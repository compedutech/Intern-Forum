Sorry for the weird title. Long story short, my plans for the summer got effed up because of personal reasons. Now I've got nothing to do for 3 months. I spent a couple of hours browsing through CDS listings, but almost none of them are nearby/I don't qualify for many of them.

I'm going to be a junior CoE with a relatively strong background in programming. I know it's pretty late, but I'm wondering if there's anything open at NJIT - research, internships, TA, etc. Unpaid is fine too; just need something to keep me busy tbh. Maybe some professor needs an extra researcher or something? I haven't received any emails lately about anything, just wondering if any of you know about any open positions or can give me tips/redirect me places.

Thanks."
380yy6,1,2015-05-31,I [23 M] am interested in starting a long distance relationship with an old friend [23 F]. Looking for advice.,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/380yy6/i_23_m_am_interested_in_starting_a_long_distance/,"**Background (High school)**    
This girl transferred to my high school junior year and we hit it off literally from day one. We hung out in the same friend group every weekend and hung out on our own as well. We texted each other almost daily for the remainder of high school. She was so interested in me, I read the signs and her friends and my friends constantly made this evident. We never officially dated because I had some self confidence issues in high school (fixed that since then), but we were as close as it can get and were pretty much viewed as taken by everyone else (as corny as that sounds).  
  
I loved hanging out with this girl talking to her. I have never met someone who I could talk to so easily. We just clicked talking about silly things to really deep, personal things.   
  
**Background (College)**  
We went to college in different states, each had our fair share of short flings and relationships with other people, but nothing serious. We kept in touch throughout the years, but not as much as we used to. The last two years of college I was living in different states and countries all the time for study abroad and internships so we started talking less and less, probably every 2-3 months. Continually throughout college, I could go say 3 months without talking to her and then all of a sudden all I could think about was trying to get into a relationship with her. We'd pick up conversation more and more from then on and eventually get to a point where there was someone else or she didn't want to commit to it (especially considering I was often living really, really far away), understandable. Anyway, no matter how many flings I had with other girls, I just could not get the idea of getting back together with her out of my head. Like I said every so often, that idea kept coming back to me.  
  
**Current Situation**  
We both graduated college and took jobs in different states, about a 1.5 hour flight away from each other. She texted me out of the blue awhile back and invited me to come visit her (since she knows I am a travel junkie and we haven't seen each other in 4 years. We snap chat each other pretty often and talk every now and then since then. Again, I am considering trying to be more than friends in a long distance relationship.  
  
**What is different now than in high school**  
I have my shit together (not to sound conceited), I didn't in high school. I have a great job, I make good money, I'm fit, I have an exciting life that I am happy with and I want her to become a part of it. Another difference is that I travelled a lot in college and she couldn't, but really wanted to. I think this really changed my outlook on a lot of things, so this may have put a bit of distance between us since we can't relate as much from past experiences.  
  
Basically now I am very interested in her and I'm not sure if she has wrote me off for good or not. I also have high standards when it comes to the girls I'm interested in dating which I think plays a part in why I am so interested in her.  
  
**Looking for advice**  

1. Is this dumb that I keep thinking about getting back together with her? She was the first girl I cared so much about, people often say that it is hard to look past this when you don't have a lot of dating experience.  
  
2. How should I handle things when I go to visit her for a weekend? I'm also going to invite her to come visit me for a weekend before I go to visit her.  
  
3. My thoughts about getting back together are based off of the idea of her, but since we haven't seen each other in a few years I'm not sure how accurate that idea really is anymore.  
  
    
**TLDR**  
My friend [23 F] and I [23 M] were really into each other in high school, drifted apart in college, now I want to start a long distance relationship. Looking or advice in the above section. Thanks!

3811ep,4,2015-05-31,Summer Internship: Programmer?,ScaryStacy,tampa,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/3811ep/summer_internship_programmer/,"Totally forgot to subscribe to the local subreddit. I am a 16 year old student in the Tampa area and I'm hoping to procure some internships this summer related to computer programming and design.

My skill set:

* Java (language I learned really well first)
* Objective C (I learned quite a bit of Objective-C 4 years ago however never really applied, started up again recently, getting to a point where I'm almost comfortable with the language) 


I've had many projects however I deleted many of them and don't have much to show for my efforts. I can tell you I've made programs related to Minecraft (client modifications, bukkit plugins), administration tools, various script tools for things like controlling computer functions, stock tickers, news tickers, RSS reader, experienced with networking, iOS applications, Cocoa mac applications, some java frameworks. Planning on learning some Spring.


So if ANY developer is looking for someone to intern them this summer, would love to have the chance. I'm not interested in pay or anything like that.

3811nq,3,2015-05-31,Me [22 M] with my roommate and ex-girlfriend [22 F] of 8 months. I need advice for handling arguments,hello258638,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3811nq/me_22_m_with_my_roommate_and_exgirlfriend_22_f_of/,"Hello /r/relationships,

I am in need of advice on how I can better handle a situation. It's really taking it's toll on me and I'm not sure what to do. I apologize if this isn't in the correct format or in the wrong subreddit, I'm new and not really sure where to ask (or even necessarily if there is any solution).

I moved in with my girlfriend in July. We had been dating 3 years and with my new internship far from home, I figured we might as well move down closer to the city. I wouldn't be able to afford all the rent, but for the first six or seven months I could afford it with the money from the internship and then she'd take over.

A little over one month in to the lease she broke up with me, telling me that she just didn't feel loved and wasn't attracted to me. Several days later she admitted to cheating on me very briefly with another guy prior to breaking up with me.

This was all very difficult for me to get past, and for the most part I think I was able to. We were friends before we got in to a relationship and I wanted things to stay that way, even if we weren't right for one another emotionally. I told her I wouldn't kick her out.

Once my internship was over, I was rejected an offer, but managed to get a job somewhere else (where I currently work). She was unable to pay the rent in it's entirety so I told her to pay 60% and I'd pay half. This worked for a couple of months.

I pressured her in to looking for a job while she was living with me but that and several other things led her to seek help and medication, as she was starting to have suicidal thoughts. I gave her a month off of nagging her to get a job and started to pay the full amount of rent again.

She had ever since been taking my car out to bars and friends houses and revealed to me a couple weeks ago that she's been sleeping with several men she's met through social media (though none in our apartment, my only condition).

Today we got in a large argument (as we have a lot recently), because she believes I don't do anything around the house (my chores are to take out the trash and scoop the cat's litter, but she meant I hadn't cleaned the house while she was out for the weekend). While I was angry she hadn't been doing the chores she promised to do, constantly forgetting them and yelling at me when I brought them up (sorry if this seems one-sided).

She says she wants to be my friend, but avoids me because we just argue to much (she's also angry I don't want to let her stay past August). 

I'm not sure what to believe. I'd like to be her friend, just like before, but she doesn't pay any rent (she says since she's never home, it's the same as if she didn't live there), she uses my car all the time (she says because I don't have friends, or a social-life, she just uses it when I don't need it; which isn't false, I really don't have a social network, work and masters program don't leave much time). But I feel so used and every time I try to bring it up, we get in to another argument. Is there any way I can get passed this way of thinking? I just want things to get better.


   
**tl;dr**: Live with ex-girlfriend. Feel used and can't talk to her. Anything I can do to stop the arguing?"
3813a1,1,2015-05-31,Isn't 30% of your income towards rent a little arbitrary? Doesn't scale matter?,Nokarot,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3813a1/isnt_30_of_your_income_towards_rent_a_little/,"I made a thread a few days ago asking about this.  People rightfully put me in my place on a few things, and I re-evaluated my budget quite a bit.  But, I'm still hung up on this 30% thing, and why people put so much faith in it when it lacks all sorts of case-by-case context.

I'm looking for my first big-kid job after a number of years working for less than minimum wage (a glorified internship, you could say).  There, I spent about 32% of my income on rent and had a surplus of ~750 per month (a cheap place to live thankfully).  With the salary of the jobs I'm looking for in a different city, all the math I'm doing suggests I could spend as much as 45% on rent and have an even larger surplus of ~1300.

Being as that I only really spend ~500 of my current surplus on myself (including food, utilities, entertainment, etc) I see it as an upgrade.  Here, I save 250 a month, which isn't much but it's something.  Living the same lifestyle (my own apartment, no roommates) with this other job, I'd theoretically be saving 800 a month.

With that said, I don't quite understand the foundation of the 30% rule, and why scale and lifestyles aren't considered.

Somebody spending 50% on rent making 50k will have a higher surplus than somebody spending 25% and making 25k.  Their taxes will be higher, so it's not nearly as significant as it  seems at first glance, but the surplus is higher nonetheless.  It's not like food is twice as expensive, or that you'll buy two new laptops nstead of one, if you make twice as much money.  Somebody who makes a million dollars a year can still live off $150 worth of food a month, if they really want to.

The only thing I see the rule being important for is for establishing your emergency fund: the higher your rent, the more money you'll need set aside, but I feel like that can have a cap and that skimping on quality living can do more harm than good.

So why, specifically, do they say 30%?  Why not 40%, or even 50%, if your lifestyle is such that the scale of your income can still support your needs and goals?  The number just seems so arbitrary to me.  Some people spend 40%+ of their income on booze, cigarettes, fast food, entertainment, transportation, and all sorts of other stuff that doesn't come in to play for my lifestyle.  So if I can bike/walk to work, cook for myself, avoid unnecessary expenses, and stay entertained with little more than an internet connection, is there anything inherently wrong with using a 45% rule instead of a 30% rule?

I understand that it's WISE to save as much money as possible, but why does the rule make it sound like it's required?"
38189e,1,2015-05-31,Hate where I'm at,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38189e/hate_where_im_at/,"I'm probably about to sound whiny and spoiled here, but I'm miserable.

In August I'll be leaving for California to start Law School, but until then I'm stuck staying with my mom in my podunk hometown located in nowhere Texas. I'd head out earlier, but since I'm staying in the school housing for law students I can't move in until around August the 11th. This also means that there is no point in getting an apartment or other housing elsewhere for less than 6 months or a year (especially considering money should be tight once law school in California starts kicking in). Long story short, I'm stuck here for a bit (and have been already for a little while).

I hate staying with my mom, I love her, but she's hard to stay with. I'm afforded almost no independence here, regular texts and calls asking where I'm at, coming into the room I'm staying in every ten minutes asking about me, etc etc. I know it's because she cares, but I'm feeling seriously suffocated here. There is only so much family time I can take before I start to go mad. I've talked to her about this, but she either doesn't listen or gets offended and I end up feeling like an ass for bringing it up. The fact that I'm solitary by nature does not help the situation. 

There is also my mom's boyfriend.

I really can't stand my mom's boyfriend. He lives with her right now and is literally ALWAYS at the house. He's just as bad as she is about not allowing me ten seconds to myself. Only he constantly talks about things I really couldn't care less about. He rambles on for ages whenever he talks to. I have never had a conversation with this man that I did not have to end because it didn't make me late for something else. I use the word conversation liberally here, because in reality it's more him talking about how he has to deal with difficult renters, fishing, or getting a bargain on a knife for 45 minutes while you nod, try to change the subject, then fail at doing so. Like oil and water me and this guy, I stay quiet enough about it because my mom seems to like him and to keep peace, but oil and water me and this guy.

The town I'm stuck in I'm not find of either. When I graduated high school everyone I knew left town. That was four years ago. No one came back. So I don't know anyone in town anymore, and from the culture of the place, I don't much want to. I've tried going out or getting involved in things, but the nightlife and recreation options are incredibly limited. I've always said there's something in the air here, it makes people unhappy, you get stuck in place, nothing's gained and nothing's lost, it's purgatory with pop-country music stations and overweight evangelicals. I know I'm only here for a little while, but all my anxiety, the drugs, all the unhappiness I thought of escaped from in high-school, all the ugliness and everything has just been right here waiting for me. It makes me feel like I didn't actually grow at all during the four years I spent at undergrad. I didn't feel that way until I came back home, now I'm feeling like I'm just getting sucked back down.

Compounded with all that are some real feelings of regret. I minored in Japanese language and also took a number of courses in Mandarin. I have however over the last year and a half let it completely lapse. I feel like I've forgotten so much of it. I spent a year studying abroad in Japan, completing my minor, and becoming pretty proficient, but after I came back I had almost no time to study Japanese. My classes during my last last year were incredibly difficult and between them and studying for the LSAT (practically a full time job on its own) I had no time to keep it in shape. Then came my internship in D.C. that was just as busy. I still would have done things the way I did, but it really eats away at me that I feel like I've forgotten so much Japanese and Chinese. These feelings are made worse by everything else. I used to be really into music and even played in a local band, but I let that lapse as well when things got busy for the year and a half when school, work, the LSAT, and internships just ate all my time away. Now I'm trying to re-learn these things, but it's so discouraging how much I've forgotten, and these depressed feelings kill my motivation.

I just feel completely stuck in a mire. I'm usually really type A, stable, driven, and a really pretty happy guy, but right now I just feel empty, if I'm filled with anything at the moment it's just venom. Thanks for reading, I just needed to whine some I guess. I'm not sure what to do to kick myself out of it,  I can usually pull myself up by my bootstraps, grin, bear it, and come out better and on top. I've made things happen in the past and I know this mopping around isn't going to help. I just can't seem to shake the bad feelings this time. Not having internet at all outside of my old phone is really causing some serious net withdrawals as well, especially when it's important for me to stay in contact with my law school leading up to my move in.

I'm in a bind. First day on the internship, I've forgotten my outlet converter at home (I'm from abroad, from the US). The folks at work have given me another laptop to use just in case, but I'm currently wondering if I can just use the power brick from the other laptop (because it has the right outlet head) to charge my laptop anyway. 

The ratings on the two bricks are:

**Mine:**

Input 100-240V ~ 2.2A 50-60 Hz 
Output 19.5V --&gt; 6.15A

**Theirs:**

Input 100-240V 50~60Hz 1.2A
Output 19V --&gt;3.42A

From my very basic understanding of electronics, I could technically use the one they gave me because the dongle from brick to laptop is the exact same, and I can just swap wires, but *the charge will just be a lot slower* than what my brick can manage.

Long time lurker here, looking for help!",startsomewhere42,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/381kil/hi_personal_finance_long_time_lurker_here_looking/,"Hey personal finance, like the title says I've been lurking here for awhile and I want to actively start taking control of my financial life.

I'm a 22 year old college student finishing up university this fall &amp; I'd like to be free of all my debt (aside from student loans) before I leave school. Money isn't something I really talk about with my parents but i'm currently still living at home so cost of living isn't really a factor.

Current I'm working a pretty good internship that is guaranteed for at least the end of summer but I'm hoping to extend into the semester so that I can pay off all of my debt! 

So the numbers!

Total Debt:  (9,515.17)

Spread across 3 sources, 2 credit cards and 1 car loan.

Credit Card 1 - (1,081.53) w/ APR - 17.99%

Credit Card 2 - (2,091.02) w/ APR - 22.99%

Car Loan - (6,342.62) w/ Interest Rate - 11.49%

At my internship I make $22.50 an hour which nets me $706.12 a week after taxes. I also have started to drive Uber when I can to make additional income! I estimate i may be able to bring in at least an extra $100 - $200 a month doing this.

What I'm hoping you all can help me do is come up with the best strategy for paying this off. After joining the sub i'd spent a few months and actually paid off my first credit card but unfortunately fell back in the hole because of irresponsibility. 

Looking for any help/advice I can get. Thank you guys in advanced!"

Biology with minor in Chemistry 2 years ago.  My career since then has been working admin in a family practice.  I have not used my degree at all. To my great regret, I did no extracurriculars or internships.

I have been offered an interview for a position at a local hospital for Research Assistant in the Clinical Pharmacology Department in the Kansas City area.  I am looking for advice in how I interview for this position, as well as knowledge about these types of positions.  

The position is described as:

&gt; ""Responsibilities will include performing standard laboratory techniques in the area of basic molecular biology, protein biochemistry and/or cell biology, such as DNA isolation and sequencing, RNA isolation, quantitative PCR, culture and passage of cell lines, protein electrophoresis, immunoblotting with colorimetric and chemiluminescence detection, and in vitro drug biotransformation and bioactivation methods. 
&gt; 
&gt; Job Requirements:
&gt; 
&gt; Associate's Degree -OR-
&gt; Bachelor's Degree -OR-
&gt; Documented prior education or training in laboratory techniques and methods requisite to conducting research.""


It has been two years since I have graduated, and am very nervous about the quality of my knowledge and skills.  Several of the skills are ones I have only read about and never done in practice.  I have only done PCR, DNA and RNA isolation and sequencing, and culture of cell lines a few times.  Those were in labs where I was given step by step instructions, and I don't know much beyond that.  I understand and remember the concepts behind some of them, but don't know much about the practice. 

What type of on the job training usually comes with these techniques? Do they expect me to be proficient? How much should I know when I go in for an interview? I would love resources if you have them.  Any advice to help in the interview would be great!

I also wonder what type of pay I should accept.  A quick google search shows an average pay of around $17-18 an hour in my area for Clinical Research Assistant.  But I don't know how accurate salary sites are.  I have no real leverage for negotiation, and my current wage is $12.39/hour.  

I want my position to pay me enough to begin supporting myself while I make car and student loan payments.  I want this position's wage to give me leverage when I move on in my career.  If you have any advice on wages in my area, or wage negotiation in this setting, it would be appreciated."
381ofv,8,2015-06-01,Weird internship situation,Princenomad,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/381ofv/weird_internship_situation/,"Okay, so I'm really just looking for some comments about this whole situation. 

So, starting about six months ago (December), I started talking to boutique agency in San Diego. Dialogue seemed good, and in January we had a very casual introductory interview. It went great. We had a good time talking, discussing the company, and what their objective was for interns in the summer.

Throughout the year, we kept in communication while I was in school. He asked me to keep him updated with what I was doing, so I sent the occasional email about the kind of stuff I'd been working on. When it came time to apply, he sent me the application two days before it was released on their site, which seemed like an awesome position to be in. After the application was sent, I got a form email stating that I had made it past the first round of applications and had to produce a video to show my ability to tell a story. 

Background: I got this on the 15th of May, saying the video was due the 25th for an internship that started on the 1st of June. 

Anyways, once I sent my video in, I got an email back saying that he thought it was awesome and that they would let me know their final decision on the 28th. I was stoked. They guy I've been talking to for 6 months said my video was great? That has to be a good sign, right? 

So the 28th (a Thursday) comes and goes with no response. On the 29th, I send him an email asking if I'd missed anything or hadn't received an email, to which he hasn't responded yet. Monday (June 1st) is supposed to be the first day of the internship, even though we had discussed that I wouldn't be able to start until the 15th because of when my university gets out. 

Is it just me being naive, or is it weird that I didn't get any feedback from this guy if I got the job? Should I continue to see what the situation is, or just ""accept"" my no response as the answer? It's been a huge bummer to see such an awesome potential job just fizzle out so abruptly. 

Either way, I'm looking for any response on the matter. Is ""no response"" a common response for people who didn't get a position? Does this response seem weird, or is this just how it is? Any response would be awesome. "

It is also 4am as I write this because I am losing sleep over many things in my life right now.

So I guess I'll start at the beginning because that is a great place to start. So over the past fourteen years I have been going to the same summer camp, nine years as a camper and five years as a counselor. This is where my family is and by family I mean my friends who have become my family over time. I love this place more then anything else in the world. It has been my home and a place where I find comfort through anything, especially when I have a crohn's flare. Well last summer I met a girl on the kitchen staff who was from Mexico. She worked on the kitchen staff as part of her culinary schooling, sort of like a paid internship. Well we met at camp on one of our nights out at the bar and we both liked each other immediately. Me not being someone who has confidence especially talking to someone as beautiful as her had trouble introducing myself. So I went to the bar had a shot of tequila spoke to her friend for a split second to ask if she was with someone, she said no and I somehow got myself to walk over to her and say hi. This was something I just normally don't do I'm not the kind of guy who can just talk to any girl at anytime. Well we hit it off, both being a little shy and a bit drunk but we enjoyed each others company and talked, danced, and kissed. It turned out to be an amazing night and at the end of it I walked her back to her bunk kissed her goodnight and went back to my bunk.

Over the summer we started to talk to each other every day and I loved every moment of it and so did she. We walked around camp together when we both had time off we relaxed together and just smiled at each other for the rest of the summer. Over the fourteen years I had gone to camp this was the best summer ever. We grew closer and closer kissed had sex relaxed smiled cuddled and just loved each other. Neither of us had to speak just being close to each other was enough. Then the summer ended and she had to stay at camp for an extra week but when she came to New York I promised I'd see her again and we'd go out on a date.

So she came down to New York and we had the best day possible. I met her in Penn Station and from there we walked around the city saw a bunch of places got a bite to eat and then made our way to central park. We went to the central park zoo which was amazing and then saw street performers and just walked around the city holding hands. It started to rain and we ran under an overhang and as tv scripted as it could get we laughed then kissed and just stayed close to each other to stay warm until the rain passed. The day ended and she had to go but we would keep in touch because we loved each other.

So she went back to Mexico and I stayed in New York planning on seeing each other again this summer and we spoke everyday. Sending each other gifts for our birthdays and valentines day. We skype'd almost every weekend as much as we could and sent each other pictures and just kept our love alive. We planned our entire summer everything we would do. Counting down the days until we would be together again holding hands just Queen K and King B. Then in March I thought I would be back at camp but I got fired for expressing my emotions on getting demoted on Facebook. Of course I had to tell her, our summer, our dreams of being together again had just been turned upside down. So I told her and it was the day I believe we started to become distant. A couple weeks later I fucked up and missed a skype date because I was with my friends even though we had made a date for each other. I shouldn't have done that and I am still sorry now and I've told her that again and again. She had blown me off a couple times in a row and maybe I did it out of spite I don't know. All I know is I regretted it a lot and we haven't skyped to each other in months.

About two weeks ago she asks me if I am happy with us and I said of course I am happy but I also know that we would be happier if we are together which will be a problem this summer because I won't be at camp and she will. I will try to visit as much as I can around my summer job to make it work because I want to try my hardest to keep us together and our love together. She says to me that she thinks she can't handle us anymore and that work and school and keeping our relationship going is just too much for her. I could tell that it was hard for her and I understand and I saw that because she would message me less and less each day and not care what I had to say anymore. No more pictures no more skype barely anymore talking. We came to the conclusion we would see where it would go this summer and try to figure it out but she seems tapped out and she loves me she just can't do this anymore but at the same time she wants to. 

That same day I had sent her a gift with a card apologizing for my fuck ups telling her how much I love her and it had a dual time zone watch in it and some other things for when she came to New York. She finally got it and told me she loved it and loved me and I thought maybe we were going back to what we had. She posted her wrist with the watch on and said that she got it from NY. Not me not her boyfriend just NY and maybe I'm looking too much into that but that hurt and I haven't told her because I don't want to add drama especially now because shes going through finals and figuring her life out. Now I wait until she gets here to figure everything out while she is here but I don't know how to talk to her before she gets here. She barely answers me and yes I know shes busy but she doesn't even message me back sometimes. No more ""good night I love you"" texts back and forth every night just quiet distance. 

So I guess what I am asking is what should I do to get us closer again back to where we were. How do I use this summer to get us there and how can I talk to her before she gets here to start the ball rolling? Any help would be amazing, I love this girl and I just don't want this to end. We were both happy and I know we can be again.  

 


   
**tl;dr**: Long distance relationship that started in a summer camp and now we are back at our homes is becoming tough and we are becoming very distant. How do I make us get closer again before she comes back this summer and what can I do this summer to rekindle our love for each other?"

No one wants a beginner. Everyone wants someone who already has 5 years of experience. If not they want an intern who is still in school so they don't have to pay them.

At this point I would even take minimum wage. I just want to work and feel like I'm contributing to something.

Are there any other things that I should know about Denmark and studying there?

384nal,1,2015-06-01,A crush (limerence?) on a girl gave me motivation to practice NoFap - rejection making me fall back to my old patterns?,user91919191,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/384nal/a_crush_limerence_on_a_girl_gave_me_motivation_to/,"Hello, a long-time lurker here. I'm male, 24 years old. I first discovered masturbation some 9-10 years ago, and it fairly soon escalated to using pornography. On average, I have probably fapped about once or twice a day.  

&amp;nbsp;

I've never had a girlfriend or sex. Between pre-school and the recent events I'm about to describe, I've never even had any female friends my own age. So you can imagine what happened to my attitude towards women when the misogyny of porn and my lack of interaction with women combined. In an intellectual sense I have always thought I appreciate and value women, but I'm not so sure anymore when I look back on it now.  

&amp;nbsp;

I noticed over time that my porn tastes started to become more and more extreme, to an extent that really started to worry me. I began to search information about the harms of PMO and found the NoFap subreddit maybe 2 years ago, leading to aborted series of reboot attempts during the fall of 2013. My maximum time was six days, as I recall. However, I always lost my motivation, mainly due to a sense of having nothing to live for. I continued watching porn, and my self-hatred increased along with the depravedness of my fantasies.  

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, as part of my studies, I worked for ten weeks as an intern at a certain place, where I met this 20-year old girl. As part of my work, I collaborated with her a lot, and after a little over a week I developed feelings for her. I have no idea why, because we really have nothing in common. I literally had trouble eating and sleeping, and when I went home after work, I would be hopelessly moved to tears, unable to enjoy anything that would ordinarily give me joy. Whenever it seemed like she was responding to me, I'd be indescribably happy. Whenever it seemed like she was ignoring me, I'd feel crushed internally. I literally felt like a different person when I was interacting with her. Everything else in my life was suddenly far less interesting. I knew I had to have her.  

&amp;nbsp;

What I found strange was the precise manner by which the sexual aspect of my attraction towards her worked. I didn't find myself thinking in any way about the explicit details of a potential sexual encounter, but rather I found incredible joy in the more abstract idea of ”merging” with her. This worked as a serious wake-up call to the objectifying way PMO made me look at women. I felt like she had been sent my way by God or other spiritual forces to teach me something about myself. I knew I had to quit PMO to be worthy of her. I couldn't withstand the moral contradiction of having feelings for a woman and at the same time jerking off to degrading shit, and I realised also that PMO would be cheating if a relationship with her were to occur. 

&amp;nbsp;

Speaking of God, I feel I've had trouble feeling connected to him. On an intellectual level I firmly believe God's love is unconditional and that he holds no ill feelings toward me for my mistakes, but that doesn't change the fact that society has for a long time promoted the image of an angry judgemental being in the sky. I haven't been entirely successful in setting aside this image, even though I realise the fallacy of it. I suppose that by developing such strong feelings for this girl, I felt I caught a small glimpse of the kind of love God really has for me. When I went home one day, I opened my mouth, and with a booming voice I've never spoken with either before or after, I swore to God I would never ever again look at porn or masturbate. I felt myself filled with a spine-tingling sense of transcendant joy that seemed wash away all my troubles, and I cried tears of joy. I shall not try to describe the experience in any further detail, as no words could give justice to the way I felt.

&amp;nbsp;

So I constantly pursued the girl during the next two weeks (during which I firmly kept my promise not to PMO) whenever we were on breaks or out on lunch, and I may have ended up acting slightly stalkerish. She eventually confronted me about my obsessive behaviour, and I told her about my feelings. She told me she didn't feel the same way. The rejection left me devastated, but she acted very supportively and even forgave my odd behaviour towards her. We remained friends. I even told her about my struggle with PMO and how she was the one who had inspired me to change. 

&amp;nbsp;

After the rejection, I felt I no longer had any goal to work towards. The truth is that I have no dreams or ambitions beyond maybe spiritual enlightenment, which in any case is a long-term abstract goal, rather than something practical I can set myself goals about. The temptation to PMO reared it's ugly head, and after having abstained for 23 days (I had noticed many of the benefits other people report here, by the way), I went on a PMO binge. I would occasionally make greater effort to continue, but I wasn't able to recapture that long streak. My maximum new record was measly 4 days. The guilt for PMOing was greater than at any time before, because I had now experienced something at least a little more substantial towards a woman. I was depressed, only coming alive whenever I saw the girl. Even though I hadn't been able to make her into my girlfriend, she continued to have an uplifting effect on me. Occasionally, feeling like I literally had nothing to lose, I restarted my efforts to pursue her, but it didn't lead to anything.

&amp;nbsp;

Last week, my internee period ended, and this girl and I said our goodbyes and parted ways amicably. I'm not likely to ever see her again, which is probably for the best, as continuing to be in contact with her might only create false hope in me. Anyway, here I am. Depressed, heartbroken, without any sense of goal or purpose, still failing at capturing let alone exceeding that 3-week streak. She isn't around anymore, nor therefore is her uplifting, inspiring effect on me. I'm not even able to cry over her, because I'm too in shock to do so. I feel like giving up.

&amp;nbsp;

I have no interest in anything I once held dear, partly because it's hard to enjoy anything in this state, and partly because I've literally started to lose interest in anything in the material world. What do I mean by the latter? To put it simply, she inspired me to change and improve myself, and I know that I must ultimately do so by concentrating on my spiritual growth, eventually attaining a higher state of consciousness. Anything else feels diminutive by comparison. The main problem is, my family members are distrustful of all spirituality, and they try to attack my beliefs when they are brought up. I can't move away, partly due to practical reasons, partly because I would then be totally, utterly alone.

&amp;nbsp;

No debate on the validity of spiritual beliefs, please. I doubt you'd be able to convince me otherwise, which I'm sure also applies the other way around. On the other hand, observations about the nature of my feelings towards this girl would be welcome. Also, I hope this post doesn't go too off-topic at any point."

3859so,8,2015-06-01,How do I tell my NFather I don't want him to visit while I'm at my internship? Long/Advice?,Togetchi,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3859so/how_do_i_tell_my_nfather_i_dont_want_him_to_visit/,"I found this sub a few months ago and reading through the other stories has made me feel like I'm not alone! I still have daily doubts and wonder if I'm crazy or overreacting, but a recent turn of events has given me a resolve to stand up and walk out. (More on that later, see dog bite.)

The good news first: 

I have an awesome internship lined up in my field for the summer! It took a combination of luck (finding about it) and careful rule-following/impressing people who knew every intern would have to pass a government security clearance complete with background check. 

After all the paperwork and schoolyear stresses mingled together the summer is finally arriving, and with it the internship! I have a place lined up through a housing co-op with the company, and my future-landlady seems like a really nice and outgoing woman. The area is gorgeous and near the sea, and everyone I've met/everything I've seen about the company is positive: They employ for life, are constantly growing, looking for people to train for the future, have a steady work-supply, believe in constant improvement, etc. 

I already have a job but my NFather said ""You know [my current workplace] isn't going to be around forever. You should look into other opportunities."" which is what prompted me to apply for internships at my university's career fair last Fall. I only got a response back from this one(everyone else was mostly hiring graduates), and put all my effort into getting in. I got past the first two interviews with the new company and filled out the various reams of paperwork to get security clearance, a badge, and transfer my medical history. They sent surveys to various people I named as references asking if I would be a threat to national security(!), and what my work ethic was like. There were several months of silence while my application was passed between various departments who all had to say yes. 

Finally, around April I was given a green light from the company! They said I'd gotten the internship, and everything looked shipshape. Just wait until I get an email telling me what to do in summer. 

I told my family that I had gotten the internship and my NFather said""You already have a job! What do you need an internship for?""

I tried to copycat what he said initially, ""They won't be around forever, and this opportunity is in my field and employing for life."" 

He rolled his eyes, complained that ""I probably didn't even give my current employer enough of a warning for me to leave without disruption during the summer,"" and the conversation was over. 

My NFather has not once complimented me on getting this internship, or given any indication that he cares about it or the company. Apparently he brags about it at work, as everyone else already knows about it in some form, and has commented that ""He worries for you"". When I first applied I told my supervisor, HR, and the CEO (who is hands-on and deals with arrivals/departures of employees) about potentially being gone for the summer and not coming in to work full-time as usual. Everyone I've talked to is very excited, and has encouraged me to take advantage of the opportunity. 

My NFather has been asking with increasing frequency where I am going to live, and to give him the address so that he and my EStepMother can visit during the summer. I really don't want them to visit, I would like to enjoy my hard-won freedom and focus on working hard for the new company for the duration of my stay. 

The other problem is that I'm using the summer as a jumping board for moving out when I come back in the Fall. I had my catalyst moment when [the family dog bit me](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/36kxto/naw_sharp_teeth/) and no one acknowledged that I was hurt, but I was told ""he has sharp teeth"" and to stop overreacting. It was very strongly hinted at that being bitten was my fault. Now, two weeks later I have scars on my thumb from the bite that was truly deep and which cannot be gaslit as 'me overreacting'. Every time I wonder if I'm crazy I look at my thumb and remember that no one asked if I was okay in seriousness, and that every attempt to bring it back up was met with scorn and fake apologies (""I'm *sorry* he 'bit' you""). I don't think a ""normal"" parent would treat their child like that. 

I told a close friend what happened and she admitted that she never really liked my father. Her moment came after I threw my yearly tea party that took two weeks to organize and when he was done eating he told me (in front of my grandma, his mother) to ""have that shit cleaned up before we get home in 3 hours"". All my grandma had to say was that ""it's his house"". My close friend and another friend helped me clean and repack all the china I'd pulled from storage. In return I hugged them both as much as possible and gave them as many leftover finger-sandwiches, petite fours, and scones as they could haul off! 

I also told my supervisor about the situation after I couldn't hide it anymore and broke down crying for the second time in a week at work after the dog incident. He apologized and said that he knew it was bad, but not like this. Both he and my close friend are encouraging me to move out as soon as possible, and I've started asking around about openings for the fall. 

**TL;DR:** I have gotten a summer internship and don't want my family visiting me. I want to focus on my work, and then move out in the Fall. How do I tell my family that I don't want them to visit, and/or avoid giving them the address? I don't want to cause a scene or worry that my things will be gone when I return.

Also: life advice? Are there any secrets to moving out, and tips for doing it without a scene? "
385by2,69,2015-06-01,I [20F] spent nearly 4 hours cleaning my bf's [25M] parent's house. Get accused of stealing.,beyondfrustratedUGH,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/385by2/i_20f_spent_nearly_4_hours_cleaning_my_bfs_25m/,"Hey reddit, so I apologize if this is more rant-ey than it should be. I just need to know I'm not the crazy one in this situation.

So, as per the title, my boyfriend of 1.5 year's parents were on vacation for 3 weeks. Before they left I assured them I would do the weekly upkeep of their house chores (watering their many plants, washing dishes, etc.). I'm over there almost every weekend and I of course wholeheartedly was on board with helping out. 

Flash forward: His parents were due back late Saturday night. Bf really wanted me to clean the place to get ready for their arrival (he would much rather pay me $40 to clean the whole house than do it himself). Obviously I agreed, I would have done it without the cash. I suspect he moreso offered because I'm a student and always strapped for cash, while he has a full time job (still lives at home while saving up to purchase a condo). Thursday night I was assisting at an event until 2am, but nevertheless I was at his place by 11:30 Friday morning because I promised I would clean. 3pm rolls around, I finish up and take some pictures of my hard work and BF comes home. He agrees the place looks clean - I even vacuumed and wiped down places we hadn't touched or gone in the whole 3 weeks. 

Flash Forward again to the present: I get home from a long day at my internship, and I get a text from BF. His mom is ""very upset"". Apparently I ""used her $140 cream without asking, used and didn't clean her hairbushes, and the bathroom/bathroom mirror/toilet were dirty, you didn't clean properly"". 

Now reddit, if I could, I would post the pics here but I don't think links are allowed. That place was fucking spotless. I would even go so far as to say that bathroom was CLEANER than when they left (they leave a lot of clutter around and I just put it all to the side, careful not to disturb anything important). You don't spend 3 and a half hours cleaning and NOT have a sparkling bathroom. I even did their laundry and vacuumed every room!

I will say that yes, I did use her hairbrush once. I am often at their house, as mentioned, and it's over an hour's commute to get there via walking/subway/bus, so I've learned to pack light. I have curly hair and don't usually use a brush but I did use hers the previous weekend. This I admit, and this I am sorry for. 

I never touched her cream. I was shocked that she had accused me of it... not ONLY does she use solely anti-aging creams, and not ONLY would she never be able to tell even if I had used it (unless I'd used an exorbitant amount??) but I was raised very conservatively-Christian. I have never and will never steal anything. Simply using her hairbrush made me feel guilty. They've known me for over a year and a half and apparently they don't trust me. 

But here's the icing on the cake, reddit, and this just pushed me over the edge. My BF was relaying his mother's anger and upset-ness (making that a word, shut up spell check) throughout this whole process. All of a sudden I get a text that reads ""And now I've apparently broken the sacred family trust by telling you about the cream. (his parents say that) I should have followed you around to see if you've been using my parent's things"". So not only am I terrible at cleaning to the point of making his mother upset, but they wouldn't have told me any of this. They wanted my BF to FOLLOW and watch my EVERY MOVE to see if I was secretly a conniving stealing bitch who had no respect for them.

I feel like I am no longer welcome in their house, even though all I tried to do in this situation was help. I spent over a year and a half building a relationship with them and making sure they knew how thankful I was for their hospitality. I gave his mother cards on mother's day, her birthday, and christmas. I called her my second mother because (I thought) she genuinely liked and cared for me. 

Sidenote: I've known his mother was obsessive about cleaning and we've had minor issues in the past about her believing the shower was filthy, or her yelling because she found 1 (no exaggeration) of my hairs on her floors. And yet there are piles of dirty laundry everywhere, I've never seen their sink not full of dishes (washed but never put away), things like this. And they freak out about me not cleaning well enough?

How do I deal with this, reddit? My BF and I spend most of the weekend gaming on his PC and his laptop, we aren't often at my place for lack of air conditioning, comfortable seating, and I only have a macbook which is terrible for gaming. I don't know if I can go back to his house, but I'm afraid that because he's stuck there for at least another year I won't get to see him like I have been, regardless of how I wanted to have a good relationship with his parents. We're in it for the long run...but apparently not all of us. Family is so, so important to me and this just hurts a lot. Maybe they never trusted me or wanted me to be a part of theirs. Sorry for rambling, it's just been a long afternoon. Maybe if anyone could share stories about how they coped with their SO's parents it would make me feel less crappy.





 tl;dr: How do I deal with BF's parents when they freaked out after I voluntarily scrubbed their house for hours and accuse me of stealing? Can I ever go back there? Please tell me I'm not the crazy one here?

**EDIT** Well, things aren't going too well. I'm still very upset about this whole thing, and BF has gone from saying he believes me to defending his parent's actions. He says it was reasonable for them to think I'd stolen from them after seeing a few of my hairs on his mom's brush. I'm sorry, but that is just not a good enough reason. He's ignoring it when I say that maybe it's an underlying issue, and instead saying that they haven't insulted my character etc. I'm afraid of where this is leading to. I can't and I won't just agree with him and accept what they've said about me and what they wanted to do, but what's my alternative? "
385dnd,0,2015-06-01,How to fast-track into entry level AI project/work?,BinaryAlgorithm,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/385dnd/how_to_fasttrack_into_entry_level_ai_projectwork/,"I've been wondering how to respec certifications to work in AI or related field (possibly also robotics). In a world where employers only seem to look at credentials, I'm unsure what they are looking *for* exactly. I programmed in VB6 for about 15 years (since I was 12), and did some C# and other languages and even assembly, but what I really need is a training experience. I have an MBA instead of a CS degree but I don't have time right now to go re-do my degree (don't feel it's particularly useful at this point compared to real life experiences); I'd rather take a few pertinent training classes or work an internship because that's practical and efficient. I can't seem to find any community here in Reno NV for AI (maybe I need to look nationally and coordinate online, but where/how? I'm not that good at finding it apparently); I have guessed that socialization is the key to finding some opportunity. Right now I just design A-Life simulations at home, but I would like to learn more working on a real AI project. I have a specific interest in intelligent agents / digital organisms and general AI development, but I see most of the work is on narrow AI for vision and other specific problem domains.

I am completely lost at how to find a mentor for this. I originally learned to program because I wanted to make games, so my approach is half art and half science (and I think some creativity and philosophy is necessary in these fields - to think out of the box and design new patterns). Outside a university, I haven't seen where I can get into this. I don't think it's an intractable problem; after all, I can read and learn what I don't know. It's just unlocking an opportunity to learn that is challenging. Does anyone have ideas on where I can go, who I can talk to? What communities have projects I can learn from/participate in? There must be some action I can take to advance, to get help with it (even if just theory discussions)?

I believe AI is what will fundamentally change mankind, and thus is among the most important focus points along with supporting technologies like quantum computers. I am also interested in computer ethics, a very small but important field. I believe I will have ideas to contribute when I encounter new information; I just want the chance to do so.

Thank you for any input regarding this. I feel very lost right now when people keep telling me what I can't do based only on credentials when I know that I can do it with a passion; I can learn, after all ..."

Im a 24 year old guy with a 20 year old girlfriend. We are both Indian from pretty traditional families (for cultural context). We started dating at the beginning of 2015. We met and went out for about two weeks and then I returned to finish my last semester of college on the other side of the country. I came back in February for about 10 days, and then back in May where we spent about 2.5 weeks together after which she went to India for two weeks and came back today to start her internship in NYC.

I recently got a job offer in Boston working for a really cool biotech startup which in many ways is a dream job for me. Its important to realize that in the 5 months that we've been together, we've spent maybe 1.5 months physically together. The majority has been long distance.

Her brother tragically passed away early April which is why she went to India for two weeks to do his funeral rights. The day before she came back is when I found out about the offer.

Today at dinner, I told her about my job offer and I told her that I didn't want to continue a long distance relationship after I moved to a new city. Holy shit did that not go over well. She has always been there for me, supporting me whenever I needed her and I never really reciprocated as much as she did. She is an amazing, kind, and caring person, I would never in a million years dream of hurting her.
I found out about her summer NYC internship earlier, but didn't end things because I knew that she would be coming back to our hometown to finish college after. After getting this job offer, I know that I won't be coming back to our hometown. Im going to be in a new city with a new job and I want to be open to new opportunities out there. Im only 24, and she's only 20. I don't want to tie myself to a long distance relationship and I want to see what else is out there as I start my career in a new city.

Does that make me scumbag? Am I wrong for feeling that way?
Anyway, she got really hurt. She also spent $400 on a nice watch as a surprise gift that made me feel even more worthless. Im just in so much pain right now. A part of me knows that I don't want a long distance relationship and another part of my feels like shit for hurting an amazing and selfless girl whose done so much for me. I feel like im being torn apart inside and I don't know how to cope.

tl;dr: 5 month relationship mostly long distance. Got a job opportunity in a new city and don't want to do long distance anymore. Told gf this and now feel like the worlds biggest scumbag.

385k52,0,2015-06-01,Me [21 M] with my very close friend [19 F] and our screwed up relationship,aubrey___plaza,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/385k52/me_21_m_with_my_very_close_friend_19_f_and_our/,"So basically there's five parties at play here. There's me, the girl [S], her brother [R], my room-mate/her boyfriend [B], and her family. S and B started dating 6-7 months ago after myself, B, and R all moved into an apartment together. This happened once S started up university at the same school as us and had known B from a visit a few years back and they had texted a lot up until this point. 

This caused a shit-storm of drama, because B is quite the asshole, and R didn't like that he had to be around their shitty relationship all the time. B and S tried to sneak around for the first few months behind R's back and eventually they got tired of doing that and told them that they were dating. B has always been a bit of an asshole to S and it's caused a lot of issues in the apartment.

Myself and S have been really good friends ever since she started school here, we always joke around and share a lot with each other. A bit over a month ago B and S approached me to see if I'd be interested in having a three-way with them, and I said yes, having even thought of it myself (I'm also really close to B).

B and S have also had issues due to S's family not liking how liberal he is, he's openly bisexual and way more on the flamboyant side. He comes off very strong, and can be difficult to deal with. S's family absolutely hates him, and since R has had issues with him it has made a rift in their family (both R and S are kicked out of the house for the summer, so they signed a lease to stay for a few extra months).

B and S's relationship is coming to a close, I've heard from both sides that they don't think it will last. But S is going to sub-lease B's room in the apartment and she's waiting to end things until it's finalized and he moves everything out. For now he's staying at his parents house to work an internship during the week and will visit for a few hours over the weekend.

Ever since I started hooking up with B and S, things between me and S have gotten somewhat serious. We're closer than we've ever been, we cuddle every night and spend a lot of time during the day together. I started developing feelings for her a few weeks ago when she moved into B's room full time, and things kind of came to a climax between us last Wednesday when S came clean saying she had started feeling for me and had never felt this way about anyone else.

We talked and I shared some of the same feelings and concerns that she had. Neither of us know what to do, we feel trapped with no way out. 

We both kind of want to take the risk and see how things work out. Myself and R are a lot closer than B and R were at the beginning of the year and I feel like R wouldn't make that big of a deal out of me dating his sister since I don't sleep around as much as B does and B made no effort whatsoever to keep his relationship with R in-tact. B would also probably stop talking to me, but I have a feeling he's going to slowly back out of our friend group anyways. I'm the only one he's still close to left in it, and he's living at his parents and commuting next school year anyways. On top of that he'll have even less of a reason to visit considering S will be around a lot, and me and here hang out on the weekends anyways.

The other option is for us to hide our feelings and continue on as really close friends. We wouldn't ruin anything and would still cuddle and share ourselves when we want. But I'm not sure if I would forgive myself for missing the opportunity for being with her. I think she's the most amazing woman, and I know we're already compatible sexually and emotionally. But who knows how things will work out. I'm really lost, sorry for how long this post is, I needed a place to vent.

I've been having thoughts of suicide since a few days ago but I feel guilty about it whenever I look at my mother. She's had to work two jobs just to pay for my tuition so I feel so selfish whenever I think about how much I want to end my own life.

I want to see help, but I don't have the means to get a therapist. I can't even tell my own mother that I've been feeling this way because she'll tell me I'm just a weak person and that'll hurt me much more.

My body and my mind is in pain and I don't know what to do.

She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by 
myself and even through all the struggles she has caused me, I still want to take care of her, just albeit on on my terms.


Background: Twenty years ago, my mom and I immigrated from a Hispanic country to the Bay Area after my Dad left us, took off in the middle of the night and emptied all the bank accounts. Promised with help, her sisters all but abandoned her two weeks after the move leaving us with nothing. My mother worked 80 hour weeks just to provide for us, as I was just in grade school at the time. I learned English on my own as well as helped my mom learn English on the side as well. Eventually I got into college, graduated and also graduated with a Masters degree. My mother has worked at her own salon since moving here, and her English has improved to the point where she can communicate effectively, but still cannot pass an English proficiency exam to get into college to further her education. 

Lately, things in the salon have turned bad, as she has an extreme mistrust of outsiders,due to being taken advantage of by her sisters and ex-husband, so she never hired any additional help. The salon is only open when she is there, and granted she does work 80 hour weeks, even to this day as she is entering her 60s. This has caused the salon to be stagnant and never reach its proper growth potential, as it keeps sporadic hours, because nobody can possibly work 120 hour weeks, so sometimes she has to close for errands or ESL classes, etc. It’s also not in a good area, with not a lot of foot traffic. Bottom line is, she makes only enough to stay open and does not make any profit whatsoever. It has been this way for awhile. This has led me to running the household, so to speak since I was 16 years old. I worked summer jobs during high school and worked after school when I had college, including full time during grad school. I could never take an opportunity to take a potentially lucrative internship as I could never not have any income coming in, as I was paying rent, groceries etc. This has led me to starting my career a bit later than my contemporaries. I will be 29 soon, and I have finally found my dream job. Granted, its entry level, but has amazing growth potential and I have the most amazing supervisors ever, but despite that, and in combination with living in the Bay Area, it does not pay a wage where I can buy a house, just yet.

Enter my boyfriend. We met over a year ago and hit it off immediately. His background is similar to mine, albeit a little different. He was born here, but still received no parental support and his parents would rather get high than raise a child. He was pretty much on his own since he was 14, although they contribute enough to keep a roof over his head. He took the first opportunity he could and moved out when he was 21 with his then girlfriend, which turned into his ex-wife soon after. Along the way, they had a child. Since then he has been saddled with child support, and also working a job where he is significantly underpaid compared to his peers (seems like you need to work in tech to get anywhere in the Bay Area, which neither of us do). The child support and his ex have ruined his credit to the point where it has caused him to lose a few years on his life by moving back into his parents, living well below his means just to pay down some debt so he can move forward in his life. He moved back three years ago and just now sees the light. He has a four year degree and is in grad school, but still lives paycheck to paycheck due to his past debt issues. (none since moving on from his ex, but still residual damage) Despite my meager salary, I make more than he does, despite the fact we both work full time and he has a second job on the side.

Problem: My mom does not think he is right for me. She comes from a very conservative Hispanic family, where the men take care of the women and the women take care of the household. Despite this, she has instilled values in me that will not allow me to be a stay at home housewife, even if my boyfriend (future husband, yes we have discussed this at length and feel comfortable knowing that we are each other’s future spouses) can afford it. When he gets a job that can support a family in the Bay Area, I will still work to put money in savings or college accounts etc. But because he does not make enough money to her, she thinks that he is just using me for sex and free food. This is not the case whatsoever but she will not listen to me. She is very much set in her ways. She makes snide remarks about us having sex in the house, claiming that “he cannot afford to take you to a motel so you guys do it here” which makes me feel like a prostitute...and she has called me that as well. Her conservative upbringing led her to this line of thinking that sex should wait until marriage, and while we wanted to respect her wishes, we also didn’t want to wait until marriage to have sex. We had a very educated conversation about what types of birth control to have and he’s been extremely supportive throughout all this saying if I felt the hormones from the birth control were too much then we would switch to condoms or something else. I have never felt used by him in any way. This was not good enough for her. We thought that would be the end of it, she wouldn’t be happy with our lifestyle but would still just ignore it. However, a couple weeks ago, she caught us coming out of my bedroom, fully clothed mind you, and this completely set her off. It turns out she had been harboring all these feelings and finally exploded. She has no friends and no family to vent to, I am all she has, and it was finally too much for her. She went on a tirade that explained that he was no good for me, was just using me for sex, would never support me or get a good job or anything worthy of me. He has made an effort to include her in his life, pays for gas when we all go out, buys dinner for her, bought her a TV for Mothers day, etc. To top it all off, she has been getting sick lately and blamed the whole ordeal on him, saying that because he’s around she has been getting sick, claiming that he poisons her. I tried to explain that she was getting up there in age, and works too many hours and that she should rest (she literally has no hobbies, just works and goes to school then goes home cooks and reads her ESL books), and that was the cause of illness. I work in the medical field with doctors who are also sick and have said it is a bad flu season. I explained that this may also be a cause, and she did not want to hear it. She thinks my boyfriend is the cause of all her problems. She found cockroaches the other night and claimed he brought them from home, despite the fact he has never seen a cockroach in his life. Despite all this, she says he can still come over, but he is not allowed in the bedroom, the bathroom or the kitchen (she thinks he breathes on the dishes and spreads germs), we live in a studio, so his visits are restricted to a 20x5 area between the front door and kitchen.

TL;DR: I am going to be 29, I pay for all the bills, and my mother does not have the skills to get another job, she is completely dependent on me, yet still wants to run my life. She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by

But we would obviously like for each other to be part of each others' lives. We did this for ourselves, for each other, for ourselves. 

Initially we were planning for he and I to move on from our separateness straight to a specific new city together, Chattanooga, in May (this month.) I pushed it back to the end of July. Now I don't even want to move there until I have at least a year under my belt in my current position. Before, I had accepted I was never going to work in the field I went to school for, I didn't think it was ever going to happen, couldn't even find unpaid internships that were interested in my sorry ass. Same story many have to go through. But now I've really been doing it right with my career, understanding my path, where I fit, where I want to be, my self-esteem, my ability to succeed in this field of my very high interest. 



It's not that I didn't make poor life choices leading up to the moment I decided to move back home as well, after I took him back home ""slightly"" against his will. My shit wasn't working for me either. So I owned up too. 



On one hand, I fucking love anything that makes this sweet-hearted, sweet-minded person happy.  Chattanooga? What? That sounds terrible I love it baby when do we leave.  But on the other hand, I have to be responsible to myself now, what do I do? 

I promised we would go, and we've talked about it, been planning it, but now in my mind I've lead him on if we don't split for the city of Chattanooga in May, no wait July, no wait...do we have to? Like dangling a carrot in front of him as it also looms over my head like a giant demon in the clouds. It could destroy my future! But it's also something I promised. It would be reckless to think that, without even a year of experience under my belt, I can just go to a whole new city, THAT city in particular (small, old boy network, college town, secluded) and find the same kind of job. And while we could make money anywhere...my career is important, so it's the quality of life that is really important, the freedom in our lives to have control and wellness. And healthcare. I can't wait tables anymore. God damn it. 

I feel terrible, I've been dealing with this battle of limbo and right and wrong and clashing in my mind for months now. When I talk it out with him, anything seems possible and I'm relieved and ready. When I'm alone again reality check sets in and I'm like, holy shit, am I delusional?  He wants to leave his job, family, and meetings to be with me and find new job and meetings, but I don't want to leave my job because I won't find a new one. He's told me he wouldn't be happy living in the city I live in now. I don't blame him. But I'm feeling weighted down and sad unable to figure out what to do. 



I have a poor grasp on picking out the meaningful parts of this situation and what to do. 


   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend/fiance is a recovering alcoholic whose rock bottom also brought me to discover and understand the meaning of a quality life worth living. He has found the same. How do we combine lives now in a responsible way that doesn't Fuck us?

386brx,5,2015-06-02,[meta] How many of you ladies fantasize about office sex with a person of authority? (Longish and serious),tragiq,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/386brx/meta_how_many_of_you_ladies_fantasize_about/,"Occasionally, I see a request by email for someone looking to role-play a boss/secretary situation. I know we're all about fantasy here, but I have spent a lot of time as I'm sure most men have, pining over some of the interns or employees in my office. 

I find it difficult to determine if I have a shot with any of them, if only for a roll in the hay. Because I am something of an authority figure to most of them, especially the interns, I worry about sexual harassment claims and things of that nature.

As women, how many of you are suggestible to office antics with an authority figure? What if there is an age gap of about 10 to 15 years? Does that make it hotter or creepier? 

Would women in their 20s be more up for the experience or more creeped out? 

Does a girl who acts very proper actually consider such taboo? Is it more or less enticing if the guy is married vs. single?

Are there any telltale signs that you're giving off that we should be looking for?

There's an intern in my office building who is not my intern but rather the intern of my neighbor. Because I'm in his office a lot, I end up chatting with her plenty and she always seems to perk up when I'm around. I don't know how to discreetly approach her and gauge interest without completely making things permanently awkward. Is there a reliable way to feel her out without completely creeping her out and then having to dread every work day until she leaves?

I'd love to hear some of your thoughts and I would be more than happy to indulge in some role-play to figure out how things might play out. I would want someone who on the surface acts very reluctant, coy or even initially offended, only to be later intrigued. 

Is this a scenario that only happens in movies? 

For those of you that are into this, does the fantasy come with a grounded in reality that a fling would be just a fling?

Can't wait to hear your feedback."
386ewk,49,2015-06-02,30 post from a guy who couldn't last 3 days and what I did differently,MarkyMarkAndPudding,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/386ewk/30_post_from_a_guy_who_couldnt_last_3_days_and/,"Hey nofapstronauts!

I'm a few days late but I wanted to express my thoughts and feelings towards nofap as I have finally achieved 30 days.

I wanna preface my thoughts by saying as the title says I've never been able to make it past 3 days and when I did I would binge the hell out of myself. I started nofap mainly for the fact I have death grip and it was effecting my sex life but yes my addiction was severe and still sucks but it's part of the process. Also even before starting nofap I was always kind of a naturally happy and healthy guy but very immature. I am 19 so I'm still maturing a lot naturally and now living on my own now. I just want to say this because I don't want people to expect these same things. These results may and probably are a mixture of me growing up and nofap. Also as I'll say later just nofap won't do much for you. 

Do I feel different? Abso-fucking-lutely. My perspective of life is completely different. I'm not shy anymore pretty much at all. I'm more confident. I'm so much more positive. I'm harder working. I do better things with my time. I have way more energy. I'm a culinary student on his internship and working 12-16 hours a day, 6 days a week. Yes I could and had to do it before but I have much more energy throughout the the day. 

Are there any down sides? 
Well obviously I crave it. And sometimes it can distract me. (I'm starting to reach my flat line, so yeah that's kinda the sucky part...)

What did I do differently this time after failing so many times after making it past no more than 3 days?

#1. This is monumental. You will almost certainly fail if you do not understand that nofap is a journey not a destination. This applies to everything and nofap included. I would always try and just desperately try to make it to my goal of 14 or 30 days. I would be super uptight about it and think about how great it would be when I'm at that big number. I saw myself as a completely different person. I didn't sit back and enjoy the fact that I'm strong enough to make the decision and I wasn't enjoying the fact that I've made it one more day not almost to a certain one (although it is naturally exciting). If you really want to help yourself I say don't even set a goal. Just start and take it one day at a time. Enjoy that day. Be in it. 

#2. You need to change more than nofap. Yes you will feel different. I didn't do much other than nofap for the first 10 or so days and I did feel different but you really should try to improve other aspects of your life. If you're trying nofap you probably noticed you have a lot more free time. Take that time and put it towards make yourseld a stronger version of yourself. Exercising I would say is the biggest impacting since it helps you both mentally and physically in a huge way but there are other tons of options like meditation, reading, learning to play an instrument. You'll learn that just like nofap the initial effort it takes is huge and takes a lot of mental effort but once you do then you're strengthening your mind to do it what it truly wants and you're reeping the benefits of whatever positive activity you choose. There are also other things you can do to better improve yourself that doesn't require time out of your day like drinking half your body weight in ounces of water or if you're a messy person. Consciously reminding yourself to clean up immediately after you've made a mess or moved something. 

That's it. There's no #3. Just those things have changed my nofap journey from a groggy irritation in my life to a path to find the strongest version of myself. 

Please please enjoy the ride, not just nofap but everything. Be in the now. Be present. You don't want too much of yesterday or tomorrow to take up today."

3870vg,1,2015-06-02,I [18F] am entering an LDR soon and am really concerned for my [18M] boyfriend...,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3870vg/i_18f_am_entering_an_ldr_soon_and_am_really/,"I am about to study abroad this August for about three months an ocean away from my boyfriend of almost eight months. Oh, and before I forget, we do attend the same university!

This summer, we have been very lucky and see each other at least once a week (we live about an hour and a half away from each other). That has been amazing, and I love every bit of time I have with him since we're gearing up for a long period of being away from each other. Recently, I got an internship in the city he lives in, which means I'll be there even more often (about 2-3 times/week).

The thing is, he gets extremely sad after a couple of days of not seeing each other. There are things going on in his life that I know are making this worse for him; however, this is simply the way he is regardless. Of course, I do everything in my power to comfort him and it all works out because we get to see each other within the next few days. I'm terrified though of what will happen while I'm away.

What can I do to comfort him while I'm gone for such a long period of time. I should note that I miss him too and this is not a one-sided thing. It just affects him at a much more quick and intense rate. I love him so much, I don't want him to be hurting for three months straight.

I've a few ideas lined up like a pendant for his necklace to remind him of me, open when letters, and just keeping a steady line of communication via text and voice. I figured those of you that have had experience with this could give me more insight!

Much love, and I can't wait to hear your thoughts and ideas:)"

387802,6,2015-06-02,"I am infatuated with another, and other ways I have betrayed someone I love.",Lest_the_wise_world,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/387802/i_am_infatuated_with_another_and_other_ways_i/,"I have been with my girlfriend for nearly 6 years now. I am very much in love and feel happy with the possibility of spending the rest of my life with her. She is also my first girlfriend, I have never had any other romantic relationships. We met in college and started dating when I was 22. 


Because of personal insecurities, I had never been able to muster the confidence to engage in romance, despite a few advances from a couple girls. However, there is this girl, let's call her Marilyn, that I have known since elementary school. She was one of my first crushes, although I didn't let her know it. She has always been at least an acquaintance and had a couple serious relationships with some of my best friends growing up. It had been hard for me to see Marilyn in relationships with others, exacerbated by being so close with her SOs. I was not a very close friend of hers however until after high school. We ended up going to the same university. I spent a few years in college ""discovering myself"" before settling down into a degree program I knew I would be happy with. After this self-discovery period I met my current girlfriend, let's call her Anne. I had finally reached a level of maturity and confidence to able to form a real romantic connection. Around this same time I ended up having more than a few classes with Marilyn, during which we became very close friends,  and as far as I knew at the time, her interest was purely platonic. Despite having a girlfriend I could not shake the renewed attraction I had for Marilyn during our time in school together. 


Eventually, one drunk night I confessed my attraction to Marilyn to which she responded that she had had a crush on me as well going back to high school! I was already in a rather serious relationship with Anne however and both Marilyn and I pretty much forgot the conversation ever happened. In the following years Marilyn and I hung out quite a bit; she's was never single during this period. At one point in my relationship with Anne we had a breakup. This lasted about 6 months during which Anne hooked up with a guy in NYC where she had an internship. During the same period my attraction for Marilyn grew, but was un-acted upon because she always had a boyfriend. Eventually Anne and I got back together with a stronger relationship than ever before. I can truly say I would be happy with her for the rest of my life. We have been through some hardships in the past but now we are living together happily in New York, with a bright future ahead of us.


Yet, in my some part of my heart I still bear an intense infatuation with Marilyn. In an egregious act of unfaithfulness I once again admitted my desire for her. Marilyn responded that she wishes I had acted on this earlier, despite her romantic engagements. She told me how she had had feelings for me but did not want to make the first move. By this point she had had an unplanned child and told me she wishes she had been with me instead. This resulted in a series of sexual conversations culminating in our sharing of explicit images. I have never been with anyone other than Anne however I still carry a deep seeded attraction to Marilyn. I am reminded of the Gang of Four song [Damaged Goods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvs4_60zvTo), ""sometimes I'm thinking that I love you, but I know it's only lust"". I have never told Anne about any of this, however I feel she senses some part of my true fondness for Marilyn. 


The worst part is I cannot honestly admit any regret for my sexual relation with Marilyn. Because I have felt this way about her so long I feel like I have two different parts of my heart. The (much) larger of which belongs to Anne, but there is still a small part that I cannot help but dedicate to Marilyn. She is a person I have longed to be with for over a decade and a half ( I am 28 now). And I still make time to see Marilyn whenever I am visiting home. I even have sexual fantasies about her. 


 Maybe I should stop being friends with Marilyn altogether. I am confident I will never do anything to betray in the physical sense, but I know it is already unfair that my heart is not whole dedicated to Anne. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and be with Marilyn at least for a little while, the thought of what may have been haunts me on occasion. "
3878uo,15,2015-06-02,Japan's Flying Geese or Flying V Model,Tropicana89,AsianMasculinity,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/3878uo/japans_flying_geese_or_flying_v_model/,"There have been a few waves of industrialization. The first wave consisted of the colonial powers: England, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands. The second wave consisted of the upstarts who missed out on the colonial land-grab, and butted heads against the established order to get a bigger piece of the pie. They make up the major actors of WW2: Germany, USA, USSR, Japan. The third wave we are seeing today, the BRIC: Brazil, Russia, India, China.  

In particular, the industrialization of China is talked about a lot in the media, but the important role Japan had to play in China's successful industrialization is not mentioned as much. From the time Deng Xiaoping opened China to foreign investment, Japan has always been the biggest investor in helping China industrialize. This can be seen in Japan's FDI. This fact doesn't receive much attention in the West, probably because they don't understand Asia well and probably because they have the dichotomy of Japan = good, and China = bad. This fact also doesn't receive much attention in Chinese and Japanese media, probably because of continued nationalistic sentiments from regular folk, so the leadership tends to not highlight it too much, although they are well aware of the close business ties between the countries.  

How did this high Japanese to Chinese FDI come to be? Because of the development of Japan's Flying V Model.  

Flying geese fly in a V formation. They do this because it allows the entire flock to expend the least amount of energy. The leader has to break wind and focus on navigation, but the geese following him, and the geese following that geese, and so on, just need to follow the geese right in front of them. This allows them to draft a bit and also conserve their energy. Japan proposed a similar model in Asia. Japan was the first industrialized country in Asia. They would break the wind, moving up the value and innovation chain, passing lower-value activities to the next asian nation. In this way they would make all of Asia richer.   

Japan started at the bottom of the value chain, like every other nation has to at some point. They made cheap goods with cheap labour with little sophisticated knowledge of machinery. They then exported this for large profit. As they made money from exports, they wisely invested this in building up infrastructure, education, and developing domestic industries. Eventually the wages of workers raised as more money flowed to factory owners and workers demanded higher wages. This meant Japan could no longer make these cheap products, like knitting shirts and shoes together, cheaply anymore because labour costs had risen. As planned however, by this time, the money earned from exports which had been invested in education and innovation had allowed Japan to move up the value chain to developing slightly more sophisticated goods, for example, manufacturing goods like toys, which need some capital as well as labour. Japan could no longer make clothing at competitive costs so they passed this onto the next asian nation, namely the Asian Tigers, the next asian countries to industrialize: South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore. Today, all of these nations have reached almost first-world standard, and are, in turn, shedding low-value industries to the next asian nation, China. For example, Taiwan's FoxConn gets most of its labour from China. This benefits Taiwan in that a sizable percentage of the profit goes to FoxConn, owned by Taiwanese owners, but it benefits China too, in that the rest of the percentage goes to Chinese workers, and the know-how and infrastructure is developed. Even China is beginning to shed its lowest-value industries, hand-sewn clothes and shoes to other asian nations: Bangladesh, Vietnam, Philippines. Eventually, these nations will in turn move up the value-chain and shed the low industries to another nation.   

This pattern was followed all the way up the value-chain. Today, Japan has reached first-world living standards. Their citizens receive top education and make first-world salaries, not as $1/day factory workers. This was all because Japan kept slowly investing in education, innovation, and infrastructure.    

When Japan first got into cars, and tried to export them to US, they were known as shit cars and death boxes. No one bought them except for those who could only afford the cheapest cars. But steadily Japan reinvested this money to improve and of course today, Japan is known to make some of the highest-quality and most innovative cars today. Japan is at the highest end of goods now. The goods they export are microchips, medical products, and other products that require extremely high-quality.   

And as Japan moved up the value-chain, they pulled up the asian nations after them. As South Korea became richer, eventually started their own car company such as Hyundai and Kia, which target cheaper consumers than those that buy Japanese cars.  

Every single successful Asian country has followed the Japanese model. Build a successful domestic industry where you're competitive, usually at the very bottom of the value chain with $1/day labour. Export for lots of profit. Re-invest that money to build infrastructure and education, and slowly move up the value chain. China is copying this model to the T.  

But I think this model actually has important implications for our own lives and the community of Asian-Americans. Asians only started immigrating to the West in 1965 with the passing of the Immigration Bill which no longer banned immigration of coloured people. But many of us have only come more recently. Many here are 1.0 or 1.5 generation.  

Our parents did the hardest work. They immigrated to the land of opportunity, whether that be America, Europe, Australia, Canada. They took the only jobs they could, generally lower-class jobs. And they told us to focus on school, study hard, work hard, etc. Basically, they wanted us to have a better life and move up the value-chain. As the first generation growing up in America we have additional human capital over our parents. We know English fluently, we understand the culture, and we've received a western education through college or some other education which opens doors to certain job opportunities. With our background of growing up in America since we were young, we have more opportunities and can make more money than our parents could. If they could only make $10/hour at a nail salon, we can make $30/hour or higher working in some office job.  

As our cohort becomes more accomplished, I think its important to follow the Flying V Model in giving back to the asian-american community. This can be mentoring. Many of us will also go on to have some sort of management job. Either being able to hire interns for our team or starting our own business and deciding to hire asian employees and helping them break into entry-level fields.  

The more successful you become and the higher you go, the more asians you can pull up with you. Yishan Wong was CEO of reddit. He chose Ellen Pao to be CEO after him (wise or not, I dunno). I'm just hypothecating, but he may have also chosen an asian Marketing Director down the line, who chose an asian Regional Marketing Manager, who took a chance on a fresh grad asian intern, giving him his first break.  

The fresh grad asian intern gets his first break. The asian Regional Marketing Manager gains valuable management experience which will allow him to continue to move up. As they get promoted they can pass on their position to another asian, which will benefit the fresh asian employee and benefit the new manager as they now have a loyal ""team"" which they can rely on to continue to be an effective manager and continue to get promoted. The net effect is enriching and making more powerful the entire asian-american community, which allows us to effectively combat the other cultural forces in America.   

You see this with the Jewish community. Many jewish families started in the textile business, aka making clothing, low-value stuff. They would hand-sew shirts and stuff and sell them for not much. But their kids got a western education and did slightly better, and their kids did slightly better, repeated for a couple generations. Today, the average salary of a jewish person is $100,000. That's insane. Almost all jewish people today work on the higher-end of the value chain. They all make high salaries in professions like lawyers, bankers, academia.  

We can enrich the asian-american community in the same way by following the Flying Geese Model.

I am currently working on my CoE application (a Japanese company is making the sponsorship for me). I am a web developer.

They want me to proof my 3 years of work experience (for the Specialist in Humanities / International Services visa).

I worked:

- 6 months of internship (full-time) with company A
- 7 months of internship (part-time) with company A
- 6 months of internship (part-time) with company B
- 17 months full-time with company C

So 36 months (3 years) in total. Will it be accepted as 3 years of work experience (regarding to internship and part-time)?

In company A and B I was an intern but did the same job as a regular employee (in fact I was the only developer in Company B!

I am asking because on immigration websites they are just mentioning ""work experience"" without further explications so I'm guessing internships are working too but... I prefer to ask!

If not, will my university degree be enough to ask for the CoE? Or it is better to add my degree + my work experiences (even the internships) to my case?

Thank you!"
387nc2,3,2015-06-02,[Engineering Internship] Is my solution to this probability problem valid?,differentiallity,learnmath,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/387nc2/engineering_internship_is_my_solution_to_this/,"Yesterday in my internship I tried my hand at a probability problem while writing a statistical report.  I'll explain the problem as best as I can:  
  
Problem:  
A plastic car part has 6 metal clips installed during our manufacturing process.  Every day, we take about 3 parts and destructively test their tensile force.  This means we rip them off the part with a force gauge to tell how hard they hold onto the part.  If any one of these 6 clips fail, the whole part fails.  
  
I was given data for 18 parts.  It lists the clip number and the tensile force, in Newtons.  I took the data for each clip and evaluated the C_pk values, using an LSL of 111 N (there is no USL, since a higher force is better).  I then converted the C_pk values into % yield (as in what percent of the clips would meet our criteria).  Here is what I got:  
**Clip**      |         **Yield**  
1                 |             0.94438  
2                 |             0.975741  
3                 |             0.876926  
4                 |             0.94084  
5                 |             0.990786  
6                 |             0.949534  
  
As I said above, if any one of the clips fail, the whole part fails.  Therefore, I interpreted the yield as the probability a clip is successful.  
  
My Math:  
P(whole part is successful) = P(clip 1 is successful) * P(clip 2 is successful) * ... * P(clip 6 is successful)  
0.94438 * 0.975741 * 0.876926 * 0.94084 * 0.990786 * 0.949534 = **0.715238**  
  
My Issue:  
I have no idea if I did the problem right since I haven't taken probability yet, and none of my supervisors know it either.  Me telling the general manager that we only have a 72% yield is a big deal that would make problems for a lot of people, so I want to make sure I did it right.  In addition, I want to learn this so I don't have to ask in the future :)"

I was never a brilliant student, and my careless attitude made me do badly in most of my high school exams, and I nearly got myself out. I flunked in almost every exam I appeared in, and barely passed my high school. People always used to consider me worthless, and life was quite tough those days. Well I worked quite hard, I gave everything I had, and eventually got into one of the most reputed university in my country, and now I have a CGPA of 3.4+/4.0. The problem is, I still work really hard, and I try everything I can to compete the people I study with, but always fail. I have really good extra-curricular, I organized a lot of events for my university, I worked really hard for three years, but when the time to award the presidencies of the societies came, I wasn’t even considered, I wasn’t even allowed to give an interview. The people who got the posts had way less experience than mine. Secondly I was never good at coding, people always used to say that I have to score good grades to secure internships and other related stuff, I did all that I had in me, I even scored A grades in all programming courses last semester, and now I applied at so many places for these summer internships, but got rejected from everywhere. People with lower GPAS keep on getting internships and I am just hopeless. I am so frustrated and depressed with all of this. I don’t know what to do, no matter how hard I work, and whatever I do, I am just not able to achieve what I want. After doing so much, and scoring this GPA I still feel I am at the same place I was in my high school, this time the only difference is that I am the only one instead of the people around me, considering myself worthless. This is the first time I am posting anywhere over the internet, I really don’t know what I really wanted to ask, I am just posting this all over here as I have no clue of what else I should do."

I am currently doing an internship (hope it is the right word, english is not my native language) at a retirement home. The guy I have to work with is the Janitor, so most of the time I am not in contact with the old (and sometimes suffering from dementia) people. When I walk past them, It is always very weird for me, they are for example just sitting there laughing or singing/humming. One of them always screams ""Hello"" and something I cant understand, but it sounds like ""I cant..."". Because I have never experienced something like this before, It honestly freaks me out. Some old lady even tries to touch me everytime I am near her. Or this old guy who just screams all day long, I can even hear him if I am doing something in the garden.

But the thing that to this time freaked me out the most happened today. 

I was assigned to clean the Wheelchairs and ""wheeled walkers"".
So there I was, going from room to room, getting them out, cleaning them up and putting them back. Many of the residents were asleep, so it wasnt a problem. 

Then, I got the Wheelchair out of the room of a resident who kept talking to herself, screaming stuff like ""you cant give away the children"" and so on. The worst thing was about to come.

Now the Janitor was back, we were cleaning together because we were faster this way. He got the stuff we needed out of an old ladys room. I think she woke up or something, because before the Janitor got in her room I didnt hear anything from her. We cleaned her stuff, now I could hear the lady in the room calling for the Janitor with his first name. He opened the door, put the wheelchair in her room in a way she could not see him and told me to do the same thing. I asked myself why he did not respond to the women. Then we just stood in the corridor and talked a bit. 

Suddenly, the old lady who was calling him got out of her room and said: ""(Janitors First Name) You are my son!"" 

He just said no and told her to go back into her room. That she did after maybe half a minute telling him he was her son.

Soo, this is one of the most scary moments of my life, not because I feared something, but because it is just strange seeing human beings like that, out of their minds.

Thank you for reading, I just wanted to get this off my Chest :P

I'm a CA resident, so I've been told the standard number to apply to is around 30-40? I want to apply to med schools on both west and east coast though, since I have family in both areas. The middle regions are a bit iffy, but I'm willing to consider it if it's a school within my statistics. Below is my information from this month's ""What are my chances?"" thread for reference. In addition, I'm concerned that my research-heavy background and low MCAT score will hold me back from being a competitive applicant to MD programs.

* **2nd time applicant**

* **Year in school**: Currently a 4th year undergraduate, will be graduating after Spring 2015

* **Country/state of residence**: CA, USA

* **Cumulative GPA**: 3.86. Had a bit of weird trend here--1st year was solid 3.9, 2nd year had a dip in grades for personal reasons, 3rd year was again solid 3.9 and currently completing my 4th year (expected to be around 3.8-3.9). However, I have always maintained myself on the Dean's Honor List for all quarters (GPA &gt; 3.50).

* **Science GPA**: 3.80

* **MCAT Scores**: 32 (11 PS, 11 V, 10 BS)

* **Research**: Photonics West 2nd Author Abstract/Presentation, CA Society of Plastic Surgeons 2nd Author Conference Abstract/Presentation, 1st Author CHOC Pediatrics Conference Abstract/Presentation, 3 Undergraduate Symposium Presentations, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 2nd Author Abstract, 1st Author Accepted Undergraduate Research Journal Submission, Journal of Surgical Research 2nd Author Publication, Undergraduate Research Fellowships. I was in one lab (Dermatology/Burn Wound Medical Optics) for three years, though I ended up joining an additional lab (due to an interest in medical 3D CAD modeling) that I quit after 1 year.

* **Volunteering (clinical)**: 1 year senior healthcare center (4 hr/week), 1 year in outpatient discharge and in-patient pharmacy for a hospital (4 hr/week)

* **Physician shadowing**: None currently. Currently in the phase of training and shadowing a surgeon during the summer

* **Non-clinical volunteering**: 8 weeks leading a STEM outreach program for urban underserved high school students (8 hr/week)

* **Extracurricular activities**: Biomedical Engineering Society Leader (Historian, Treasurer, Vice President), Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society Leader (Outreach Chair, Vice President). In addition, do a lot of visual arts (particularly in chalk art festivals), though I have never done it for an award/recognition.

* **Employment history**: None. Technically was an intern for the research lab (with paid stipend) before becoming an undergraduate research assistant (non-paid)

* **Immediate family members in medicine?**: None as a doctor/physician, but do have relatives that work as a nurse and pharmacist

* **Specialty of interest**: Dermatology (due to extensive research with surface tissue), Radiology (due to research work with medical optical technology), or Pediatrics (due to occasional baby-sitting jobs, helping out with children's program in my church, and the STEM outreach program)

* **Shadowing experience**: None, as explained in physician shadowing. Will be shadowing under a surgeon during the summer of this application season though.

* **Graduate degrees**: After this coming spring, will have a BSc. in biomedical engineering

* **Interest in rural health**: Not in particular, though I'm not particularly opposed to it either. I lack the experience of engaging with the rural population in regards to clinical outreach.

388pyj,3,2015-06-02,"Dependent Mom Still Controlling Life (Long, but desperately need some insight)",Dreamgirl94025,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/388pyj/dependent_mom_still_controlling_life_long_but/,"Background: Twenty years ago, my mom and I immigrated from a Hispanic country to the Bay Area after my Dad left us, took off in the middle of the night and emptied all the bank accounts. Promised with help, her sisters all but abandoned her two weeks after the move leaving us with nothing. My mother worked 80 hour weeks just to provide for us, as I was just in grade school at the time. I learned English on my own as well as helped my mom learn English on the side as well. Eventually I got into college, graduated and also graduated with a Masters degree. My mother has worked at her own salon since moving here, and her English has improved to the point where she can communicate effectively, but still cannot pass an English proficiency exam to get into college to further her education. 

Lately, things in the salon have turned bad, as she has an extreme mistrust of outsiders,due to being taken advantage of by her sisters and ex-husband, so she never hired any additional help. The salon is only open when she is there, and granted she does work 80 hour weeks, even to this day as she is entering her 60s. This has caused the salon to be stagnant and never reach its proper growth potential, as it keeps sporadic hours, because nobody can possibly work 120 hour weeks, so sometimes she has to close for errands or ESL classes, etc. It’s also not in a good area, with not a lot of foot traffic. Bottom line is, she makes only enough to stay open and does not make any profit whatsoever. It has been this way for awhile. This has led me to running the household, so to speak since I was 16 years old. I worked summer jobs during high school and worked after school when I had college, including full time during grad school. I could never take an opportunity to take a potentially lucrative internship as I could never not have any income coming in, as I was paying rent, groceries etc. This has led me to starting my career a bit later than my contemporaries. I will be 29 soon, and I have finally found my dream job. Granted, its entry level, but has amazing growth potential and I have the most amazing supervisors ever, but despite that, and in combination with living in the Bay Area, it does not pay a wage where I can buy a house, just yet.

Enter my boyfriend. We met over a year ago and hit it off immediately. His background is similar to mine, albeit a little different. He was born here, but still received no parental support and his parents would rather get high than raise a child. He was pretty much on his own since he was 14, although they contribute enough to keep a roof over his head. He took the first opportunity he could and moved out when he was 21 with his then girlfriend, which turned into his ex-wife soon after. Along the way, they had a child. Since then he has been dealing with child support, and also working a job where he is significantly underpaid compared to his peers (seems like you need to work in tech to get anywhere in the Bay Area, which neither of us do). The child support and his ex have ruined his credit to the point where it has caused him to lose a few years on his life by moving back into his parents, living well below his means just to pay down some debt so he can move forward in his life. He moved back three years ago and just now sees the light. He has a four year degree and is in grad school, but still lives paycheck to paycheck due to his past debt issues. (none since moving on from his ex, but still residual damage) Despite my meager salary, I make more than he does, despite the fact we both work full time and he has a second job on the side.

Problem: My mom does not think he is right for me. She comes from a very conservative Hispanic family, where the men take care of the women and the women take care of the household. Despite this, she has instilled values in me that will not allow me to be a stay at home housewife, even if my boyfriend (future husband, yes we have discussed this at length and feel comfortable knowing that we are each other’s future spouses) can afford it. When he gets a job that can support a family in the Bay Area, I will still work to put money in savings or college accounts etc. But because he does not make enough money to her, she thinks that he is just using me for sex and free food. This is not the case whatsoever but she will not listen to me. She is very much set in her ways. She makes snide remarks about us having sex in the house, claiming that “he cannot afford to take you to a motel so you guys do it here” which makes me feel like a prostitute...and she has called me that as well. Her conservative upbringing led her to this line of thinking that sex should wait until marriage, and while we wanted to respect her wishes, we also didn’t want to wait until marriage to have sex. We had a very educated conversation about what types of birth control to have and he’s been extremely supportive throughout all this saying if I felt the hormones from the birth control were too much then we would switch to condoms or something else. I have never felt used by him in any way. In fact, he encouraged us to be open with her about the fact that I lost my virginity to him and he explained that he valued and respected me despite us doing it before marriage. This was not good enough for her. We thought that would be the end of it, she wouldn’t be happy with our lifestyle but would still just ignore it. However, a couple weeks ago, she caught us coming out of my bedroom, fully clothed mind you, and this completely set her off. It turns out she had been harboring all these feelings and finally exploded. She has no friends and no family to vent to, I am all she has, and it was finally too much for her. She went on a tirade that explained that he was no good for me, was just using me for sex, would never support me or get a good job or anything worthy of me. He has made an effort to include her in his life, pays for gas when we all go out, buys dinner for her, we bought her a TV for Mothers day and he paid half plus purchased a converter box, he drives to my house as she doesn’t like me going to his house or be out so much etc. To top it all off, she has been getting sick lately and blamed the whole ordeal on him, saying that because he’s around she has been getting sick, claiming that he poisons her. I tried to explain that she was getting up there in age, and works too many hours and that she should rest (she literally has no hobbies, just works and goes to school then goes home cooks and reads her ESL books), and that was the cause of illness. I work in the medical field with doctors who are also sick and have said it is a bad flu season. I explained that this may also be a cause, and she did not want to hear it. She thinks my boyfriend is the cause of all her problems. She found cockroaches the other night and claimed he brought them from home, despite the fact he has never seen a cockroach in his life. Despite all this, she says he can still come over, but he is not allowed in the bedroom, the bathroom or the kitchen (she thinks he breathes on the dishes and spreads germs), we live in a studio, so his visits are restricted to a 20x5 area between the front door and kitchen.

TL;DR: I am going to be 29, I pay for all the bills, and my mother does not have the skills to get another job, she is completely dependent on me, yet still wants to run my life. She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by 
myself and even through all the struggles she has caused me, I still want to take care of her, just albeit on on my terms.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I have an internship with a tech company here developing mobile apps, and they are giving me the option of working with them while abroad. This means that in my down time I can easily make enough money for the next day or two by sitting down and programming for a couple of hours. The laptop will also allow me to contact family members whenever I want and allow me to look up information with more speed than my phone would.

However, my two other friends I am going with are bringing their laptops, and so my thoughts were that I could easily use their laptop whenever in order to do my stuff. The problem with that would be I would spend quite a while setting everything up on their laptops in order to do my work from it, in which I would lose a lot of precious time doing it (my friends are already abroad so I can't set it up before I go).

It seems like having a laptop would be a great thing, especially since I am debating starting a blog as well while I'm traveling. The only problem is, I have a  Macbook that cost me around 1700, and even with the AppleCare, it doesn't cover the Macbook being broken or stolen, etc etc. So if I lose it, my life will become a lot harder for me back home (especially since I am a CS major).

My question is if you were in my shoes, would you bring the laptop with you and take the risk, or would you just leave it at home?

Thanks in advance everybody! It's been a dilemma I have been dealing with for a while and just thought I'd get third party opinions."
38941a,1,2015-06-02,Galapaghost,trrh,trrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/trrh/comments/38941a/galapaghost/,"Galapaghost was a monstrously large undead turtle. This made it very difficult for him to secure gainful employment. His resume was impeccable. A triple-major in Computer Science, Marine Biology, and Humpback Whale Linguistics. Perfect GPA. Multiple internships.

He received a steady stream of calls for interviews. But as soon as he showed up, the person from HR would take one look at him and start making excuses. Or run away screaming.

Employ me, Galapaghost prayed every night. Dear God, Dear Creator, Dear Everyone, please just help me find a place in the Universe. I want to contribute to the world. I’m sick of watching all these stupid documentaries on the internet and eating snack food all day long. I want to have somewhere to go, somewhere that’s outside my house. I want to be part of the world.

Galapaghost always felt better after praying. When you want something with all of your heart, the universe finds a way. That’s what it said in The Alchemist. And Galapaghost believed it.

He spent the morning sending off resumes, as usual. Around lunchtime, he was distracted by a news story about the war in Ukraine. Rebels in Donetsk had captured some Ukranian soldiers. The pictures were harrowing. One P.O.W. had two black eyes. He stared at the ground while the rebels paraded him through town.

A civilian woman was being forced to stand on a street corner at gunpoint. The rebels had draped a Ukranian flag around her and forced her to hold a sign that said ‘Spotter for Ukranian Artillery’. Commuters got out of their cars to shout at her and spit on her. Everything was ugly.

Galapaghost couldn’t look away. The images were disturbing, but they tugged at something inside him. Something deep within. This was injustice. This was wrong.

The microwave dinged, and Galapaghost shook off his reverie. When he was carrying his bowl of Ramen back to the computer desk, he noticed that a letter had been slipped under his door.

It was from SmithCorp. Had he applied to a company called SmithCorp? It didn’t sound familiar.

He grasped a letter opener in his bony fin and opened the letter.

    Thank you for sending us your resume. We are very interested in your unique skills. We would like to invite you for an interview this afternoon.

That was it. No other message. Just an address printed on the letterhead. What was SmithCorp anyway?

He checked Google. Nothing. That was odd. Definitely not a tech company. And ‘SmithCorp’ wasn’t the name anyone would give to an NGO devoted to Ocean Conservation efforts. Maybe it was a mistake. The letter had been meant for someone else.

He was about to throw the letter into the wastebasket when a little voice in his head spoke up. No, the voice said. Go to the interview.

But I don’t know anything about the company, Galapaghost thought. Even if they don’t change their minds when they see me, I’ll look like a fool when they ask me questions. I don’t even know what industry SmithCorp belongs to.

It doesn’t matter, the voice said. When you want something with all of your heart, the Universe conspires to bring it about.

Galapaghost took a long breath. He nodded. He could do this. He could give it a shot.

He went over to his closet and picked out his only suit. It had been tailor-made. A gift from his mother. He inspected himself in the mirror. The turtle skull looking back at him was confident. That guy in the mirror looked good. This was happening. This was his time.

He rode the bus, getting off a few blocks from SmithCorp’s building. The building was large, but it looked mostly empty.

“You’re Galapaghost, right?” A man in a charcoal suit said, walking towards him.

“Yes,” Galapaghost said, “That’s me.”

The man held out his hand. Galapaghost shook it with his fin-bone. He was astonished. He’d never made it this far into an interview before.

“Come inside,” the man said, “I’ll start your interview immediately.”

Galapaghost followed the man inside, looking around frantically to see any kind of logo or signage that would indicate what kind of company SmithCorp was. No luck. He didn’t even see a SmithCorp sign.

The walked inside and entered a small private room. Plastic chairs and a wooden table. No windows.

“How did you know I was coming?” Galapaghost asked, sitting down.

The man laughed. He looked at Galapaghost, expecting a smile. When the smile failed to materialize, the interviewer frowned, his eyebrows deepening dangerously. “I don’t think you’re giving us enough credit,” he said.

“Oh,” Galapaghost said, “I’m very sorry, sir. I meant no offense.” His heart was beating wildly. Someone had finally given him an interview and here he was, messing up his only chance.

The interviewer cleared his throat. “Situation,” he said, “You’re assigned to travel internationally. What do you do to prepare?”

“Um,” Galapaghost said, “Pack?”

The interviewer looked at him expectantly.

“Pack my stuff,” Galapaghost continued, trying to buy some time. What did they want him to say? What was the right answer here? He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. He looked up at the clock. The thin red second hand was sweeping down in a broad arc.

“I-,” Galapaghost said, searchingly, “I would do some research,” he said in a burst of insight, “On the local language. See, I studied a form of Linguistics as one of my majors. I’m deeply interested in learning different languages and I feel that knowing something about the local language would give me a strategic advantage in any kind of negotiations that might come up.”

The interviewer nodded, satisfied.

Galapaghost realized that he had unconsciously been drawing his limbs and neck down into his shell. He relaxed, extending his limbs outside his shell.

“Situation,” the interviewer said, “You have a goal. Someone else has a goal which is contrary to your own. What do you do?”

Galapaghost grinned. He was ready for this one. “When you want something bad enough,” he said, “the whole universe conspires to give it to you.”

The man gave a look that was almost a smile. “Do you want this job more badly than the other guy?”

Galapaghost nodded. “Oh yeah,” he said, “I definitely want this job more than the other guy.” It was true. He still couldn’t tell what it was, but somehow it felt right. He needed this to work out.

The man asked more and more questions about ‘Situations’. Some were vague, some specific, some bizarre. Some questions involved violence. Was this some kind of psychological screening?

For some reason, Galapaghost found himself talking about the article he’d read about Ukraine that day. It was a terrible mistake, he knew. It made him look unhinged.

But it made the interviewer happy. He asked Galapaghost a barrage of follow-up questions about Ukraine, and geopolitics in general. Galapaghost surprised himself. He ended up sounding pretty well-informed. Watching documentaries and reading articles had paid off.

After an hour, the interviewer paused. “You’re an impressive candidate,” he said finally, “But why do you want to work for us? You could get a more traditional job at any company.”

Galapaghost couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Had he gotten the job? That’s what it sounded like. But now was definitely not the time to admit that no one else would hire him. He had to think of something fast. What did this company do? He still had no idea. But he knew why he wanted a job. He smiled.

“I want to do something meaningful,” Galapaghost said. “I care about the world a lot. And I want to be on the side of good. Making things better. Fixing problems.”

The man nodded thoughtfully. “You know,” he said, “A lot of people think that what we do isn’t meaningful. But I think it’s the most meaningful thing in the world.”

He continued, “When I come home from an assignment. And I see my little daughter sleeping peacefully. I know what it takes.” Emotion crept into his voice, “I know what it takes to keep this country the kind of place where little girls like her can sleep peacefully.”

He cleared his throat.

“How soon can you move to Langley?” he said.

“Langley?” I asked.

“To begin your training,” he said, “We’ll start you off as an analyst, but even our analysts have to go through training.”

Galapaghost’s jaw dropped. Now he remembered sending off his resume. This job was beyond his wildest dreams. He never expected them to contact him. Especially not in such a secretive way.

The man smiled again. “Welcome to the C.I.A.”"

Can these two lost souls find a future together?Note: this story takes place 3 years before A White Hot Christmas: Novella  
   
   
   
   
   
**Excerpt**
   
Holding hands, I’m barely aware of anything aside from Aaron’s fingers entwined with mine as we walk out of the building.
   

   
“Golly, he’s adorable!” I exclaim when I catch sight of a beautiful chocolate Lab happily looking out of the window at us as we approach Aaron’s truck. Russell is even cuter in person that he was in the tiny picture I saw last week.
   

   
He’s standing on the passenger’s seat with his tongue hanging out to one side, his warm breath visibly hitting the cold air, and his golden eyes alight with what can only be described as happiness. “I wish I had my camera.”
   
___If only I could capture the obvious love for life he’s exuding._“
   

   
Let me turn on the truck and roll down the window so you can say hello,” Aaron says, letting go of my hand and moving around the hood to the driver’s side.
   

   
Russell and I stare at each other in excited interest, his more visible than mine. He whines pitifully, as his entire body quivers and he beats his tail back and forth.
   

   
As soon as Aaron begins rolling down the window, Russell’s nose is poking out through as much of it as possible until it’s down far enough for him to reach me.
   

   
“Hello there,” I say, reaching out one hand to try and pat him as his head moves around wildly in an attempt to lick me instead.
   

   
“Are you a good boy?” I coo, scratching the soft downy fur behind his ears.
   

   
“Sometimes,” Aaron quips, now standing next to me.
   

   
Again, I wordlessly hand him my mocha, freeing up both hands so I can take hold of Russell's head and give him several kisses on his forehead.
   
   
“I don’t believe your Daddy. I bet you’re the sweetest boy ever. Aren’t you?”
   

   
He begins licking my chin gently as he attempts to climb out of the truck and into my arms.
   

   
“Stay inside, baby,” I laugh, trying to push him back through the window and into the truck.
   

   
“Enough. Russell, sit,” Aaron says sternly. Russell’s eyes move to look at him, but he continues to thump his tail, kiss me, and attempt to climb into my arms.
   

   
“I said, sit!” Aaron growls sternly, moving closer to the open window.
   

   
Russell sits down looking petulant, but sticks his head as far out of the window as possible to continue his greeting.
   

   
“Yes, I love you, too,” I say, scratching Russell behind his ears and giving him several more kisses.
   

   
“You need to get your own woman, buddy. Nina’s mine,” Aaron says, placing my mocha on the hood of the truck before pulling me away and turning me to face him.
   
___Nina’s mine._
   
___Golly, I like the sound of that!_
   

   
I giggle and reach up to tuck his hair behind his ears. “Don’t be jealous, Aaron. I’ll scratch you behind your ears, too.”
   

   
Aaron leans down and silences me with a deep, possessive kiss. There is a faint tingle of toothpaste, tang of orange juice, and the bite of coffee, all mixed with what I'm beginning to associate with as Aaron’s taste.
   
___Delicious!_
   

   
“Not in front of the baby,” I laugh, pushing him back from where he now has me pinned against the truck.
   

   
“Russell, close your eyes,” he commands, before the arms that are wrapped around my waist are pulling me back in. As Aaron kisses me again, my arms wind their way around his neck and I move in closer, pressing myself into his hard body.
   

   
His firm hands travel down to roughly cup my backside, causing me to moan with pleasure. Encouraged, he lifts me slightly so we are touching intimately, and I can feel his excitement growing harder against me. We both groan at the contact.
   

   
Dropping me gently back onto my feet, he pulls away. We are mutually panting and gasping for breath. “I really gotta go,” Aaron whispers, clearly annoyed.
   

   
“Right, that thing called work.”
   

   
“Yeah,” he says, removing his hands from my behind and running them up and down my back, making no move to pull away completely.
   

   
Standing in his arms, shielded from the cold, I feel safe, cared for, and desired. Moving my hands down his chest, I wish I could feel Aaron’s warm skin and his muscles reacting to my touch. I wrap my arms around his waist and pull myself in closer. Looking up into his face, I’m mesmerized by his long, dark eyelashes and cobalt eyes.
   
___I could stay like this forever._
   

   
Resting his forehead against mine, we stand still, breathing each other in. Neither one of us really want to move.
   

   
“I’d much rather take you inside and continue kissing you. I need to kiss all of you—_every inch_,” Aaron whispers, his words heated with meaning. “There—there are so many things I want us to do together.”
   

   
His words send a thrill of excitement through my body, heating me with anticipation.“Later?” I ask, my voice rough and hopeful.

My B4 start date is approximately 4 months out and I am curious as to whether or not it is appropriate to try and preemptively transfer from the office I interned with to another in the area (the office I was associated with for my internship was mainly selected because of my school's location). 

Now that I finished with school and back at my home, the current location is still viable for me, but there are others that are more preferable. Would there be any harm in asking about the option to transfer, given that there openings in the alternative locations? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

389vdh,2,2015-06-02,Hi i need some advice on whether to double major or do a masters.,sijose,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/389vdh/hi_i_need_some_advice_on_whether_to_double_major/,"Sorry for making this post so long I just need advice so please bare with me.

I'm an junior double majoring in accounting and finance at a top 100 business school. This upcoming winter I'm going to have the opportunity to either stick with the path I'm on or switch to a bachelor and masters in accounting program. At the moment if I stay in the program I'm in this fall will be very important as meet the firms is held for summer internships. My overall gpa is only a 3.11. I know with that gpa i won't have much of a chance at a big four internship particularly the pwc minority program internship. I know for that one you a 3.4 overall gpa so I'm pretty sure I have zero chance at getting the opportunity to intern there. At the same time I know if I did the five year program that I would have an additional year to move my gpa to a 3.4,or above, thus making me more competitive for internships. The only thing is if I did the five year program I wouldn't be in school for five years it would be more like six years. This is because I was at another university majoring in agriculture before I transferred to my current university. I had been taken some upper level courses in my previous school  that was counted as electives in the school I'm at now. So I basically lost a semester by transferring schools. In my mind I want to do the five year program but I'm worried that people will assume that I did six years because I was extremely lazy plus the school I was at is an large sec school so I'm worried that people will think I left that school for the wrong reasons. Really I left because the out of state tuition was too much for me but what if recruiters question that? I also realize I have bad study habits that led to my gpa being poor. I took intermediate accounting 1 and pretty much barely read the book plus I didn't do much of the practice material yet I still got a b. I know I can get a 3.5 gpa or above I just need to put in the effort. In the end I'm not sure what to do stay a double major while graduating in May 2017 or do the masters and graduate in May 2018.

I've come in to contact with a few people from my adolescence (very recent adolesence, Im 20 now) and I'm seeing people graduate college and become engineers and get internships and while I'm immensely happy for them, it bruises my self-esteem. I know that these people are a few years older than me and only one guy my age is getting an engineering internship that I know of but it all still makes me feel like a damn failure. I still have 3 semesters of community college to go before I can transfer to a 4-year university and god knows how long it will take there to actually  get my degree. Right now I'm just struggling to pay off my debt from the 2014 fall semester which I half tanked. I don't have a car either so I'm not sure how I'll get to school if I make my payments in time to re-enroll this fall where I'll be picking up the pieces from last fall semester. All of this just weighs really fucking heavy on me. If you've read this far, I'm impressed as I'm really just spewing out why I'm upset in order to vent. 

Anyways, I can't give up. I know that things will get better and that my biggest enemy is myself and my self-defeating thoughts. I can't stop trying because the second I really fail is the second that I really give up. Being sober for me right now means dealing with reality and its not easy, but I'm doing it. 

Thanks for being here fellow leavers, best of luck to you all in your sobriety.  "
38acvz,7,2015-06-02,"New GM, full time manager hates her, restaurant staff suffering. (Long and rant-y)",kshearules,TalesFromYourServer,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/38acvz/new_gm_full_time_manager_hates_her_restaurant/,"We just got a new GM
She's fine, but our restaurant is tough to learn. The problem is one of our salaried full time managers absolutely hates her like poison, and spends the majority of the shifts he runs talking about how much he hates her and how much she is ruining the restaurant. 
I have a hybrid position: a combination of serving, bartending, and managing. There's a full time AGM, as well.
The entire atmosphere of the restaurant is being poisoned by the salaried manager, making it very difficult for the new GM and the AGM to keep the staff positive even when he's not in the building. His shifts are absolute hate-fests, and it feels like if you aren't aboard the hate train, you are also the focus of his ire. He's told her right to her face that he doesn't like her, *but he's able to be civil and work with her*; which is patently untrue. 
Today, I walked in to work and before I even saw any of my colleagues I could hear the very loud complaining. Himself, the other server, and a former employee were mocking a note (a nice note that complimented the staff, which also had a few new policies. Nothing to merit the horror vented). The former employee walked out of a shift about two weeks back, then pulled a no-call no-show. The new GM had left her several messages about her employment status, she never returned those calls- so after about a week the AGM sent in termination papers. The night she walked out, she had a verbal altercation with the hate-manny- but from what I understand the two of them are now friends under the hate umbrella of 'oh, that new GM cunt just fucked you out of your job.' Less then a week ago, the former employee came in and his hate was directed at her, as she had a temper tantrum, walked out, and never apologized. 
On the shifts I run, and on the AGM's shifts, there isn't a lot of complaining mainly because we set the tone of our shifts as positive and don't tolerate negativity. Herself and I are on board with the new GM. All of her policy changes are things we should have been doing all along, and everything has an explainable purpose. 
We have a bunch of employees who have whittled their availability down to &gt;3 shifts a week. One of these employees got a month long internship, and asked the GM for a leave of absense- asking to return for her two weekly shifts. The GM told her that she wouldn't hold her job for her as her availability was too little to merit holding the position- to my mind, this makes sense- GM has notified the staff verbally and in writing that if these part part-timers can't loosen up more availability their shifts won't be guarenteed, and will most likely be reassigned to current employees with greater availability or to new hires. Angry manager was motherucking the GM up and down today over the 'unfair loss of a really good employee' *in front of several other workers*... which is completely unfair I don't care if she's the greatest employee we ever had, it's just not good to hold a job open for someone who only can work two shifts, neither of them on weekends. Another employee gave notice last night- she is a nanny full time during the summer, plus she has accepted an interim director position at the nursery school she works at. Her reasons for leaving have nothing to do with the restaurant, but today the angry manager turned the situation on it's ear, telling everyone that the GM is the reason the employee gave notice.
It's soooo hard to keep spirits up during this period of transition. Every little bit of positivity the AGM and I try to pump into the place during our shifts gets decimated by him in the first five minutes he walks in the door. He's pulled up her fb and mocked her in front of at least ten employees. Everything she does, he calls her a dumb cunt. There is no way he's ever going to change his opinion of her, but he's made it impossible for employees on his shift to *not* hate her without fear of reprisal. Today, I mentioned that the new check in server sheets were actually a good thing; I was called a kiss ass and told I didn't know what I was talking about- not by him, but by the other workers. The GM has given me the task of reorganizing the side work, and while I was making notes about par lists and additions/changes to our six year old system; one of the other workers told me that redoing the side work was a stupid idea. Not by angry manager, but he was aware of what I was doing, as I told him and asked him if there was anything he thought we should add.
Sorry this was such a long and scattered rant. I'm just at my wit's end and don't quite know what to do."

I spend a lot of time on this subreddit looking through the various problems and accomplishments that my fellow redditors have in regards to their finances. Recently I have been more and more interested in doing something with money that I have saved up over the years from gifts and summer jobs. I've read past (top) threads
advising people in what to do with X amount of money if they're X age and such. I want you guys to do the same. Place yourself in my shoes and tell me what you'd do with your money.

Details:

- I'm 20 years old, just finished my sophomore year of college. I have two more years of college left.

- I have a scholarships that pay for most of my tuition and other expenses. However, thus far I have taken loans to cover the difference that my scholarships do not.

- Other the course of 2 years, these loans total **$8.5K**. Continuing this trend, I expect to leave school with **~$17k** in loans.

- Starting this Fall semester, I will be renting an off campus apartment with two other people and the my rent will total **$6600** or **$550**/month.

- I have **$1K** in a checking account right now. I have a summer internship where I will be making **~$7600** (after taxes) over the course of 3 months.

- Finally, I have **$5000** in cash in my house. This is money I've saved over many years.

Summary:
 
- 
**$8500** in student loans thus far. Expected to be **~$17000** by the time I graduate.

-  **$1000** in checking account. **$7600** to be added from summer internship.

-  **$5000** in cash.

- **$6600** or **$550**/month in expenses.

- I do not have a car or any other expenses.


Now, with all this information, what would *you* do with the $5000 (or any of the money) that is currently collecting dust?"

Sidenote: I spent this past summer in Poland and offered a guy a pinch in a diskotek. I explained how to do it very thoroughly and put one in myself to show him.

Starting with Team **Fan Favourite:**

---

**Part 1**

Okay as you can see there are alot weights hanging in a tree, about 15 feet up. for part 1, you will be creating some type of ladder in order for you to go up and cut the down the weights. It doesn't even need to be a latter as long as one of can get up there. The materials you can chose from included.... * 15 foot long log * Steel rope * Giant fan * Duck tape * Duck tape * Giant cauldron * Glue * Giant rubber band * Basket full of butterflies * Fireworks * stones * stuffed bear * SCISSORS * flame thrower * trampoline You can only use 7 objects. Now not only will you be graded about getting up there but you will be graded on getting down safely. This challenge will also be graded on functionality and creativity.

**Practicality: 7/10** - Creativity challenges are tried and true with practicality, and this seems fair and decent, 4 different gradings though? That might be a little too much for just 1 part of a challenge

**Creativity: 3/10** - Not super creative, since it's basically taking the bridge challenge and turning your head 90 degrees upwards, and it's getting quite a low score just for the fact that basically all of the items were taken from previous creativity challenge

**Coolness: 5/10** - It's not particularly cool, nor is it particularly uncool. not really much to say about it otherwise.

---

**Part 2**



First of all, there should be a long streak of tar with wooden poles dotted throughout; the more weight you carry, the lower your chances are of getting across, where if you fall, you lost 15 seconds on your time. Then, there should be a rope swing where you must make the right movements in order to get across without getting hit by projectiles shot at you. (Blasts of water, pepper spray shots, spike balls swinging back and forth) The more time you take to stop and wait for them to pass, the lower your chances of succeeding, due to the weight dragging you down. Every time you wait, you lose 5 seconds. Lastly, the should be a long board covered in slime (not unlike Pahkitew's) with rope ladders leading up. The catch? The ropes themselves are covered in slime, so you have to be fast. On top of that, if you fell prior to this, The people of the opposing team who completed before can dump water on you. You lost 10 seconds if you fall. The sooner a contestant gets to the end, the better, for this is a race to the end, in order to put the weights down.

**Practicality: 0/10** - Ok... so what? I have literally no idea what the hell I am supposed to submit for a part like this, literally the only thing I can gather is that I need to get a lower time. But there is literally nothing telling me to do anything, so it's entirely impractical.

**Creativity: 4/10** - There is nothing exceptionally creative about this challenge, most of the things I assume we would submit are things that have been done before

**Coolness: 3/10** - honestly, it was a cool challenge, but it was so saturated with... stuff that it makes it really uncool, more confusing than anything else.

---

**Part 3**

For the 3rd part of the challenge. You will have to select a member of your team to hold all the weight the other team managed to get across from part 2. Of course, as soon as the other team gets to the end they are placing the weights on you. So you better hope your team gets to your opponent before they get to you. However you will get to pick which spot to put the weight. Your arms, legs, back, torso, or neck. Each body part will be able to hold the weight for different periods of time.

For everyone else, with the weights you must decide where to place them. Left-Left. Left-Middle. Left-Right. Center. Right-Left. Right-Center. Right-Right. Some spots will make the weights seem a lot heavier than they are and how you organize the weights will impact how long the contestants may hold them. The team who cannot keep the weights on them before dropping them loses.


**Practicality: 7/10** - It works. That's a big thing. It's a little unclear as to how it works, but it works.

**Creativity: 6/10** - props for combining time based and simple left right left challenges, but there is nothing that screams creativity either.

**Coolness: 7/10** - Not too sure why, but I like this part a lot, perhaps it's the survivor esq feel, or the simplicity, yet complexity of it.

---

**Blendyness: 3/10** - The first part of the challenge has nothing to do with being time based, while the second ones do, and the only real meritable blendyness is that  you go from weights in trees to weights on people.

**Final Score: 49/104** (+4 thanks to Gwen's Handy Dandy score card)

---

Now for team **Dratini Diddlers**

---

**Part 1**

For part one we made a few fakes and you must pick what ones are fake. Here are your choices. Pikachu, dragonite, pichu, ponyta, snivy, greninja, jigglypuff, lucario, Mewtwo. You get 3 choices so pick wisely!

for the challenge part the host would pick the ones that will be fake

for each part of the challenge the winning team will get 20 xp, 2 place will get 10 xp, and 3 place will get 5 xp. The team with the most xp at the end will win in the end. That idea came from shawn

**Practicality: 5/10** - It works as a challenge, it isn't very well elaborated on, but I see that it works, which is something.

**Creativity: 4/10** - It's not very creative, considering it's just a run of the mill challenge

**Coolness: 6/10** - the pokemon theme is nice, but the fakes dont really have anything to do with pokemon specifically.

---

**Part 2**

So my last submission to you was just kind of the prototype of the challenge. So for part 2 now we're going to make it so that you need to drain the HP from the Pokemon in order to train/catch them. You need to pick between 1-10 HP to drain but if you drain too much the Pokemon will faint and you won't score any points. This adds some complexity to part 2 instead of just picking a number between 1-10. And like i said the challenge I sent you earlier was just a prototype (didn't realize it at the time I sent it in) so if other people send in changes to parts 1 or 3 disregard what I had sent. 

**Practicality: 8/10** - A tried and true challenge, with a little more intrigue than a completely basic challenge

**Creativity: 4/10** - It's not really an original or ground breaking idea, nothing exceptionally special

**Coolness: 8/10** - I gotta say, I love the whole taming pokemon thing, it really works with the challenge and is pretty awesome

---

**Part 3**

For part three you will be battling a intern cough I mean trainer! You must chose to use tackle or tail whip 5 times (example. Tackle, tackle, tail whip, tail whip, tail whip)

**Practicality: 8/10** - it's clear, and it works, which is more than can be said about most of the challenges

**Creativity: 4/10** - it's not super original, and is a very ""left right left"" challenge, but at least it fits the theme

**Coolness: 4/10** - Huge wasted potential with the idea of 

---

**Blendyness: 8/10** - the first part is a little iffy, but the last two parts blend perfectly, and it's not like the first part is completely exclusive, also the XP system works really nicely.

**Final Score: 59/100**

---

And with that, Team **Pikachu Pedos win immunity!** They all also get a shot at Idol Island!

So Team **Fan Favourite** You are going to need to vote someone out of this game!

38b3wd,15,2015-06-02,I [19 M] am worried about how to end my relationship with my FWB [46 M],mthrowaway199,polyamory,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/38b3wd/i_19_m_am_worried_about_how_to_end_my/,"Hi /r/polyamory. I really need advice and my post was removed from /r/relationships so I am posting it here in hopes that you guys can help me.

**TL;DR:** I am concerned about the situation with my fuck buddy. I am in a new city, we live and work within a five minute walk of each other. We have become extremely close in a very short time (2.5 weeks), but there are several red flags (described below) about him which I feel could lead to an abusive relationship. 

I’m sorry for the length of this post. I have tried to summarize it before getting to the entire essay. I have only known him a few weeks so I summarized our relavant interactions and what I have found online about him. I feel confused because I feel strongly about him. Either I'm overreacting or I need to stop seeing him. Please help me with what to do Reddit.

**Background about me:**

I am a college student, and I have moved to a new city for the summer for an internship  about 2.5 weeks ago. I am completely new to this city, and three hours from home. Other than my fuck buddy (let's call him Troy), I have very few friends here besides my roommates (two people who I have just met). 

I am in a very open and committed relationship with my boyfriend from my school. We have been together (open the entire time) for one year. He is 24 years old and knows everything that is happening with my other sexual relationships as well and vice versa. We consider ourselves polyamorous. This is really only slightly relevant. He is still at our school about 4 hours from where I am from the summer.

**Summary about Troy and the major red flags:**

* He’s 46. He lied to me and claimed he was 31. I have not confronted him about this. I don’t really care that he’s 46, but clearly I can't really trust him.
* He is *extremely* athletic, big and strong, and honestly does not look 46.
* He was raised in Romania, and apparently saw active duty in their army
* He owns his own successful business.
* He knows and has introduced me to a lot of people and is well established here.
* He’s not okay with my open relationship.
* He mentioned that he has anxiety stemming from his last breakup, and that he has been prescribed medication (for when he needs it) but hates and avoids taking it.
* We’ve hung out almost everyday that I’ve been in this new city. I have enjoyed the time we’ve spent together. He’s never acted violent or maliciously around me.
* He knows exactly where I live and work, and also lives and works in close proximity (5 - 6 blocks) to me.
* He wants to have unprotected sex, and I don’t. He is extremely pushy about this, and once joked that he would rape me. 
* He allegedly assaulted someone in 2011 at a bar. I found a blog post about it from the victim.

**The entire (excessively long) story:**

We began talking on Grindr (gay dating/hookup app) while I was here preparing to move about a month ago. We texted back and forth until the day that I actually moved here. During this communication I established that I would only be here during the summer months and also that I have a boyfriend. He asked me at one point to guess his age. Based on the fact that he owns his own business, and his appearance I guessed 38. He told me that he was 31 (I found this was untrue last night using google). 

The day we met (the day that I moved to the new city) I was entirely charmed by him. We walked around the city and he showed me his business, and after this we went to his place. We began to kiss and cuddle, and while this was happening he poured on the sweet talk (you're beautiful, I want you to be mine, etc). While I didn't mind it, it seemed to me that there was some type of disconnect. At one point I said, you remember that I have a boyfriend correct? He responded by saying that he had put it to the back of his mind and did not want to talk about it. He also did not remember that I would not be staying in the city permanently. While I thought these things were odd, I didn't think all that much of it. We then went out to dinner, and had sex later. 

We hung out (not just for sex, but meals, movies, walks etc.) everyday and we continued to become infatuated with one another. About a week after we first met, he texts me saying that he believes strongly in monogamy, and I tell him that we should have a conversation in person about this topic. When this conversation happens over dinner a few days later we essentially agree that we were looking for different things and that it would be best to stop or slow down. He told me that he could not stand to think about sharing me and that he did not want to know anything about my relationship with my boyfriend. He also said that his last breakup two years ago was still messing with him but didn’t go into detail. It was established that we needed some space, and that he would think about the whole thing. To be honest I was pretty devastated that the conversation went poorly. We continue to communicate over the following days via text, and eventually he invites me over to meet his friend and watch a movie, during which we begin to kiss and cuddle. We didn't really ever continue our discussion, it sort of just picked up where we had left off.

We spent another great day together walking around, shopping, eating and having sex this past weekend. When we have sex, he tries to convince me to have sex without a condom. Latex apparently irritates his privates, makes him lose his hardon, etc. I have always refused to have sex without a condom, and he has whined that I don't trust him (clearly I shouldn’t), that it would be so hot, that there's no need to worry because we're both clean, etc. This past weekend I slept over and when we woke up, we started dry humping, naked, without a condom. That's fine in general, but he was clearly trying to get it in there so I stopped him (we had to go also) and he casually joked that he would rape me. It was clearly uncalled for, but I didn't really respond to it and we just got dressed and left. 

That was the last time I saw him. Last night I googled his name and found out his real age is 46, not 31. Clearly I was beyond stupid to believe that, though I did have suspicions. 

I also found a blog post from 2011 by someone who was allegedly assaulted by Troy. I'm sure it's about him as it specifically mentions his business. The entire blog is a really dramatized diary of this gay guy. They were apparently at the same bar (they were intoxicated) when Troy overheard this guy speaking badly about him. Troy apparently shoved/punched him and gave him a bloody lip (unprovoked other than the shit talking allegation) and left the bar shortly after. Later in the post it shows a conversation they have over the internet on a gay hookup site. Troy was defensive in the conversation and admitted to doing it but didn't apologize.

**Conclusion:**

I’m really concerned about how to handle this. I’m guessing everyone will advise me to go no contact, though I feel this could provoke him the most. The possibility of him trying to (and easily succeeding in) stalking or finding me scares me a lot, and I’d prefer that if it needs to it would end more smoothly on what he thinks is a good note. What do I do or say? I would not really feel comfortable involving the police unless he actually threatens me.

38b8or,2,2015-06-02,Ferocious Feline Fells a Friend? Fffuuuuuu...,kidsweekend,clovetree,https://www.reddit.com/r/clovetree/comments/38b8or/ferocious_feline_fells_a_friend_fffuuuuuu/,"In search of adventure, Barry, Gruul, Orange, Thrrak, and the intern Appie decide to revisit the old Dwarven Temple of Courage, which is located a quarter-day south of the Halfling fort where they had been staying. It has been several months since Gruul and Thrrak had last explored the terrible catacombs underneath the abandoned tower and were touched by its sinister power.

Appie's mother (may she rest in peace) told her that Duergar were known to lurk below the tower and Orange's description of them matches what Gruul and Thrrak remember about the creatures they fought there.

As they travel to the place they come across a deep ravine and notice that goblin-like creatures have made camp on the other side, though only two remain. The party hatches a plan that involves using Appie as bait to try and lure them across the ravine while the other adventurers ambush them at the bottom. The plan works! However, the party does not notice the Tiger lurking near the bottom of the vale and Orange is brutally attacked.

Despite the best efforts of his friends, Orange is torn apart by the Tiger and is killed. They quickly dispatch the goblin-like creatures and the Tiger too, but begin to realize the awful truth. Appie becomes hysterical and Thrrak delivers a funeral sermon. Yet as they prepare to say a final goodbye to their friend, Barry--in a truly selfless act-- calls upon the gods to cash in a boon.

Using an awesome and mysterious power granted to him by the gods for having drawn from the Deck of Many Things, he recalls the name of a powerful Oracle who is said to live on the island and compels her to cast True Resurrection on his friend, saving him from permanent death. Barry is concerned because he knows that the Oracle--an old woman named Marble Blackmyre--will remember this day, but his friend is returned to life and they soldier on to the derelict temple. 

Gruul notices tracks from several days ago that go down into the catacombs and after spending a night in preparation, they descend into them. Gruul immediately confronts a group of Duergar and intimidates them into submission. The party kills all but one of the creatures, who suddenly becomes invisible and escapes down a well trap that Gruul and Thrrak remember from their previous adventure. They follow the fleeing Duergar down the trap and into a cavern of icy water. Orange sets a nest of Dire Rats near the shore into flames before the party decides to wait for reinforcements.

Thrrak turns Orange into a gaseous cloud so that he can float up and out of the cavern, return to the Halfling fort, and retrieve their friends Osmen and Telmah. Together, they plan to journey further into the catacombs and confront the dark menace that had once cursed them many moons ago..."
38b9s2,4,2015-06-02,[F20] Need advice on maintaining a long distance relationship with my boyfriend [M24].,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/38b9s2/f20_need_advice_on_maintaining_a_long_distance/,"He lives in California and I live in DC, we met in the mid-west for university. Our relationship recently became long distance due to his internship and plans for getting his master's degree over there. I'm going to see him sometime next month for a few days when I have time away from my job. It seems like he and I will be in a LDR for quite a while, so I wanted seek some advice from you guys. 

What's the best way to deal with a LDR? Yesterday was the first time that the silence really hit me and we've been apart for only a month already. Not in a way that's lonely, but in a way where my mind was playing tricks with me. Just the typical insecurities and worries about how things may work out. What's the best way to prevent such things?

38bns7,2,2015-06-03,[Product Review/Suggestion] For the guys and maybe the girls I found a body trimmer that some might find useful.,notaswedishchef,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/38bns7/product_reviewsuggestion_for_the_guys_and_maybe/,"Hey guys, just 2 disclaimers

I hope I'm not breaking any rules and I hope people find this useful, that's all I aim for in this post. 
 I am not a coporate shill, I'm not getting paid, nor will I ever get paid for this. Hell I can't even get my internship to pay me (heyooooo).

Also many people swear by straight edge razors versus the mass produced razors that companies throw at men. Cool, I respect that


I'm just about finishing my internship, same with my gf. We have been seperated for months and I grabbed us a hotel and will finally see each other in 4 days, we have all these things planned and we both can't wait. So today I was at the store grabbing mini bottles to put body wash and crap in for the plane. I found [this](http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Fusion-Proglide-Groomer-Trimmer/dp/B0062IWQVU/ref=sr_1_6?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433302192&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=gillette+fusion+proglide) and for those that don't want to follow the link it is a personal body groomer with an attachment for razor blades to shave with. I picked it up to check it out as an easy way to shave the Johnson and the boys and then throw on a razor and shave. I have owned one other hair trimmer, that said I could only once bring myself to bring something big and metal close to my junk, plus I needed to buy a bunch of different size combs with it and that seemed like work going to sally's or ordering from online. This proglide styler I figured would be a nice ""cheap"" way to keep myself all trimmed without investing in a whole new product that needed special batteries or a cord. 

So how well does it work? Well it's powered by 1 AA battery, that comes with it. It's a hair trimmer that is a bit smaller and doesn't need a cord or charging. It's maybe about an inch across and a bit shorter than a hand. It's a nice fit in the hand with good grip all over and a sleek design. The product comes with 3 combs, long med and short. Long is maybe a quarter inch med being 1/8 and short being pretty much stub if not gone. It's not sharp but it does cut hair. It also comes with what is basically an extension and a razor blade to attach there. It also comes with a cool base that holds the 3 combs and extension in it. 

How it did? Actually pretty great, It cut short where it needed to, didn't nick the skin and did it's job quickly. Now for down there it did a great clean up job, around the main attraction it did it's job quick and painless, no catches no cuts nothing. For the boys, it trimmed up but I've gotten closer. I was a bit more hesitant here since there's a bit more skin and easier time fucking up. 

As for shaving? It's not the best shave I've had, it works and didn't cut me. I didn't get any ball hair in my mouth or on my face. Cleaning it was a bit finicky. You push back on the styler blades and the black part pops up and you run water under it. It wasn't clearing so I pushed the black part back farther and heard a click then put it back together and it wouldn't start. I gave it a minute and it works just fine now, be wary when cleaning it. 

All in all this was a good tool, I can keep my bathroom from overflowing with single purpose items. I spent maybe 22 bucks to consistently keep myself groomed. Hell I may give it to my girlfriend to help shave the back of my neck. This is a nice way to groom down stairs without people seeing it in the bathroom and thinking of that immediately. It's from a big company so easy to break and replace parts or the whole thing and it's well made. If you have any questions let me know, I can't talk for long term maintenance or reliability or battery life. If your interested in that pm me and I'll get back to you in the future. "
38btng,1,2015-06-03,Summer Internship -- Need Help Not Withholding Too Much,domn1995,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/38btng/summer_internship_need_help_not_withholding_too/,"I'm a 19 year-old dependent student from Idaho in the following financial situation:

I worked a TA job for my university for the last (Spring) semester and earned $2043.79 after $154.35 paid towards federal income tax and $53.00 paid towards state income tax. I claimed 0 allowances.   

This summer I will be working an full time making approximately $1,635.20 every 2 weeks before taxes for 3 months (until school starts again), when I will go down to working around 10 hours per week and make approximately $368.00 before taxes every 2 weeks.

As such, I predict that my income for 2015 will be the following:


  * $2,251.14 from my TA Job
  * +
  * $9,811.20 3 months full time 
  * +
  * $3,312 4.5 months part time 
  * --------------------------------------
  * $15,374.30 2015 Gross Income
  * -
  * $6,300.00 Standard Deduction (can i claim this as dependent?)
  * -------------------------------------
  * **$9074.34 Taxable Income**

If I have done the math correctly, and if I can claim the standard deduction as a dependent, then $9074.34 will be my taxable income for 2015.

Falling in the 10% tax bracket, this would make me owe around $907.43 in federal income tax.

I have already paid $154.35 towards federal income tax from my TA job, and around $287 from my first paycheck from my internship (not including FICA and state income tax), adding up to $441,35. I didn't claim any allowances because I was afraid of not withholding enough, but I have come to believe that may have been a mistake. 

If I don't change my allowances, I think I will end up paying around $2,000 in federal income tax this year ($287 per paycheck during the summer), considering that I will probably pay around the same as my TA job per paycheck towards feral income tax -- $21.97.

In turn, am I correct to deduce that I should adjust my allowances in my W-4 to try to reach around $900-1000 in federal income tax paid that is paid evenly between my paychecks? Something like $33 per paycheck for the next 6 months for a total of around $400?

Am I on the right track with this math, or completely crazy?

I know this may be a confusing question, because even I am confused by it all. Please don't hesitate to ask for clarification, and as always, thanks for the help!

38dh7s,7,2015-06-03,Contemplating backing out of my match... would I regret it forever?!,omgcantdecide,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/38dh7s/contemplating_backing_out_of_my_match_would_i/,"Hi all. I'm 25. I went to a very expensive college for dietetics (read: student loans)  I got rejected from matches 2 years in a row (due to not having any clinical experience at the time), and I FINALLY got a match this year after going to conferences, getting work experience in a hospital as a dietetic tech, taking graduate courses, doing self-guided research and learning about dietetics, etc.  It was my last choice match and I don't really like the program, but hell. It's a match.

However... I'm having serious cold feet. Tuition ($8k) is due June 15th. I'd have to quit my job, leave my amazing apartment and move back in with my parents for a year, and take out another loan to cover the tuition.

Reasons I'm considering doing the internship:

* I've literally spent the last 7 years of my life working towards getting a match before having a major change of heart in the last 3 months or so; maybe this is just temporary insanity and cold feet?? It seems crazy and heartbreaking to give up now after so much of my life working towards it

* I've always wanted to be a dietitian and I'm enthusiastic about helping people eat beetter

* Family would probably throw me in an asylum if I rejected it haha

* will get me the RD which will allow me to practice legally and open up job opportunities

* if I decline it now, I figure I'll be basically throwing away my opportunity for an RD forever, since my DPD is going to expire and I'll be pretty much blacklisted for declining a match anyway, and I'm just not sure I'm ready to commit to never being an RD

* There is some valuable knowledge and experience to be gained from the internship

Pros for not going through with the match: 

* I'm still passionate about nutrition but in the last 3 years of research, I've personally decided that the evidence points toward a mostly-plant-based, unprocessed diet.  I think a lot of the dietary guidelines are total crap (3-4 servings of dairy a day?? Way too much meat and grains and crappy margarines, not based on science but based on $$$$ from corporations)

* I have some serious issues with the AND (see above) and I'm not sure I want to give them my money 

* I truly feel well-informed on dietetics and patient counseling from my BS in Dietetics and my 3 years working at the hospital, I've read literally thousands and thousands of books and research articles, I don't think an internship would teach me much more that I need to know, since I don't intend to work in a clinical setting again

* I would have ethical issues having to advise patients to eat more of foods that I truly believe are harmful. I've started doing the summer homework and for so many of the questions, I know the answer I would give is completely different than the answer they expect me to give. 

* I've actually gotten the travel bug, have issues with the USA, and have family in other countries. Lately I have been seriously considering moving out of the country entirely, which would make an RD pretty pointless

* I have never planned on having a 9-to-5 work-for-an-employer job; I've always intended to be an entrepreneur and/or find my own clients to work with, so the lack of jobs from not having an RD isn't a huge issue

* There seem to be thousands of people making plenty of money advising people on shit like the paleo diet, various shakes and gimmicks, ""health coaches,"" ""wellness coaches,"" etc.  If these uneducated snake oil salesmen can do it, then why shouldn't I be able to do it? I truly consider myself very well-informed on the topic of nutrition and always try to use critical thinking and the best evidence-based theories and I'm open-minded to changing my opinions when new research comes out. Would having an RD *really* make me that much more appealing to the average uninformed person of the public who wants to lose weight or get healthier? In an ideal world, I should've spent the last year trying to get clients and see if its a viable source of income, but I didn't and I can't change that now.  I've read all the laws about who is allowed to give what advice legally, and it seems that I would be in the clear as long as I don't label myself a dietitian or give medical advice. I've also worked as a chef in the past and I'm a certified personal trainer, so I could see myself in the niche market of a health coach type thing, giving exercise advice, cooking advice, and general nutrition advice. I could buy liability insurance.

* I'm worried that 10-15 years down the line, once the RD requires an MS, I'll be looked at less competitively for jobs anyway even if I do have an RD

* This is slightly off topic, but I make decent side income with online blogging and I would love to get into rental real estate as an alternate form of income in the future, so I don't rely on nutrition as a means of supporting myself, and I would like to eventually get married to somebody who has a job and be a stay-at-home-mom kids ... but I also know I can't rely on that as a form of income, who knows if/when it could happen. But it seems pointless to get an RD if I could theoretically be not working in 5-10 years... maybe.. But maybe I'm overly optimistic.  Who knows, I could never have kids, and maybe in a decade I'm really going to want a solid RD career

* skipping the internship would save me a lot of money, allow me to keep my apartment, and save me from having to move back in with my parents which would be miserable

Ugh. Anybody have some advice? 

Am I making a logical decision here, and it's perfectly possible to get by without an RD? 

Or am I batshit insane for even considering declining a match and I'd regret it forever? 

So many things are up in the air and undecided... I could see my life going like 100 different ways, some of which would need an RD and some of which wouldn't... I need a crystal ball! Sigh.

Thanks in advance! I know this is my decision to make in the end, but all responses and advice, no matter how critical, would be appreciated!"

I have been learning java as an intern at a software firm for a bit less than two weeks now. The guy teaching me is pretty busy, but told me to write a simple command line calculator yesterday. This is what I came up with:
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4ea9c012fc3fc2b81172

Now he has asked me to improve it so it will accept more than 2 entries at once (for example: 2+4*1/56) and I am at a complete loss for some reason :( A hint of his was ""use arrays"" and he mentioned trees, but said that that was more oop focussed and I should concentrate on the programm itself for now.

My question is less ""How do I do this"", although input is appreciated. The real question is ""if I fail at this, is it likely that I am not good at coding, or is this more of a knowledge problem?"" I'm getting pretty discouraged, especially when I compare this to how easy javascript was to use (which I was dabbling in before this dev offered to teach me java).

Thanks in advance for any responses :)"

38e4ue,74,2015-06-03,We Need Model Legislation,KahnsSermon,electronic_cigarette,https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/38e4ue/we_need_model_legislation/,"Vaping is going to be regulated at the State, Local, and Federal levels. That battle was over before it started. 

Right now it seems most groups are reacting, trying to rally support to defeat or carve out exemption in proposed legislation. This has a lot of strategic disadvantages. Often legislation moves fast so you have to react quickly, defensively. Legislatures are lazy and don't like to change things or rewrite legislation so it usually takes a good amount of outside pressure to get them to move. Most importantly it puts us in the position of opposing ""tobacco"" regulations, which makes it easy to portray us negatively in the media. It's generally a weaker position to argue from. 

We need to *propose* regulation. Model legislation is used by most industry and public interest groups, and quite a bit of law in general comes from some proposed model. (especially from industry, Tobacco, Coal, Labor, Ag, Telecoms, and lots of other big industries basically write a lot of their own regulations) An industry group or private body crafts legislation and regulatory guidelines that they support then tries to get a Legislator to sponsor that bill. If needed then rally public support to see the bill through. 

Once the Model is written, anyone can take the bill, modify for local considerations if needed and try to get a legislator to sponsor it. This is a big advantage if you are dealing with local / county / state regulations, make it easy for anyone to take up the fight. 

Lots of advantages to this. Legislators are lazy, writing the bill for them saves them / their office a lot of time and effort (not a lot of legislators actually write anything themselves, the interns / backoffice / policy institute people do that) just give them a fully written bill that makes them look good, or has support and/or money behind it, make it easy for them. It's normal, pol's are used to working with industry. It puts the other camp on defence. You call the proposed bill something catchy like ""The Keeping Children Safe Act"" or just vaguely Orwellian like ""The Tobacco Products Control Act"", what kind of monster opposes The Keeping Children Safe Act? 

Of course any bill would have to be sellable. Anything that would pass any legislature would have to seem like it's cracking down on the vaping industry. No sales to under 18's, no marketing to children, no vaping in restaurants, etc. Your local politician has to be able to stand up at a town hall meeting and claim victory. But the bill you push has all the exemptions you would want already carved out; sampling in stores, vaping only lounges, flavours are ok, stuff like that.  It's easy then to portray us as reasonable / responsible. ""hey, we are doing our best to work with the legislature to keep the kids safe"" 

We are not going to dodge regulation, everything's regulated. This is a widely used strategy for staying on top of it that seems to be missing from the fight to keep vaping (reasonably) safe (please correct me if I'm wrong). 

So that's my pitch. 

P.S. If anyone is going to put out youtube PR videos, it needs to feature relatable folk. Moms and Dads, middle age professional ladies, smiling grandparents, that sort of shit. The fear machine is in motion against us, this is largely a media battle.

38e80z,143,2015-06-03,Me [28 M] with my GF [25 M/F] of 3 months told me she is pregnant with her ex's kid.,throwayyyxyz123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38e80z/me_28_m_with_my_gf_25_mf_of_3_months_told_me_she/,"First time posting, throwaway account for many reasons.

I'm not even sure where to start but here I go. I've been dating this girl for a little over 2 months. She is awesome, great, and just a lovely individual. We are really compatible together and we have been pretty open about everything good and bad.

Before I met her she was seeing this other guy who is pretty ""famous"" in our industry. They hooked up for awhile and had unprotected sex all before we met. I knew all of these things already and as long as she was over him I was ok with everything.

Right now she is overseas working on an internship and she has been having really bad cramps every night. I suggested that she should go to the doctors over there and get checked out which she did. After a ultrasound and a urine test (administered by the doctor) she was informed that she was pregnant and based on the timeline of how far along the baby is - it's not mine.

She has said she doesn't want anything to do with her ex but at the same time she probably can't go through with an abortion. She's struggling with that decision right now and hasn't made a clear choice one way or the other. She said she needed some time to think and some time alone right now.

At the same one once she talked to her ex on the phone, she informed me that she is going to come back home from the internship (presumably to see him?). Being internationally and 14 hour time time difference from each other has made communication a little difficult during these times.

I really like this girl but at the same time:

- I totally understand we are still in our honeymoon phase. I haven't been seeing her that long and I have no idea if I am ready for a long term commitment like this.

- I can't even stand the thought of having her ex in my life which would definitely be the case if she kept the baby.

All this has happened a little fast and I'm having a hard time to think through everything. It's not really my place to tell her what to do and I'm not sure if I would want to stay or leave. Would really appreciate any advice especially from someone who has had a similar situation.

**tl;dr**:  Girlfriend is pregnant with her ex's child. Should I stay or leave?"

This may be a little long. But it's been on my mind for a while and I just need some where to vent:-/

Several months ago my husband got a job in a new state so we had to relocate, which meant I had to find a new job. 

Over the course of several weeks I put in several applications. One business called me in for an interview, so I drove two hours from where I lived to meet with them. That interview went very well and I wouldn't change a thing. Then they tell me I made it to the second round of interviews and they wanted me to meet with an occupational therapist to 'see if I would fit into their workplace.' Having never met with an occupational therapist before, I thought why not. And anyways I really liked the job. The people were nice and it would have been a nice change of pace for me. 

They took me out to dinner before I had to go to the therapist. During that meeting, I got a voicemail for another job interview with a different company. One of the managers there recognized the number and pulled me aside later that meeting to tell me I had the job, they've turned away other people, and that they were talking about paying me X amount of dollars bc of my qualifications, and not to worry about ur meeting with the therapist bc it was just a formality. Before I left to meet the therapist, another manager told me that out of all the candidates who applied, i stood out bc of my detailed cover letter, experience, etc... And he said he would really like it if I came to work for them and not to worry about the meeting with the therapist. He also told me they would contact me early that next week to give me a final answer. 

When I got to the therapist, that is where everything went down hill. I had to take like 20 different tests that asked me questions I didn't know the answers too and not to mention they were timed. (I should note that I'm diagnosed ADHD and have severe anxiety about timed tests. I was given extended time in high school and college whenever it came to exams). The interview was for a reporter position, so the fact I had to answer questions about long division really threw me. Math has never been my best subject and I can't remember the last time I have had to use long division. Other tests were a mix of something to the effect of 'an apple is to a banana, like a car is to _______' and 'if such and such problem arises in the work place, how would you handle it?'

I was honest on one part of the test where It asked me to fill in the blank for 'never ask me ____________.' I put 'why I over analyze', which in retrospect may have not been the best answer, but at time I thought it might have been OK bc I was honest about how I tend to over analyze in my job interview and that it was something I'm continually working on. 

I was already nervous bc I was applying for jobs in a state I had never lived in before. I was comfortable at my last job and was very confident, as I had been there for several years. So leaving that was very hard for me. So I was trying really hard to say and do the right things at this new interview and the meeting with the therapist. 

Well the therapist was very rude and basically wanted me to tell him my life story, which I was not going to do. I didn't think it was appropriate to tell him that I get anxious in certain situations, that I was nervous in that meeting so i got awkward and didn't know what to say, that I had just wrecked my car bc it slid in the snow, that I just got diagnosed with MRSA and was taking antibiotics and felt like complete and utter shit. For one it didn't feel appropriate. And two, how am I supposed to remember exactly what my intern editor said about me in summer 2008 or what exactly was on my performance review three years ago?

I got more and more nervous everytime he shook his head and wrote something down in his notes. I felt awkward the entire time and I felt like he could sense it too. I got flustered, stumbled over my answers and was all in all, just not doing well. 

I left the meeting feeling really uneasy. I knew it didn't go well. But I thought everything was OK bc of what one of the managers told me-- that I basically had the job.

Well an entire week passed and I heard nothing from them, even though they said they would call me early that week. So I built up the courage to call them, which took a lot for me. One of the lower managers was the first one to pick up his phone and said 'well it looks like your meeting with (therapist) didn't go well. What happened?!'... I didn't know what to say, so i said 'I was nervous.'

Not 10 minutes later the higher up manager calls me and gives me a spill of '(therapist) had some
Concerns about you and after some internal discussion, we've decided to go with someone else... If you were under the impression that you had the job, than i sincerely apologize.... We're continuing to adjust things here; so i would encourage you to apply again in the future. ... Hey we even live in the same area, so might see you around town.'

It was hard to hold back the tears as I heard that. So the minute he stopped I awkwardly said 'thank u. I appreciate it.' And that was that. 

What really stung most of all, was not that I didn't get the job (which now im thankful that I didnt)... It's that i was lead to believe i had it. Don't tell me I have It and you've turned away other people bc u all decided to choose me.!it upset me That I got a call on a Wednesday asking me to meet with the therapist on Friday, even though at that time I still lived two hours away. So I had to drop what I was doing, ask off work even though i had already put in my notice, and drive up there... If me getting the job was so contingent on this therapist's recommendation, I wish they would have told me....I feel like I wasted my time.

Also it made me wonder, what the hell is wrong with me? I had a lot of experience, clips and im a good employee. So what about myself did random guy think was so concerning. I just got flustered in the meeting. 

It's been several months since this has occurred and it feels like it's constantly in the back of my head. Everytime I hear the word 'concern' that phone call seems to replay in my head. It has affected my happiness and my over all confidence. 

I just wish I could be like those people who can just compartmentalize and move on.

We wrote a song we were all really proud of and are getting ready to record in July. The guitarist sent it to a buddy who interns at a studio in Cali. 

The guitarist sends it over to his buddy. The guitarist's buddy added some effects and different sounds but used our riffs note for note. It turned out really well and even though it was just a scratch track everyone loved it. 

Today we are contacted by his friend. His friend was excited because he did a damn good job making it sound full and different, so he showed his boss - after all, he is looking to get a job there hopefully. 

This *fucking guy* **stole** our track. Literally note for note, only taking out a prechorus and chorus. It's 100% our song, we wrote it. I'm fucking *livid* right now.

I need to know what we can do. He gave it to another band that he is producing for. We don't want to fuck over the guitarist's friend and end up getting him fired, but *fuck.* We put so many hours into that song and even had guest vocals from our favorite band in it. We already paid the guy for guest vocals. Everything was ready, we were off to record in July.

We asked the friend about copyright shit, and apparently according to him, there's no ""automatic copyright"" even though we have proof the guitarist wrote the song via email. He said that the studio had a copyright license and now it's their song essentially and we could be in a legal issue if we continue to go and record **our fucking song.**

What can we do here? We're fucking lost, guys. I feel so defeated. It wasn't the friend's fault, and I know he feels bad... but **fuck.** HELP."
38eiuy,182,2015-06-03,Me [25F] accidentally read some text messages between my boyfriend [26M] and a girl he likes.,sitting_on_a_dream,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38eiuy/me_25f_accidentally_read_some_text_messages/,"(Throwaway account since I know he reads reddit)

First of all, I'm going to preface this with the fact that I KNOW reading another person's text messages is a huge invasion of privacy. We already talked about that and he's forgiven me. I feel terrible about it. 

Now for the issue. I have been dating my boyfriend ""Brian"" for over 2 years now and it's been great. We've gone through our own share of hardships but have always come out stronger, or with a new understanding of each other. Before we started dating, Brian had a massive crush on one of his inner-circle friends named ""Eva"" for well over a year. She's never reciprocated, but I think she's the type of person who likes to flirt back for attention. 

Approximately 2 weeks ago, I was sitting in bed with Brian's laptop getting ready to skype my family in Asia. I knew from the time when we had done long distance, his microphone sometimes doesn't work - so I went to click on ""Echo sound test"" just to make sure I had everything ready to go before I start the call. By accident, I clicked on ""Eva"" instead of ""Echo"" and instead of immediately clicking away like I intended, my eyes got caught on some messages between them. It listed things like...


B: ""Happy Valentines Day! I was thinking about you a little last night ;) Hope you're having a good day. I Love you!""

E: ""I love you too!""


or


E: ""Hey crotch face!""

B: ""I bet you wish my face was in your crotch""

E: "" gross""

B: "" Don't say that, I'm actually very good at oral ;)""

E:""Gross lol""

B:""I really miss you, can I hang out with you when I get back?""

E:""You will be busy hanging with your woman""

B:""No way, you're my number one priority""

etc....


Now, normally these messages wouldn't bother me. I mean, people get flirty with their opposite-gender friends quite often, right? I mean, I've been known to be flirty myself - albeit without any sexual innuendos or saying any 'I love you's.
But the thing was - during the time he sent these we were abroad in Sweden - just the two of us living on our own. I had accepted a 10 month internship and worked 50 hours a week. He came with me so we could be together, but he couldn't find a job and would just hang around our apartment all day. He also got sick, depressed and really bitter, mostly because he was home-stuck in a foreign country for 2 months. I can't blame him for wanting to go home, but it got to the point that the only time I ever saw him happy was when he was making plans back in Canada where we're from. 

After those 2 months he decided to go back home and we would do long distance for the remainder of my internship. When he got back to Canada, the first few weeks he barely talked to me - which really hurt because I had spent so much of the first two months trying to make him happy and showing how grateful I was for him trying to support me. I would message him ""Hey, I'm really lonely, do you want to skype?"" and I wouldn't hear back for days. On facebook, I saw that him and Eva were hanging out, going to bars, museums etc. There was a big evening campfire event that happened over the summer and some of my own friends messaged me saying ""Did you and Brian break up? He's being really flirty with this other girl"".

Now that we're both back in the same country and have brought our relationship back up to speed after doing long distance - I can't help but get that nagging feeling that he's not over Eva. We talked about it, but all I ever seem to get out of him is ""I'm sorry, I don't like her I promise!"", but by the way he talks about her, or prioritizes her over his other friends I feel its a different story. 

One of my best friends is actually dating Eva's sister, and has told me that sometimes even Eva finds it uncomfortable how Brian only wants to hangout with her when I'm busy and how she sometimes feels like a ""surrogate girlfriend"".

Now, I've been cheated on in the past, so I know I have some insecurities that might make me blow things out of proportion, but I can't help but think he's lying to me when he says he's not into her anymore. We've been dating for 2 years, but then that would mean he's liked her for 3 years. Do you think someone can just get over a major crush on a close friend without ever wanting to know what it would have been like? I mean, she's absolutely gorgeous and funny. I just feel so inadequate.

I'm sorry internet strangers for the long novel. I know my dilemna is almost nothing compared to some of the stories I read on r/relationships, but even just some validation that I am/am not going crazy would be helpful. Am I blowing things out of proportion?

  
**tl;dr**: I accidentally ready some of my boyfriends messages to a girl he used to like. I don't think he's over her after all these years and it's eating me up inside.

She was studying abroad in Austin when I met her ( I was a student as well). We broke up about a year ago because she found out I was different than what she thought. At that moment in my life, I wasn’t happy, and it showed. I was less active, I was a bit dirtier, the relationship seemed one sided. Long story short, she broke up with me and after about 2 months, she decided to stop talking. Fast forward about 2 months and we get into an argument. I send her a message while drunk and I kinda insulted her when I was just trying to lay down some truths. She got pissed but eventually understood what I meant and recovered. We talked on and off every other week and then one day she got assaulted. She messaged me and she even said she did not know why, but I made sure to be there for her as a friend and support her. The talking increased to twice a week, and then more and more until it became an every day thing. I have been improving myself little by little, (before for her, and then I eventually realized that that was the wrong idea, and I should be improving myself for me; the future is not certain and if I don’t end up with her, then at least my health and my happiness will not suffer). She has always said “if it’s meant to be, it is meant to be”. Well, she was able to find an internship and a sponsor here in the US and she gets here on Friday! I am ecstatic but at the same time very nervous and scared. She wants to take things slow, which I completely understand, but I don’t know how to handle this or how I should be. I want to spend time with her when I can (havent seen her in a year) but I don’t want to be needy and I want to know that she needs me as well. I’ve changed for myself and of course, in part, for her, but she hasn’t done much (aside from being more understanding and letting things go), which I value just as much, but I feel like she has all the power to make or break. Do any of y’all have any advice for me? Things to do and not to do, to look for? She has said previously that she still has feelings for me, although that was a while back, but the talking only increased, so I believe it safe to say that the feelings still remain, just not like they were before.

The office's appellate briefs are all in docx or pdf format on a shared drive in the office domain. The assigning attorney would ideally like some sort of searchable database where you could locate briefs primarily by issue (Waiver, Ineffective assistance of counsel, etc), and then by sub-issue (Waiver - Post conviction), and then of course by Attorney's name, docket number and all of the obvious issues.

I have a good bit of IT experience from before law school, but databases are not my strong suit. For now, I've established a google spreadsheet with all of the file names, and have established categories for attorney name, case name, issue 1, issue 2, issue 3, etc., and now me and the other interns are going through every single brief and tagging different issues that we see. But I don't know where to go from there, or if that is even the right approach. I'm thinking of asking a couple of my programmer friends if they could teach me the basics of SQL Server or something similar, but this is such a huge project that I don't think anyone outside the intern pool would be willing to do it. 

Has anyone had any experience building an in-house brief bank? If so, how did you do it/What software did you use/how did make the work more efficient? Thanks!"

I was in a very serious relationship from 21-23 (I'm 24, looking to date at 26) and want to try dating a guy when I finish school.

I'm getting an MS in a tech field and want to pick up hobbies like 3D modeling/editing, acrobatics, and read 2 books a month, not including the coding you do on your own time outside of school and work. I'm also going to try to work at an internship during the day as my classes are in the evening. I additionally want to volunteer with an organization benefiting children ~5 hours a week, but actually working with kids not more tech. I am really strict with scheduling so I'm not concerned this won't all get done.

I have a small group of friends I see 2-3 times a week I code or make art with. I feel like between school, my friends, and picking these things up that a relationship would suck time away from my hobbies.

I don't plan on having sex during this time because the only sex I've enjoyed has been in a relationship.

Even when I date the guy, I'm going to continue the hobbies, so I would need the guy to either give me space or spend time with me at home while I work on my computer. Though really I would only date someone with long term hobbies like me, so he might be at home anyway. I would also still be out a few times a week exercising and volunteering so the guy wouldn't see me every day either.

Will a guy think it's weird if I tell him I had no desire to have sex or date for two years? I want a long term relationship that would ideally culminate in a marriage (though not until at least my late twenties) and probably children. Is this break from dating a red flag for something undesirable?

38fgjw,6,2015-06-03,Questions about the CS program and if I should transfer?,Johnnyhoboy,UGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/38fgjw/questions_about_the_cs_program_and_if_i_should/,"Hey Dawgs!

I usually don't post on Reddit often, but I wanted more opinions on this matter other than from friends and family. So I will be an upcoming freshman in the fall with computer science as my major, and have been debating for a while if it was worth transferring to GA Tech or staying the 4 years at UGA. (Sadly, I did get rejected from Tech with decent scores)

A little background of myself. I'm an in state student from Duluth, GA. I LOVE the UGA campus, food and atmosphere at Athens, but I also don't mind living in the big city of ATL (although I would hate Tech food lol). I  understand that Tech's CS program is a lot tougher and I would have to give up some of my social life, but I would end up learning more. I've already read many posts related to this matter on Reddit and College Confidential, and have heard from multiple friends and alumni that GA Tech does have the better CS program overall (#9 vs #90 on US Weekly). However, I also have friends who have graduated from UGA with a BS in Comp Sci and have decent jobs at Microsoft and small companies in ATL. 

Ultimately, is it worth transferring to Tech? I can have all the credits necessary for transfer after one year. I just wanted some answers/opinions to these questions:

(1)My biggest concern is how many job placement/internship opportunities Tech has over UGA. If I stayed at UGA, would I be able to find decent amount of summer internships, and after graduating, a good chance at a job in a somewhat big name company?

(2) Is the average starting salary for comp sci majors considerably bigger at Tech than UGA? 

(3) And, for those who graduated from UGA in Comp Sci, where are you working now and have you considered transferring to Tech at any point?

Any help is appreciated! :D"
38fugi,1,2015-06-03,Bizarre dream where time kept resetting it self,Fat_Ass_Reddit,Dreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/38fugi/bizarre_dream_where_time_kept_resetting_it_self/,"**TL;DR - Evil old man and evil toddler came to my work. Toddler was trying to use my computer to summon demonic alien. Time kept resetting itself, same scenerio, different versions kept occuring. Eventually evil old man brought clones of the evil toddlers, overtook the office, and summoned said demonic alien.**

I've always had bizarre dreams and a good memory for them since I was a child, along with lots of sleep paralysis experiences (it's entertaining once you learn to control it). I don't usually write down my dreams since I'm pretty good at remembering them for a bit, but I feel like I should start now that I've been browsing this subreddit. I don't really talk about my dreams with many people that can relate to having such vivid memories of them but I've always wanted to. It's a few paragraphs so I hope it's not too long and it gets a few reads.

This last dream I had stuck out because it has such a strange context (although not really any stranger than other dreams many of you or myself have had)...

I'm at work, in my office (I work in IT). This elderly asian man and an asian toddler (maybe 2-3 years old) walks in. I get up to approach them. The toddler looks vaguely familiar, but I don't think much of it. The old man, wearing tan slacks and a polo shirt, has this vicious look on his face and mutters that the toddler needs to use my computer. Before I know, the toddler has ran to my computer desk and is typing away. I try to pull the child away from my desk but the old man grabs me with force to stop me. The man, looking even more wicked than before, tells me in a harsh tone to not get in the way. The child looks back at me, emoting the same sinister vibe of the old man. I keep trying to pull the toddler away but I struggle as the child resists and the old man keeps pulling me away. This is when it happens...

Everything happening stops. Literally, like a hard cut in a film. I'm back in my office, alone. Like time has reset itself. The old man and toddler are gone but something is different. I intrinsically know that they are going to come back and the situation is going to repeat it self. I'm aware time has reset itself and before I know it, here comes the man and the toddler through the door again, same scenario.

This time our department office setup is a bit different. The room dimensions are still the same but some furniture is moved around. We have 2 computer workstations out in the open part of the office for our interns. Those workstations are now on the opposite end of the room from were they are usually.

This time the toddler runs to one of our intern workstations and when I try to pull him off, the little fucker bites me! Then it hits me, I recognize him. He's my friend's child who I only know because of Instagram. My friend posts photos of their kid all the time. I've never met the kid or have spoken to my friend in a few years other than comments left on photos. Now, I don't know if it's because of this sudden realization that causes me to lose some focus, but the segue to next part of the dream is a little blurry.

I somehow figure out what the purpose is of the toddler typing on the computer. Another sudden realization. The old man and toddler are trying to summon a demonic alien into this world, and apparently they are going to open a portal that's accessible by typing some shit on a computer (I saw Kung Furry recently, so I'm assuming the ridiculous shit that hacker dude did influenced this. For those that haven't seen it, go watch it. It's an entertaining 30 minute film).

I then ""wake up"" in my room, like everything is normal but I still know it's going to happen again. This is where I'm unsure whether I was really awake or not. The same scenario happens a couple of times more but this time when it ends I keep waking up, laying in my bed, falling back asleep and repeating. I don't ever die, but time appears to be resetting itself every time I get to the part of the struggle of pulling the toddler off computer.

The interesting thing is time keeps resetting itself a few minutes further back each time, meaning that I realized I keep getting more time exponentially to prepare for these two demon summoners to arrive. This time I had enough time to shut the doors to our office before they showed but it's almost as if ""they knew"". I waited and listened for them to approach and heard their footsteps outside but this time the old man brought multiple clones of the toddler, about 15 or so, and they started banging on the doors, screaming in an eerie monotonous tone to let them in. My boss is in the office time time, but as soon as I realized a purple, vortex-like portal appears behind him and sucks him in. Fucking even more random. Like if something realized ""hey, he's not suppose to be there, let get rid of him.""

The last scenario before it ended seemed like it took the longest. I was on the first floor of my building, trying to gather other co-workers to come help me prepare for the arrival of the old man and toddler clones. I convinced a few people to come up to my office but it was too late. The door was left open and the toddler clones and old man were already inside summoning the demonic alien force. The toddler clones were typing away on every computer in the office. I ran as fast as I could, just knowing I was heading towards my car.

I was relive to finally wake up and got out of my bed immediately, even saying out loud ""I'm so fucking glad that is over.""

I told my girlfriend and she said it sounded like something straight out of a Dr. Who episode, which I though was hilarious.

Funny thing is the very next night, I was aware I was starting to dream the same scenario again but I was literally able to think ""nope!"" and woke up."

I arrived here in late April for a summer internship at a start-up. It turns out we weren't a very good match, which means my next few months will be very open. I'm trying my very best to get myself to daily events I find through Facebook in hopes of establishing friendship(s), but I'd like to exhaust every avenue for finding them, reddit included.

A little bit about me: I'm 21, a fourth-year university student majoring in Computer Science, minoring in French. I'm a small-circle-of-friends kind of guy; I have one very close friend back home, two a bit more distant, but apart from them it's just acquaintances. I'm very devoted to queer, feminist, and racial equality causes and have spent much of these last few years back home doing activist work. (I'd like very much to get involved with similar things here.) I'm a nerd who loves tech, but also language; sudden realisations that previously unlinked words in my mind have common etymology gets me as excited as unboxing my latest device. Late night talks with friends are some of my favourite things in the world; I'm infinitely happier waking up after having spent all night emotionally bonding through debate than rising at morning having bonded sexually. I don't speak French very well at all, but enjoy making a game out of finding the words to communicate existent in my present vocabulary (again, language nerd). Finding someone at my level (that of an early primary school student, perhaps) and amused by similar follies would be super.

As I stated, I have much free time, so it would be ideal to find someone who's similarly uncommitted. Excursions together at least a few times a week, dining at new restaurants, walking around new parks, spending nights together talking on the couch, etc., would be great. (In the interest of full disclosure, I'm searching for intimacy, yes, but emotional intimacy, not sexual; I'm an ardent supporter of the theory that attraction takes many forms, some of which couldn't be more distant from genitalia.)

Well, I think that's it for now. I'll edit later if I come to realise I've left out anything critical. Please, feel free to reply or inbox. I'm posting this on a Wednesday evening (3 June), and would love to grab drinks or a cup of coffee together anytime, be it to-night, to-morrow, or this week-end!

Thank you kindly,

38g9xa,55,2015-06-03,I [23 M] have wasted my life and now I'm paying for it,cvrdinbees,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38g9xa/i_23_m_have_wasted_my_life_and_now_im_paying_for/,"Sorry this is long but I'm just writing to get this out. I'm 23 and sitting in my childhood home and I've let insecurity and laziness run my life for so long. When I was in high school I lost a ton of weight, pretty girls started to take interest in me but I was always too nervous or scared to do anything, was totally afraid to take a chance and never made a move with any of them. And I know it was just hormones but everything felt fresh and new like spring, I was excited about life even if I was too afraid to make any sexual moves and I loved writing and I had a good group of friends and generally just felt good about my life. 

Then I went to college and it seems like all the confidence (or pseudo-confidence) I had built up just turned to mist. Suddenly I was scared again and frightened, and I ended up spending two years just being antagonistic and aggressive because I thought that's what confidence was but I just felt fucking miserable all the time. I also hated the school I was in because I went to a small Catholic high school and I went to a small Catholic college so I felt like I was on repeat and I wanted out. I almost tried to kill myself because I was just too upset and felt like I had nothing to live for, especially if college was supposed to be the best time of your life, I figured why stick around for the rest? I transferred schools after my sophomore year and I was even more miserable at my next school, it was like a nightmare. I hated my roommates and was stuck in off-campus housing so I had nowhere to go. I didn't go out and try to join clubs or anything because I was too upset and felt too sorry for myself to do anything about my situation. 

I coasted through and now I'm out. It's been a year and I just finished an internship in NYC but I have no motivation to do anything else. All of my friends took their college search seriously or more seriously than I did and they made lasting friendships and had good experience and have SO's and even if they're not all completely living the dream they just seem to have more motivation than I do.

I'm just not sure where to go from here. I want to be a writer but I have no inspiration and even though I write every day I don't care about any of the projects. I didn't take advantage of any of the opportunities I had an now they're gone. I don't want to live in my quiet suburb but it's like I don't care enough about my life to do anything about it. It's like I'm floating in a fucking sea of apathy. I don't think about killing myself but if I died I'd be fine. I feel as if I'm stuck in a cycle, and I know that if I never do anything about my insecurity and depression (I guess idk it's just general feelings of apathy and sometimes hopelessness, like extreme lethargy) I'll never live the life I want to live. I just keep reliving how I actually felt alive when I was a teenager and keep screaming at myself for all the time I wasted in college. I'm just very, very tired and I wouldn't mind sort of nodding off and never waking up. I feel like this is going to be my life for the rest of my life and that it's too late to experience  all the things i should have already experienced before turning 23-first love, traveling, making new friends (that I made before high school). I feel like I wasted my life and it's just going to be mediocrity from here on out-the same people and and the same bars and the same places. I just hate myself and the faults and weaknesses that both simultaneously blocked me in and brought me to this place. I feel like I'm done.

Sorry for the shitty grammar, rambling and repetition. Just had to let all this out.

EDIT: Wow, I really can't thank everyone enough who commented on this. I'm new here (as in I just started going on Reddit literally two and a half months ago) I didn't expect anyone to actually reach out, just figured I'd vent. It seems ridiculous but I guess I was too mired in myself to see any way out. Not sure if I'm even writing in a section where anyone can see this (no I don't know what I'm doing, yes I probably do need an adult) but I really want to thank everyone for their kind and thoughtful comments about this. Truly, everyone, thank you.  "
38gjbr,1,2015-06-03,Girlfriend [19/f] got a full time job which is causing problems for our relationship and I [18/M] need some advice.,bdawson130,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/38gjbr/girlfriend_19f_got_a_full_time_job_which_is/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for around seven months. Everything has been great and all with some problems but thats in every relationship. I have an internship where I currently work 8-4 for five days and a part time job where i work 12 hours. After the first two weeks of my internship it will reduce to 20 hours and my other job will be bumped up to 20 hours. She just got a job where she works 4-12 m-f. So as you can see we work quite the opposite schedules. She originally had a job where she worked mornings for around 30 hours a week but quit to work at her new place. She lives with her dad and i live with my family, we both are home from college and live within 30 minutes. 

So my problem about all of this is that I dont want to only be able to see her for a couple hours on the weekend. What happens if something comes up then i dont see her for 2+ weeks. I know this may not seem like a big deal to some but im a pretty affectionate guy who needs some time to spend with my SO. She will be working full time during school as well so that makes it even worse. 

Her reason for taking this job is because she doesn't want to have any loans when she exits college and wants a fall back plan. I keep telling her that she gets to be young only once in her life and now should be the time to take full advantage. She isnt buying any of it. I dont want to have to threaten to leave because i dont think thats really fair. Preferably advice where I dont leave her because I really do love this girl and would like things to work out. 

Anyways any advice is welcome and there is lots more detail that ive let out so just ask me questions ill answer them. "
38gp2z,2,2015-06-03,How can we [20F/21M] spice up our relationship? He says it's boring...,throwaway_041212,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38gp2z/how_can_we_20f21m_spice_up_our_relationship_he/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for over 3 years now, and things are going well. We've talked about marriage in the future (not anytime soon of course, but we see a shared future together). Sex is good, this post isn't about our sex life lol. One big difference between us is that he is so adventurous and always wants to go out and do something, while I am one to choose to stay home and do my homework. Of course, when I DON'T have school priorities, I love exploring new hobbies and places. 

Anyway, today we were just hanging out at his place after I got out of class, and I noticed something was a little off about him. I asked him if he was happy in our relationship. I'm not sure why, but sometimes, I just have these weird feelings (call it intuition if you want) that he's not as into us sometimes as his usual self, so I'll ask him to make sure something isn't bothering him. He told me that yes he was happy. Then he got quiet and weird and after a LOT of pressing and asking, he finally asked me if I thought our relationship was ""fun.""

I asked him to clarify and he said that he feels like we do the same things all the time and that we don't really do anything new. Like I said, he is the adventurous type and loves to try new things. I am too, just not as much as he is, mostly because school and work are my main priorities, so for me, fun comes last often. 

I asked him what he would like to do because we live in a small town, so there aren't very many options for activities. Plus, we are both full time students, so money is tight. I only have a part-time job, and he just started a full-time internship that will only last for the summer, and we are both trying to pay for school. I pointed out this financial problem to him, and he just said to forget about the money (?!?). This started a different discussion about how I care too much about money--he thinks taking out loans for school isn't that big of a deal because I will be able to pay it off when I start working--I say I can't just spend all of my money now and expect to have a good paying job in the future. Then he says he doesn't mean that we have to go out and do something extravagant. I again ask him what he has in mind because I'm all for doing something new with him, it's just that nothing comes to mind and I'm honestly short on time often because of school...but he doesn't even know what he wants to do -______-. 

He mentions then that he wants to go on a road trip (really...this costs so much money...). I say I don't have money. He says we can just get a hotel and hangout and drink in the big city nearby, just spending time together someplace else other than our homes. He also pointed out that he thinks it's not just our relationship that he feels bored in. He said his two best friends rarely want to do anything anymore either besides chill at home and smoke hookah. So I pointed out to him that we are all growing up and have different priorities. But to him, growing up is the exact reason we need to all go out. I see his point of view, but at the same time, I feel like he has a hard time keeping in mind the REAL priorities. 

I really am SO for trying something new with him. I think that it's healthy to constantly change up your relationship here and there! My only problem is that neither of us really have money to spend, and I have so little time for myself/him outside of working/school (school 5 days a week, work all weekend). He asked me to take off work for one weekend to spend it with him, but I just can't...I can't afford to NOT make money one weekend to spend money that I do not have...

Also another thing to mention is that he feels like I don't give him enough of my time. But I honestly can't! I'm literally at school all day, I come home and have to study for the rest of the night, and then I work on the weekends. And during the regular school year, we go to different schools, so it's even harder. I feel like, though, when I DO have a day off or the littlest free time, I spend it with him /:

My question is what are some cheap, affordable activities that we can do together? What other ways are there to spice up our relationship? We planned a day trip to a state park (we like hiking together and exploring nature) since I have the day off, so I'm not sure why he's complaining now ):

There are 2 parking garages, both on 13th and Main: - If you arrive before Noon, the H&amp;R Block Garage will be closed, so use the Cosentino's/OneLife garage. Prime floor is 3rd floor, same as Main Street level. - Otherwise use the H&amp;R Block garage. All floors are deeper than Main Street level, but there's a patron elevator toward the south wall you can use to quickly get back up.

Regardless of which garage you end up in, GET YOUR PARKING VALIDATED or you'll be charged when you leave. The first thing you should do when you walk inside Alamo is hand the parking pass you took to get into the garage to the box office to get it validated.

STAFF: Brett Alan Cooker is our main man if you have questions about anything. He has a job to do, though, and on most nights he has to disappear at 9:30 PM to run films and won’t be available for the rest of the night. Just keep in mind we’ll be on our own after 9:30.

We’re not hollywood enough yet to have staff attend to us in the mezzanine, so just head down to the 1st floor lobby to order what you want. There are also plenty of restaurants in the Power &amp; Light district within walking distance from cheap (Chipotle, Burger King) to not-so-cheap (BRGR or any of the bar &amp; grills).

38gtf4,0,2015-06-03,Long-time sad person now stuck in a pretty awful place seeks strategies to get better,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/38gtf4/longtime_sad_person_now_stuck_in_a_pretty_awful/,"I've never been a cheery person. I've always been able to enjoy life to some extent and be happy on a day to day basis, but beyond that there has always been some sinking empty pit in my stomach that's made some days awful. Not all or most. But I would get into modes here and there that varied from completely apathy towards being alive to some pretty gnarly despair.

I always came out the other side though, which is why I would've previously struggled to think that I actually had depression. Last December however I got hit with a miserable loss and spiraled down into a dark place pretty fast. As of a month or so ago I thought I finally came out the other side. I was having a lot more decent days than miserable ones. I was wrong unfortunately, because the days got worse and worse and more and more frequent, to the point when I don't really know when I'm out, if I ever am.

I'm a college student, and during the school year I periodically visited my school's counselor over a period of 3 or 4 months. He never told me anything I didn't already really know, such as needing to move on, and I've done everything I can to achieve that goal. Thankfully, he kept my mind focused enough that my life and health stopped suffering and even improved if anything because I picked my grades back up and even landed a great internship. I never figured out the smoking gun to move on and actually recover, let alone to find any strong and lasting happiness in my life.

I watched Robert Sapolsky's lecture on depression and the line about how depression is a disease that ""makes you unable to enjoy sunsets."" That really stuck out to me because now that the weather is finally nice, even seeing the same sunshine and feeling the same summer breezes I felt with the person I lost makes me feel like utter garbage.

I don't know what I need to feel like myself again, but I want it bad. I don't want to sit here the rest of my life. I want to regain myself and get better than I've ever been, so I can actually find the serious happiness and fulfillment that everyone deserves and even owes themselves. 

I really need to know what my options are here so I can find a way to escape.

Thank you to all who provided comments on drafts 1 &amp; 2 - I've pretty much re-written the whole essay (it was rough to say the least), so I could really use some input on this new (and I hope improved) version.  Thanks for all your help guys!

Link to Draft 2: http://www.reddit.com/r/peacecorps/comments/381pnv/i_want_to_volunteer_please_help_critique_my_pc/

---Prompt:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Peace Corps service presents major physical, emotional, and intellectual challenges. You have provided information on how you qualify for Peace Corps service elsewhere in the application. In the space below, please provide a statement (between 250 – 500 words) that includes: Your reasons for wanting to serve as a Peace Corps Volunteer; and How these reasons are related to your past experiences and life goals. How you expect to satisfy the Peace Corps 10 Core Expectations (please be specific about which expectations you expect to find most challenging and how you plan to overcome these challenges).

---My Mission Statement (Draft 3):--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was the little girl who received free lunches at school.  I know what it’s like to be given a coat because I didn’t have one.  I understand what it feels like to need a helping hand.  I owe the person I am today to community members showed me the way to opportunity – I’ve been incredibly lucky. 

I’ve always felt drawn to the Peace Corps both by my appreciation for the generosity that has shaped my life as well as the inspiration I’ve found in helping others.  I first felt empowered by service in secondary school when I saw younger students come together against bullying after a mentoring conference that I helped lead.  I felt the pull of participating in something greater than myself when a stranger with tears in her eyes thanked my group for helping her devastated community after Hurricane Katrina.  Volunteering has afforded me some of the most honest, raw, and rewarding moments of my life.  In these moments I’ve found meaning, purpose, and an unshakable drive to serve.

I also see the Peace Corps as an adventure.   As an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer I set out for Wyoming knowing little more than that I was to spend the summer building houses with Habitat for Humanity.  I felt so alive, taking that chance and adapting to the challenges of a novel experience, that I’ve sought that feeling through my internships, co-ops, and study abroad.  I’ve cultivated a love for travel, but to me it’s not enough to stand on the outside looking in.  My fondest travel memories aren’t the grandeur of ancient sites or swanky tourist attractions. Rather they are the opportunities I’ve had to connect such as explaining that I don’t’ live next door to Brad Pitt to my homestay family as a People to People student ambassador. 

From travel abroad to helping ESL students improve their English on my college campus, I’ve cultivated an open minded approach and intense curiosity towards people, cultures, and ideas different than my own.   I believe the best way to expand my view of the world is to try to understand someone else’s, but not everyone sees it that way.  Building trust and confidence is one of the most important cornerstones of progress, but rapport takes time to develop.  I believe I'll encounter my greatest challenges during that development phase.  It will be challenging to maintain balance between integrating myself into a new culture and faithfully representing my own.  It will take strength to effectively and dynamically use my skills under adversity – to not only hold myself up, but to benefit others as well.  

When I was young someone told me, ""It is difficult to be sad and useful at the same time."" I've held this mantra close, and when life's challenges seem much greater than myself I'm made strong by turning my focus on others.  I will be encouraged through the Peace Corps’ challenges by my fascination in learning a new culture.  I will be impassioned by the deep-felt meaning I find in helping others.   I will be reinforced by my belief that struggle is the predecessor of progress – it’s an opportunity to become more than you thought you could.

Presently, I am seeking synergy between an engineering career and my desire to help people.  I covet a future where service is a primary component of my everyday affairs.  I’ve learned the best way to find your path is to surround yourself with people and experiences that resonate with your passions.   It’s my passion to grow a life that blesses those it touches.  I believe the most fertile ground for that is in the Peace Corps.   My decision was cemented upon identifying with the words of a friend and former volunteer, simply put – “it's just what people like me were born to do.”

She gets really into the characters for movies and she is very over the top with reactions. This being said, I want to get a her reaction to the red wedding because I've seen videos of reactions and think that she could have a really good reaction... The problem is she moved to Texas for the summer for an internship so I won't be able to watch the show with her. I've come to the conclusion of two possible solutions:

1). I have her record herself watching the episode from the beginning. It will suck because she will know something is going to happen this episode, but I'm sure when she gets into the show she will forget that she is being recorded. However, then we are left with an hour long video and I have to trim it. Not that big of a deal and probably my best option but it's just kind of a hassle.

2). My other option was to fix the lengthy video problem by telling her at a certain minute into the show to turn the camera on. However, I personally don't really like this idea because it gives away that something crazy is about to happen because I am having her turn on the camera now. To me I feel it ruins the experience and the reaction won't be as sincere.

My question to you, Reddit, is are there any ways that you might know of, or could come up with, that will help make sure I can get the video I want while also making sure I don't give away the fact that something crazy might end up happening? I feel like the first option is my best, but I'm hoping that you guys can help my find an even better one.

Also, sorry for the title, this is my first post on the subreddit and I'm not 100% sure how to make the spoiler in the title."

38hpbk,1,2015-06-04,I'm lost for the next 4 years of my life,shunug,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38hpbk/im_lost_for_the_next_4_years_of_my_life/,"I'm a senior in High School and I have the dream of becoming a television writer when I grow up. I've been focused on this for about 2 years now, and everything I have done has pretty much been to get me closer to this goal. Last August I decided I was going to apply to NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, arguably the best film school in the nation. No big deal right? Wrong. There was a 5 part supplement including a 6 page script I needed to write for the application. I spent all my time working on this app. I wa so focused there was nothing that was going to stop me from reaching my dream of NYU.

Well in the meantime I also play baseball and was being recruited by nearly every DIII school in the PNW among other schools around the nation. I spent my main focus on Occidental a small liberal arts school in LA and Willammette a small liberal arts school in Oregon. I visited both schools and was the top recruit for both. However both were slightly out of my financial range and I was still hoping on my early decision from NYU to come back positive. 

Well it did. I was accepted and for that brief moment I was so happy. My entire life was being lit up right there in front of me. After I found out I had been accepted I didn't bother applying to any other schools because I knew I was going to NYU. Until they didn't offer me any financial aid and asked for $70,000 a year. I was fucking screwed. I made the mad dash to scramble and find any colleges with admission still open who also had an at least semi respected film school. I ended up applying and being accepted to Arizona State and Montana State. During this time my dad, who works in the Maritime industry, suggested joining the merchant marine for a year to raise money to potentially go to NYU or to go to a different school. I got all my papers and training and also got geared up to potentially join the Sailors Union of the Pacific. 

I ended up denying my acceptance to NYU and sending my deposit to ASU. I also got a deferment accepted for before my freshman year at ASU so I can take the gap year and sail if I wanted. My only problem is I feel like I can do better than ASU and i fucked up my chance with Occidental. My biggest stress in college is internships because that's where I break into the industry so I worry about Arizonas internship opportunities where I know Occidental is right in the heart of LA crawling with internships. I fucked up though because I didn't apply.

I have at least 4 different options for college and I have no fucking clue what I'm gonna do. I could just go to ASU next year, I could take a gap year then go to ASU. I could go to my nearby Community College to play baseball then try and transfer somewhere, or now I could go to a CC in California to play baseball and have the possibility of transferring to a state school in California.

I feel like I fucked up because I cut my ties too soon. There are so many things running through my mind about which possibility would be best. Should I call the Occidental Coach and see if there were any strings he could pull to get me into the college next year? But then would there be any financial aid money left over? How badly do I want to continue playing baseball in college? Would playing in college take up too much time for me to get any quality internships or make any quality connections? NYU has a baseball team and they're DIII, would the coach be able to find money for me if I wanted to play there? Could I even still make it back into the school? I still can't believe NYU was so close to me. That school was it for me, like the girl I still haven't gotten over. Sometimes I go to the website and still pretend like I am going there and look and see all of the things I would be doing there. I can't believe any of this happened to me. Maybe taking a gap year would be the best thing for me but would I be able to go to any other school besides ASU? I can't make any decisions for myself because I'm still so hurt over NYU and other people are pulling me in every direction imaginable. I just wish I could skip college all together or just have somebody make a decision for me because all of this anxiety is killing me.

Tl;dr I have too many options for college next year and it's killing me inside"

38hxs5,0,2015-06-04,My ex/sort-of current gf [21 F] of 1.5 years not talking to me [22 M] because of drunken outburst and have waited two weeks without hearing anything...,citydodger80,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38hxs5/my_exsortof_current_gf_21_f_of_15_years_not/,"So I dated this girl off and on throughout university and in the summer before I left for the UK to pursue graduate school, we made it official and fell in love and the such. However, two weeks before I left we got into a huge argument (that I started unintentionally) and we broke up.

Over the following few months, we didn't really talk but after I went back home for the holidays we met up and reconnected and started talking again. We were texting off and on and then became very regular and were constantly texting/skypying/calling etc. each other every day up until about a week and a half ago when I drunkenly started another argument and was for some reason really obsessive/acting very controlling over her which she obviously didn't like. 

Since this isn't the first time I have hurt her with this (i guess for lack of better term) trust issue, she told me she needed her space and I have obliged and have had zero contact with her for a week and a half now..

However, it is complicated because she is coming to London (where I am studying) in about two weeks to start a summer internship, and we had all these plans and things to do together once she got here. I love her, and what her back but don't want to force things and lose her forever. 

Have I waited long enough and should I try contacting her, especially since shell be here soon? Or should I just wait it out and see if she makes the first contact? 

tl;dr- Fucked up (again), now not talking to me. What do?

38i3pk,1,2015-06-04,I have 3 months of summer left and am struggling to come up with a workout plan,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/38i3pk/i_have_3_months_of_summer_left_and_am_struggling/,"Hi r/fitness! 

I'm a 20 year old college student. My height is 5'3 and weight is 138lbs. I used to work out during last semester at least 3 times a week but then stopped because I was frustrated as to how little it looked like I was losing. However, I want to get back on it and have convinced myself that it will take weeks/months to get the toned, athletic look. 

I just want to at least kick start my journey to fitness. I have a lot of time on my hand besides my internship, which ends early in the evening. 

My plan was that I start off 3 times a week, then next week 5 times a week, then twice a day 3 times a week with the other 2 days just once a day workout. The workout lasts 30 minutes. I was thinking of using the T25 workouts and going to the gym for a mix of cardio and strength training. However, I'm not sure how to start lifting. I have no clue where to start.

For diet, cut down on rice and toasts and for days to eat them, they'll be brown rice and whole wheat. I do feel slightly better these days when I don't eat too much grain but I don't feel any better if I have a low-carb (maybe more moderate). Eat a range of fruits and veggies, cut down on sugary foods and drink 3 liters of water a day (I already drink 2 per day but I'm trying to increase that)

Could you please offer some extra tips or ideas as to how I can exercise and plan it all out? Thank you in advance :)"
38i5v1,284,2015-06-04,Me [27/F] with my FMIL[45/F] after making me cancel my wedding last year is guilt tripping me into changing my wedding date again.,Mooieberry,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38i5v1/me_27f_with_my_fmil45f_after_making_me_cancel_my/,"Update here: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38kq3h/update_me_27f_with_my_fmil45f_after_making_me/

-Backstory-
I met my fiance Mike 3 years ago and we've been engaged now for over a year and a half. After becoming engaged I started planning out wedding naturally and planned it for a year out to give us time for me to finish undergrad and well so all the planning a wedding takes. So after finding a venue and putting down a hefty deposit we set a date only to have my FMIL Kate to freak out! Freak out she did, she said we weren't ready to get married, too young, to broke, Mike wasn't done with school etc. etc. Then she threatened us to stop the wedding by kicking Mike off her insurance, taking back the car he was loaned and basically making out life a living hell. 

So after several arguments and discussing it with my family, we decided the best thing to do was cancel the wedding because we were not financially ready to tell Kate to fuck off and let us live our own life and make our own decisions. 

-Current Problem-
It took several months for me to become excited about planning another wedding after canceling my last, it was so humiliating to tell everyone I had cancelled it and expensive too! So now we've pick another date for June of 2016 and I've picked a venue and put down a deposit, also hired a photographer. Even before I picked a date I sent a nice to to Kate asking if their family had anything planned next summer I should avoid and received no response. So I went ahead and picked a date in June. NOW! Apparently Mike's little sister wants to go overseas for an internship and will be gone for our wedding. WTF! I asked Kate before I booked if there was anything I should avoid so this situation didn't come up. I feel horrible because Mike's little sister is a bridesmaid, I love her she's the sweetest and has a very close relationship to Mike. BUT, I can't lose another deposit and damn'it if I wasn't pissed that I should have to move my wedding AGAIN for Kate. 

Please help, I don't know what to say or do. Kate is blowing up my phone asking me to change my date and guilt tripping me. Should I change the date so the whole family can be there, or ask lil' sis to book another internship? So confused, could really use some advice.



   
**tl;dr**: Cancelled and move wedding once, now FMIL is asking me to do it again but I don't want to."

I have been working as an engineering intern for the past three summers. Every summer I am taxed as if I was self employed. Someone mentioned that I might be able to write some things off because of this but I have very little experience in this. I was hoping someone could give me some advice.

For example, for my job I work with a lot of 3d modeling (using programs like SolidWorks). If I bought a laptop so that I could work on the modeling at home (it's a pretty demanding program, my current computer struggles with it), would that be tax deductible? 

In general, I'd like some advice on if I can write off things, and if so, what kind of things can be written off. Please forgive me if these are dumb questions."
38iavo,4,2015-06-04,Dependent Mom Still Controlling,throwaway03011211,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/38iavo/dependent_mom_still_controlling/,"TL;DR: I am going to be 29, I pay for all the bills, and my mother does not have the skills to get another job, she is completely dependent on me, yet still wants to run my life. She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by myself and even through all the struggles she has caused me, I still want to take care of her, just albeit on on my terms.

Background: Twenty years ago, my mom and I immigrated from a Hispanic country to the Bay Area after my Dad left us, took off in the middle of the night and emptied all the bank accounts. Promised with help, her sisters all but abandoned her two weeks after the move leaving us with nothing. My mother worked 80 hour weeks just to provide for us, as I was just in grade school at the time. I learned English on my own as well as helped my mom learn English on the side as well. Eventually I got into college, graduated and also graduated with a Masters degree. My mother has worked at her own salon since moving here, and her English has improved to the point where she can communicate effectively, but still cannot pass an English proficiency exam to get into college to further her education.

Lately, things in the salon have turned bad, as she has an extreme mistrust of outsiders,due to being taken advantage of by her sisters and ex-husband, so she never hired any additional help. The salon is only open when she is there, and granted she does work 80 hour weeks, even to this day as she is entering her 60s. This has caused the salon to be stagnant and never reach its proper growth potential, as it keeps sporadic hours, because nobody can possibly work 120 hour weeks, so sometimes she has to close for errands or ESL classes, etc. It’s also not in a good area, with not a lot of foot traffic. Bottom line is, she makes only enough to stay open and does not make any profit whatsoever. It has been this way for awhile. This has led me to running the household, so to speak since I was 16 years old. I worked summer jobs during high school and worked after school when I had college, including full time during grad school. I could never take an opportunity to take a potentially lucrative internship as I could never not have any income coming in, as I was paying rent, groceries etc. This has led me to starting my career a bit later than my contemporaries. I will be 29 soon, and I have finally found my dream job. Granted, its entry level, but has amazing growth potential and I have the most amazing supervisors ever, but despite that, and in combination with living in the Bay Area, it does not pay a wage where I can buy a house, just yet.

Enter my boyfriend. We met over a year ago and hit it off immediately. His background is similar to mine, albeit a little different. He was born here, but still received no parental support and his parents would rather get high than raise a child. He was pretty much on his own since he was 14, although they contribute enough to keep a roof over his head. He took the first opportunity he could and moved out when he was 21 with his then girlfriend, which turned into his ex-wife soon after. Along the way, they had a child. He is currently paying child support (and seeing his kid frequently), and also working a job where he is significantly underpaid compared to his peers (seems like you need to work in tech to get anywhere in the Bay Area, which neither of us do). The child support and his ex have ruined his credit to the point where it has caused him to lose a few years on his life by moving back into his parents, living well below his means just to pay down some debt so he can move forward in his life. He moved back three years ago and just now sees the light. He has a four year degree and is in grad school, but still lives paycheck to paycheck due to his past debt issues. (none since moving on from his ex, but still residual damage) Despite my meager salary, I make more than he does, despite the fact we both work full time and he has a second job on the side.

Problem: My mom does not think he is right for me. She comes from a very conservative Hispanic family, where the men take care of the women and the women take care of the household. Despite this, she has instilled values in me that will not allow me to be a stay at home housewife, even if my boyfriend (future husband, yes we have discussed this at length and feel comfortable knowing that we are each other’s future spouses) can afford it. When he gets a job that can support a family in the Bay Area, I will still work to put money in savings or college accounts etc. But because he does not make enough money to her, she thinks that he is just using me for sex and free food. This is not the case whatsoever but she will not listen to me. She is very much set in her ways. She makes snide remarks about us having sex in the house, claiming that “he cannot afford to take you to a motel so you guys do it here” which makes me feel like a prostitute...and she has called me that as well. Her conservative upbringing led her to this line of thinking that sex should wait until marriage, and while we wanted to respect her wishes, we also didn’t want to wait until marriage to have sex. We had a very educated conversation about what types of birth control to have and he’s been extremely supportive throughout all this saying if I felt the hormones from the birth control were too much then we would switch to condoms or something else. I have never felt used by him in any way. This was not good enough for her. We thought that would be the end of it, she wouldn’t be happy with our lifestyle but would still just ignore it. However, a couple weeks ago, she caught us coming out of my bedroom, fully clothed mind you, and this completely set her off. It turns out she had been harboring all these feelings and finally exploded. She has no friends and no family to vent to, I am all she has, and it was finally too much for her. She went on a tirade that explained that he was no good for me, was just using me for sex, would never support me or get a good job or anything worthy of me. He has made an effort to include her in his life, pays for gas when we all go out, buys dinner for her, bought her a TV for Mothers day, etc. To top it all off, she has been getting sick lately and blamed the whole ordeal on him, saying that because he’s around she has been getting sick, claiming that he poisons her. I tried to explain that she was getting up there in age, and works too many hours and that she should rest (she literally has no hobbies, just works and goes to school then goes home cooks and reads her ESL books), and that was the cause of illness. I work in the medical field with doctors who are also sick and have said it is a bad flu season. I explained that this may also be a cause, and she did not want to hear it. She thinks my boyfriend is the cause of all her problems. She found cockroaches the other night and claimed he brought them from home, despite the fact he has never seen a cockroach in his life. Despite all this, she says he can still come over, but he is not allowed in the bedroom, the bathroom or the kitchen (she thinks he breathes on the dishes and spreads germs), we live in a studio, so his visits are restricted to a 20x5 area between the front door and kitchen.

TL;DR: I am going to be 29, I pay for all the bills, and my mother does not have the skills to get another job, she is completely dependent on me, yet still wants to run my life. She is completely illogical and does not even process the idea that I know what I am doing in my life. She is still my mom and cannot survive if I leave her because she will be unable to pay for the apartment by myself and even through all the struggles she has caused me, I still want to take care of her, just albeit on on my terms.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

38ib22,19,2015-06-04,[AMA Series] Church of the Nazarene,Salivific,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/38ib22/ama_series_church_of_the_nazarene/,"Hey everyone, /u/Salivific and /u/jape2116 here. Welcome to the Church of the Nazarene Denominational AMA! We're here to answer any questions you might have about our denomination, as well as provide a background for and explanation of what the CotN believes.

We'll give general explanations of beliefs, history, and polity all in this main post, but other than that, ask away!


--

---

* Beliefs

Nazarenes have an agreed-upon [creed](http://nazarene.org/beliefs) (though we don't call it such) and sixteen [Articles of Faith](http://nazarene.org/articles-faith). These and more can be found in our [Manual](http://nazarene.org/files/docs/Manual2013-17.pdf). Nazarenes are a product of the holiness movement in America, and are staunchly Wesleyan-Arminian in theology. Doctrinally, we're probably closest to Free Methodists or Wesleyans (go figure). Nazarenes are by-and-by-large more conservative than not. That isn't to say that there aren't any liberals or moderates, but they are certainly not the majority. We affirm the Creeds from the first four great ecumenical councils. The CotN has been sending missionaries around the world since our founding, and we have roughly two million members today because of this.

--

* History

The CotN comes out of the American Holiness Movement, specifically the strain of the holiness movement that sought to reform ethical practices after conversion and held camp meetings (like, actually in the woods under a tent). We still do camp meetings, but they're usually indoors now. They're still quite often out in the boonies, though. 

The CotN is a product of mergers, and today contains sixteen denominations as a result of their continuation. The original CotN was founded in 1895 in Los Angeles. This denomination merged with the Association of Pentecostal Churches of America in 1907, becoming the Pentecostal CotN. This in turn merged with the Holiness Church of Christ in 1908 at Pilot Point, Texas. This is considered the official founding of the modern denomination.

--

* Polity

The CotN is a hybrid of episcopacy and congregationalism: As an international denomination, the world is first divided into six regions, each covering approximately a whole continent. Each region is split further into districts (see [the USA/Canada region](http://usacanadaregion.org/find-a-district) map for a visualization). Each district has mission areas that cover smaller areas (e.g. the Nashville South mission area on the MidSouth District). Local congregations are members of the district they are located in, but operate with relative freedom and impunity. Each local congregation has a board which helps to govern on church business, and often several subcommittees as needed.

Once a year, each district calls all clergy available (as well as lay delegates) to come to a district-level assembly where district business is done, reports given, etc. This assembly is presided over by the District Superintendent (think bishops). And once every four years, each region calls representatives from all of its respective districts (the District Superintendents in particular) to a General Assembly. The assembly is presided over by the General Superintendent for that region (think archbishops).

The General Superintendents meet to discuss the issues facing their respective regions, as well as church governance on a board. At the same time, though, each local church is given a great deal of operational freedom. Hence, hybrid.

---

* Panelist Bios

/u/Salivific - I am a fourth-generation, cradle Nazarene. My father is an ordained elder, and I myself am a district-licensed minister. However, as I'm still enrolled in undergrad at Trevecca Nazarene University, I'm not a pastor yet. I am currently in an internship at a local church for the summer. I am probably a liberal by Nazarene standards (which would probably make me a right-leaning moderate if I were in the UMC). I'm also a lover of church history, though I'm not exactly extremely well-versed in it.

/u/jape2116 - I have been a Nazarene for about a year and a half now. I was baptized Presbyterian, Grew up Lutheran, sang in a Catholic church, and attended a non denominational church for awhile. When looking for a new church my wife and I attended a Nazarene church and immediately felt at home. There is something about they way the church evangelized. They brought not only the community they were housed in together, but also worked closely with other churches. I then moved churches and became the worship leader at my current church. I just finished my first year of graduate work at Mount Vernon Nazarene University working towards a Master of Ministry degree. To be honest, I don't know where I fit into the the greater denomination as far as being liberal or conservative, I don't bother too much with those things. I constantly google the Nazarene church because I am still getting a feel for the culture. This denomination seems to be all about who you know and everyone knows everyone. So if I had to sit down and think about it, I'm probably more liberal.

I am very interested in game development, and have a pretty solid grounding in both Java and C++. I definitely want to take one of these 2 courses, since they seem more unique than courses offered in other universities. 

Currently, I am leaning towards the Games course, since it seems like something I would enjoy more; however, I can't help but worry that it would be harder to get non-game jobs and internships. Also, should I ever decide to transfer to another university, which only offers a regular CS course, would it hurt my chances?

If anyone can provide some advice that would be fantastic. Thanks a lot! "

38ij0o,27,2015-06-04,CMV: A person with visible facial piercings or body mods will likely be viewed as less professional and turned down in favor of equally (or even less) qualified individuals.,AtomikRadio,changemyview,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/38ij0o/cmv_a_person_with_visible_facial_piercings_or/,"I would really like to believe this isn't the case, but I feel it is. I love facial piercings. Nothing extreme, just an eyebrow piercing or a labret or, at the most extreme, snake bites. Throughout my life I've had these, I've had a scaffold/industrial piercing, and I've had my ears stretched to a 4g. (So, not big ""discs"" or anything but large enough that people noticed.) Everything (except the lobes) were one at a time, I never had more than one type of ""abnormal"" piercing at a given time in my life. 

I always removed my piercings and let them close before returning to my school or job or what have you. For a while I worked as a pizza driver with the labret, but after removing it found my tips improved. I think many people think piercings and similar stylistic modifications are phases teenagers go through and not appropriate for adults.

I'm about to enter my last year of undergrad and move on to a Masters program with an internship component and I feel I cannot return to having a piercing (let alone multiple ones) beyond normal lobe piercings without being taken less seriously, seen as less professional, and possibly being passed over for positions and opportunities.

TBH I'm about to turn 28 but still have this, like, inner-goth side that is constantly yearning to get a piercing or two and rock some black hair dye again, but I feel I can't because I feel I'm *supposed* to be beyond that and I'm ""too old for that stuff.""

I would love it if someone could change my view. You are more than welcome to address tattoos in your response as well, though I am mostly referring to piercings and possibly dyed hair that is clearly not a natural hair color for the individual.

(I am a female, if that is relevant. I know some people view piercings on different sexes differently.) 

Edited to add: I see many people mentioning it depends on the profession. I realize this and I'd thought just mentioning the Masters program would make it clear I'm not going to work at a tattoo parlor. lol But fair statements. I will be working in the healthcare field as a direct provider to patients, but not as a physician. There is also a high chance of working in research/academia after the internship phase.

Furthermore, I'll clarify here that is is the intent of this CMV to find out if there are areas of the country where this is not the case. I am from a small farm town in Utah, I was hoping this reaction to piercings was a local thing, and so this CMV is an attempt to find out if it is true all over the country. Alas it sounds like my view won't be changed, due to being correct. :( But *please* change it if you can. I really want to be wrong!

38ikad,0,2015-06-04,Had the best orgasm of my life last night. I'm a fucking failure and I'm afraid it's going to kill me.,nofapthrowaway21932,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/38ikad/had_the_best_orgasm_of_my_life_last_night_im_a/,"Two weeks ago I posted about my medical condition: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/360m4k/please_help_save_my_life/

The counter is wrong. I actually relapsed three times during this time. 

The second time it happened (after a 3 time binge), I had the worst headache of my life the next night. I thought my brain was going to explode. I begged any force in the universe to save me- said I'd do anything to live. In the end I stayed up til 3 and collapsed exhausted after taking some Motrin. 

I don't know how the hell I forgot about that night. But the fact that I couldn't change myself after that fucking galls me. I can't even stop masturbating to save my life. 

Last night I relapsed after edging for six days. I thought I could handle it. It turns out I just ended up discovering a new way to masturbate that creates even MORE pleasure than before. I resolved to never edge again. 

Yet this morning I relapsed AGAIN. Even after last night's headache wrecked me, and even after the previous headache threatened to kill me.

I'm really starting to doubt that I can save myself. During the longest streak I had- about 4 weeks ago, total of 1 week- I think my headaches started diminishing at the end of the streak. But I don't remember and I'm scared I have some other problem like a tumor or some shit, or that I'm past the breaking point and it's already over.

I hate playing the waiting game. I’m in a fairly high pressure internship right now and after I relapse, I can barely work. I just have 0 motivation and the headaches distract me from doing anything. I’m always waiting to hit that point where they start diminishing but I haven’t made it to a week for an entire month. 

I keep thinking about my life and how much it's gone to shit over the past few years. I'm just starting to finally believe that I can't put it back together again. 

I just want to give up and die. I don't know how I can keep going on. I want my life to begin, but living with this everyday pain is just too much.

38ilef,60,2015-06-04,How many of your friends know about your big secret?,bdp_thrwaway,bigdickproblems,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigdickproblems/comments/38ilef/how_many_of_your_friends_know_about_your_big/,"I’m actually a pretty shy guy and don’t strut my stuff at all, always showering in swimming trunks and such. I’m 27, and I’ve only had sex with four girls. However, despite my attempts to keep my size under wraps, it seems that many of my friends found about it through various events - some run-of-the-mill, and others quite bizarre! Here’s some:

———

1. My first gf and I were virgins, and we had a rough start doing it without hurting her (I’m about 8” and 5.5” around). It took time for us to find the right groove - but when we did, she grew to really like it. She later told me she consulted with her close friends (some of whom are my friends as well) about our troubles and triumphs. 

2. After my first gf, I was out of town visiting a friend for a week, and his gf introduced one of her friends to me. We hit it off quickly, and she soon invited me home with the mutual knowledge that it would be a fling. When we took our clothes off, she was absolutely floored. I was her biggest by far, and she later marveled that I was bigger flaccid (around 5.5) than some of her previous lovers. I took things slowly, and our first night was a success. She said she did not think she could orgasm from deep penetration, and lamented she might not be satisfied by other guys any more. She really got hooked on it the next few nights, and surmised “most girls would go crazy about it if they knew…”. My friend later told me he heard about my “big secret”, and said she went on a long rave about me to some of his friends.

3. My friends (3 guys including me and 2 girls) were hanging out, and one girl asked about our sizes as a part of a game. The first guy said 6, I said 7.5 (which is my nbp length), and the third guy said 8 (which he has stated many times prior). After our responses, she told the other girl, “See! I told you all the guys measure it!” Now comes the BIZARRE part! A year later, my friend (the 6” guy) had a long-distance gf visiting, and they invited me to hang out with them. The night started out innocently, but started taking risqué turns. Eventually, they asked me about a 3some, and I said yes! Soon, when the girl took my pants off, she was shocked by what she saw -she said it must be 10 inches! When I said no, she decided she had to measure it! She measured it from the side, at an angle, really pushing it in, and declared, “okay, maybe it’s 8.5… 9!”. She also measured my friend, and what he claimed was 6” was actually about 4.5”… She started to fuck him, but would only suck me, saying that it would probably destroy her. We were good sports about the ordeal, and the night ended well.

4. My current gf got thrilled at seeing my penis, and gave me repeated compliments, saying that it’s the perfect size (she’s had one larger, but said it hurt too much). She also decided to save some pictures of it on her phone. A friend later borrowed the phone, and started snooping around, eventually finding the pictures! My gf’s denials didn’t work, and now two of her friends know what my penis looks like…

———

So like it or not, many of my friends now know the secret - how does it compare with your experiences? Do you try to keep it a secret? Also, I had exactly one girl approach me for my size, but our date fizzled way before we had sex.

———

**EDIT: More detail in response to requests**

Both of my relationships have been long term (4+ years) - and greatly helped in developing my skills. I was quite clueless at the start, and my first gf really showed me the ropes on how to please her and how to use what I have. It took a lot of time and practice before there was pleasure without much pain.

Afterwards, I didn’t think much about my size until I was with my second girl (the girl from the 1-week trip on my post). Getting such a positive reaction from her was incredible, and it really boosted my confidence for a while.

Before my current gf, I also had a very short-term relationship while I was away on a summer internship. She was cute with a great body and I normally would have thought she was way out of my league (I’m 5’6” so many girls have rejected me for height alone). However, I was on a confidence high, and I made many advances. After showing lukewarm interest, she finally agreed to a date after getting rejected by a guy that she was chasing. 

On the date, she vented a lot about the dude that rejected her, and didn’t seem too interested in my stories. However, she did show physical interest, and was more than ready to go after some alcohol. When the clothes came off, her eyes got wide and she said that my dick was really big.The sex was fantastic, and she came many times, saying things like “oh god, I’m coming again! It’s so big I love it!” She got hooked, and we had a primarily sexual relationship until my internship ended. While this was many years ago, she does hit me up from time to time when she’s in town to see if I’m free.

Meanwhile, the 3some experience was definitely the most bizarre. I was (somewhat) hoping that I was smaller so that things could have been less awkward. I do wonder whether the girl would have fucked me if the my stark disparity with her bf wasn’t there.

The only reason why I was okay with it is because during the summer,  I live with my parents and I can smoke at his house. 

Yesterday he just asked me to do him a favor and fix his computer, and he would compensate me with weed. Last year,  I said yes and fixed his computer. But being 2 months clean and having an internship,  I was finally able to turn him down. It feel great to be gone from the addicting grasps of weed and cutting of a bad friend.

38iz2x,12,2015-06-04,I [21M] am on the verge of breaking up with my girlfriend [21F] of 4 years and am seeking advice,throwaway55896514asd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38iz2x/i_21m_am_on_the_verge_of_breaking_up_with_my/,"Sorry if this is a bit long, it has been a long relationship and I have thought a lot about things and how they are. Just want some opinions from others on my thoughts and reasoning. 

Background Information:
We started dating when I was a senior in high school and she was a freshman in college. Things started out great and we really fell in love with each other. I was writing her poems and songs and all that crazy romantic stuff that happens. Of course that only lasted a year or so when the honeymoon stage ended. I really wish she still inspired me like she used to.


We moved in together after about a year and a half of dating. Everything was still great. We both go to the same school, enjoyed spending practically all of our time together etc. 


Things died down slowly but we always remained very stable and did not spend much time with other people. We are very much best friends. I had some trust issues until about a year ago but was able to overcome them. We fight about as much as any couple would, mainly over petty things. 


Why I feel like I should end things:


I think we got way too serious when we were both very young. My parents did the same exact thing (its scary how much my relationship mirrors theirs) and it did not end well. They stayed together for the kids and now are unhappy. 


We are at the point in our lives where other people are age are getting married and I know she wants that but  I don't see myself marrying her anymore. Our personalities don't seem as compatible as they once did, and I am having to decide if some of her traits bother me enough to be ""deal breakers"". Our relationship has also turned into more of a ""roomates"" kind of things. We are content, but not happy.


I am extremely self motivated. I enjoy learning and trying new things. I play 4 or 5 different instruments. I generally put my best foot forward on most things. She is the kind of person who is ok with doing ok (nothing wrong with that, but being the way I am I generally try and push her a bit), is more closed to new experiences (food, places, sex etc), and has few life goals. 


I am also very close to my parents. I enjoy having dinner over there, talking with them, etc. Its one of the main reasons I chose to stay in my hometown for college (her being another main reason as well). I guess I just know they wont be around forever. She does not like this too much. she is not very close with her family. I love for her to go with me over there to eat and what not but most of the time she would rather not. My parents love her and she knows this, but even after all this time she is not very comfortable being there. We go over to her parents house every now and then, its usually in and out, most of the time she tells me to just stay in the car. Her parents like me and they think I am a good man and know I treat her well. I enjoy talking with them and seeing them, but I know her childhood was the not the same one I had, so I understand her reasons for not being as close with them.


Our sex life is not ideal to me. I have a high sex drive while her's is pretty much nonexistent now, although it was fine the first year and a half or so. There may be an underlying cause for that such as depression but we have talked about it a lot (I feel bad about bringing it up but it is just so demoralizing to have to beg your girlfriend for something that seems so natural and that you want so bad) and she says she just does not want or enjoy sex that much. Maybe I am not doing something right, who knows. I go down on her all the time with no want for reciprocation (which she does maybe once every 3-4 months), just because I enjoy doing it and making her feel good. I would love to do it a few times a week, but am lucky if it happens a few times a month. 


I am also away for the summer for an internship and am exploring the new city with my new friends, trying new things, and generally trying to enjoy my time here. The distance between us has been hard. I have had doubts for the past year or so, and our time apart has really amplified them. Maybe its just the newness of it all, but it gives me a feeling like I am being held back, like there is so much more out there. I hate to be cliche but I guess I fall into the ""wanting to find myself"" category and want new experiences.


On the other hand:

she is my best friend and the one person who knows everything about me. She is kind and caring. She is smart and full of potential but I feel like her inner drive wont lead to any realization of that. I would say we have an extremely strong bond even if it does not show as much anymore. A very companionnate love. When we first started dating I did not really think she was extremely pretty or anything (frankly I was not very attracted to her), but she grew on me and turned into a very beautiful girl. We get along very well. We communicate a lot, express our concerns, but in the end it always comes down to us saying things will get better and we both are going to try harder and do more but nothing ever really changes. I am especially bad about saying I will change but never do. Its like our relationship is stuck in quicksand and we start working on things, but they never really take and it sucks us back down.


My mind is telling me to end it, but my heart has this worried feeling. I'm scared I am just in a phase of wanting something new and exciting and one day I will realize she was the right one all along. I guess I can never know for sure.


While blame lies on both our shoulders, mine feel pretty heavy. I think maybe if I caught things earlier I could have fixed it, but at this point its getting so hard for me to try. I feel like a lot of our problems have to do with sex, and I feel bad about that. Its important to me, but so is she. What do you guys think? Is breaking up the right decision?


**tl;dr**: 4 year relationship. Still love her. Always will. Bad sex life, some bad traits but some good ones. Want to find myself, try new things, experience more of life in general. Do I end it or try one last time?"
38jbbr,27,2015-06-04,Me [25/F] with my boyfriend [25 M] of 2.5 years. Should I stay even though he's broke?,anxiousaboutfuture22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38jbbr/me_25f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_25_years_should/,"That title is a much much harsher version of my question, and in no way am I attempting to reduce my boyfriend to just his bank account. I was hoping it would draw people in.

My BF (Trent) and I have been together for two and a half years. We started out really hot and heavy and have been practically inseparable ever since. We have had our issues, but our foundation is really strong and we share core values and have discussed building a life together.

The issue is Trent's lack of income. I come from a different part of the country (USA) have been established in my career in our current state for 4 years. I had some initial family connections that got my foot in the door of my first company, and I was able to make a lateral move with a pay increase last year on my own. Trent is from here, but does not have any real connections, through his family or otherwise. He was a varsity football player in high school and college, so his summers were dedicated to that and he was not able to build a resume of internships. 

He has had odd jobs here and there, but has not found a real career yet. Many of his promising opportunities fall through. Our entire relationship has occurred while he has not had a steady job. I completely understand how difficult the job market is, and I have been understanding and supportive and have had no issue paying for most of what we do together. It is hard, but completely manageable, so far. He spends a lot of time at my apartment, but officially lives at home with his parents and younger brother (still in High school). Basically, we are very serious about each other and I know he would do the same for me, so I am more than happy to support him in his time of need. 

My issue is that I'm worried about how long that time of need might end up being, and I'm nervous about committing to him in a more concrete way (we've talked about getting married and moving in together officially) because of his lack of income/career opportunities. Obviously because of his lack of savings and his lack of income, we are only able to talk hypothetically about the future we want at this point, and we are still young! (both 25) so I know there's no rush, but I'm still nervous. 

He has gaps in his resume, no specific industry, and is not completely qualified for any job with previous experience required. His wonderful qualities, smarts, quick learning, and charm don't even make it past the front door when up against resumes more stacked than his :( I love him so so much and would love to settle down with him and have kids when the time is right, but when will that time be?

I am anxious that I would end up being the sole provider for our family. I am in an industry that has solid pay, but I probably won't ever make six figures unless I change industries or get more schooling to take on a different role. Where we live, that would make it very difficult to give our children the life we want for them. 

I also have a medical condition that will make it harder for me to conceive, so I would hate to miss out on having children if it takes him another 5-7 years to start helping me build a solid foundation for a marriage/family. 

I am a realist and am painfully aware of how much housing and having children costs, not to mention a wedding (even if it's small and done on a very tight budget). I can't do it all alone, and I'm wondering how much time I should give him before it becomes clear that he won't be able to be an equal partner in everything. I do NOT expect him to take care of me. I am happy to be the primary breadwinner, just not the sole breadwinner. 

I help him with job applications when asked, but do not push or pressure him in any way. I have hesitated to bring this up in the past because I'm terrified of him feeling emasculated or attacked. I know he is working on it, and sends out hundreds of applications without hearing back. He is looking into getting a specialized degree (IT or a real estate license), but that takes even more time. I would hate to be cruel and give up on him despite his efforts, but at the same time, I am not sure how many years I can support him and put off planning a future. 

Help? What can/should I do? 

**tl;dr**: BF of 2.5 years doesn't have savings/career to help him build a future with me. I am scared of what a future would look like with me as the only provider. What can/should I do?

38jju5,1,2015-06-04,"Jeff Brady and the Trenchcoat Guy, Part 8: The Re-Growth",[deleted],tardtales,https://www.reddit.com/r/tardtales/comments/38jju5/jeff_brady_and_the_trenchcoat_guy_part_8_the/,"&gt;be Lilly, 21. A friend from college who's visiting me. The main character of the story.

&gt;be Jeff, 21. Your resident Chiraqi. Driven out of retirement, and is way too old for this shit.

&gt;be The Sausage Bouquet, 18-21 (or at least the people there - minus Puck and Clay). My friend group.

&gt;still don't be Trenchcoat Guy, 24. Thankfully minus trenchcoat. Was cut off long ago.

---

I thought that it was over. I thought I could live my life in California, free from the stresses of the Neckbeard Mafia, medical card by my side, and hanging out with my friends down there. In the four months I could afford to fly back, I could work on my internship, throw some parties with my friends from my town, and have fun. Of course, that was way too much to expect, and the results have driven me back to you guys.

Every month or so, my friend Lilly drives down to see me. I've never mentioned Lilly in passing, but she's a friend from college who lives in Milwaukee. She's also very well-connected in my friend group, and she's pretty great. Lilly is very blunt – she's even less afraid than I am to say what's on her mind, and she's one of the few people who can hold her own with me in a matter of how dark we are. Essentially, imagine a female, more socially awkward version of me, and you have Lilly.

So this Tuesday, she got off of work and drove down to see me because she told Hulk and Mrs. Hulk that she wanted to go to their wedding. Since the entire Sausage Bouquet got off of work, and we needed to pre-game a bit before the big party, we all decided to have one last wings night before we went on the road. Eight people decided to show up to this event – me, Tony, Phil, Kaner, Ffej, Bigsby, Lexi, and Lilly. Since my house is closest in the group and we were going to go to Peoria, we met up there, smoked, and drove on our way.

The group had some time to kill, so we decided to browse the mall and grab a few extra entertainment needs. Our first stop was FYE – the same FYE where the cockblocking incident happened – because Bigsby was too broke to buy an auxiliary adapter for his car and he wanted some CDs. Lilly was off on her own in the rock section, because she (and some of the rest of the group) is fairly grungy, and I was off browsing the hip-hop section with Bigsby, Tony and Lexi. I saw an album I liked, showed the group, and had plans to buy it once they approved. Everything was fine... until the distinctive drawl of the employee on shift caught my ear.

&gt;”YOU GUYS FINDING EVERYTHING OKAY?”

No. It couldn't be him. I scared him off, and Ma Dukes burned what was left of the bridge between us. He couldn't be talking to us, and he surely would have backed off if I was there. Right? *Right?*

Then, I looked up. If his monotone didn't confirm my fears, the mediocre goatee did. Some sadistic, vengeful god had re-introduced Trenchcoat Guy into my life. He was a bit character now, but regardless, he was back, and apparently undeterred from talking to me and my friends. Last time he upgraded from a bit role, he essentially forced his way from background extra into one of the creepier antagonists of my life. I was justifiably pretty anxious about him actually recognizing me, so I turned around. Bigsby sensed something was wrong and wound up bailing me out.

&gt;”Yeah, I think we're fine.”

&gt;”HOW ABOUT YOU?”

This time, he was talking to Lilly, very clearly staring at her chest. This would be the point where I'd step in and take the bullet for my friend, but she handled herself well when it came to creeps. Instead of faking having a boyfriend or being disinterested in a relationship, she'd just tell guys who were coming onto her too hard to back off. Considering his off-putting nature, I knew she'd rip this kid apart, and that he'd be an emotionally destroyed man at the end.

&gt;”I'm good.”

&gt;”WELL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST LET ME KNOW AND I'LL BE THERE,” he said with a wink.

&gt;”I'm not into you, dude. Fuck off.”

His face was a mixture of “How did she know I liked her” and “Well, fuck”. After being rejected, he just trudged over to his perch behind the register and stood there, waiting for people to come by. I texted Bigsby to pick up the album for me and that I'd pay him back, left FYE with Lilly, and we hid in the GameStop across the mall until he left. By some ungodly miracle, even though I was wearing the same Toews jersey that I wore in the previous stories, he never noticed me walk out, and my friends texted me when I left.

She had heard my stories about Trenchcoat Guy, but she never thought she'd have to deal with him firsthand. I'm not worried about her – he doesn't have me on Facebook, and he doesn't have any mutual friends in my group, so they have no pathway to find each other. Unless we stop there when she's visiting, she won't ever have to deal with the kid again. Either way, she didn't seem shaken up by it, but was more surprised that one of the main villains of my life story had his eye on her.

I'm guessing he approached us because he recognized some of the group from Anyville High, but he didn't seem to notice me between the throwback Nuggets hat (that I switched to the back when he was looking away to disguise myself) and the Toews jersey (although I've worn it pretty frequently for so long that I was wearing it during Episode 3, it's one of the least distinguishable articles of clothing anyone in Illinois could wear). 

I have no clue if he recognized me but just didn't want to say hi, or wanted to stay professional, or just straight up didn't realize I was part of that group now, and I don't care to find out firsthand. Feel free to post your own thoughts about if he recognized me here. If anything notable happens this summer (since guys' nights are usually when we're out), I'll definitely report back and tell you all what's been going on.

Until then, if a guy working at an FYE in Central Illinois starts talking to you and you get creepy vibes... pay no attention to the man behind the trenchcoat."
38jls4,9,2015-06-04,Today has been hard,HawliBear,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/38jls4/today_has_been_hard/,"I'm doing an internship at *Patheos* right now. It's been lovely.

But my mother keeps asking when they're going to let me write something, and I can't tell her I've already been published on there twice. I can't tell her that many readers like my writing. I can't tell her that my career may be beginning.

I want to be open with her. I want to share this with her, but she won't be able to be proud of me. To her, I'll forever be a lost sheep. As I read *Undivided*, a book about a mother and daughter and their relationship after the daughter converts to Islam, it validates all my fears. The mother brings up repeatedly how she wishes her daughter would return to the fold; she wishes her daughter would just love Jesus.

I want to tell her, but I don't want to destroy her. I don't want to prove all her fears right. I don't want to be the child she's ashamed of, but I""m angry that it would come to that. I'm a good child, some would go so far as to say I'm a good person. I'm intelligent, I've supported myself through college. I've made good choices.

I'm not bad.

But that's all she'd see. If I tell her, I'll just be the lost child. I'll be the prodigal daughter that she hopes comes home. She'll take my lack of faith personally. She'll take my move away from Christianity as a personal failure: both hers and mine. It'll prove to her that I've become immoral, despite the truth related to my morality.

So today has been hard. Today I want to be honest. Today I want to promote my blog, today I want to share my writing. Today I want to be honest, but I can't tell if now is the time. I don't know if there will ever be a time that's right."

I've been a gamer for all my life and regardless of living here i always buy my games and never pirate.
But recently i came across this gorgeous game called Elite: Dangerous. This game is a space simulator with amazing graphics and a very large space to explore. I've always wanted to play a space sim and now that i have an ok PC i thought i should try.
But unfortunately this game is soooo expensive here, it's really absurd. Well that's because the brazilian Real is worth 0,32 cents of a dollar right now :(
But the biggest problem for me is that i recently lost my internship because the company i worked at changed focus and didn't need interns no more, and now i'm having a tough time finding a job that doesn't get in the way of my college schedule.

38jxz3,2,2015-06-04,My boyfriend [25M] can't meet my needs [22F] because of dyslexia?,whatevverrr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38jxz3/my_boyfriend_25m_cant_meet_my_needs_22f_because/,"We've been together a year now and come from very different backgrounds. He's Italian from Ferguson, Missouri and yells and gesticulates and accuses and ""says whatever is on his mind."" It's been an issue for me in the past but he says that's how he's been brought up to communicate. I come from an Asian family and prior relationships that have been quiet, understanding, and resolve conflict in a peaceful manner, as opposed to an explosive one. I don't know how to deal with him. He's tried very hard in the past to do things my way and I have to admit that he's made a lot of progress, but I'm uncomfortable with being yelled at when he slips up.



He also breaks promises all the time. We're apart now for the summer and he had previously promised an entire summer full of activities and trips for the both of us. I planned my family vacation and work for the summer around these plans that we made together, and then he took an internship that prevented all of our plans from happening. That's okay of course and I was happy for him, but the way he told me about it made me feel he'd simply forgotten about everything we'd planned together.



We got through that, and then because we're apart he promised to be home at 10:30 every night to Skype me. It's been 10 days since we've Skyped. He promises to text in the morning and the afternoon, and he doesn't. I'm lucky to hear from him at all until 4:00 pm and after that I'm lucky to exchange 10 texts with him. 



So I broke up with him Saturday (5 days ago). 



The problem is that I love him very much and I know that he loves me more than anyone has loved me before, he just can't show me in a way that I understand. He tells me all the time and when we're together he'll look at me in amazement and be genuine in saying, ""Wow, you're the most beautiful and smartest and kindest woman I've ever met, I'm so lucky to have you.""



I've tried to break up with him in the past, but he convinces me back into it because he says we love each other and that should be enough to want to work things out. Is it? Do you think so?



Now, in talking to him post-breakup (because he's promised to call and Skype to discuss and missed those promises too), I've discovered that he can't grasp the concept of time. He doesn't know how much time is passing or what time of day it is and he mixes numbers up so that he can't give me an accurate estimate of when he'll be available. He's also so incredibly busy at his job that he doesn't have a second to call. He's an artist, and he gets lost in his work and loses track of time ON TOP OF not being able to tell it in the first place. (He has both dyslexia and ADHD and can hardly read.)



Now my problem is that I don't know whether or not I should be sympathetic to this, seeing as I know I'll be able to find someone in the future who is not dyslexic and will meet my needs in the way I need them to be met. Obviously I am very young and I've only had one other long term relationship before, which was very different from this one. He tells me loving each other means that we have to work hard and, honestly, he's improving in every other area that I've asked him to: telling me when he's angry and has to take a moment to calm down, explaining his feelings, using ""I"" statements to avoid blaming me, etc.



I don't know if I should have to hold the hand of a 25 year old man and walk him through the basics of being in a relationship when I could leave him and be happy with someone else who doesn't have dyslexia and ADHD. While those things are the bulk of the issue, it's not only those things that are making him wrong for me. We also communicate in completely different ways and I hate how he yells and screams. But, like I said before, he's trying his best not to and he's doing a lot better. So I guess my question is whether or not I should give up on this. It's been almost a week and I know that either decision I make will be the right one in the end, but I don't know if I want to waste my time trying to change someone that can't change, even if we love each other.










**tl;dr**: My boyfriend has unchangeable traits (family background, dyslexia, ADHD) that keep him from being right for me, but he is trying with all his heart to change them. Should I let him try, or should I move on?

I've been to Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Austria with my family. I'm not interested in taking classes in a foreign language, but I am a poli sci major and I'd love to continue my studies abroad and/or possibly an internship. So far here are the countries I'm thinking and the pros/cons:

-London-
     Pros: English speaking, exciting city, close(?) proximity to Ireland and the coast, ability to visit other countries in europe, my uni offers programs and internship programs there, rich history
Cons: Conventional choice, not as close to other european countries, possible safety concerns, expensive living, not great food (apparently), not as exciting of a natural landscape

-New Zealand-
Pros: gorgeous landscape, lots of adventurous things to do, english speaking, my school offers programs there
cons: less exciting urban life, not much to do outside of the natural stuff, isolated from other countries, not sure about internship programs related to political science

-Greece-
pros: gorgeous, allows traveling to other european countries, school offers program there I think, rich history/sight seeing
cons: concerned about the quality of english classes, might not be the greatest country to learn about government, farther away from other european countries, safety concerns

-Switzerland-
pros: beautiful, close proximity to other european countries, great place to intern with poli sci related programs (if I can find one)
Cons: I've been there before, might get boring

-Australia 
pros: beautiful, great cities, lots to do, english
cons: SPIDERS and other scary shit, isolated, expensive, not sure about internship opportunities

-Mayyyybe Spain-
pros: beautiful, I've heard great things about it, location is prime
cons: not a great place for an internship, I'm kind of sick of learning about Spain from my past spanish classes

-Semester at sea-
pros: I'd be able to see multiple countries, wouldn't get bored with a country, reliable classes in english, interested classes offered, variety of activities and leadership opportunities 

cons: my school doesn't offer a program with it so It would be more expensive, cooped up on a boat, might look like a joke on my transcript (although it's with UVA so I don't know), safety concerns about traveling to India, africa, burma etc., I have a bf and I've heard the boat is a sex haven, 

Has anyone had experiences studying abroad in any of these places and would be able to offer me some insight on any of my pros/cons? "

I'd rather hear some tips and tricks, unless there aren't any.

I have an informal lunch interview with the guy who'll be my boss (if I get the internship) tomorrow and I'm kind of worried. I'm perfectly good at making conversation with random people in informal situations (usually with jokes and funny observations), but I'm completely out of my element in formal or semi-formal settings since even self-deprecating jokes can be inappropriate or damaging.

The internship is IT-related; it's basically systems integration, hardware and software troubleshooting, and creating software packages, which are all things I know how to do. However, I'm a chemical engineering major with not much of an IT background. I recently started learning HTML and CSS, and am relatively proficient in all the high-student-base languages such as MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple. I'm going to try to leverage this internship for a co-op opportunity in the Fall, and I think this may be my last shot at an internship.

Other than that, I don't really know what to talk about. I would feel awkward asking him about his family, recreational pursuits, or dreams, since he's in his 50's or 60's and seems like it wouldn't be organic to the conversation.

I think most of my anxiety stems from the fact that out of the fifteen or so chains of interviews I've given in the past year, only two of them didn't suck. And out of those two, one of those resulted in an internship offer and the other resulted in this interview.

**TL;DR:** Coffee interview tomorrow. I'm awkward. Plz help."

tl;dr: Cancelled and moved wedding once, now FMIL is asking me to do it again but I don't want to

This morning I fought with Mike about how I believed his mother was doing everything in her power to stop us from getting married. Of course he was hurt to hear this but he agreed that his mother had been pretty shady about not informing us about his sister's internship next summer. He also informed me that he fought with his mother last night and that he informed her that he wasn't going to make me move my wedding date again. 

A few hours later Kate sent me a text saying that flying lil' sister home was a stupid idea and to keep the date as is and they will work around it. So that was a nice to hear but my feelings are still hurt and I feel that Mike needs to talk to his mother and REALLY back me up. 

Mike and I are skyping with lil' sis as she's overseas now and are going to explain to her that weddings are planned far out and that she will need to pick another internship that will go around our weeding, her choice. 

Thank you all for your insight and advice, I feel like if this marriage is going to work Mike is gonna have to tell his mom to butt out and stop trying to control our lives as well as stand by me. I fear this will not be the last power struggle but at least this one is over....for now.


   
Edit: Lil Sis hasn't even picked a new internship for next summer...or applied or anything, she had just wanted to go for the same time period (beginning of summer?). She also told me that I should have consulted her before booking my wedding....I had no idea I had to ask everyone if a certain date was okay with them before booking my wedding. I thought that you pick a date and those than can, will make room for your special day. 

Half of you say to tell them to fuck off, the other half are calling me selfish for picking a date and not changing it....again. Guess you can never make everyone happy."
38l7vk,3,2015-06-04,Should I buy a 1992 BMW 325i?,DanniKongur,BMW,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/38l7vk/should_i_buy_a_1992_bmw_325i/,"So my situation is that I will be in the U.S. for about a year for my internship. My commute is about 45-60mins each way, per day, in a less-than-conveniant transportation set up by my employer.
To make my life easier while I'm here, I have been looking to buy a cheap car that would run for that 1 year and preferably also be sold before I leave for some pocket change.
Now for the main reason for this thread: A coworker told me the other day that she and her husband are trying to sell one of their cars, a 1992 BMW 325i. They are the original owners of the cars and have mostly used it for commuting to and from work. I took a look at it today and it seems to be in pretty good condition. The engine seemed to work fine (although it needed to get a jump since it hadnt been started in over a year), the interior wasnt in too bad shape, the outside was fine except for the small patch of rust near the left signal light on the back end. However, the back doors won't open for some reason and the signal/hazard lights and power windows dont work. They have a specified BMW garage that they have been using exclusively for all their maintenance but the car has almost 300.000 miles on it.
They want $1.500 for it, how reasonable is that price? Should I be expecting high maintenance costs throughout the year if I buy it? Any other good suggestioms for buying a used car (in South Carolina)?"
38lf7o,2,2015-06-04,"Me [23 M/F] with my BF [26 M/F] of 4 mo, he frequently searched for/looked at an ex-crush of his on Facebook",damn_you_senioritis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38lf7o/me_23_mf_with_my_bf_26_mf_of_4_mo_he_frequently/,"My boyfriend and I met in college. He graduated a while before me and recently started working at the company he interned the previous summer. When we first started dating, he was honest with me about a crush he had for a girl he met during the internship. And he swear that he was over it at the end of the summer last year. He said that it sucked that once he expressed interests in her, she just tuned him out and it sucked. But whatever, we all had a life before so it didn't really bother me at all. That girl is due to start working fulltime at his office this fall(pretty small startup, so they'll have plenty of interactions at work I'm sure).

A month after we started dating (long distance), he told me he was going to have dinner with his intern mentor from last summer and another previous female intern, which didn't bother me at all either -- he was new to the city and I was glad he could hang out with his friends. After that dinner, I started to wonder and asked if this was the same girl he had a crush on. And he said yes. I was a little upset that he didn't bother to tell me. But still, he's over it and they'll be co-workers. Plus I totally trust that he's not the type to cheat. So I got over that pretty quickly too.

A couple weeks ago, I moved out here and is staying at his place temporarily. He gave me access to his desktop so I can play games on it. While he was at work, I was opened a browser to launch facebook and mindlessly clicked on the facebook search bar. Turns out he's still logged into his facebook and this girl's name is right on top of his ""previously searched"" list. It made me a bit uneasy to see that, so I checked his facebook search history. Turns out, he searches this girl's name quiet regularly. Before we started dating (while we were flirting on fb chat and all that), he would search for my name and her name almost daily. After we started dating, the search frequency for both of our names died down for a bit. But in the recent two month, he would search for this ex-crush's name sometime 5 times a day, some time 3 times a week. But he stopped searching for my name in the meantime. This re-surfaced search pattern bugged the hell out of me and I messaged him right after I saw it. He was weirded out and didn't think he would search it all that much. He apologized and tried his best to make everything right and prove it to me that he really doesn't have feelings for this girl, including voluntarily delete her from his facebook. Open up his message log to prove that he has not talked to her since March and didn't actually try to start conversations with her at all. During this whole thing, he didn't try to turn the event on me and blame me for breaching his trust or privacy at all. But he did feel a little hurt that I don't trust him or think he had lingering feelings for someone else. He didn't think he did anything wrong by searching her on facebook that frequently. And he defines ""emotional cheating"" as something you have to act on, whereas I think he lied by omission, just like what he did the first time by not telling me he had dinner with his ex-crush.

So now a couple weeks has passed, and he's still super affectionate and we have a lot of good times together. But I'm just having a hard time getting over this. He pretty much give me an open door policy to his phone and computer. And he promise to tell me all the future non-work related contact he has with this girl. And promise he won't hang out with her alone etc etc. Aside from this, he has never given me a reason not to trust him. But I just have trouble knowing that, in a couple month, he'll be working in close proximity with a girl he pretty much stalked for a year on facebook.

Reddit, I'm crazy or over-jealous? Did he really not do anything wrong?



   
**tl;dr**: loving and loyal BF sometimes searches his ex-crush's name on facebook, to a degree that most of his top autocomplete results when he type in facebook directs the browser to her profile page."
38ljn3,8,2015-06-04,"Alright, I just need a SHIT ton of trap",santasmic,trap,https://www.reddit.com/r/trap/comments/38ljn3/alright_i_just_need_a_shit_ton_of_trap/,"TL;DR post a long ass trap playlist from SoundCloud please

I'm interning this summer at a software company, writing code pretty much every day. I'm allowed to listen to music and it's pretty much the only thing keeping me focused day in and out. Staring at a screen for 8 hours sucks.

I'm a goodie two shoes kind of guy, I don't really go crazy or anything. I mean, I go out on the weekends, but for God's sake I'm working a software internship. But I have a hidden love of trap, I don't know why, but the heavy bass line keeps me on task for hours at a time.

Unfortunately I've gone through my normal plays lists pretty fast as I'm listening to music 5+ hours a day.

So, if you could just post long, long play lists of trap, I'd appreciate it. I don't need the highest quality banger big house edm rave shit, as long as it's in general trap and it's not awful I'll listen to it. 

Particularly calming or smooth, deep trap. But anything works. I only want SoundCloud because it kills my battery the least.

Also, if you're an aspiring trap artist, just link to your account and I'll go through your stuff.

Thanks so much!"
38lvm4,3,2015-06-04,I need to talk about my sexual assault - the prospect of getting tested for STIs is bringing everything back and I need to deal with my guilt,testedthrowaway1,rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/38lvm4/i_need_to_talk_about_my_sexual_assault_the/,"I just wanted to talk about my sexual assault somewhere, because I'm finally realizing it wasn't my fault, and that even though he didn't have sex with me, it was still assault and that my feelings about it are justified. I know this is a huge wall of text, but part of the humiliation for me is my relationship with him and another guy involved, so I wanted to write it out.


Over a year ago, I lived in a college internship house with about a dozen other people. I'll call two of them X and Y. One of the first days we were all there, we partied and drank a lot. X started dancing with me and trying to kiss me. I was drunk, happy to be where I was, and thought, why not? so I kissed him back. Neither of us mentioned it after that, and I understood it to be a one time thing, a drunk kiss that didn't mean anything, and our lives went forward. I wasn't interested in X and he never made a move at me. 

Fast forward two months, and I started dating his roommate, Y. We went on a few dates over a few weeks, and decided to call it of because we were incompatible. During that time, Y and I fooled around a bit, enough for me to stop him and tell him that I was a virgin and hadn't done much before. At one point, he put his hand down my pants and rubbed my clit a bit, but that was it. Even after we had called it off, I had feelings for him for a while later. 

Fast forward another month, and we're all getting ready to move out. We partied and drank again, and some of us hung out in the backyard. Eventually as people began to go in, it became just me and X. I was drunk, but not terribly so. At one point I high fived X for something, and he grabbed my hand and forced me into his lap, and held me there. At this point I was scared and knew what he wanted, but was intimidated and confused enough (drunk, remember) that I didn't try to get away. X was huge, a ~300 lb football player, and I'm quite petite, if that puts it in perspective. X started bringing up how we had kissed a while back, and asked what had happened between me and Y. I told him, and X ranted on about how much he hated Y (lots of reasons, they were very different people). He said Y had told him and their other roommate that I was a virgin, and X teased me for it. I was embarrassed and angry, but still didn't leave. Then X demanded to know why I never dated *him*, and I bluntly told him I didn't want to and wasn't interested. His tone was accusatory, even though he had never made a move! 

Still on his lap, he started kissing me, and I was so confused by it all that I kissed him back. For some reason in my drunk state it felt rude to not reciprocate. When he started moving down to my pants, I protested. He persisted and kept talking the whole time, about my virginity, about why I should let him continue, until I gave up saying no. I stopped kissing him and stopped participating entirely, but he continued to escalate things until he was fingering me, rubbing his penis against my crotch, and clothes had come off, all while periodically I had been saying no and being shut down. Eventually I became so uncomfortable that I managed to get off of him, despite protests that he wouldn't come on me or I was giving him blue balls. 

I went back inside, with him right behind me. To my embarrassment, Y was sitting just inside and saw both of us. I tried to laugh off the obvious situation Y had found us in, because I still had feelings for him, and left the room. X closed the door behind me and immediately told Y all about how I had jumped on him, kissed him, etc.  X even invented dialogue that I had said as I ""seduced"" him. I stood behind the door with tears in my eyes - I still liked Y, and here X was using me as a tool, a conquest, to one-up him because he didn't like Y and felt entitled to my body because I had let him kiss me months before. 

*****
I felt guilty about this for almost a year after, because I had kissed him back at first, and I hadn't kicked and screamed and fought back. Because of my guilt, I never reported him. 

I have a gyno appointment tomorrow and I'm realizing that I should get checked for STIs from X (I've never been sexually active before or since), and the prospect of talking about it and facing it in any way is making all these feelings come back. I keep thinking, it's just not fair, because X got to take advantage of me and brag to his roommate about it, and never considered that I was a human being, that I had my own life outside of gratifying him, and meanwhile I get to live with feeling disgusting and humiliated a year and a half later- I can still hardly talk to Y, because I'm angry that he told so many people about my lack of sexual history, and I'm embarrassed because he thinks I threw myself at X when it couldn't be more false. And because X had a Kentucky accent, I still can't hear those accents without feeling uncomfortable. It's stupid, but the little things won't leave me alone. X's name is also really common, so I hear it everywhere.

If anyone read it all, thanks. I know it was a lot to get through. I just needed to get it out there before I bring up my need to get tested tomorrow. I'm scared and if anyone has any words of comfort or advice, I'd appreciate it. Thanks."

38ma8u,3,2015-06-04,Coworker Situation,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/38ma8u/coworker_situation/,"Cringy and long, but caught the dreaded feels so I needed to type this out whether it gets read or not.

So I share a cubicle with an astonishingly attractive girl (9.2/10 face and body) who is now only here for 4 more months as an intern and we quickly developed some simply unreal chemistry (potentially on a level I haven't felt before which is why I got kinda neurotic).

After 2 months of heavy flirting, we hooked up after a night out with coworkers and friends. (Made out/danced for 2 hours at the club, continued at my place. Tried to escalate by taking her pants off, got some resistance but eventually got em off but she kept closing her legs etc. At this point we are both drunk and exhausted so I say fuck it and went to take a piss and come back and we pass out with her head on my shoulder.

She leaves way early before I get up (says she was sweaty) and I get the ""thanks for the great night :)"" text.  Thought I was in for 4 months of plate fun and work shenanigans.

Try to make dinner plans (yeah..I know, been wanting to try this place for a while though, this was a good excuse) that night but she's busy. We decided the next day was cool.
Texted her early here and there and kept getting the hour later reply deal. Told her I made reservations for 2 at 7:30. Around 5:30, said ""getting hungry"". And she replied ""kind of..."". A couple back and forth 20 min in between texts. Asked if she wanted to postpone cause I get the whole not reply right away thing, but we're trying to make fucking plans here. ""I'm coming""

Her body language was way off when we met up, dinner was OK, didn't try to kiss her at the end of the night (probably huge mistake), she didn't want to come back to my place (logistics were certainly in line). 

Next day at work wanted to clear the air.told her to meet me outside the office. Said let's be clear with each other since we work together. Kissed her, ""you're a beautiful girl, etc"" ...Told her I'd really like to spend time and explore the city while she's in town. ""it seemed like you didn't want to go to dinner, what's up?"" ""do you want to stay colleagues and nothing more?"" 
She says ""friends is cool...what do you think?"" Then I proceeded probably spout my mouth too much and don't even really remember what I said. Went back to the office.

Got busy at work, didn't really pay much attention to her for 2 days (headphones in, facing a bit away from her). She says ""Did I say something wrong?"" ""Why are you ignoring me?"" I was actually busy but certainly wasn't initiating convo and flirting like normal. ""Nah just busy""

Ended up talking again in private and I said ""No I'm not mad or ignoring you, Just been busy and not exactly sure what happened between Friday(the club) and Sunday(Dinner). She said she was hungover. I said you clearly didn't want to go. She said I imagined it. 

I said I still don't get it, let's go back to work. I was basically thinking fuck it, next girl, this is a huge distraction and she's leaving in 4 months, but I really enjoyed our chemistry (haven't felt it on that level before) so it was fucking tough to ignore this girl that I can see out of the corner of my eye for 40 hours a week.

Things kind of went back to normal. Got flirty again...At one point she was sucking on a lollipop and comes over and puts it in my mouth, rubs the back of my head when she leaves the cubicle a couple times

Today found out some dude bought her flowers (they were under her desk). Pretty confident she went out to lunch with him (put on perfume right before leaving the office for an hour and a half - same perfume I told her I could smell in my bed for 2 days and she knows I fucking love). Not happy about this.

The rest of the day I was pretty dialed in..headphones in etc, pretty much ignoring her besides work related issues. Avoided eye contact a couple times (probably super obvious). She left for work and rubbed my damn head again (god I love that).

I'm really not that bummed about the other dude in principal, it's the fact that I was honestly looking forward to spending a lot of time with her while she's here - and I think she's been going around town with this dude.

I am still very attracted to her, and pretty much any time I talk to her she's super receptive.
Do I need to clear the air again - be super up-front, tell her I know she's seeing some other guy but I don't give a fuck and to come out with me as well/instead? Just ask her out again? Remain stoic and professional (not my default state)? Go back to normal flirtatiousness, but not bring up us hooking up again and see where it goes?



TLDR: hooked up with coworker (cubicle mate), got mixed signals (probably gave them myself as well), might have inadvertently friendzoned myself, found out she might be fucking some other guy, still getting signals...best way to play out the next 3 months to avoid toxic work environment and maintain mental sanity).

38mj7t,9,2015-06-05,Weird reaction at work,vickevlar,Trichsters,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trichsters/comments/38mj7t/weird_reaction_at_work/,"This might just be venting a bit. A small ""incident"" at work as left me feeling very weird, and while normally I'm pretty open with boyfriend about my thoughts and feelings about my trich, in this case I see him going into an unhelpful overprotective mode. 


I've had trich for about 14 years, and I had been managing it to a level I was satisfied with for a while until I started a year-long internship last July. It was stressful, emotionally draining, and just generally not right for me for ages, although it has cooled down lately since I'm so close to being done. My pulling at work has not cooled down, though. It's been totally out of hand this whole time. It stinks that it affects the way my hair looks, but what I really hate is picking something off the ground and realizing how much hair accumulates around me. You don't notice from above because the carpet is dark. I always try to scoop up as much as I can and throw it away in a tissue (or several). I'm also always needing to brush it off my desk into the trash. Fortunately, I am sequestered away in a corner cubicle, working by myself, and rarely have anyone even walking by to see me pull or to see hair everywhere.


The other day, though, I came in to the office later in the afternoon because I had a technical issue with my computer, and when I arrived, there was a big balled up wad of my hair sitting next to my computer, like someone had scooped up a bunch from the floor and left it for me on my desk. It was so bizarre that I didn't even know how to react to it; I just threw it out and pretended nothing had happened. But I can't stop thinking about it now.

 
Usually people find other people's hair pretty gross, so who would actually scrape their hands on the floor for someone else's hair and ball it up? Then not throwing it away and leaving it on my desk, the only reason that makes sense to me is to embarrass or shame the person, which isn't cool but the thing that sticks in my mind is just how odd it is. Despite my hatred of my internship, I know everyone in the office &amp; they're pretty nice and friendly, and since I'm just a temporary intern working on my own thing I don't even really ""work"" with any of them except my supervisor in any meaningful way; all our interactions are for the sake of being social and it's cordial. The only candidates I can think of are maybe if an IT person had to crawl under my desk to plug in something, found hair and for some reason decided to try to make me feel bad, though the computer problem I was having really shouldn't have needed anyone to do that, or if a cleaning person got tired of my shit, although I sometimes stay late enough to see them and have never seen them do anything other than empty the trash bins. The only other possibility is that it's someone who is usually friendly to me.


So it was creepy and weird. Over the years, my feelings about the disorder have bounced around a bit, but usually it's about how I want myself to look. This is the first time where ""avoiding other people's reactions"" have really factored in. Just another reason why I can't wait to get out of here. Thanks for listening. "

Dingaling. I know -- a funny last name. The kids used to tease me all
the time, so I stayed to myself, studied hard and got good grades. When I got

&gt;be Jeff, 21. Your resident Chiraqi. Driven out of retirement, and is way too old for this shit.

&gt;be The Sausage Bouquet, 18-21 (or at least the people there - minus Puck and Clay). My friend group.

&gt;still don't be Trenchcoat Guy, 24. Thankfully minus trenchcoat. Was cut off long ago.

---

I thought that it was over. I thought I could live my life in California, free from the stresses of the Neckbeard Mafia, medical card by my side, and hanging out with my friends down there. In the four months I could afford to fly back, I could work on my internship, throw some parties with my friends from my town, and have fun. Of course, that was way too much to expect, and the results have driven me back to you guys.

Every month or so, my friend Lilly drives down to see me. I've never mentioned Lilly in passing, but she's a friend from college who lives in Milwaukee. She's also very well-connected in my friend group, and she's pretty great. Lilly is very blunt – she's even less afraid than I am to say what's on her mind, and she's one of the few people who can hold her own with me in a matter of how dark we are. Essentially, imagine a female, more socially awkward version of me, and you have Lilly.

So this Tuesday, she got off of work and drove down to see me because she told Hulk and Mrs. Hulk that she wanted to go to their wedding. Since the entire Sausage Bouquet got off of work, and we needed to pre-game a bit before the big party, we all decided to have one last wings night before we went on the road. Eight people decided to show up to this event – me, Tony, Phil, Kaner, Ffej, Bigsby, Lexi, and Lilly. Since my house is closest in the group and we were going to go to Peoria, we met up there, smoked, and drove on our way.

The group had some time to kill, so we decided to browse the mall and grab a few extra entertainment needs. Our first stop was FYE – the same FYE where the cockblocking incident happened – because Bigsby was too broke to buy an auxiliary adapter for his car and he wanted some CDs. Lilly was off on her own in the rock section, because she (and some of the rest of the group) is fairly grungy, and I was off browsing the hip-hop section with Bigsby, Tony and Lexi. I saw an album I liked, showed the group, and had plans to buy it once they approved. Everything was fine... until the distinctive drawl of the employee on shift caught my ear.

&gt;”YOU GUYS FINDING EVERYTHING OKAY?”

No. It couldn't be him. I scared him off, and Ma Dukes burned what was left of the bridge between us. He couldn't be talking to us, and he surely would have backed off if I was there. Right? *Right?*

Then, I looked up. If his monotone didn't confirm my fears, the mediocre goatee did. Some sadistic, vengeful god had re-introduced Trenchcoat Guy into my life. He was a bit character now, but regardless, he was back, and apparently undeterred from talking to me and my friends. Last time he upgraded from a bit role, he essentially forced his way from background extra into one of the creepier antagonists of my life. I was justifiably pretty anxious about him actually recognizing me, so I turned around. Bigsby sensed something was wrong and wound up bailing me out.

&gt;”Yeah, I think we're fine.”

&gt;”HOW ABOUT YOU?”

This time, he was talking to Lilly, very clearly staring at her chest. This would be the point where I'd step in and take the bullet for my friend, but she handled herself well when it came to creeps. Instead of faking having a boyfriend or being disinterested in a relationship, she'd just tell guys who were coming onto her too hard to back off. Considering his off-putting nature, I knew she'd rip this kid apart, and that he'd be an emotionally destroyed man at the end.

&gt;”I'm good.”

&gt;”WELL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST LET ME KNOW AND I'LL BE THERE,” he said with a wink.

&gt;”I'm not into you, dude. Fuck off.”

His face was a mixture of “How did she know I liked her” and “Well, fuck”. After being rejected, he just trudged over to his perch behind the register and stood there, waiting for people to come by. I texted Bigsby to pick up the album for me and that I'd pay him back, left FYE with Lilly, and we hid in the GameStop across the mall until he left. By some ungodly miracle, even though I was wearing the same Toews jersey that I wore in the previous stories, he never noticed me walk out, and my friends texted me when I left.

She had heard my stories about Trenchcoat Guy, but she never thought she'd have to deal with him firsthand. I'm not worried about her – he doesn't have me on Facebook, and he doesn't have any mutual friends in my group, so they have no pathway to find each other. Unless we stop there when she's visiting, she won't ever have to deal with the kid again. Either way, she didn't seem shaken up by it, but was more surprised that one of the main villains of my life story had his eye on her.

I'm guessing he approached us because he recognized some of the group from Anyville High, but he didn't seem to notice me between the throwback Nuggets hat (that I switched to the back when he was looking away to disguise myself) and the Toews jersey (although I've worn it pretty frequently for so long that I was wearing it during Episode 3, it's one of the least distinguishable articles of clothing anyone in Illinois could wear).

Everything was going well between us until I left for an internship abroad. We used to be very close with each other and we were sharing everything. We were spending every day together and I really loved him, we were having the same friends and we were never bored. Since I moved things between us changed. He was very defending and every time we had an argument he would find a way to hurt me. Although he is visiting quite often, in our anniversary he did not come, something that hurt me a lot. In my birthday he booked tickets but he missed the flight, when I was trying to discuss with him, he was accusing me that I do not understand how hard it is now that I have left. In the past every time I asked for help in anything, he was always there for me, now I asked him to help me find a job after my internship and he is not helpful at all. I was trying to understand why he was so distant and to find if  hurt him somehow, but apart from the distance, I never changed my behavior towards him.  For months we are discussing the same problems all over again and we are not able to change anything or to solve them. I do not know what to do, sometimes I do not even want him to come and I am thinking how I should react  when I see him. I stopped trusting him that much and I am keeping things from him.I do not see him with the same way anymore. I used to adore him and admire him, now sometimes I feel sorry for him because he is not trying enough to achieve his goals. I do not understand how can a person who always was sweet and kind, to become so arrogant and negative. He told me many times that it is a mistake that I left and that I hurt him with this decision. He is my first relationship so I have never faced a breakup before.All of my friends here who had a bf have already broke up and they advice me to do the same, but I never cheated neither did him and nothing extreme ever happened between us so how can I be sure if I should end this relationship or not?

So now I usually study for my exam or roam the internet. I'm not sure how theyre going to evaluate me at the end of the term if they have nothing to evaluate me on. 

I feel so useless, unproductive, and like I'm not learning anything here. My manager suggested I read a ratemaking manual in my free time.

One of the other interns has a ton of work, and stays late a lot. I'm sure I can help out some other team in the department, but I don't know who I would approach about this, and whether that's even an acceptable thing to do.

Does anyone have any experience with this? "

All of these posts appear to be from an intern who is going into big 4 with more secrets than Dolly Parton keeps in her hair. /r/Accounting is this the same person with all these same throwaways? Is this one enormous troll giving themselves a pat on the back? Is this Chipman_69 from the [going concern forums](http://www.goingconcern.com)? Who knows?!

&gt;be Jeff, 21. Your resident Chiraqi. Driven out of retirement, and is way too old for this shit.

&gt;be The Sausage Bouquet, 18-21 (or at least the people there - minus Puck and Clay). My friend group.

&gt;still don't be Trenchcoat Guy, 24. Thankfully minus trenchcoat. Was cut off long ago.

---

I thought that it was over. I thought I could live my life in California, free from the stresses of the Neckbeard Mafia, medical card by my side, and hanging out with my friends down there. In the four months I could afford to fly back, I could work on my internship, throw some parties with my friends from my town, and have fun. Of course, that was way too much to expect, and the results have driven me back to you guys.

Every month or so, my friend Lilly drives down to see me. I've never mentioned Lilly in passing, but she's a friend from college who lives in Milwaukee. She's also very well-connected in my friend group, and she's pretty great. Lilly is very blunt – she's even less afraid than I am to say what's on her mind, and she's one of the few people who can hold her own with me in a matter of how dark we are. Essentially, imagine a female, more socially awkward version of me, and you have Lilly.

So this Tuesday, she got off of work and drove down to see me because she told Hulk and Mrs. Hulk that she wanted to go to their wedding. Since the entire Sausage Bouquet got off of work, and we needed to pre-game a bit before the big party, we all decided to have one last wings night before we went on the road. Eight people decided to show up to this event – me, Tony, Phil, Kaner, Ffej, Bigsby, Lexi, and Lilly. Since my house is closest in the group and wings were on sale, we met up there, smoked, and drove on our way.

The group had some time to kill, so we decided to browse the mall and grab a few extra entertainment needs. Our first stop was FYE – the same FYE where the cockblocking incident happened – because Bigsby was too broke to buy an auxiliary adapter for his car and he wanted some CDs. Lilly was off on her own in the rock section, because she (and some of the rest of the group) is fairly grungy, and I was off browsing the hip-hop section with Bigsby, Tony and Lexi. I saw an album I liked, showed the group, and had plans to buy it once they approved. Everything was fine... until the distinctive drawl of the employee on shift caught my ear.

&gt;”YOU GUYS FINDING EVERYTHING OKAY?”

No. It couldn't be him. I scared him off, and Ma Dukes burned what was left of the bridge between us. He couldn't be talking to us, and he surely would have backed off if I was there. Right? *Right?*

Then, I looked up. If his monotone didn't confirm my fears, the mediocre goatee did. Some sadistic, vengeful god had re-introduced Trenchcoat Guy into my life. He was a bit character now, but regardless, he was back, and apparently undeterred from talking to me and my friends. Last time he upgraded from a bit role, he essentially forced his way from background extra into one of the creepier antagonists of my life. I was justifiably pretty anxious about him actually recognizing me, so I turned around. Bigsby sensed something was wrong and wound up bailing me out.

&gt;”Yeah, I think we're fine.”

&gt;”HOW ABOUT YOU?”

This time, he was talking to Lilly, very clearly staring at her chest. This would be the point where I'd step in and take the bullet for my friend, but she handled herself well when it came to creeps. Instead of faking having a boyfriend or being disinterested in a relationship, she'd just tell guys who were coming onto her too hard to back off. Considering his off-putting nature, I knew she'd rip this kid apart, and that he'd be an emotionally destroyed man at the end.

&gt;”I'm good.”

&gt;”WELL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST LET ME KNOW AND I'LL BE THERE,” he said with a wink.

&gt;”I'm not into you, dude. Fuck off.”

His face was a mixture of “How did she know I liked her” and “Well, fuck”. After being rejected, he just trudged over to his perch behind the register and stood there, waiting for people to come by. I texted Bigsby to pick up the album for me and that I'd pay him back, left FYE with Lilly, and we hid in the GameStop across the mall until he left. By some ungodly miracle, even though I was wearing the same Toews jersey that I wore in the previous stories, he never noticed me walk out, and my friends texted me when I left.

She had heard my stories about Trenchcoat Guy, but she never thought she'd have to deal with him firsthand. I'm not worried about her – he doesn't have me on Facebook, and he doesn't have any mutual friends in my group, so they have no pathway to find each other. Unless we stop there when she's visiting, she won't ever have to deal with the kid again. Either way, she didn't seem shaken up by it, but was more surprised that one of the main villains of my life story had his eye on her.

I'm guessing he approached us because he recognized some of the group from Anyville High, but he didn't seem to notice me between the throwback Nuggets hat (that I switched to the back when he was looking away to disguise myself) and the Toews jersey (although I've worn it pretty frequently for so long that I was wearing it during Episode 3, it's one of the least distinguishable articles of clothing anyone in Illinois could wear). 

I have no clue if he recognized me but just didn't want to say hi, or wanted to stay professional, or just straight up didn't realize I was part of that group now, and I don't care to find out firsthand. Feel free to post your own thoughts about if he recognized me here. If anything notable happens this summer (since guys' nights are usually when we're out), I'll definitely report back and tell you all what's been going on.

Until then, if a guy working at an FYE in Central Illinois starts talking to you and you get creepy vibes... pay no attention to the man behind the trenchcoat."
38pfha,17,2015-06-05,Question regarding my education,slokenafk,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/38pfha/question_regarding_my_education/,"Hi all. Sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I wanted to look to some people with experience. 

So I have been going to school for 4 years now. I'm about to complete my associates. I wasn't able to finish my associates in 2 years due to being miss advised and due to tuition costs. 

Anyway I major in IT with a focus on networking. Last summer I landed an internship at a college in NYC. They liked me enough to hire me and I have been here since. Today the college president offered for me to go to school here for free. Only problem is they don't offer any IT programs. I am considering going for a management degree and then doing certs for IT  related things. 

I guess I'm just kinda confused what to do here. The free tuition combined with the idea of working and going to school in the same place seems really appealing. I just don't want to go to school here and not be able to find a job afterwards. 

Any opinions or experience?"

38pjgx,0,2015-06-05,Getting into programming apps is relatively easy. How do you actually become good at it?,[deleted],iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/38pjgx/getting_into_programming_apps_is_relatively_easy/,"After teaching myself Python (the syntax anyway), I decided to enroll in college as a Computer Science major for my freshmen year. The program teaches us in depth C++ over the course of our degree and I really liked it and will definitely go into that career field. Midway through my second semester, I decided I wanted to be programming more than I was for classes and I wanted to feel like I was actually making something instead of staring at a black terminal learning about quick sort. Like many others I turned to iOS programming and I bought a decent Mac Mini and starting learning. Learning how to program basic apps and learning the ropes isn't too difficult. There are dozens of tutorials and programs and tons of different routes to take. Over the past 3-4 months I have been learning Swift and how to use XCode, and I now have my very own app on the App Store! I'm pretty proud of it and it really is awesome to see your own name on the App Store.

Anyway, after learning what I will call the ""basics"", where do you go from there? Is it natural to just tackle each problem as you run into it and just learn through solving your own issues? Am I supposed to read about things before I need to use them? When am I considered experienced enough to confidently apply for internships? My fear is that while I *could* keep creating decent apps with the skills I have now, I won't grow as much as I need to as a developer to be taken seriously if I do.

TLDR: Learning to make basic apps is easy, how do I learn about the next levels?"

I am a Canadian citizen who participated in an internship in the US last summer (2014) with the J1 working VISA. I was being taxed 26% off of each paycheck and I know it's late but I would like to file my taxes. I have figured out that I need to use my W-2 to fill out the 1040nr-ez but I have a few questions.

1. Is there any additional information I need to provide besides the filled out 1040nr-ez with the W2 attached?

2. Is it safe to mail these forms with all my information/SSN/etc?

3. I am asked for my ""immigration status"" at the end of the 2014 tax year... I had been back in Canada for 4 months at that point and nothing but a Canadian citizen. What do I put here?

4. Is it too late to file my taxes? I know in Canada that the tax deadline is hard if you owe money, but if the gov. owes you money you can file whenever, is it the same in the US?

Thanks so much, any help would be greatly appreciated.

38pox9,1,2015-06-05,Somebody Just Give Me A Job,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/38pox9/somebody_just_give_me_a_job/,"How freaking hard should it be for me to land a job after graduating with a bachelors of science in electrical engineering? I'm in a place that has tons and tons of high-tech companies that have jobs relevant to my degree and what I want to pursue, and yet I get phone interviews maybe once every couple of weeks, with person-to-person interviews few and far between. I graduated with a decent cumulative GPA (a 3.48), but I unfortunately never landed an internship. I certainly tried the last couple of summers but through a combination of me sucking at having conversational skills and just bad luck, I never got one.

But that shouldn't mean I can't be able to get a job after graduating. If it is, then I'm fucked and there's no way I'll ever get a job. I'm so tired of getting on my computer every day, going to indeed and searching for jobs. I always set the search to limit results within the last day because otherwise I'll just find repeats of jobs I've already looked at or applied to. My resume focuses on my project experiences (which really, *really* are not that bad, *at all*! I have lots of great engineering project experiences), because I don't have any decent work experience to show. 

It's been a month since I graduated, and I've been searching for jobs since last Fall.

I'm starting to think I need to just find a stupid retail job, but every time I think about it, I feel like they're not going to want to hire me because I'm way overqualified for such a position, and they'll probably think I'll leave as soon as I get an offer for a real job. Which is entirely true.

I've been depressed and have had anxiety for the greater part of a 
year too. It hurts me on the inside to see so many of my peers who have already obtained jobs. Going on Facebook is risky and can sometimes make me feel like a freaking loser.

38pr01,158,2015-06-05,Me [37 M] trying to deal with [24 F] potential stalker,Dealing_with_a_Crazy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38pr01/me_37_m_trying_to_deal_with_24_f_potential_stalker/,"So I have what my buddies describe as a crazy dream.  I have this really hot new hire that seems to be into me, which would normally be great but she is also super young and potentially a stalker.

Here is the deal.  We work in the same building but not on the same project or anything.  We cross paths in the cafeteria and in the garage but outside of that don't really interact on a daily thing.  Our first meeting was back in April at an office happy hour thing.  It seemed to be a pleasant conversation and we hit it off for a few hours and then went our separate ways.

We would cross paths a few times in the hall or the company cafeteria, but would just smile or stop and make small talk.  Then about two weeks ago I was sitting having lunch outside by myself and she came and joined me out of the blue.  We laughed and joked and then finished up and I went back to work.  When I came out that night to leave for work she was sitting on my motorcycle waiting for me.  She asked if I would take her for a ride around the block but I explained to her that I only had one helmet and riding in our city without one could get us a ticket.  I know weak excuse and my buddies gave me flack for it, but honestly I am weird about safety when I ride.  I told her maybe another time then went home.  Two days later I am at my gym finishing up and I get a tap on my shoulder.  Its the intern!  We talked and she told me she just joined, to which I thought nothing about and then I went on my way.  

Now I am not going to like,  I was thinking of maybe asking her out, but I really don't want to screw around with my job and career just over a hot girl whom I may or may not have anything in common with.  I talked it over with my friends and well many feel the same way with a few that live for the moment and others that put more thought into actions.  The next day (last week) she joins me for lunch again.  We get to talking some more and she told me she wasn't sure about joining a gym but after talking to a few people and seeing that I worked out there she decided to give it a shot.  Fast forward to last night where I get a strange knock on my door.  I open it up and who is there, you guessed it the Intern girl.  She said she was in the neighborhood and wanted to know if I wanted to go out for dinner and some beers.  Now I am a bit creep-ed out and ask her to how she knows where I live, to which she states she peaked at my employee file (she works in HR as an intern there).  I tell her this is not acceptable and ask her to leave because I already have plans to which she apologizes and leaves.

Now I know she is young, so some of this might be impetuous mistakes, but I am honestly a little freaked out by this.  I don't know if I should report this to HR (where she works) or let this go.  I mean I don't think I've done anything to lead her on, I have not asked her out, slept with her, or even do anything outside of have lunch with her.  I'm not trying to get her fired nor ruin my career in any way.  One of my friends seems to think if I just went out with her she would calm down, but I don't think I want to encourage the behavior and end up with a dead animal nailed to my door or something.  I am not sure if I go to HR and say ""hey, your intern is looking into my personal file and showing up where I work out and at my home"" if they would believe it.  She also seems genuinely nice and sincere in conversation so I don't want to ruin her life if it was just a stupid mistake we make as a kid type thing.  I also don't want to assume that because of this she is interested in me then try to have a talk with her and have her come across as if I'm at fault here.  What is the best way for me to protect myself and proceed from here?  Am I over reacting or making a big deal out of nothing?



   
**tl;dr**: Met an intern at company happy hour, she went into my HR file and started appearing where I hang out.  Not sure how to deal with the situation."
38ptgs,19,2015-06-05,"I keep getting interviews and potential job offers, but no follow up..",wafflebread,blackladies,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/38ptgs/i_keep_getting_interviews_and_potential_job/,"I guess I haven't been out of grad school for too long (3 weeks). I'm in the animation/motion graphics/design industry. I've applied to maybe...30ish jobs? And I've actually gotten quite a lot of phone interviews and in-person interviews. So I know my portfolio and resume is attracting people. But I just haven't gotten any committed offers.

The last week of school, I got an interview for an internship at a animation and design company. Through email they seemed super excited to meet me. But when I got to the interview...and it's a different person than the woman I talked to over email. The guy didn't seem interested in talking with me AT ALL. Like, I had to pull his teeth to even get more description about what my job duties would be. I even got an email after that interview from the original lady I spoke with asking if I was still interested in the position. I said I was...no reply.

A week ago I actually got a call from a different advertising company that wanted me to do freelance work that would pay really well. The guy who would head the project said he believed I could do the work, and just wanted to meet me and other people at the company before I got started. I was out of town and said I'd love to meet the following Monday.

I emailed him asking to meet. Got no reply. Called him and he didn't pick up. Left a message. He finally emailed me back said they were super busy, but we could meet Thursday. I emailed again trying to confirm. Thursday has passed. So I'm pretty sure that job has fallen through, or they just found someone else.

I guess I haven't been looking long enough to just assume that I'm being looked over because I'm black. But yesterday I took my picture down from my website just to see if I get any better luck. With LinkedIn, though, people can still see what I look like. Also I'm not bragging, but if you google my name a few big awards I've won and pictures of me will come up. So I can't really hide what I look like if someone is looking to find out..

Anywho I was just wondering if you ladies have dealt with similar things and if you had any advice when interviewing on how to deal with this. I know I need to work on my portfolio more for some of the positions I've been applying too, but I am starting to feel like something wrong is happening at the actual interview stage. :/ I'll find something soon, though!"
38pztb,2,2015-06-05,Squidward's suicide,Mesytry,ShitShortStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitShortStories/comments/38pztb/squidwards_suicide/,"I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn't one.

I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn't paid of course, most internships aren't, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would go crazy over it.

Now, since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I'll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the SpongeBob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premiere that set everyone and everything back for several months.

Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ""Fear of a Krabby Patty"" and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn't final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ""How sex doesn't work"" instead of ""Rock-a-bye-Bivalve"" when SpongeBob and Patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ""Squidward's Suicide"" we didn't think it more than a morbid joke.

One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidward practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear SpongeBob laughing outside and Squidward stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. SpongeBob says okay and goes to see Sandy with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward's concert. This is when things began to seem off.

While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (at this point sound is synced up with animation, so, yes, that's not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight murmuring in the crowd before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malice in it. Squidward's in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with SpongeBob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people's eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at each other, obviously confused, but since we weren't the writers, we didn't question its appeal to children yet.

The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn't very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It's as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward's sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.

Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I've had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced.

The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn't have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road.

The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child's death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke.

The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you'd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo.

The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer's shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed.

About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his tentacles down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams.

Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames.

The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink.

The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Squidward was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said ""DO IT"" and we see in Squidward's hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what's left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends.

Mr. Hillenburg is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know what the heck was going on. Most people left the room at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I'm sorry I stayed.

The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and to this day nobody does.

There was an investigation due to the nature of the photos, but nothing came of it. No child seen was identified and no clues were gathered from the data involved nor physical clues in the photos. I never believed in unexplainable phenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can't prove anything about it beyond anecdotal evidence, I think twice about things.

    &gt;&gt; to save up for the move, but would prefer that it be in a closer related

    &gt;&gt; with HTML, CSS, and for the most part, jQuery. I understand, but haven't
    &gt;&gt; written anything yet in PHP. Along with that, I had a class in C++, but
    &gt;&gt; haven't really been able to implement anything like that in web design, but
    &gt;&gt; it does help me understand things like arrays, loops, if/else statements,
    &gt;&gt; etc. I am willing to work on a ""contractual"" basis, meaning I realize that
    &gt;&gt; my limited experience in a very competitive market and am therefore I am
    &gt;&gt; willing to work for below the minimum wage (hence why we'd need to make it
    &gt;&gt; to where I am a ""contractor""). Honestly, I really *want* the experience
    &gt;&gt; and *NEED* money for the move up there. Please let me know if you know

    So I'm seeing a number of WWVB receivers. They're more expensive than
    GPS, and don't seem to be as easy to use for high precision timing
    (ie: they look like RS232 out, some seem to have a TTL pulse per
    minute, but not the GPS pulse per second).
    
    I have no idea which is a better hardened system, though obviously
    there's a lot of hardening of components and your local system you
    could do.
    
    Depending on just how back to basics you're thinking of, I'd consider
    some sort of physical assembly with photo sensor to get a very
    accurate true local noon, and calibrate for that in software. But then
    I'd also consider carefully just how much precision you need in your
    time.

38qzbd,2,2015-06-05,Can a relationship fail because of fatigue?,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/38qzbd/can_a_relationship_fail_because_of_fatigue/,"Apologies if this is a little meandering. I'm trying to get me thoughts in order, but we'll see how I do.

Context: My BF [25] and I [25 F] have been apart for just over a year now, after four years of attending undergrad together. During that time, we've seen each other fairly frequently (for this sub anyway); about one weekend every 4 months. He also spent a much-needed three weeks with me in mid-winter when I was having a hard time with school.

Here's my problem: we had an end date, it's come and gone, and we're still apart.... and it's really wearing us down. We were planning on waiting until I finished the degree that put me in another city, see where I got my internship, then move to that city and spend the summer together... and then, if things were still working out, move in together.

I found out where I was going to intern back in March. He immediately started applying for work in my new city. But, for a variety of reasons, it hasn't worked out. He's gotten depressed and has started to give up. He sounds more and more despairing every time we talk and I don't know what to do.

/rLong Distance, I am out of ideas. I don't know when I'm going to see him next, he's sliding into depression, and there's nothing I can do. I can't host him at my place here for more than a few days (I can't afford it, and my lease wouldn't allow it anyway). I need encouraging words for him, because I've said everything encouraging I can think of and it isn't helping. I'm tired of being alone all the time, I'm tired of missing him all the time, I'm tired of feeling left-out when my friends talk about their boyfriends, I'm tired of not being able to just tell him things, I'm tired of racking my brains for encouraging things to say tell him... I'm just tired.

How the heck are you supposed to stay motivated when all the certainty is gone?"
38r4xf,5,2015-06-05,another classic in love with the wrong person at the wrong time story...,no42throwawayno42,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38r4xf/another_classic_in_love_with_the_wrong_person_at/,"Probably the oldest story told, but here goes...

Me 43M, married for almost 10 years to my 43F wife, together for 15, with the best 9 year old daughter anyone could ever hope for. For years we've been in love and yes, we are still in love. But over the last few years, my wife has gotten more and more immersed in her very high-pressure, high paying job. We don't need the money and could easily live our lives on less income, but despite the pressure and stress the job give her, she shows no signs of wanting to leave. As a result, about half her time or more she's either spending days or weeks at a time on business trips to her company's home office (based in another city) or working 80-90 hours a week from a desk at home.  We're both high-ranking professionals in our respective fields but I'm able to set boundaries with my work that give me the ability or freedom to work no more than 40-45 hours a week, and never from home, always from my office about an hour from home. My wife on the other hand divides what precious little is leftover from her non-work time between our daughter, her friends, and her family. I miss her, as we rarely have the opportunity to spend quality time together. It also seems like she's changed and gone from the free-spirit I fell in love with years ago to the hyper-career-driven, gotta-have-it-all worker bee, a personality type that has never been something I was attracted to. Long story short, the last few years have left me feeling like my wife puts me low on the priority totem pole. We've had many fights and arguments about this, especially as I do the vast majority of our housework, but to no avail. Which brings me to my current dilemma...

At my company last summer, we hire an intern in a department that I don't have much direct dealing with, but at the same time I end up training her and working with her on a few projects and events, especially after she ends up being good enough at what she does to get hired on a full-time basis.. I notice her (23F) but I'm not really looking or noticing at all. Except, it does start to seem like we have a number of interests in common and there certainly seems like a connection. We chat every once in while, find out she has a boyfriend, but doesn't seem to affect the fact that we can very easily chat and talk in a really warm, comfortable and friendly way. All is well until I hear that she's giving two-weeks notice to pursue her desire to move to a different city to pursue her career in our field there.

On a total impulsive whim, I ask her out to lunch.  Purely on a professional basis mind you, I'm high up in the company, she's a valued employee leaving on good terms and a goodbye lunch is certainly in order. But at lunch, we really talk and bond, laughing and chatting in a way that feels like we've known each other for years. A work lunch that ends up feeling like an awesome first date, except that we both lament that we have to cut it short to go back to work.

So she has her last day at work, after which I connect with her on FB. Another quick chat ensues and we make plans to have another lunch, days before she moves. Over lunch, we talk and talk, sharing deep personal details and stories to an intimate level that I've rarely experienced with another person. Again, time flies and flies and this lunch really feels like an amazing date. I also come to find out that she's moving to this other city without her BF, but he's still in the picture somehow and helping with the move. Nevertheless, the connection between us is electric, deep conversations with occasional extended moments of just looking into each others eyes. We also make plans to definitely see each other again, the next time she's in town or the next time I'm in the city she moves to (where I tend to travel fairly regularly.) We also talk about possibly spending a weekend at a music festival in her city later on this summer. Unfortunately, I have to go back to work. We take a train back and the whole time on the train back as we chat, we're leaning into each other with our shoulders.  But we get to my stop, we say our goodbyes, share a very warm, lengthy close embrace, and I get off the train (she's taking it one more stop.)

And that's where it is now.  To recap, I'm married, she sort-of has a boyfriend. There's almost a twenty year age difference between us. We also now live in two different cities. Yet, there's an undeniably electric spark between us, and clearly has been for a while. A tender, sweet, passionate, intellectual, emotional, and erotic spark. She's absolutely, mesmerizingly beautiful, BTW. I'm planning to go to the music festival this summer (I'll book my own hotel room though, I'm not staying with her) and I have no idea what will happen then. I'm not looking to burn down my world, not to mention my wife and daughter's, but at the same time, there's a feeling that this other person could be a soulmate that I would have been together with in any other lifetime.

TL, DR: just as my marriage hits serious trouble, I find myself infatuated with the absolutely wrong person, at the absolutely wrong time, for the absolutely wrong reasons. Yet merely change one parameter and this could have been one of the world's great romances. Or alternately, I'm just an idiot.  Or maybe both."
38rcxm,1,2015-06-05,I'm (22/f) confused about him (32/m) not calling/messaging me after one week.,psq88,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/38rcxm/im_22f_confused_about_him_32m_not/,"Hello, and thank you for reading this. 

I met a guy 10 years older than me at my new internship and fell in love. He has been working there for a while now in a different department. I swear the first time I saw him I felt a connection and I thought it was mutual, almost like love at first sight (at least for me). At several occasions he approached me to start conversation. We have many things in common. Last friday we went to an afterwork party, I drank too much (probably he drank too much as well) and we stayed together the whole night.. we had fun talking, dancing and he even kissed me on the lips for like 1 sec.. probably because he didn't want anyone to see. He has my phone now and I have his. 

He kind of asked me out that day when sober, but passively. We both want to go to this museum exhibition and he suggested we ""should go someday"" not really specifying when so I couldn't say anything but ""yes we should...""

The thing is... I haven't seen him at work ever since nor heard from him via text message/call/work messenger/email...etc. Usually I see him 2 times per week maybe 3, this week however... nothing! 

I'm confused because I was sure everything went well and that it might be mutual after all, I'm afraid he regrets something or thinks that the age gap/work relationship isn't okay...

Additional information:

He told me he likes being alone, he doesn't really care for social media or internet, he lives alone (not married, no children, probably no girlfriend). 

Please help me figure it out! Do you think he likes me or is it in my head??

38rewy,1,2015-06-06,"I'm 20 F and my partner is 20 M. Our relationship (of nearly 2 years) was once very happy and exceptionally healthy, but I'm miserable. Can you give me some advice as to how we can salvage it together?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38rewy/im_20_f_and_my_partner_is_20_m_our_relationship/,"I met my partner during the fall of my freshman year and his sophomore year of college, and we've been going strong ever since, though less so now. We started off moving fast--met his parents before we'd even dated a month, now count his close friends among my best friends, talked a lot about the future very early on. 

Now things have changed a lot: 
-We went through some pretty big trust issues (MJ related--I'm doing my best to be open minded but he lied by omission about smoking it), but have tried to recover.
-We both moved to (separate) apartments this past fall, and I had a hellish three months that led me to stay most nights at his apartment just to escape from my horrible roommates.
-He had planned to study abroad in Scotland in the spring so grew extremely distant, but never ended up going (claims he did it so he wouldn't have to be away from me, and holds my going to London to study abroad against me). 
-We went on a weeklong trip to Canada together where it was just the two of us, and that went decently despite some communication issues. 
-I moved to a different apartment where he escaped from a tough roommate situation, visited almost nightly (as it turns out, to comfort me) during a tough spring semester, and where we went through the death of a close friend together.
-I got accepted to grad school (a dual degree program) and my dream internship, he got accepted to a teaching internship, and we both decided to stay in Boston over the summer to work. I also had a housing situation fall through at the last minute, so was homeless for three weeks. He helped me move out of my on-campus apartment and into his for two weeks while I got my ducks in a row.

So, you can see our relationship is pretty good, but very much a mixed bag. He's an incredibly nurturing, loving person and in a lot of ways, I'm tremendously lucky. For all the good in our relationship, though, we have what I feel are a lot of issues that are driving me crazy. I guess somewhere in his last (*appallingly* unhealthy) relationship, he learned to be tremendously accommodating, ever-present, and flexible to the point that he doesn't voice his opinions unless pressed. 

So, that's led us to spend a huge amount of our time together at the expense of some of our other relationships (part of the reason I've neglected some of my friends and have to rebuild our relationships, and why he hasn't been able to grow too many relationships outside of his old friend/close friend groups). An increasing proportion of the time we're spending together is starting to feel obligatory from either side (i.e. either my heart's not in it and I kind of want him to leave me alone or I can sense that he doesn't really want to be there and would rather be with the guys), and that's obviously making some of our dates/the time we're hanging out kind of suck. 

I've talked to him about this and we've agreed to only spend time together when we genuinely want to see each other, but it's always the same conversation and nothing really changes. He's been noticeably less open about his plans or what he's done over the course of the day (basic stuff, which I only ask because I'm working 60 hrs a week and would like to see him at least a little bit or sort of feel present in his life), and because of this and because the tone of codependence that seems to be forming between us makes me sick, I've been curt and less communicative too.  For all the time we're spending together, our sex life has kind of gone to $#!† (once in the past two to three weeks, and I didn't enjoy it as much as I used to), and I'm starting to despair. I've become unrecognizably fickle and vindictive, and have reacted by pulling away, spending more time with my girlfriends and shoving him towards our mutual male friends--I really hate what's happening here.  I feel like our once-model-healthy relationship is getting to an unhealthy point, and because I love this man and he loves me and we've discussed wanting our relationship to last a lifetime, I want to do all I can to salvage our relationship before we reach a point of no return. He says he's willing to do whatever it takes to fix this, but even I'm not sure what would be best to do.

Have you reached this point in your (otherwise good) relationship? If so, how did you cope? Can you offer me any advice?


   
**tl;dr**: Relationship of two years is at a crossroad because of hard times and loss of independence on both sides--can you offer me advice for salvaging it?"
38rjjx,10,2015-06-06,Ended a relationship. Now I'm totally alone.,throwaway_damnit93,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/38rjjx/ended_a_relationship_now_im_totally_alone/,"I kind of need help, this is not an specific gay issue but, between bros we can relate.

So, I stared my first relationship a few months ago, with a guy I dated for 4 or 5 months. The guy is great and I feel really attracted to him, so I did my best to get him. I must confess that before I was with him I was a shitstorm, I did drugs, consumed a lot of alcohol, went partying a lot, and I fucked a ton (even BB). I got out of that dark place to give that guy my best, and to not kill myself haha.


At the start we went through something rough, I needed to know my HIV status, I was really scared (scariest time of my life), he was there all the time, rock solid, no HIV found. Then he helped me execute my decision to voluntary distance myself from bad influences, like most of my addicted friends. 


Then I got my life on track, got the best available opportunity for my internship, ended the semester with the max grades for all my subjects and I still had a boyfriend.
I was pushing myself a lot, I choose to grow and my boyfriend seemed to support me, he made me feel so alive.


Suddenly he started feeling out of place at his new job (I helped him to get through the interview process by the way), and everything changed a lot. He was constantly nagging me on how I was always busy or tired (work/study 15 hours a day, obviously I can't be super energetic) and how I stopped giving him little gifts and stuff. Imagine a 15 year old girl/boy on her/his first relationship, just like that.


It felt strange. I did stop giving him gifts because all my free time was to be with him, we saw each other 3 to 5 days a week at least 3 hours/day. I had 0 hours left in my day. I was tired, of course, but I was happy to be with him... I'd sleep early the weekend, making him frustrated, I tried to make him understand that on my weekends that was the only time I could sleep the hours I needed.
We talked about this for months, week after week, I kept telling him to please wait till the summer, I'd have more time then and I'd be able to give him those things he missed of the guy he feel in love with.


He broke up with my a week ago, and I'm fucked up. I feel alone, got no friends to go out with, I feel like I did something terrible to him, and I miss the old me... like if something was telling me to destroy everything I built in almost a year, my new person, and get back to live a life out of mindless passion.


I don't know what to do, I'm still in love with that guy; but I'm not sure if I want to be with him because I really don't think he's ready. 
We had a very weird relationship, it's our first serious for both of us; but there are some things that also made me uncomfortable: 

* he has some (mental) issues with sex so, no sex (even when I tried to talk to him about this, he made me feel bad for pushing him).
* He's 25 and I'm 21. He's really dependant on his family, talks to them for hours everyday, I'm more independent from them.
* He wants to travel the world with money he doesn't have, buy expansive cars and clothes like right now. I want to build a career and save for my retirement, make investments and enjoy when it's time to. Right now I feel like I have to work my ass up to where I want to be.
* He got mad at the smallest things, like, me not calling him for at least and hour when it was not possible for us to see each other (that was when he got weird). Not answering quickly to his texts. Not saying yes to everything he wanted, for example, when we disagreed on something, he'd say that we were radically different just because we disagreed on something stupid.


So basically I'm conscious that my relationship is in a weird place, but I still love him. And I wrote a lot about the negatives but he has a ton of qualities. He'd never cheat on me, he likes a lot of the same stuff I like and we think similar, in long term we have similar life goals and he drives out the best of me. 


I'm not sure where to stand, and I'm telling him we should go back, I really love him. He says he still doesn't know if we're getting another chance or not. But I feel like I'm getting back to my old habits, and I feel really lonely. I miss him, it wasn't fair that he finished this just before the summer started... I was supposed to be with him more, and to make him the happiest guy on earth, I feel like I failed.

Sorry if you think this is stupid and immature, I guess I'm stupid and immature. "

I hope I am not a bother, but I'm stressing over professors and courses. You've been a big help naming the courses that provide coding and such. I will be doing Summer Bridge at UT, so I will be getting the Calculus and Rhetoric credit in the summer. I'm sure that'll change up my whole college schedule substantially. 
I have a few questions:

* What professors would you recommend I take? You don't have to take too much time from your daily activities, any number of professors you recommend will help me a lot. Here is a link to the catalog: http://imgur.com/JfCmqxp
* I think I might be getting an opportunity with some work for a big tech company in Austin from a family friend I happen to know, but I am unsure. If this doesn't happen, are there any people you recommend I should talk to? Your NVIDIA and Microsoft interviews are already accomplishments in my book. Are there really any internships an incoming novice freshman, like myself, can do? Tbh I doubt it, but anything to enhance my ECE education will greatly be appreciated.

* How has your experience been in Software and Embedded Systems? I am thinking about taking that up alongside Software Engineering and Design, or Electronics and Integrated Circuits in order to have that appealing hardware knowledge that employers look for.  

* What are some books you recommend for ECE and coding/programming, etc.?

Even if you can't find the time to answer I sincerely hope you succeed in all your endeavors! I'm sure ECE is tough, and life is too, but from the great advice you've already given me I am sure you are doing well. Thank you for everything, and I hope to hear back soon."

* Do you think it is wise to take the Calculus and Physics courses? A lot of people advise me to take the Cal courses, but use AP credits for Physics. It seems as though most people at UT find the Physics overwhelming and not worth the time given how much knowledge they actually use from it in ECE. I think all I really need is the circuitry and Python emphasis from Physics.

* I'm sure we use our computers a lot in ECE, so are there really any hardware specs we should get? Like CPUs and GPUs? Do we use AutoCAD at all? I'd assume so, but maybe not until later on. I was saving up to build a rig, and get quality parts for the computer instead of using integrated graphics and 2nd gen CPUs for years lol.

38rtlt,1,2015-06-06,In about two months I am going to spend 1500USD on a gaming PC. What is a suggested build?,flyersfan314,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/38rtlt/in_about_two_months_i_am_going_to_spend_1500usd/,"###Build Help

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Gaming

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

I want to play new games with high resolution at a minimum of 60 FPS.  I like action/adventure games and a bit of FPS. 


**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

About 1500 INCLUDING a monitor

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?**

I am open to it. I do not know much about overclocking or if I should overclock.

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

Yes and whatever you recommend. 

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Not going to build it for about two months but I wanted to know what you all think my build will look like. I am just so excited. I just got a paid internship in my field and it may turn into a full time job. I am really happy and I love this sub, all the builds make my mouth water and get my heart pumping. 

I am curious about 4k gaming but that seems expensive right now. 1080p used to be expensive but now it is reasonable so I am thinking I should wait on that as 4k will eventually become reasonable. I am interested in a build that can be upgraded to 4k if possible. I do not know much about SLI. What would you recommend? 

Also I would prefer an orange/black or orange theme if possible. 

Thanks!

38skcj,4,2015-06-06,"Shaving spots on my neck, stopped shaving for 3 months but they have not yet gone... What to do?",[deleted],wicked_edge,https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/38skcj/shaving_spots_on_my_neck_stopped_shaving_for_3/,"I'm sorry this is so long, I hope someone can help.

So about a year and a half ago I was sick from the standard gillette blades and done some research and switched to a DE razor. The one I got was the gillette tech safety razor off eBay. I used this for a while and it did reduce the number of shaving spots, however it did not remove them completely. They were still very visible.

In conjugation of this blade I also used Proraso Shaving Cream Soap and a badger brush. I thought my shaving was fine, and that my prep for shaving was fine too (I would ex foliate before a shave, never use alcoholic based after shaves etc). 

So with the spots still not going I decided to go see my doctor. He told me that it'd be wise to stop shaving for a while and let the redspots go away then start again. I followed his advice and I've been trimming my beard with an electric trimmer which doesn't irritate my skin. The red spots have decreased ALOT, however there is still a few spots and a little redness, I fear as though when I start shaving again I'm going to end up with the same problem.

So now I'm here, what do I do? I have an internship coming up and I need to shave for it. The red spots make me feel really self-concious and without being able to grow a stubble to cover it I have no idea what to do.

I recently got a Merkur 23C long handle as a gift, should I replace my gillete razor with this? I use feather blades by the way. I've experimented with other blades but I feel as though these are the best.

Please any tips on how I can make these go away.. as I'm honestly out of ideas."
38sosl,49,2015-06-06,[Non-Romantic] Parents enabling my abusive sister [24/F] Causing me [18/F] extreme mental anguish. What should I do?,CanisLupusAquarius,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38sosl/nonromantic_parents_enabling_my_abusive_sister/,"**Edit:** I spoke to my parents at length about this situation. They themselves have no idea what to do. They have conceded that my sister is an impossible problem, but there is nothing they can do about it. I asked why they don't just throw her out onto the street, and their response was ""she would have nowhere to go... she would die."" So I guess she's just going to live with them and torment them until my parents die.  



I am 18 years. I am still in highschool (well, for the next twenty or so days,) but I will be leaving for college in two or three months. My sister is 24 years old and for all intents and purposes, unemployed, and has been verbally and mentally abusing me and my parents for the better part of ten years. When I was ten years old she told me that I deserved to be ""raped and tortured to death in a Holocaust concentration camp"" because I did not go to school. For years after that she would call me fat, told me I was causing my parents to get a divorce and that I deserved to die, etc. (My parents did never get a divorce, though my dad talks pretty openly about how he wishes he could either die or leave us. And I don't blame him. I think the reason they haven't divorced is because we're financially unstable.)  

 

My sister refuses to get a job outside of the theater industry. So, she ""works"" from home and commutes into NYC by train maybe once a month. She is essentially a glorified intern, so she doesn't even make enough money to cover the cost of her train tickets and the takeout lunches she buys 2-3 times a week. She can't do many things on her own. She refuses to do chores around the house. If asked to do a chore, she will purposefully do it wrong so that she doesn't get asked to do it again. She yells at my parents for two hours a day, often over trivial things.  

She has ""rules"" that we must follow, otherwise she will throw a tantrum, scream for hours, and break things. 1: You are not allowed to eat tuna when she is home. I'm not joking. She has broken chairs in the past when someone has tried to make tuna salad. 2: you are not allowed to talk about any aspect of her life or career to anyone. This rule, of course, does not apply to her. She is the nosiest person I've ever met, and talks incessantly about other people. She does not value anyone else's privacy, though she has called my grandmother a cunt to her face when my grandmother asked what she was doing for work. 3: you're not allowed to talk when she is talking. Again, this rule does not apply to her. I can't remember the last time I got to have a conversation with either of my parents that she didn't butt in.   

My mother suffers from depression and anxiety and my sister purposely tries to make my mother have anxiety attacks. The family dog passed away in January and my mother hasn't been the same since. My sister will say things like my mother killed the dog (the dog had liver disease, so that's just absurd-- my mom loved the dog more than anything), she'll bring up his death out of nowhere, she'll ask my mother if she actually loved him and then when my mother says ""yes, of course,"" my sister will say ""no, you're lying."" My grandmother (my mother's mother) died 17 years ago from lung cancer, and if she's brought up in any context my sister will say that my grandma deserved to die and was a bad person because she smoked cigarettes.  

Yesterday my sister demanded that my mom buy her ""royale raspberry tea"" from the supermarket. When my mom returned home with ""red raspberry tea"" by the same producer, my sister threw a fit. She later had the audacity to make my mom buy her Starbucks and a doughnut, then take her to the movie theater and buy her popcorn and candy at the movies.  

Financially, my family is not doing well. My father makes good money, but not enough to cover the mortgage on our house and his putting three children through college. Like I said before, my sister is effectively unemployed, and she tells my father that he doesn't make enough money for her, that he's only a ""sperm donor"" to her, and that they should be making more money. Just for context, my sister spends probably $300/month on things like takeout sushi, iTunes music and apps, and movies, but pays none of that back. Every few months she also makes my parents pay for her to stay in an apartment in the city, which she doesn't pay back.   

My sister misinterprets what other people say and then insists that everyone else is lying when she in fact is delusional. If my mom says to her ""we might go to the animal shelter this weekend"" my sister will say ""you told me that we were going to adopt a dog this weekend. You're a liar."" This is just a minor example. She herself is a pathological liar and a hypocrite, but refuses to accept or admit it.   

My sister has been abusing my parents for nearly all of her life, and the majority of my adult life. Still, they won't kick her out of the house. I can't take it anymore. Every day of my life I come home and I am subjected to this torture. My parents refuse to deal with her, and in doing so they are inadvertently harming me. I feel like I have been robbed of my childhood. I got a job when I was 15 years old to compensate for the fact that she does not make money. I do twice the amount of chores around the house to compensate for the fact that she does none. *I buy my own groceries at the supermarket and cook my own dinner to compensate for the fact that she spends twice as much money on non-essential food as the rest of us.* For years I have had to clean up her messes because it's unfair for my parents to have to do so.   

When I leave for college I never want to come home; not for holidays, not for vacations, not for anything. I will do anything in my power to never see my family again. I love my parents, and on the rare occasion that my sister is not home (she actually rarely leaves the house) I get along really well with my parents. Unfortunately, I can no longer associate myself with them as they're never going to deal with my sister. I feel bad, because my mother is incredibly depressed and my father has reached the end of his rope. Still, I cannot continue to go down with this ship.  

I myself suffer from anxiety disorders as well as depression and an eating disorder. College is not going to be an easy thing for me. I worry about failing out. Still, I'd rather fail out and live on the street than return home. As much as I love my parents, they are dead to me, and I no longer can put up with their enabling behavior.  

I'm really desperate, looking for any advice or help whatsoever. And before you say it, my sister refuses to see a therapist. My parents tried taking her to one before I was born, and apparently she threw a screaming fit. Since then, my sister says that ""she can't trust [my parents]."" So having her institutionalized is out of the question, though that's what I think would be best for her.  

My entire adult life all I have known is anguish caused by her abuse. She is a burden on this family. My parents will not kick her out. Please, please help me. Tell me what to do.

   
**tl;dr**: Parents can't control abusive sister, have been enabling her for about a decade. Don't know how to overcome the trauma that she has caused me. Need advice for coping and/or how my parents can deal with her. "

Our end goal is to be together/live together the first chance we get. Problem for right now being I, since upon graduating have moved back in with my parents in Alabama. She lives in Southern California.

My parents recently moved to Alabama so I no longer have any connection to the community or have a circle of friends. My days are spent job hunting, playing video games and waiting for her to snapchat or text me back. Her days include going to her internship and spending time with her friends she hasn't seen all school year. I don't think she realizes how important how simple texting me or snap chatting me back in a timely matter is. As dumb as it sounds I literally have nothing to do. So when we have a dialogue and it's half an hour to an hour between texts I get frustrated. Especially when she goes out the bars with her friends. If I were to say something she would say how she's busy with her friends and I can't expect her to give me her undivided attention, which is true. But sometimes it feels like bullshit, because she's always on her phone. Does she see my text and just decide to let it marinate? I don't get it I instantly respond to her no matter what, but when she puts time in between texts I almost feel obligated to do the same, but then I wonder why the hell am I playing her game.. If it is even one.

Next is the issues of her going out. She's a fairly attractive girl and loves to dress up and put on make up. That's great I get it she's a girl. But what's the point of doing this and going through all the trouble to go the bar when you're in a relationship. Back in college when we were together I would forgo going to the bars all the time to be with her. If I asked her to do the same she would say that I'm trying to control her. It's not that I don't trust her but alcohol can make anion do irrational things. 

That's another thing I'm worried about for when she's back at school. She's going to be living minutes away from the bar scene and her sorority sisters are very pushy when it comes to going out. It's hard to think of all the guys that will be drooling over her at the bars, I hate thinking about it. What is she going to do when her friends are dancing with a group of guys? Stand alone in a corner or join in. It just hurts to know that I can't be there.

Today she is going to a concert and when I asked her who was going she named 4 of her girlfriends that I know and some random guy that she immediately removed any possibility of being a threat. Then she said about how they made 100 Jell-O shots for the tailgate and when I asked why she made so many for just 5 people she said well that's just our car that's going. Is there a reason why she felt the need not to tell me everyone who is going? 

I don't know reddit long distance is hard. I will be seeing her in less than 3 weeks but the time apart sucks especially when I don't get the attention that I feel I deserve. What are some ways I can bring this up without her getting too defensive or just default saying she's busy. I don't want this relationship to be about me worrying and feeling left out. "

38tipg,10,2015-06-06,"[21F] Been experiencing ""healthy"" weight gain over the past six months. Having trouble coping with it.",oculus_caesius,BodyAcceptance,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/38tipg/21f_been_experiencing_healthy_weight_gain_over/,"**TW: Self-harm/suicidal ideation mention**

Some backstory:

I have always been a small person. I am 5' 2"" and have a high metabolism, so I was always a bit underweight to begin with. Starting the summer after I graduated high school (2012) I started coming down with various physical ailments. I was admitted to the hospital for colitis, which I had never experienced before, and experienced quite a bit of (unwanted) weight loss. In August of 2012 I was 89lbs, which was awful! A combination of steroids and Ensure managed to get me back up to about 105lbs, which was my average weight. 

I have continued to battle digestive troubles ever since. I was never given an official diagnosis, some doctors saying I have an inflammatory bowel disease and some saying I just have IBS. It's been a very frustrating struggle. 

Over the past six months or so, a lot of my digestive symptoms have lessened, and while I still deal with pain, diarrhea, nausea and such, I am not in agony nonstop and that is wonderful. However, I have started putting on weight. Currently I am just at 120lbs. I have stretch marks on my hips and thighs, I went up a size in pants, many of my shirts feel a lot tighter on me. As much as I hate saying it, this weight gain is really, really hard to accept. I am looking for advice because I have never struggled with feelings like this before. I have had issues in the past with self-harm, suicidal ideation, and depression. I have gotten help with those issues, I have not self-harmed or had suicidal feelings in nearly two years, though I still struggle with the depression sometimes. My main mental health struggles now are anxiety (generalized and social). All in all, life isn't so bad. I'm in school to be a social worker (I've already completed an associate's degree), I have a job I enjoy, an internship that I love, I have a supportive family, caring friends, a wonderful boyfriend and am very active in my church. 

I find it hard to talk to my family and friends about things like this. They've seen me at my sickest, when I was basically skin and bones, and had to take three doses of steroids a day. I never want to be that sick or skinny again because I was absolutely miserable. I'm just having a lot of trouble dealing with this rather quick weight gain. I have never gained weight fast enough to actually notice it happening. I love food, but I also feel the slightest bit of shame any time I eat anything unhealthy. I just need help making sense of these feelings and hearing from people that can relate. This is all very confusing and different to me. 

**For the record, I am in therapy for my anxiety, but since the focus of my sessions has been working on learning how to handle the social anxiety, I haven't had much of a chance to bring these feelings up to my therapist. I do plan on doing so soon, though.**"

38trle,2,2015-06-06,(21M) I Feel Like A Distance is Starting to Develop With My Girlfriend (24F),Laffmeister,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/38trle/21m_i_feel_like_a_distance_is_starting_to_develop/,"Hello folks, 

I'm in my first relationship and I just came here to spill the beans anonymously and get some feedback. I've been kinda twisted in a knot and I feel like I got things reasoned out from a logical standpoint, but from an emotional standpoint I'm still wrenching my gut. It's that whole logos pathos thing. 

So I've been dating my girlfriend for awhile now, we hit our 6 month anniversary a little while back and I've taken an internship position down south which just so happens to be close to where she lives. I'm from the north, so this is about 10 hours from home. To avoid a twelve month lease, I looked for a prolonged stay on airbnb and was lucky enough to find a place.


There's a few problems that have made themselves apparent living down here. My roommate is a girl and we are strictly friends. She's shown me around the city a bit, has done a good job of helping find a friend group down here with the local grad school population, and we often go out for beers with that larger friend group I've developed. In the city I'm currently living, its pretty easy to find something to do after a day of work and having a few people to do it with has been awesome, I couldn't thank her enough for that. 


However, my girlfriend has been getting a little jealous. Obviously when another girl's name keeps on popping up in conversations, I can see how it could happen. It's just that I'm not the type of guy to break the faith. At a very young age, I've built quite a few work relationships and gotten into some things I shouldn't have (black tie events, jobs in fine dining, two internships) just because people trust me. I go through life with the idea that the person I'm talking to should always be able to walk away and recommend me to someone else. Trust is a big deal to me so its a weird feeling when I'm not trusted. 


So it kinda hit a head when I wanted to go swing dancing. I see it as a hobby and the college my girlfriend and I go to has a good community. I figure if I live in a city that is known for music, I should do a little bit of dancing. Problem is, she sees dancing as intimate and I see it as a hobby. It's something you do for fun and to meet people. She pretty much convinced me not to do it because she didn't want me dancing with my roommate or meeting another girl. Again, that's a reasonable thing to think, but I don't swing that way.


 I feel like she's starting to limit me with what I do and I don't really like that after working overtime and doing an online physics class. I've talked with her about it and she still is ardent with her opinion. I'm getting stressed out and she's bottling me up, which I guess I haven't told her. It comes back to the trust thing, I want that in part so that she can let me go do those things and not worry because, in all honesty, she has no reason to. 


It's done a bad thing for our communication, which is where it gets me the most. If I bring up something fun I did with another girl that's a friend, even though it's strictly as friends, she starts getting mad at me and I'm pretty sure she has cried over it. That makes me feel like shit, then I'm worrying about my job (If I do things wrong, it makes many big booms) and I'm worrying about my class. See where the bottle comes in? 


I don't like holding back information. Honesty is a trait I look upon well and it's a part of being a genuine person. I love my girlfriend, but I'm starting to think more and more its love in terms of friendship, not in terms of relationship.


 It seems more dry now when I say it, she makes me say it after every nightly call. I wish I didn't have to say it so she would know it. I feel like I do good things for her in terms of making her dinners, taking her to see nice things, I keep on telling her it's not what I say but what I do. I'm not good at communicating my feelings through speech, but I try to do my best with attention to detail and care. 


I'm going to ask you folks to think about this because I've been thinking about it since the summer started. I feel like I've done well given the circumstances, but I'm going to the point where I'm feeling that even though I'm happy now, the balance is teetering. I think the bottom line is that I need a bit more independence and she wants to be a part of everything I do. That seems perfectly fine, but even though we aren't a twelve hour distance away like what would have happened had I stayed in my home state, a one hour distance still kind of is a long distance relationship in the idea that I can't just hop in the car and stop by. I don't like talking on the phone all too much with anyone and texting is a poor substitute for a human being. I'd rather just wait until I see someone.


Again, thank you for reading my wall of text. My question is what is your outside observation? I'm going to see her again tonight and I'm really happy she's coming down. I'm hoping to show her around a bit and get her breakfast tomorrow at a good coffee shop a stones throw away. Hopefully we can talk about some of this so I'll try to keep you updated if you want.  I feel kind of vulnerable for saying all of this, even online, just because I don't know if I'm going in the right direction or not.

I need to turn it around,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/38u5zs/my_life_has_been_heading_in_the_wrong_direction_i/,"I'm depressed. I don't want to put my family and friends through the emotional and financial stress of a funeral. All throughout my life, I've struggled to connect with people. My home environment failed to set me into a position where I feel comfortable in a group. I always struggle to find companionship but get caught up in my perception of how others perceive me and feel like shit. Family matters are fucked up. Everyone loves each other, but everyone has their own issues. My parents have both been constant loving figures in my life but their dynamics left me extremely fucked up. My Dad is extremely quiet and passive to an unnerving point. He struggles to ask for the simplest directions and fails to vocalize and thoughts or feelings. I love him but, I never felt as if I had a strong male role model in my life. As for my Mom, she's been the dominant character who goes overboard in protecting me. Her constant sheltering and cracked world view has obscured me from developing normal social skills. I love them both more than I could ever vocalize, but my childhood definitely fucked me up.

I can't blame my family for anything though. They have tried the best they could to help me. In eighth grade a started to see a therapist to help me with test anxiety. At least that was the cover. I was unable to vocalize that every day since I started school at my private school in 4th grade (the one I would attend throughout middle school and high school) I had been a living hell. With my lack of social skills, I only made a few friends, but I failed to connect with anyone else. I always felt like a stranger, an observer, the boy watching everyone else have fun when I couldn't. Eventually, in middle school this came to a head and I was severely verbally bullied and ostracized by my peers. I was ""childish nickname""(removed for anonymity) the incompetent clumsy kid who was book-smart, but who was quiet outside of class. I silently put up with the torture, only occasionally mentioning it to my Mom who would attempt to sort it out for me... in hindsight I should've delt with it on my own with playground politics, but I didn't and the hazing never stopped.

Although the faces of the bullies changed, their victim was the same. I never grew up. I never learned to handle myself. I'm still that same little boy who has been too scared to act.No matter what I do with my life, I never feel satisfied. Sure, I got into a good school to pursue engineering, but I have failed to make any friends in my first year, I kept to myself, and my second-term grades suffered. I went to school in California to start anew, having lived on the east coast my whole life, but I feel I've landed in the same shithole in which I've always existed.

The last two summers, I had an awesome internship at a prominent aerospace company, but now without any work, I feel depressed and worthless. I fucked in school and it's just going to get harder next year. I failed to make connections and now it's just going to get harder to make connections. I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing with my life. I feel like a never grew up emotionally, my life is permanently fucked, and I'm too screwed up to ever properly function in society."

I think it’s all due to the long distance and the disparity of the reality of my life versus what I expected it to be at this point in time. We had an end date last year. It was not a solid one but it was one we were going to try to make work. He was coming to live with me in the US after finishing his teaching job abroad. We planned to travel around the US, then to SE Asia, then he would come back to the US for me to finish the internship for my MA, and then we’d move to Europe for his MA. We traveled through the US an Asia for about 8 months and it was wonderful. About two months ago, though, we realized that the best thing for him would be to return to a place where he could work to minimize the amount of debt he was taking on for school. Because leaving the US before December is not an option because of my MA, that meant that we’d have to be apart.. you know, again. It was a tough decision but we were optimistic. The plan now is to see each other again in about a month for about a month. Then, in the beginning of December, I am moving to be with him for good. Like, we’re getting our own place together and we’ll be there long term.

I expected to be okay when I returned but the past month has been so hard and I’m afraid that my depression is taking over me. I feel as though I am now living a life that I didn’t expect to still be living; working in the same place, doing the same things, and having to deal with Skype all the time. I feel alone and I miss my boyfriend more than I’ve ever really missed him. I feel impatient and just really tired.

I know that the key to overcoming this and the key to maintaining our (always very healthy) relationship is for me to start trying new things and reconnecting with friends and older hobbies I’ve really enjoyed in the past. The problem is motivation; I wake up in the morning and feel lost. I don’t feel like doing anything other than the things I have to do (i.e. - work). I feel anxious at the thought of seeing friends or trying new things. I know that this isn’t great but I can’t figure out how to overcome it. My partner is incredibly supportive but this takes a toll on him while he’s also feeling similarly. I want to be able to have a great independent life again but my head is stuck in where I “should” be (or already starting the next chapter of my life with my boyfriend). 

Has anyone had this similar experience? How did you overcome it and get back in to the swing of the things, despite disappointment?

TL/DR: My boyfriend and I reached our end date, spent 8 months together, and now have to go LD again for 6 months. I feel depressed and unmotivated being back in the same place again. How do I get past that feeling to maintain my healthy LDR?"

38v3cj,5,2015-06-06,[Day 1](kinda) Finally trying to go the whole way,ferret_80,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/38v3cj/day_1kinda_finally_trying_to_go_the_whole_way/,"Hey LoseIt, I've been an occasional lurker around here for a bit, and after much putting off I'm finally making my first post here. I'm a 21 y/o male, 279.5 lbs 5'11"". 

I've been on and off the weight loss train for a while. two years ago I went Keto lost weight, but I returned to school and lost all that progress. My internship the next summer was very sedentary and while I did do some exercise it wasn't nearly enough. This year was tough academically and once again I decided that ""eh, academics for 1 year is more important, I can lose weight after I graduate""

Here I am, graduate, now job-seeker, I am more than obese, and my physician says that the fat on my liver may cause some major complications in the future, so it is time to change NOW!

I've always been relatively fit and active despite being overweight, I like good food, so I know how to exercise and I've proven to myself from earlier diets, that I can commit to weight loss if I try and stick to it. This post is to make sure I stay with it. I don't like to talk about it with my parent's as they can be over bearing in my opinion. So this is my announcement. I WILL lose weight, I WILL become healthier, NOW! not tomorrow, not when i get a job, NOW!

For the past week I've begun eating less, less carbs, less ""snack food"", I've been going to the gym daily, I have a weight lifting routine, Arms/Abs, Legs/Back, I also usually do 30-40 minutes of cardio on the stationary bike. 

I know I should start counting calories in MFP or another app, and I hope this post(and possibly your replies;) will encourage me to start tomorrow. I'm also going to take some pics so I can have a reference point and at the end I will have an amazing progress pic album.

Thanks for listening and keep up all the encouragement, not only for me, but for all the other people in this sub. It's amazing this communities support of each other in our shared goal to get healthier."
38v98q,1,2015-06-06,"I [21M] ended things today with my [19F] GF of nearly over 1 year, yet now I feel serious remorse and worry I might regret this in the future, as I had to really push myself to end things and break her heart.",aston_spartan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38v98q/i_21m_ended_things_today_with_my_19f_gf_of_nearly/,"Hello everyone. I would really appreciate any feedback/criticism/advice on my dilemma. I wrote a fuck-ton but I don't really know where else to turn to and the details are necessary for the best answer. I'm romanticize a lot of things, and I tend to be very inwardly emotional. I ended things today with my GF of just over a year (let's call her Amanda). Amanda really did not want to end things, and it was incredibly hard for me to push myself to end things. 

I'm currently a junior at university and will be graduating next year. I'm spending my summer right now (been here since May) several thousand miles away in a major metropolitan center at an internship, so it became long distance about a month ago. Amanda had planned on visiting me but that kind of changed with the split. 

I have been in two former serious relationships, one that was only 6 months and one that was 2.5 years, both of which ended on more or less mutual terms and not because of infidelity or something like that. 

Anyways, onto my current relationship, the one I could potentially look back to for the rest of my life. I met Amanda at university and went out of my way to reach out to her. I was ""that guy"" who would brag about not chasing girls or would be hooking up with different girls. In spite of that persona I portrayed, deep inside, I'm a romantic. Short-lived hookups don't mean much to me, and ""one night stands"" seriously fuck with my mind. To this day, I can't get around getting over an immense amount of passion in one night. I met Amanda, and the first night I hung out with her, I had sex with her. Here's the catch: **I was a virgin**. I had never had sex with any other girl prior; I'd always work to other things but never sex. Amanda and I kept on talking, and I ended up getting into a relationship with her. What would be the next year of my life with her turned out to be the best year of my life. I loved, and still, love her. I traveled with her. I partied with her. I played video games with her. I did everything with her. The chemistry, sexually and personally, was beyond what I could imagine. 

Amanda and I continued to date, and around last fall (around October), I got really drunk (I don't want to blame it on the alcohol) at a social event and hooked up with (made out, a bit of touching, nothing more, no longer than a minute or two) a girl who's been a close friend of mine since high school. I hadn't seen Amanda in over a week so I was kinda missing her, or sexual activity for that matter. In retrospect, I didn't really put in an effort to see her or meet her though... Morning after, I told Amanda what I did, and she hated it. Everyone I knew told me to NOT tell her. They told me it was a ""mistake"" and to ""move on"" and that ""telling her"" would be ""dumb"". I couldn't sleep on it. I had to tell her. I owed it to her, she's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I'd say she knows me better than I know myself. 

We worked things out. She hated that I did it as did I. We continued, relationship went well. Over the winter break (late December), she went back home to Europe for several weeks. During that time, it happened again. With a different girl, at some bar that I had gone out to with my guy friends. It was much less severe, as it was just kissing that lasted 10 seconds. Still cheating, I guess, but I'm glad it didn't escalate. This happened the night before she came back from Europe. I told myself, I need to tell her again. I owe her the honesty and the confidence. I'm not going to be that fucking relationship that comfortably cheats on each other and act like everything is peachy. She came back from Europe the next day. I picked her up from the airport, took her home, and felt like shit. She was so excited to be back in my arms. All she did was think of me while she was gone. Yet, as we finally exchanged Christmas gifts, (we agreed we'd do it when we met again), I told her. I had to fucking tell her this while she gave me gifts. She gave me a scrapbook that she had put an immense amount of effort into and next thing she knows, I've cheated again. She slapped me, I don't blame her. She's never laid a hand on me or anyone else but I can understand why she did. We took a ""break"" although we kept in contact and cried to each other every day. That lasted for about a week, and we were back together again, and things finally seemed to be better. I spent NYE 2015 with her and it seemed like I could put everything behind me. 

Fast forward to May 2015. I've left my hometown where I live close to her and attend uni with her. I'm headed to a far-away major city for an internship that I had dreamed of getting. Amanda was really sad to see me leave, but I assured her and we believed that we would really work things out. The distance wouldn't be a problem. We could make things work out. Fast forward a month, to last weekend, late May. I went out with a male intern friend of mine (I almost always only go out with guy friends) and we meet these two foreign women at a bar. My friend's single so I figured conversation would help his chances and it didn't mean I had to do anything with this girl. But I didn't actually think that, in retrospect. I bought her a drink. Me, my friend, and these two foreign women went to a club, had a blast, and I had a night of passionate dancing and kissing and touching with this woman. We had great chemistry... We chatted so much and I was under this woman's spell. I think this is because of the romantic in me, and because I had never really truly lived the ""single life"" or ""gotten it out of my system"" since I had lost my virginity to Amanda. I don't fucking know. Whatever the fucking reason, I hooked up with this lady, and it was a night of passion that fucked with my mind the morning after. I didn't sleep with her, but I thought of her, and the way that she stared into my eyes from the moment we met to when she walked away from me but turned backwards to look at me, as if to imagine what might have been. It was a great night, but I fucked up. I felt terrible, and it weighed on me: I cheated again. After Amanda gave me chances twice before. After we traveled Europe, and after I spent an week with her before I left for my internship. After everything, I did it again. I thought to myself, there's no way I'll tell her. I'll damage her, and I'll ruin her trust. Furthermore, perhaps I'll lose her forever. I had told her that night that I need ""to talk to her"" but ended up just saying other things. 

I thought on it for a whole week, and we arrive at earlier this morning, a cool, energetic, windy morning in the city. I told her that I really do need to talk to her. I spoke with her for a couple of hours over the phone. It took everything in me to say the words ""I'm not the boyfriend you deserve"" or ""I can't be in a relationship with you right now."" Amanda is the fucking **love of my life** and here I am telling her this, giving up, and saying goodbye to her. I really do believe that this is the best for me, and ""us"", right now. I truly believe, that if I am to marry her someday (which I believe), that I need to do this now otherwise we'd crash and burn harder in the future. Plus, I cheated again and she still doesn't know. It'd break her, as if breaking up with her wasn't destructive enough. She, in a way, understood what I was saying, but she was so hurt. She put everything into our relationship and she would do anything for me. Her love for me is beyond scale. She found herself fighting to find a way to keep me; I just don't know if she could make me be in a relationship when my heart is tugging in a different direction sometimes. 

This is my dilemma, reddit. I really love this girl, I still care about her. I'm checking my phone every fucking second right now to see if she'll text me. As a matter of fact, she called me after we broke up, not too long ago, crying and again fighting to find a way to capture me. I told her the truth: I need the distance and the time, as does she, to introspect and really review my decision. Should I man-up and tell her that I cheated again? Won't she take it really bad? If I feel that I'll cheat again or that I'll hook-up again, isn't it better to be single? What if I love her forever? What should I do or think to know if I should really be with her? I feel complete depravity and loneliness right now... And this internship I'm doing will have me working ~70 hour work weeks so my head will be all over the fucking place. Reddit, please help me and give me some guidance. Hopefully someone's been through something similar. 

Please read my story... the tldr doesn't do justice and I really need help here. Thank you. It's a Saturday night in this god-damn city and I'm alone musing about this. 
   
**tl;dr**: Cheated on gf for third time (make out+touching) but didn't confess this last time. Instead, broke up because I feel I'm not mature enough. I'm also currently abroad for 10 weeks. Did I do the right thing?

38v9lc,3,2015-06-06,Trying to get an IT/Networking job but this is ridiculous -- where do people even start??,networkingnovice,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/38v9lc/trying_to_get_an_itnetworking_job_but_this_is/,"I have a bachelor's degree in computer networking and I'm hopefully going to get my CCNA in routing and switching sometime this year. That being said, I only have retail job experience (in management at least) and I am trying to find IT/networking jobs in a state I'm trying to move my family to. I have two kids and I'm in my 30's so it's not like I'm fresh out of school and can just take big job risks... 

So I'm perusing through tons of job listings on this state's job website, and there are all sorts of IT job postings but the requirements for most of them are so advanced. Like, I need in depth knowledge of a huge range of specific technologies and things... not just the basics of networking and IT systems. Each job is fairly specialized so a guy like me who knows the basics (and a little more) still could not just jump into a job without significant training. And I do have a lab at home that I am using to learn routing/switching and playing with servers, etc, but that seems to only go so far with what I have...

I know I've seen a lot of similar posts saying that one most likely will have to start out in a call center, but is that really the only way? I saw a few job listings for *temporary* call center positions that explicitly state phone support only, but how is someone supposed to take a job like that and expect it to lead somewhere further? 

Aside from finding a company to intern for or offer services to local businesses/churches (which is still very difficult to find by the way), it seems like truly the only way for someone to get any sort of moderately advanced IT job, you have to be connected to people that can get you in, or you have to have already been bounding around the IT world for years building up the experience.

I just feel overwhelmed and hopeless because I *want* to find a good IT job that leads to a career and not just some crappy temporary call center position where I'm disposable."
38vdt5,4,2015-06-06,I (29F) am having trouble dealing with a summer apart from my boyfriend (26M)-- Am I being too needy?,LDisabummer,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38vdt5/i_29f_am_having_trouble_dealing_with_a_summer/,"This is my first time posting but I'm having a rough night and could use some hopefully kind advice or commiseration of strangers. My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 months, we met online on OK Cupid. He is a graduate student and got an internship out of state for the summer and it's really hard. What I can't tell is if I'm making things worse, or if he is, or if there are red flags. Or I don't know I just need some perspective.

Part of the reason it is difficult is because about a month before he was supposed to leave he had a freak out and dumped me. He realized it was a mistake pretty quickly and was mostly a result of stress from exams and things between us getting pretty real. He was practically living with me and we decided to move in together this summer when both of our leases were up. 

Our relationship had been really good up until then, physically, emotionally and otherwise. In many ways I feel like he is my ideal match-- he is handsome, smart, funny, kind, and loves dogs (including my dog!) as much as I do. We didn't really fight, though we did have a few difficult conversations. But we are respectful, honest, and open with each other. We also both make efforts to recognize our own flaws. 

All of this said, the break up did some damage to my trust and security. He has apologized many times and tried to explain things to me so I could trust him again. He said he knew I would have some trust issues for a while and would do whatever he could to help with that. This included him promising to write me a letter every week and visiting once per month during the summer. Well, he has been gone three weeks and I haven't gotten a single letter and it looks like he won't be visiting until early July. This is extra disappointing because we had talked about him coming this weekend for a visit and to help pack. Also I thought it would be nice to see him aroun my birthday, which is a big milestone one next week.

So on top of everything else this means that I have to pack up all my stuff and handle the move into our new place all by myself. Well, mostly, he'll come to day after the movers come and help finish up I guess. It feels crappy to move by myself with no help to start what was supposed to be our new life together. 

We talked about all this for a long time last night because I told him how much all of this bugged me. And he said he wanted to make me happy and he loves me so much, but that he's more independent than I am. He says that his calling and messaging regularly is his way of doing things and that he has trouble remembering to write letters and that I shouldn't take it as a sign that he doesn't love or miss me. He asked me to be patient and instead of getting upset at what he's not doing, and let him surprise me in his own way.

So now I'm still over analyzing things because I'm miserable about this. I really loved how we were together in person and I can't tell if I'm expecting too much or he's giving too little. I explicitly asked him for thoughtful gestures which he agreed to and then he's not following through. And I'm afraid to complain too much (though I always says what's on my mind anyway) because I'm afraid he will dump me again. He reassures me that he no intention to ever ""make that mistake"" again. But still I feel off.

And so then days like today, when I think because it's the weekend he'll have time to talk and I get only two five minute phone calls, I just get so frustrated and hopeless feeling. Maybe I'm overthinking this or being too needy but I also get paranoid he's not as flirty or passionate. 

So strangers of reddit-- any advice, thoughts, or commiseration? Thanks for your help!

------------------------------

**Tl;dr**: My boyfriend of 7 months is gone this summer for an internship and I'm not handling it well, partly because of trust issues from when he broke up with me for a day a while back. Need some advice or cheering up..."

38vgay,22,2015-06-07,We met online...2.5 years ago.,fireducksalamander,wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/38vgay/we_met_online25_years_ago/,"Well, it's been a while, reddit! I haven't been on here for like 2 years, I used to check this forum all the time and wanted to write a little something and also wish to all you online lovers out there the best of luck and strength and hope that you all get to meet each other and that everything goes the way you daydream at work or school :)

**How we met online:**

Over Tumblr, in November 2012. I'm from Austria but I went to uni in the Netherlands, and he's Chilean. We were both in uni, and the same age. We instantly felt a connection and flirted a lot, it was cute but bittersweet as we thought we would never meet :/. Since he's super shy we never even had a voice/video call!!

**How we arranged to meet:**

I was extremely lucky because at the time I was in my 3rd semester applying for my 5th semester, in which we could either do an exchange program or an internship of our choice, anywhere in the world. It was sort of a free semester, and I didn't get into any exchange program of my choice so I started applying for internships and thought, hey, why don't I do one in Chile? I thought about it for a long time, all over the Christmas holidays, and eventually asked my parents if they would support me, and they actually agreed. Since South America is quite a popular continent for young people to travel to, and Chile is the safest country, they thought it was cool of me to go, and of course I didn't tell them about my ulterior motives, although I really wanted to, they are quite old-fashioned and just don't get the online thing. Amazingly, I found an internship opportunity at an English language newspaper so I didn't even have to know Spanish, which I knew like 0 words of, but I started taking intensive classes anyway. When I told him he was in SHOCK! Even though we had agreed to be friends we talked every single day and night and were very anxious to meet. He even said he would pick me up from the airport, and I didn't even know what his voice sounded like :P

**Actually meeting:**

So august 21st, my parents drove me to the airport, they still had no clue and I told them my future roommate was going to pick me up from the airport. i don't have that many pictures but to prove that I really did this: [here is me being super nervous and excited on the plane](http://i.imgur.com/5JQX2KC.jpg),  and a picture of the morning before I landed [the sunrise over the Andes mountains](http://i.imgur.com/oi4Nu2Q.jpg). About one and a half days later, I arrive at 9 am in the middle of winter on the other end of the world. This is the exciting part! 

It took forever in immigration, unfortunately for him because he had been waiting for hours and didn't wanna miss me and had to go really badly (he told me later). Finally I arrived at the area to pick up my luggage, which is right next to the visitors area, and there is some kind of balcony with glass overlooking it where visitors can watch the arrivals like some sort of zoo :P. I had a feeling I was being watched so I looked up and standing there was...Jon Snow. But slightly slimmer, Chilean, and wearing jeans and a beige sweater instead of the black. 

I'm never EVER forgetting how it happened. He waved and I died inside, my heart was racing, but I still had to get my suitcase, and was too shy to look up again and went through the last part of customs and when I got out, there were a million people. I looked up and he wasn't there so I walked around and finally saw him so I just went up to him and we hugged for a long time and he said ""finally"" while hugging me and that was the first time I even heard his voice!!!! It was deeper than I imagined. lol. He smelled good.

We went to his apartment which was close to where I had pre-rented my room. I went to take a shower, and then we just talked, and he was *really* quiet and shy. It was awkward as we were both nervous and had been in denial about liking each other for months. But one thing led to another and although this is still a topic of debate it was clearly me who kissed him first *wink wink*. 

**About staying together:**
Everything was exciting, and perfect, and cute at first. We eventually told both our families, and made it official. Then after some time we had to face reality and have 'the talk' because I was obviously going to leave and go back to Europe in January to finish university. With this looming over us we tried to make the best of our time and traveled lots, to the ocean and to the country and eventually the south, it was amazing. Although I hate how I look here is [proof of us with Santiago in the background](http://i.imgur.com/kRxOS06.jpg)

 Uh sorry imgur is being annoying and I can't seem to upload any pics but I'll try later!!

The day I left was the worst day of our lives. I promised him I'd find a way to come back, but he was destroyed inside. The first week he could barely speak, it was like I had died or something. My obsession was only to finish the last semester of uni, and then move to Chile indefinitely, but he had huge doubts about that because he thought I couldn't actually live there, and would eventually just go back to Europe, or lose interest, or find someone else. But the truth is, I had thought about it long and hard and decided it's worth giving it a go, Chile is a breathtakingly beautiful country, Santiago is a nice city to live in, it's economically stable and there's lots of job opportunities, plus it's as safe as any European city.

Anyway the long distance was absolutely terrible for us, it wasn't like before where we were just waiting for a future together, it was crippling, we had fights all the time, he was doing really badly mentally and had to start seeing a psychologist, and I stayed in touch with his family members as well. At some point it just got too bad. I was constantly checking flights. At one point we were at such a low point, I spontaneously booked a flight and visited him for a week. I didn't even tell anyone, especially not my parents. It all went smoothly though and that week with him was so perfect and beautiful. This was around April, and in June he was scheduled to visit me in Europe, which was also amazing. I had booked a one-way flight to Chile for the same time in August. 

**Fast-forward to now**

This part is kind of important for people who are thinking of moving to their partners country and are worried about how to cope with the cultural difference, not knowing anyone and not speaking the language: it's alright, you can do it all. It's not easy but nothing worthwhile ever came easily, right?!

I now live in Chile indefinitely, and I learned to speak Spanish fluently (but we still speak English with each other, old habits die hard). It took a while but it is 100% doable, and man, Chilean Spanish IS HARD. It is NOTHING like Mexican Spanish. Mexicans don't even understand Chileans most of the time. 

I am finishing my bachelor thesis (online), but I want to study for a Master's degree for my career but don't want to go back to Europe and studying in Chile is not an option for me, so I'm applying for a long-distance online Master's degree in the UK. 

I have a part-time job at a restaurant. It's fun and pays alright, if I do enough shifts. I was looking for jobs and got 2 offers instantly, one required a bit too much time commitment for me, and the other one was pretty exploitative, with terrible working hours and low pay. I declined it but unfortunately this happens a lot in this country. You gotta be careful.

I don't actually live with my boyfriend, his living situation is a bit complicated, but I sleep over at his place several days a week. Instead I rent a room not too far away, in a shared house. 

I don't have a group of friends yet but my circle of acquaintances is growing. I volunteer at a dog shelter, which is something I did all the time before I got my job, nowadays I don't have as much time to go :/ I met some pretty awesome people including my current landlady who is a volunteer too. As a result, I live with her, some of her family members and foreigners, and about fifteen rescued dogs. Our house is really laid back and also showed me a completely different side of Chile as they are so different from my boyfriend's family.

Anyway, for anyone who bothered reading my novella, thank you for your interest, I hope you make it, whatever you decide to do. If you are really thinking of making the big move don't let anyone tell you not to do it, just go for it! Make sure you always have some sort of contingency plan, even if it's just some backup money to buy a ticket back home. Think about whether you would stay in the country if you broke up. If you do break up and move back, it will always have been a worthwhile experience. Stay in touch with your family if you can, don't let them worry about you too much or think you have given up on them. Also, get a Kindle. "

What have you seen at other bunfests that you really liked?

How can we promote the event to reach even more people?

How can we get to people who are not rabbit owners to the event/ what can we do to promote rabbits as good household pets? 

Also if you'd like to be a vendor send me a message and I could direct you to the right resources :)

The bunfest isn't until Oct 3rd and my internship will be long over before then but I would love to continue to work on the bunfest! I thought this would be a good community to help with ideas! "

I tease you. Constantly. And you can either take this opportunity to become an animal and just take me or I can seduce you despite your desperate attempts to pull away.

38w5kq,181,2015-06-07,Husband caught cheating with a woman who has a baby,PinkShoeGal,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/38w5kq/husband_caught_cheating_with_a_woman_who_has_a/,"Hi everyone. This is my first time posting here, I am so glad i found this group of like-minded people because as of now nobody in my life knows about my situation.
My husband and I have been together 9 years (married for 5). I have always known that I never wanted kids and told him so from the beginning. He had wanted kids but since he knew I didn't want them and he wanted to date me he put it off. However, he was always obsessed with my little nephews or other kids from people in his family. Always talking to them in baby voice and chasing them and playing around. Meanwhile I was like ""yuck"". Anyways we lived very happily until September 2014 when he started acting very depressed. He wasn't interested in his usual activities (soccer, video games), he was quiet and withdrawn and around November he stopped wanting sex (which he loved before). I thought it was just due to his depression but a few days ago I found emails full of pictures of him and some nasty girl kissing and hugging, etc. There was also pictures of this girl's little daughter and letter he had written which said he loved being with her during these past 9 months and couldn't wait until they are a family. Of course this girl has a 2 year old daughter and I believe she is married too (in the letter my husband wrote he said something about the girl having to put up with a guy). My first instinct was to kick him out right away but right now I am unemployed because I just graduated with a master's degree 3 weeks ago. I am of course looking for a job every single day but until then I need him unfortunately to help with our mutual bills (I always had a job but stopped last year during my internship). My plan is to find out who that girl is married to and letting her husband know as well as telling my husband's family the real reason why he will be out of my life. He loves to play the good guy and will surely tell them he was just going through depression. I have her email address and name but cannot find her on FB or Instagram. It makes me sick having to have him here in my house and pretend nothing is happening. The day after I found the emails I had a conversation with him to ask how his ""depression"" was going and he kept saying he could tell I wasn't happy and didn't want to hurt me anymore and that's why he believes we should break up. I asked me straight out if he was cheating and looked me in the eyes and said ""no"". I'm sooo mad. I don't know what to do. A part of me wants to write CHEATING BASTARD with spray paint on his new car but the more rational part of me knows I still need him at least until I have secured a job. Anyways I just wanted to vent, sorry it's so long."

38wltt,1,2015-06-07,I'm not exactly sure how I feel right now... but not good...,extreme_douchebag,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/38wltt/im_not_exactly_sure_how_i_feel_right_now_but_not/,"I had been looking for a job for a little over a month.  I finally got a temporary position.  I originally expected to work certain hours for each day, but when they emailed me the offer, it ended up having different hours, and for some reason I accepted without thinking it through (completely my fault).

I don't have a car so I need to use public transportation, but the public transportation doesn't even run at the time I needed it to to start my shift today.  I also have only $50 in my checking account and around $20 of credit left on my credit card.

So, yesterday was my first shift, and it went OK.  I was considering quitting in the back of my mind, but for some reason when my supervisor asked my coworker and I if we were going to come back today I said yes, and then he quickly left before I had time to process what I just said (again, my fault).

So, at this point, every part of my body was telling me to quit because 

* This is a minimum wage job, and I'd have to spend half of my money I'm earning on taxis to get there for the early morning shifts like today and tomorrow (since I live far away, I don't have a car, and the public transportation doesn't operate at that time)
* The job requires me to interact with people and remain upbeat for at least 5 hours in a row, and I already felt drained from the first day, which was going to be far less busy than the next one.  I didn't want to be at work while in apathetic zombie depressed mode.

Anyway... I guess there are some more details but I ended up just quitting right before my shift started this morning.  I feel physically uneasy about this, since everybody there was super nice to me and I basically just abandoned them out of nowhere for reasons that are my fault.  I was the only one there doing my job, so me leaving unexpectedly is bad for them.

I feel like my brain isn't meant for the practical world.  I studied computer science and did two software engineering internships, but my plans to do software engineering full-time de-railed (along with my plans to graduate) when I got hit with mental illness a few years ago.  I've improved a lot, but the general rule that seems to hold these days is that I can only do around 4-5 hours worth of ""serious analytical thinking"" a week, when I used to be able to do 50+.

Just wanted to get this off my chest since I really don't feel so well and hate to let other people down, especially when they had been really nice."

38wv19,12,2015-06-07,Questions about very rapid weight loss,muwa,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/38wv19/questions_about_very_rapid_weight_loss/,"Hi /r/loseit I'm Male, 21, 5'10"" and 194 lbs. 

A little back story: In high school I was 165 lbs and a competitive swimmer on a national level (trained 4 hours a day 5 days a week). Once I went away to college I stopped doing cardio all together and just lifted on and off for periods of about 2 months at a time. I also partied....a lot. I would go out 5 nights a week and probably would have around 10 drinks a night on average and my weight more or less tapered off at around 190-195 lbs. My lifestyle was very sedentary and I would eat out pretty much every meal. 

After I graduated in May, I decided that I would pick myself up by my bootstraps and get fit. This summer I am working in Germany for two months for an internship before I start my masters and this has given me a lot of motivation because absolutely everyone under the age of 40 here is in very good shape. What I've been doing:

* Cut out drinking altogether (5000 cal deficit per week)
* I run for 30 minutes every other day (usually about a 5k which is 425 ish calories according to Runtastic)
* Started eating a bowl of cornflakes for breakfast (~200 cal) and usually having a salad for lunch and dinner (~500 to 600 calories each)
* Started doing a lot of walking since driving isn't and option (maybe a mile or more each day).

Doing some back of the napkin calculations I am creating a 11,800 cal deficit per week  which roughly translates into 3.4 pounds per week. I have read that it is unsafe to lose more than 2 pounds a week and I am worried that instead of burning fat that I will start burning muscle. Is what I am doing relatively safe or should I try doing something else? "

I'm not sure if this is the right place but I'm a bit confused about my paycheck. I'm a 20 y/o Sophomore heading into my Junior year this Fall majoring in Computer Science. I started an internship last week making $16/hr. I received my first paycheck for the first week I worked (40 hours @ $16/hour = $640 before tax). I noticed that I was hit pretty heavily on taxes, much more than I'm used to when I was working at other places. After taxes, it was about $520. At my previous job, I worked part time for my school and was being taxed about 15%. It seems like I'm being taxed ~22%. On my paystub, I had to pay Social Security Tax and Medicare tax while I didn't have to at my part time job. Is that because I'm working full time now? I don't have much experience with this. 

Some info:

I still live at home with just my mom in New York City. She can't physically work and receives government assistance. Most of my college tuition is paid for via scholarships and grants (I go to a local state college neaby). I plan on saving 85% of the money. Is there anything specific I should be doing with it, which should be a little over 6k after taxes. 



Thanks For The Help."
38xlmn,53,2015-06-07,Saw Father John Misty Perform Last Night [Show Review/Essay],art36,indieheads,https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/38xlmn/saw_father_john_misty_perform_last_night_show/,"So, I went to see Father John Misty in Pittsburgh last night. I only recently became interested in his music, but *I Love You, Honeybear* is my AoTY at the moment and ""Holy Shit"" is the best song of the year that I've heard thus far (just my opinion), so my expectations for the show are running relatively high.

Anyway, this show is interesting because it is being played in a small music hall in a 100 year-old library about 10 minutes outside the city. As someone who covers live music in the city, this is far from a normal Saturday night in terms of live music options; Taylor Swift is playing Heinz Field (stadium the Steelers play in), Dave Matthews Band is playing the 20,000+ capacity music amphitheater, and there are a plethora of other shows vying for the attention of music lovers and concert goers, but here I was with about 800-1000 other fans who decided to forego the other options that would seem more desirable to most folks to attend this show.

I didn't initially plan on posting a show review here or elsewhere. I was just going to share this funny sort of story of what happened prior to the show. As my buddy and I waited for the openers to begin their set (Mini Mansions), we had some drinks outside the venue (the volunteers from the library were selling wine and beer outside). It was a gorgeous summer day and we were enjoying the early evening drinking alcohol from solo cups before the show.

The venue is nestled on a hill that overlooks a Victorian-styled park with a gazebo and carefully-crafted flower beds. As my friend and I finish our conversation criticizing all of the shitty parking jobs along the street (About 20 yard away from where we are standing) I suddenly notice a man strolling carelessly down the street with cigarette in hand. As soon as I recognize that is Josh Tillman, Father John Misty, the man of the evening, he looks up and we make eye-contact. 

Now, I've worked in live music for several years (although I currently work in finance) and I know better than to make a scene or really do anything to cause attention or something unwarranted, I just smile and raise my solo cup as a nice kind but subtle gesture. He grins as he continues along the sidewalk and emphatically raises his hand with his imaginary solo cup to return the gesture. It was the perfect little interaction: nothing to get held up, no words were shared, but there was a mutual sort of respect and honesty that was really neat. I've had the pleasure of meeting several notable musicians in various circumstances (Alice Cooper, Chris Cornell, Tegan and Sara, and Matt Berninger among others), but this was probably my favorite and most candid interaction.

Soon thereafter we finished our drinks and entered the venue. The openers, Mini Mansions, were ok in every sense of the word. The lead singer, in a very gimmicky sense, played the percussion during their set. They have a very poppy sound, and for the first time in my life I honestly felt that a drum machine would sound so much better in a live show for a band than whatever this guy was doing. It wasn't a bad performance, though, but it was very forgettable.

We waited in our seats during the intermission and saw the stream of additional concert-goers fill into the music hall. The music playing during the intermission was almost entirely spaghetti western themed music, which was surprisingly very entertaining! The song prior to FJM taking the stage was actually the theme song from [Django/Django Unchained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAooXLAPoBQ)! As soon as the final notes sounded, the lights dimly lowered.

The set opened with the title track/album opener ""I Love You, Honeybear."" The song on the record is very sublime and not very anthemic, but FJM came running onto the stage and absolutely belted out the song. I had watched several of his performances online prior to the show, but this was very unexpected. He ran around the stage flailing the microphone stand and then crashing down to his knees as he sang. 

One thing I need to point out, especially to folks who've never seen Father John Misty live, is that Josh Tillman has a booming voice. The entire music hall rang with his words through each and every song. The amount of confidence and stage presence he had was on par with great rock frontmen like Mick Jagger. Most indie or folk frontmen are very reserved and let their songs do most of the talking, so to speak, but FJM's stage antics were very much an integral component of the show as he seemingly acted out each song. I don't think I've ever used the phrase ""Folk rock star,"" but that is precisely what he was and is. 

As the set continued, each song built upon the previous one, and there was no signs of him slowing down. Most shows I attend, an act may start strong or start slow, but then things tend to settled down, but this was never the case as each song continued to maintain the same level of energy and commitment to execution. Each break between songs was filled rapturous applause followed by friendly banter.

The final song of the main set was ""Holy Shit,"" and it was played to absolute perfection. The song started out with just him on stage playing an acoustic guitar, as the song progressed each member of his band slowly crept up to their position on stage and awaited what was to come. Just as the song crescendos on the album, the band began to essentially play shrieking noise (very similar to when Wilco performs ""Via Chicago"" live), and then perfectly continued in unison with the final verses. Tillman leaped out into the crowd as he belted out the final words and crawled over seats to stand. It was absolutely glorious to see a musician so captivated and seeing the true meaning of the words really wash over himself as he sang to the crowd. He returned to the stage with a huge tear in the right knee of his suit pant leg. I don't know if it was a cheap suit from Macy's or an Armani suit, but I don't think it would've changed FJM's mind to bear his soul to the audience.

And I think that is what makes Father John Misty' music so enthralling. Sure, I've heard and read that people think he is pretentious and whatnot, but he certainly does not lack sincerity. There's no doubt that he has a sizable ego, but his music certainly holds up to that standard in my eyes (and ears). It was beyond impressive to see an artist completely devoted to truly becoming the master of their own sound. It felt like seeing Dylan perform in 1964 or Neil Young in 1975. You truly feel in awe of an artist realizing and reaching their full potential.

My final words would simply be to go see him play live if he is touring in your city or nearby. It was a truly mesmerizing experience, and I don't say that lightly. I used to intern at a live music venue where I saw a few hundred performances, and I still go to quite a few shows (just this week I saw Tame Impala, My Morning Jacket, and Jenny Lewis, and I'll be seeing The War on Drugs next week), and this might've been the very best show I've ever seen. It was funny to think of, literally, the hundreds of thousand of concert goers who will be talking about their time at Taylor Swift or Dave Mathews come Monday, but I honestly feel that they missed what will probably be the best live performance in the city all year.

For the sake of discussion, though, feel free to share your thoughts if you've seen or plan on seeing Father John Misty live and if you agree/disagree with my synopsis. "
38xuct,382,2015-06-07,"My SO [24M] always pulls the ""If you really love me you would..."" card and I [22F] am so sick of it.",ifyoureallyloveme,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38xuct/my_so_24m_always_pulls_the_if_you_really_love_me/,"I hear it at least once every two weeks or so, whether it be in text or conversation, and it's starting to piss me off. It's his way of asking me to do things for him, and here's the thing--*I would do them, if only he worded it differently*. I've already asked him to stop using the phrase, and told him in response that I love him with all of my heart, but to no avail. It actually isn't the asking me to do things that's the problem, it's the fact that he seems to have a habit of using that phrase. I don't want to blow this up and make it a bigger deal that it already is, but at the same time I hate how he seems to casually uses our relationship as leverage to get me to do things for him/us.


Obviously, our relationship is still very brand new (4 mo), and I am willing to take the time to work on and move past this issue with him. I think he's a great guy, but when I go to my friends for advice on this problem, they tell me to stay away, and that it's a hint about his personality and how he views me and my role in the relationship. They fear that our relationship will evolve into an emotionally abusive one, and that I'll end up as some sort of servant to cater to his needs.

   
**tl;dr**: BF constantly uses the phrase ""If you really love me you would..."". Is this something I can fix, or a sign of a toxic relationship worth breaking up over?



Edit 1: Wow I wasn't really expecting this to blow up as much as it did. Thank you all SO much for your responses. I'm sitting here in bed reading up on emotionally abusive relationships and I'm starting to feel like I've only given one side of the story. It's quite hard for me to believe that our relationship could escalate into something like what I’ve been reading, because I love him more than I've loved anybody else that I've been in a relationship with. And I know that he loves me, he tells me that every single day. I haven't explained adequately enough how great of a guy he is and how much I respect him and trust him with my life. The good and compassionate person in me has overlooked this problem every time it comes up, and right now I'm wondering if just a little bit more love, affection, and understanding from me will help him get over whatever complex he is internally dealing with.


In terms of ending the relationship now, it’s something I don’t want to think about. As I reflect deeper and deeper on our relationship, in these past couple hours I’ve realized how obsessive he is about having control over me and my feelings. The friend problem is a big one, as I’ve realized that my social life completely revolves around his. Our relationship has definitely evolved to one where I feel like I am in debt to him, because he’s helped me so much school and career-wise. Not so much financially, luckily enough, but it is because of him that I have my current internship and can go to my future grad school. So if we were to break up, if he wanted to he could basically make my life hell on earth.


I guess one more thing you guys should know and are going to go apeshit over is that he’s had a physically abusive past. When I first met him, he was going through a breakup, catalyzed by a fight he had had with his ex one night. He punched a wall and pounded his fists on the bed where she was sitting, giving her some bruises. Now when he asked me out he promised me he would never lay a hand on me, and that promise has been upheld. I do feel safe with him, as we have resolved arguments civilly and successfully, but at the same time I know the damage his unrestrained temper can cause.


I’m sorry this post is such a mess. I don’t really know what to do or think. Like I said before, I have asked him to stop using the phrase and told him that I don’t like it, but he responds as if he is acting in my best interest and that I don’t know what’s good for me. I’ve never pressed the issue any further than that, simply because threatening break up over a simple request for food seems makes me feel delusional and crazy, as well as a little bit scared of what could happen.

I can't find anything in the r/montreal subreddit rules against this, but mods, feel free to remove.]

Hi there,

I arrived here in late April for a summer internship at a start-up. It turns out we weren't a very good match, which means my next few months will be very open. I'm trying my very best to get myself to daily events I find through Facebook in hopes of establishing friendship(s), but I'd like to exhaust every avenue for finding them, reddit included.

A little bit about me: I'm 21, a fourth-year university student majoring in Computer Science, minoring in French. I'm a small-circle-of-friends kind of guy; I have one very close friend back home, two a bit more distant, but apart from them it's just acquaintances. I'm very devoted to queer, feminist, and racial equality causes and have spent much of these last few years back home doing activist work. (I'd like very much to get involved with similar things here.) I'm a nerd who loves tech, but also language; sudden realisations that previously unlinked words in my mind have common etymology gets me as excited as unboxing my latest device. Late night talks with friends are some of my favourite things in the world; I'm infinitely happier waking up after having spent all night emotionally bonding through debate than rising at morning having bonded sexually. I don't speak French very well at all, but enjoy making a game out of finding the words to communicate existent in my present vocabulary (again, language nerd). Finding someone at my level (that of an early primary school student, perhaps) and amused by similar follies would be super.

As I stated, I have much free time, so it would be ideal to find someone who's similarly uncommitted. Excursions together at least a few times a week, dining at new restaurants, walking around new parks, spending nights together talking on the couch, etc., would be great. (In the interest of full disclosure, I'm searching for intimacy, yes, but emotional intimacy, not sexual; I'm an ardent supporter of the theory that attraction takes many forms, some of which couldn't be more distant from genitalia.)

I think that's it for now. I'll edit later if I come to realise I've left out anything critical. Please, feel free to reply or inbox. I'm posting this on a Sunday afternoon (7 June), and would love to grab drinks or a cup of coffee together anytime, be it to-night, to-morrow, or this week-end!

Thank you kindly,

I use a 3d printer at an internship I have right now all the time, and I really want one for myself, and the simple metal looks to be the best option for me.  The one thing that I am worried about is the sound that a 3d printer makes.  I am still in high school, so I still obviously live with my parrents, and they are a little concerned about the sound that the printer would make.  I plan to have it in my room on my desk, and I personally am a very heavy sleeper that has slept through my step dad installing shingles on the roof above my head, but my mother and sister are both very sensitive to sound.  My basic question is on a scale of 1 to 10, one being something quiet like a computer case fan, and 10 being something like a clothes washing machine, just how loud is the simple metal?  Also, if anyone else has been in my situation what have you done to quiet the printer down?"

38yhrg,3,2015-06-07,"I [21M] was just dumped by my girlfriend [20F] of two years. Left on good terms, says she's always a phone call away. Wants to give things another go in the future.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38yhrg/i_21m_was_just_dumped_by_my_girlfriend_20f_of_two/,"Background: Started dating in high school, carried it into college. Been together for about 2 years and 4 months. I'm out of state for a summer internship. We did long distance for my entire freshman year of college (she was still a senior in high school).

My girlfriend dumped me. We're long distance right now and we recently had a pretty huge fight. I thought we had recovered, but I was really needy for a week and was constantly asking for reassurance. I think it annoyed her and she couldn't handle how overbearing I was being. We only lasted a week after the fight. Other than that, I really thought the relationship was going great and I think she would agree.  I'm so confused as to how a rough week can destroy everything. She was so overbearing at times during my freshman year yet I always stuck with her and helped her through it. I've RARELY had to lean on her for emotional support. Seriously, maybe only a couple times.

She says that she has some soul searching to do and needs to be happy with herself before she can be there for me again. She says that this isn't my fault, and that she doesn't expect me to completely understand, but to just give her some space for now. She also wants to give things another go when we return back to school in August. She wants to remain loyal to one another until then and she promises not to hook up with other guys (I would find out pretty quickly since we have the same friend group back home). She says she still wants to get married, have children, and live happily ever after with me. She swears that this is just her working through some personal issues before moving forward.

I'm absolutely devastated. I'm across the country living by myself without any friends or family. I have no idea how I'm going to keep up with work in addition to taking a couple online classes. She said she still loves me and that she'll always be there for me and that if I ever need to call her I can. As much as I'd love to take up her offer, I think it'll just make things more painful for me and only decrease our chances of getting back together. I feel so betrayed after everything I've done for her.


Should I call? Should I give things another shot after she gave up on our relationship so easily? How do I trust her to be in it for the long run if she can't tough it out for a week? Are all ""breaks"" bullshit?

**tl;dr**: Dumped by girlfriend. She wants to give things another shot when we return back to school (August) when she's done working out some personal issues. She says I can call her whenever I need to if I'm ever feeling lonely. Do I call? Do I give things another shot?"
38yko8,3,2015-06-07,I am relatively panicked about my digestive problems and would really appreciate an informed outlook to calm me down while I wait to be able to call my doctor...,medicallyembarresed,medical,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/38yko8/i_am_relatively_panicked_about_my_digestive/,"Hey as the title says I am pretty panicked and bothered by what has been going on. Let me start by saying I am 21 and in general I have been having digestive problems for about a month and a half. THe digestive problems started out with serious amount of nausea, constipation, lack of appetite, bloating, abdominal pain, and vomiting (that occurred once). Went to the ER and they did a CT scan where I had to drink a ton of contrast. The results of that showed that all of the contrast stayed in my stomach even after two hours so they suspected gastroparesis but referred me to a gastroentrologist. They saw nothing else. 

Gastroenterologist saw me for an appointment and on describing everything he told me he wanted to do an EGD and a Gastric Emptying Time Scan. He did some prodding around at my abdomen but I wasn't tender or what have you so I guess that was okay. EGD happens and everything is normal. Gastric Emptying Time Scan, normal. Even a barium x-ray thing that was similar to the gastric time scan (they tried to see how long it would take to fill my bowel), normal. Everything so far screams ""normal."" He told me I have a lazy colon and just need to have Miralax twice a day. Bisacodyl if I haven't gone in several days.  Through all of this the only time i have a full bowel movement (still until now) is if I take bisacodyl and miralax and get to where I have diarrhea. 

Now I am incredibly stressed because I was getting all of these tests done rapidly because I had to leave for Dubai for an unpaid internship with IBM on May 30th. The trip itself has been fine so far. I am still adjusting to the whole 8 hour difference thing but I am continuing on my path of being unable to eat, unable to have a bowel movement, nausea etc. What is changing is I am noticing that I am constantly going to the bathroom like I need to have a bowel movement (I feel like I can) but nothing comes of it. If I do manage to pass a small amount of stool there is a small amount of bright red blood on the toilet paper and this has been going on since approximately Thursday. I called my doctor at home on Friday. Also when I urinate (especially if I am siting down), when I stand up or start to walk a little I dribble urine. This urine complaint has gone on for about a week and a half but it didn't seem like anything but it seems to be getting slightly worse over time and to be honest like I said I am getting crazy worried so I can't help but think it is a huge problem now. They said to call again on Monday if it persists, which I will but due to time differences and when this doctor gets in I probably won't hear from them fully about what to do or think for at least another 14 hours. Looking at all the tests they did, they (I think) hardly really checked my colon and this terrifies me to an extent now as well.

Anyways I think I have given a ton of information and I hope that is enough for some of you guys to maybe help me out with regard to giving me a reasonable outlook on what is going on... I have done my best to ignore WebMD results that say things like cancer and mainly look at just symptoms to see what might match up with a Lazy Colon + something that isn't crazy. Maybe just IBS and a Hemorrhoid? I just don't know anymore. 

I also welcome any advice on how to receive international healthcare. From what I understand there is a Health Card I can apply for which I am going to apply for tomorrow but I am pretty sure Total Health Care (though the Governemnt, I am a poor college kid) will cover international medical costs so that is part of my stress too.

Thanks for reading. 


EDIT: It might also be worth note that I am 5'4"" and about 145 lbs.

EDIT2: I have been taking bisacodyl over the course of about a month in general by recommendation from him. Same with miralax. My miralax dosage increased to twice a day when he said. Also when it comes to food intake I am looking at STRUGGLING to have a meal and a half a day. "

38ypvc,3,2015-06-07,I wished I got into Computer Science,missgalvin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/38ypvc/i_wished_i_got_into_computer_science/,"I always liked computers. My first contact was when my big bro, who was graduating at the time, got a PC so he could write his thesis. Very quicky I learned what I could - only the basics, how to run a game from DOS, simple stuff.

However, there was something that ruined the scenario: I never got into Math. We lived near an Engineering School - ended up knowing a lot of people from there, even dating some - and everytime I stared at the building, I got sad because I knew I couldn't get into computing and into that school because I was terrible in Math. So I grew up believing that I would end up studying foreign languages.

And now here I am. I'm 30 and back to my parents' place. Years ago I graduated from Modern Languages, finally ending the long ""suffering"": I never enjoyed my course and never believed I could change to another thing. I hated myself and had settled to a career in Technical Translation.
The internship actually helped me realize that I could learn what I wanted. Two years later, I gave up on Translation and stated studying on my own.

I tried what I could. Did a short course on Programming. Learned about the history of the Internet on Coursera. Started studying for certificates and got an CompTIA A+ cert. Still studying for network certifications. Meanwhile got interested in Web Developing as well.

Sometimes it hits me. I've read about the differences between Computer Engineering and Computer Science and my heart believes CS should have been my choice. I learned to enjoy Math, have been doing Khan Academy for a while... but here I am. On my 30s, accepting my bad choices, unemployed, without much money, struggling with Depression, watching my friends leaving the country or furfilling what they wanted, and what's there for me? Call centre jobs and getting the minimum wage (which is about 500 euro)? 

I just wished I had taken another path..."
38yqbo,4,2015-06-07,Me [24F] with my sister [19F] she refuses to grow up and take responsibility for her life (long),Ash_Fire,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/38yqbo/me_24f_with_my_sister_19f_she_refuses_to_grow_up/,"Hello. I will apologize in advance for the length as I like my storytelling to be thorough.

So, of my sisters and I, there's me ""Peter Perfect"" (24F), my middle sister ""The Rebel"" (20F), and ""The Oddball"" (19F). True to those nick-names you can guess how our family views us individually. I did all the things in high school, went to the family alma mater for college, and graduated and got a long internship right out of school. One can argue that where my family is concerned, I did everything ""right."" The Rebel also did a lot of things in high school, not quite to the extent that I did, but found her own expression different from mine (which we happily discuss when talking about our various projects). She's now in an art college, and doing quite well from what I can gather. 

The Oddball didn't really do much. For starters, when she was a young teenager, she was diagnosed with Aspergers, and had a specific medication that she hated taking to help her focus at school. Her social life wasn't great, and frankly it didn't help that she would get reamed by The Rebel at home when anything set her off (although some of that was a call to do her work). She started to do some extracurriculars, but quit many of them as soon as she figured out she didn't have to participate if she didn't want to. The only thing she stuck with were dance classes, that I think were the only thing in her life that gave her a real sense of obligation (but for whatever reason the school play did not- possibly because of my involvement years before). 

Her school work was a mess. If she wasn't satisfied with the work, she wouldn't turn it in, even if she knew it was something like a paper she would be getting back to make corrections before the final grade. Or, the more common case, if she didn't want to do homework, she would go play video games, particularly ones where it's not hard to lose a few hours playing. Not to hate on video games, I like playing them too (and even watch different YouTubers play the ones I'll never buy b/c I can't afford them), but she's totally in the whatever game it is to get lost in it. Even getting her drivers permit and license were tough because she just would not study, despite the direct correlation of its usefulness. She was finally convinced when Daddy said, ""Ok, let's walk to school so we know how long it's going to take."" She got it almost immediately thereafter. 

Between me, my other sister and my dad, we had a hell of a time convincing her that she must do her homework if she was going to graduate (she almost did not graduate with her class and was almost forced to take summer classes). Nearly every conversation that was about what she was going to do would end in her screaming and crying in frustration ""I Don't Know!"" shortly followed by her escaping back to video game land. (My mom was the only person who could convince her without or with less tears than we conjured. She passed a few years ago.) Through many tears, wailing, and gnashing of teeth, she did graduate high school. 

So came the inevitable question: what's next? She had applied to a few schools, but nothing too serious (also a hard time scheduling things like SATs/ACTs). Although if you asked her, she would say that she wants to professionally be on the storyboard team for video game companies. So, the summer started she had no idea what to do next, when she finally got an acceptance letter. Again with much badgering, we got the ball rolling and she was in college.  A new environment where she doesn't really *have* to do anything, she was put on academic probation her first semester. She failed to get out of it that next semester, and will not be returning next fall. Daddy has said she must get a job or he's going to kick her out. I don't like it, because she really has nowhere to go, but at the same time the only proven motivator for her is being forced into the worst case scenario. It's been a little more than a month since she put applications in. She's had one interview and didn't get the job. She has yet to continue job hunting.

Reddit, how can my family instill motivation in her, without resorting to the worst case scenario, when even she doesn't know what motivates her?



   
**tl;dr**: My sister is a massive gamer, and wants to do it professionally as a writer but is too lazy take the necessary steps to get there. She's now in the beginning of the downward spiral that will lead to the worst case scenario. How to motivate?"
38yqur,0,2015-06-07,[Under the radar] Arozak Salam Indonesia's first Mr. Gay world delegation on 2014. Will be any delegation on 2015?,drugar48,indonesia,https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/38yqur/under_the_radar_arozak_salam_indonesias_first_mr/,"I know it's outdated, but it's worthy to share. Before i'm plunge into the main course, here's link that could give you a glimpse on what is Mr.Gay World, what are the goals and vision and mission [About Mr.Gay World](http://www.mrgayworld.com/about-us/) and [Mr.Gay World Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Gay_World)

&amp;nbsp;

Not much that i can tell you about [Arozak salam](http://imgur.com/PIBhxtm) because of the limitation of information that i could find. Arozak Salam was alumni of Institut Tekonologi Bandung (ITB) year 2005-2009 focusing on Ocean engineering, previously work as announcer at Oz Radio Bandung on 2007, had an internship as Coastal Engineering at Ausenco Sandwell on 2010 and now currently live in Australia. Ozak as he referring himself, enter Mr.Gay World pageant while he is still 26 years old. the pageant itself  was held in Rome from August 24 - August 31 2014. Voluntarily joining the contest, he seems has a high concern on LGBTIQ community in Indonesia.Even though he wasn't obtained a place in any category, but his deeds and spirit will be inspiring others LGBTIQ youth especially in Indonesia.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the transcript from his Q &amp; A that he made:

&amp;nbsp;

**Hi Ozak, I’m sure not many people know you at this stage. Can you introduce yourself to the world?**

Okay, in a short way, I’m a half hippy and half corporate

**What do you mean?**

Yeah, I am a free spirit. I’m not my hair. I’m not my skin. I am a soul that lives within. I like to sing and dance especially in the rain. On the other hand, I am a subsea engineer. I like to get lost infront of computer analysing wave fatigue analysis on the drilling riser. I occasionally like wearing a suit. So, I see myself as a half hippy and half corporate.

**Good to know. Let’s talk more about your participation in Mr.Gay World 2014. How did you hear about this event?**

I think I knew it before from the news. When I mentioned to my housemate that I wanted to join, his response was like “Is that for gay people?” and I just nodded. Apparently my straight friend willing to take part the competition as well.

**Hahahaha, he needs to confirm to the committee first for the eligibility. What made you decide to join then?**

 I have personal reason which I cannot tell you in this interview because I want to address this matter direcly in the competition later. But I can give you other reason which is “visibility”. In my home country, the majority of LGBT people still live under the radar. We do exist, but we are still considered as a joke sometimes. We are there among the society, but there is still a huge barrier to assimilate with them. It’s difficult to apprehend the good side of us when the stigma still dominate our portrait. The combination of social norm and religious perception towards LGBT people is still the biggest burden for us to make peace within ourselves.

After the visibility comes “tolerance”. I am grateful enough to be able to live overseas and do bit of travelling. While many asian LGBT still struggle with their identity to fit in to the society in home country, I find other challenges within LGBT community itself that sometimes the gay scene can be more cruel than you can ever imagined. No black, no asian, no white, no feminine, no over 30. Hung only. Hairy only, Manly only, Top only.

Well you know what, I am going to step up on the world stage for you all to see me whatever I am. I am all the rejection that you can address. I am all the unticked criterias that you required. At the same time, I am the reality. This shape, face, race, voice are there on the stage for you to see me. You don’t have to love me, you don’t have to accept me. Only this time, I ask you to see me. If thousands of me appear and you become familiar with it, I hope your tolerance level might improve slightly better.

**Ok, it’s getting too serious here and I’m not sure if I can digest all your information. Anyway, how is the preparation so far?**

So far so good. A good friend of mine helping me with the national costume. My friends keep sending the support through private message and online voting. The rest it’s just managing the expectation, really. Luckily I got upcoming holiday so I can indulging myself to refresh my mind. Hopefully I don’t go too crazy.

**Just random question, are you top or bottom?**

What kind of question is this? I will answer that on grindr if you insist.

**Just random question again, do you think size matter?**

I’m glad you ask. Ehmm, but why is it important for you to know? (awkward silent for a while).

**Well, it’s been a pleasure to have a chat with you then. Goodluck for the competition ahead.**

What? That’s it? No more question? Ask me more!!!

I am working at IT tech support internship and I just super grateful to be able to afford school through the help of my family.

I teach for a non-profit that serves underserved communities, and it is a blessing to give back to the community, of a country that gave me a chance.

I am a sophomore in an ivy league college at the moment. I have held decent paid summer internships every summer for last few years. When I graduate with a BS in Computer Science, I will have no student loans since my parents paid for everything, which I will be eternally grateful for. Despite all the things I am proud of myself for, I frankly am clueless about how to approach the future.

Assuming I can get a full-time job out of college, when should I be setting up the things I commonly see such as a 401k, starting my credit, and anything else. Also, should I be living with my parents out of college first in order to save money or should I develop independent experience? Finally, with a BS in Computer Science, would that be a flexible degree to land jobs with or should I instead try to now go for a Computer Engineering degree ? Thank you all, and have a nice day!"

OK first off, I don't really know if he's really my ex, since we are pretty much in contact and he keeps saying he will come back to me when he's done growing up. 

So recently, James's father has not been well, and needed to get surgery. Living in Canada, health care is pretty much free, so hospital bills are not the problem. However, because of this illness, he will be unable to continue working for the next 3 years. James has just finished his bachelor in electrical engineering, but has no internships or related working experience. His mother who is also working, says she can't afford working alone to support their family of 5 and is pressuring him to find a job. I don't know what she exactly said to him because I wasn't there, but James last week, cried to me over the phone, saying he needs to find a job and grow up, and to do that, he wanted a break.

James, for the years I have been with him, has sort of slacked off, and would sort of treat me like shit occasionally, for which I would reprimand him. But I've always felt the need to help him however I can. It's partially my fault, that he has become the way he is, because I was the one pushing him to apply to jobs (I would make his resume and cover letters as well as apply for the jobs for him). He would get interviews, but unfortunately would not pass them. Because of my success with finding jobs and his failure, he sometimes tells me ""you're only getting hired because you're a girl"". 

Anyway, he's been feeling really low on himself, but he doesn't really have anyone to support him except me, but he just wanted to be friends until he can figure things out. 

I wanted to distance myself from him so he could get the peace he wanted, but he calls me and wants my company, so I don't understand... Why he wanted a beak.

Should I keep supporting him, or do I leave him be?

Tldr; ex just broke up with me because he needed time to grow, but now he's showing signs of depression and wants and needs my support. What should I do? Leave or stay."

I'd like to apologize for the wall of text but these events have really devastated me and I am so confused.

A few days ago I went on a trip with my girlfriend of two months - just us two. We had a ""perfect"" time (as quoted by her friends) but when I came back I had to leave her place as I had to see another friend of mine. 

The next day I messaged her, asking her what her plans for the day were. She seemed quite reluctant to reply, which made me think something was 'off'. I knew she was seeing a friend who really wanted to meet up with her again and that she had a networking dinner so I understood that she might be busy.

However, she always has got her phone nearby and I know she saw the messages (perks of Whatsapp), let alone saw the notifications she got. I was concerned because she usually texts back anyone who messages her, and I would have thought that after such a trip, she would still ride this 'high' and be really happy to talk to me. 

Once when she actually did message me, she asked what I was doing, to which I told her what I did that day (mind you this is at ~4pm already). She gets back to me after two hours with a completely new topic, disregarding everything I told her. It felt that she didn't really care what I said - I was quite surprised and frankly started to get pissed off, replying ""whatever"".

We stopped talking and that night she said she would go out clubbing. I was still pissed at that point and I messaged a few friends and went out with them as well. I had a few drinks and couldn't stop thinking about what happened that night so messaged her flatmates boyfriend who was with my gf at the time at the club.

He said that she does not know what she wants and that I should keep my options open, which really pissed me off. I told him that I would come by my gf's place and take my stuff (this was at ~3am), to which he encouraged me to do so.

I came by and took my stuff while she was taking a shower, without saying a word to her. Her flatmates were telling me to calm down but I just left with my stuff in my bag. 

I messaged her afterwards and when she finally picked up her phone, she said I reminded her of her ex (who was quite abusive) and that my 'fit' at her place just reinforces her belief that she is ""not ready for a relationship"". 

I was devastated.

I mean we just came back from this great trip abroad and this happens in 24 hours? The next day we spoke very briefly, and she asked me to come to her place to ""chill"" at around 11pm. She never uses the word ""chill"" with me. I accepted and went over, where we spoke about what happened.

She said she is not ready for the relationship and thinks we should break off especially now that summer is coming up - she's actually leaving to do an internship two days from now. I admitted that I overreacted by storming into her place and taking my things, but I felt that this was just a bump on the otherwise smooth road that we were on. She said that we would make good friends i.e. friend-zoning me, which really hurt me. She even got me a birthday present (my bday is next month) and gave it to me then. 

How could it have gone from the best times in our relationship to the worst in less than 48 hours?

I know she still likes me and this is real hard on me as I don't know what to do. 

Help me Reddit.

Thanks so much.

390s5e,1,2015-06-08,My sadness and self hatred of my job is ruining my relationship.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/390s5e/my_sadness_and_self_hatred_of_my_job_is_ruining/,"So to start off, this is my first post here so I'm sorry if I break any rules. I marked this NSFW because my problem effects my sex life as well. I have not been diagnosed with depression or any mental disorder because my parents don't believe there's anything wrong. I don't know where else to put this, but if you know a better place please let me  know.

So I'm 21, senior engineering student at college. My boyfriend is 24 graduate student. We've been dating for 8 months and its clear we both have some problems, mentally, but for the most part we're still just normal under control people. 

Well I've been at a crap internship for the last 6 months, and this place has caused me so much stress and anxiety that I've sunken down as low as I've ever gotten. I rarely think of committing suicide, but it has crossed my mind. I've thought of drinking myself into happiness, but I've never done it. I vent my anger, frustration, and my sadness to my boyfriend a lot. 

Most of the time it's about self hatred and feeling like a worthless intern here. I get the vibe that everyone here hates me and can't wait to get rid of me. This job is in a field I'm not too familiar with doing work I'm not that good at. They've put a lot pressure on me to do work faster than I can do it, and when I make even the slightest mistake I get chewed out for it. I'm too scared to talk to my manager because any time I have talked to him the situation only gets worse.

So I'm stuck venting and crying to my boyfriend to the point where I just text him, ""well I'm crying again, I hate company X and everything else blah blah blah"" and he just tends to say I'm sorry or its ok and then we just stop.

We're pretty sure this is affecting our sex life as well because I have trouble finishing from anything else but my own hand. Whenever we try it always ends with me crying because i feel like I'm broken. So he told said we need to figure this out because he feels inadequate and not good enough for me. He said we shouldn't have sex until I figure this out, and while sex isn't important to me, it did make me feel closer and more loved by him.

I've reached the point where I can't run from my own internal problems anymore. I feel like I'm causing all of this stress and pain, ruining the best relationship I've ever been in. I don't know where to go or what to do or even who to talk to.

 I'm scared and now distracted by this problem while I'm at work. I've thought about therapy, but I'm on my parents insurance and I don't know how it works, I can't afford therapy out of pocket. Talking to my parents about this just leads to them saying I'm being overdramatic, and maybe I am but I can't stand this sadness and crying anymore.

I feel useless at work, at school, I can't make my boyfriend happy... I hate this struggle, this constant feeling like no one wants me and I'm in the way.

I'm sorry for the long post. Thank you for reading.

#tl;dr I'm sad and scared of everyone at job, I can't satisfy my boyfriend in bed, and my parents won't listen to my plea for help. I don't know what to do :( #"

So taking a few of your advices I reached out to the head of my department and shot him an email over the weekend explaining my situation and my talk with the HR Director.  After that I went about my weekend and put it out of my mind.  With that said, there were a few times when my phone would go off I go would get a bit nervous that I would get a message or call from her, but that subsided.  

In fact, when I walked through the doors this morning I really had started feeling better about the whole situation; like everything was back to normal.  An hour had passed then all of a sudden my department head pulled me into his office and sat me down.  He and I go way back to when I first started working here so he told me that he had talked to HR and that he was not allowed to discuss anything with me until they had spoken to me first.  He then told me to consider my options before I signed any paperwork, then walked me up to HR.

Now I am a grown man, but I have to admit that the walk and elevator ride up to HR was the most uncomfortable silence and nerve wracking experience I had experienced in a while.  It was like being marched to the Principal's office and you were not sure why.  My stomach was in knots and thoughts of getting a lawyer or finding a new job started jumping into my head.  By the time I had sat down in the HR director's office I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin.

The HR director sat me down and went over what I had reported on Friday before leaving for the day.  She kept saying that she wanted to make sure I wasn't leaving out any detail or if I had any video or audio proof of what I claimed.  At this point I felt like I was on trial for something so I started asking why I would have any of that or be even prepared to document my life in such a way when up till her showing up to my house I had never put anything thought about her being anything other than friendly.  She then told me they found that my records had been reviewed as well as others, but I was the only one that had come forwards with anything.  As many of you can imagine I was confused at what was going on and a bit scared, so I asked her flat out what is going on.  

She told me that as of today the intern had been fired and if I wanted to pursue legal matters against her (restraining orders, breach of privacy, etc.) the company would provide me full support and back me up legally with lawyers.  I am also at this time getting 2 years free of credit monitoring and insurance.  The company would not bring up legal recourse against the intern unless I wanted to.  There was mention of offers for counseling and such, but I let them know I wouldn't be needing it as nothing outside of her showing up happened.  

They let me know I have 48 hours to take all the paperwork to my lawyers and think about what I would like to do.  But as of right now I don't think I have anything to worry about.  I talked to my director after the meeting and he told me that the company at this time is afraid I will sue, which he doesn't recommend, but I don't have to worry about my job.  I told him I wouldn't be pressing charges against her as she had already lost her job and well, I feel like that would be taking it too far.  He had a different feeling about it, but also told me that he might have handled the situation differently if he wasn't married and it had happened to him. 

Over all I feel relieved and wanted to thank everyone that had given the advice before

I have an internship this summer, and it's the first time I've ever received Direct Deposit. I am receiving 7 DDs this summer (already received 1, so 6 left, including one this Friday). 

I see a lot of good offers for banks to open a new account [Nationwide - $200, Chase - $150, SunTrust - $150, and others] if I set up DD with them for 1 or 2 DDs. [Already opened a Discover Bank acct for that $50 bonus without DD!]

Is it ok if I just constantly change the bank is sending the DD to from company every two weeks? If I ask them to switch, will they be able to change my DD by Friday for this week? Does it hurt me somehow if I have multiple bank accounts? I am organized enough to be able to manage it if there's no downside. 

I only have 6 DDs left so I want to make the most of it! 

Thanks for the responses. "

Every second gets worse.,choking_myself,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/391ykm/i_am_lost_and_terrified_of_life_every_second_gets/,"I'm a 23 male and have no idea who I am or what I want to be or how to handle life. I graduated with a bachelors degree in something I am not passionate about, nor does it promise much opportunities without serious effort (communications, of course). I feel like I was forced into going to school because of my family and pressure of society. My whole life has been directed for me from the start, and I feel like I have never made any real decisions of my own, and now that I am done school, its all up to me to figure out what to do. 

I've been leeching off my dad for 6 months, as he pays my rent and sends me money, and I'm supposed to be looking for a job. I haven't been searching because of my major social anxiety and lack of work experience. I've never had an internship and the only job I've had is working at my dads restaurant that didn't involve dealing with people. I look at job listings on craigslist and feel like a worthless piece of shit when I see the qualifications and feel like I can't do anything. I'm WORTHLESS. 

Even when I do imagine getting a job I could do like a crappier low end one such as a dishwasher, I start to worry about even more stuff like will I make enough to pay the rent? (Im in nyc so its very very high here) Will everyone look down on me? Do I even want to stay in this city? Will who I am die and will my soul be completely drained? Will I still have time to do the things I enjoy? Will I still be close to my friends? Will I be taking the right path? Will it all lead to something better? And will I be able to pick up the pieces if it doesn't work out? SO MANY THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD ALL THE TIME AND IT NEVER ENDS. 

I started taking a low dose of celexa last week, hoping it does something for me. The only time I feel almost okay is when I lay in bed awake late at night when everything is calm and no one will talk to me, or when I lay in the shower for hours just trying to escape from life in a capsule where all my problems wait outside once I step out. I can't even enjoy the things I like to do and have been isolating myself from my friends.

I instantly have a panic attack when I look at my phone and see my dad calling because he's always had anger management issues and I know he's frustrated and pissed off at me because its been half a year and I have nothing to show for it. I bottle up and say something like ""still looking for a job"" or ""yeah, interview soon, no offers yet"" and then I feel just as shitty. I'm a terrible person, and am too afraid to tell him I've been falling into a dark and scary depression this whole time. I am a fuck up and a let down. 

My apartment lease ends in 3 months, and at this point I really don't know what my life will become. I don't know whether I want to somehow stay in this expensive city where I know one day I'll have to leave; go back to my home state and try to rethink my existence, or run away and become a homeless drifter. I'm just floating in the ocean with no direction, having the current take me where it may. All these thoughts go on while everyday I contemplate killing myself. I've battled suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. I don't know if I am fit for this world, and maybe I should just leave. I don't know whether this post is a desperate cry for help or if I just need to see my thoughts down on paper in a way SOMEONE out there MAY actually read them. But I do know I could use ANY form of help, even if that means a stranger has heard me.

To anyone out there that feels as hopeless and terrified, you are not alone. "

I was recounting the short version of this to a friend yesterday and remembered that I'd been meaning to post the long version here, for all of you lovelies.  It took place over 3 consecutive days so I'll tell it in three parts.

DISCLAIMER - everything is true but I've changed names and some location details for privacy.  Also, this first part isn't very sexy.  But it's background for the next two steamier parts.  You can skip this if you're just skimming for the sex ;)

____________________________________

One year during grad school I took a summer internship in a completely different city.  I'd recently broken up with a long-term boyfriend and intended to use that summer to really ""find myself"" in all the best and worst ways.  The city I was moving to for the summer is about 15 hours drive from my home so a good friend of mine and I packed up the car and set out for a crazy summer.  We made plans to stop and stay for a night at my uncle's house which was about 2/3 of the way there so we wouldn't have to drive straight through.  We had so much fun we ended up staying for two nights before heading off to our destination.  But that stopover is where the story begins.

My uncle lived in a coastal town and his roommate was a bartender.  We got in from our long drive and relaxed for a while before we decided to head to the roomie's bar for some drinks.  My girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised - apparently there was a rugby tournament in town because the bar was filled to the brim with rugby players.  Some locals, but mostly Europeans visiting.  I wasn't aware of this at the time, but I think its common in the rugby world for teams to go out at night ""dressed up.""  Some were in shorts but they all had on dress shirts and ties.  So here's my friend and I just thinking we're going to get a quick drink and take in the view and instead we land on a gold mine of hot, athletic, European men in ties.  I may have literally proclaimed ""JACKPOT"" as I entered the bar.  

Another tradition that's common is their rugby drinking songs.  Some of the raunchiest stuff you've ever heard set to a tune. But of course, to a girl looking for a good time, it was the best soundtrack there could have been.

My friend and I had winged for each other before -  we knew each other's type, our habits, our games.  It was custom for us to each select a ""mark"" early on, and while that target could change, there's just something more fun about the hunt.  This is probably a good place to stop and describe myself.  I'm 5'7"", long brown hair, brown eyes, freckles, curvy (was heavier then come to think of it, but not BBW, just big in the right places).  My friend is shorter, more of a tomboy, but she doesn't make any sexy appearances in this story so it's a bit moot.  She tends to pick the best looking guy in the room, and then by the end of the night end up chatting with the oldest, or the saddest (she's a magnet for sad that girl, I think she likes to play the healer).  Me on the other hand, I like the smartest guy in the room.  The one who thinks he's the most clever.  I need banter, fun, a challenge to keep me interested.  But smart is not always easy to spot in a bar.  So I tend to go for the loudest.  The one cracking everyone up.  The life of the party.  That's how my eyes landed on Billy.

Billy was not the tallest on his team but his body...well I mean I've yet to meet a rugby player with a bad body...but this guy....yum.  Curly brown hair, bright eyes (I would say hazel?), buff arms, strong hands, those muscular rugby thighs you see on all the players (I never thought I'd be attracted to a guy's thighs but damn!)  Just scrumptious.  And he was loud and brazen with this infectious laugh.  Dimples when his face lit up (which was nearly always).  I wanted him and I wanted him bad.

They were playing this game with a ping pong ball.  Not beer pong, it was more subtle.  Whoever had the ball would try their best to slip it into someone's cup without them noticing.  If they got you, you had to finish your drink right there and then.  In retrospect, this was not the most sanitary game and perhaps not the wisest to invite something slipped into my drink, but it was an in.  We positioned ourselves on the edge of their group and just kept chatting up whomever was around or passed by, biding our time.  Eventually we ""caught"" a player from our targets' team and got the conversation going.  Our strategy was correct - once Billy saw one of his mates talking and laughing with two unattended girls, he came prowling.  In my mind I was just reeling him in.  

We introduced ourselves and asked about their travels, the tournament, etc.  At one point one of his mates got Billy with the ping pong ball and he pounded his beer, which was quickly replaced by another.  I was genuinely engrossed in conversation with him (loving that smile) when he paused, held my gaze and said simply, ""Drink.""  The fucking ping pong ball was in my beer.  I'd forgotten he had it but this was all coming together nicely.  I chugged my beer (not too unlady like, but fast enough to show I was down for some fun) and smiled.  My beer was also quickly replaced.

Now - I should also mention that obviously these guys had their agenda.  Bang silly drunk American girls, right?  I was under no delusion that they didn't travel the country getting girls drunk and hooking up with them.  But I was young, newly single, and but for making sure I didn't catch anything I really didn't give a damn.  I wanted to make out with a naughty rugby player with a sexy accent. Or better yet, do more if we hit it off.  I would end up doing much, much more.

But not that night.  Billy and I continued drinking, talking, flirting but he was surrounded by his team and my uncle was feet away. He's a cool uncle, he wouldn't tell on me, but he probably would snatch me away from a random guy or stop me from doing anything too public when I was drunk.  Billy invited us to come watch their game the next day and mentioned what bar they would be celebrating at the next night.  I played it nonchalant, didn't want to come off too ""groupie,"" said we'd try to make it. My friend and I headed home with my uncle and announced that we were staying for an extra night before heading to my summer spot.  We explained that I really wanted to have some quality time with my cousin the next day (which was true) but naturally, what was really motivating me was the thought of Billy's cock.  I'd decided I was going to see it, hopefully taste it, and make him mine if even just for a little while.

Parts II and III soon.

I am currently a psychology BS grad with a 3.6 major GPA, but a 3.1 overall GPA from a top 20 school. I have no experience in the field, but have a few volunteering and internships related to clinical psychology. 

Briefly looking through some of the current students' resumes at these schools, my current situation does not seem attractive, and I feel overwhelmed by these resumes. Current students seem to have prior internships within the field, or even years of job experience! It has been difficult to break into the field, and I have tried applying for internship positions related to design and HCI, but have been turned away or not even receiving a response. I believe this may be due to my major. 

So, other than studying to get a very competitive GRE score, what other things can I be doing to make my resume more competitive for these top HCI schools?? Any suggestions are welcome."

I was bored with my job, so I quit and decided to go to graduate school.  I am finding that boring but found a summer internship at a reputable, Fortune 500 company.  Was excited about doing that but after three weeks, I'm bored out of my mind.  I find most of my days trying to invent things to do since my manager is basically never at work since he's constantly traveling or whatever.

I'm bored with my girlfriend.  We moved in together six months ago and it has made the relationship harder.  She's fine and all but the spark and excitement is all but gone.  I've been with her for two years and find most of her antics tired and boring right now.  She tends to have a breakdown every other month, whether it be about work, her mom or her sister, and I just can't muster up the brain power to care or to do anything about it.  When I do, she just snaps at me because ""I just don't understand.""  Tedious.

I don't get much enjoyment out of hanging out with my friends or family.  I can only stand them for a little bit until the point where I just lose interest or can't find anything interesting to talk about.  

I don't find much enjoyment in my hobbies anymore that I used to.  Video games have lost almost all appeal.  I'm too lazy or tired to drag myself to the gym.  I just find myself drained and tired the second I wake up.

I think I'm depressed because of this boredom and I so actively want to find something stimulating to do but I'm so tired from all the efforts that I've put in over the past six months.  I'm just exhausted.  I dread most social interaction and don't find many things fun or interesting anymore.

TL;DR - I'm either depressed because I'm so bored OR I'm bored because I'm depressed."

392g14,1,2015-06-08,How to get the motivation?,itsTbod,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/392g14/how_to_get_the_motivation/,"Hi everyone,

I am a 20 year old male going into my senior year of college. I have been slightly over weight my whole life and not really happy with my body. I'm 5'4"" and my weight fluctuates from 165-175 pounds.

  I currently have an internship that usually has me working different hours each day (9AM - 6/7/8/9/10PM) and so its hard to get a steady workout schedule started. Usually I have a regular schedule, it becomes much easier for me to be consistent in working out- but this job makes it so difficult for me. Especially when it is lunch time and the only place to eat is a small, very unhealthy deli (which is located in an extremely small town were one of my offices are located).

My main question is how can I (or how do you) get the motivation to lose weight and stay on track? I've wanted to just stay dedicated for years (and have steadily worked out daily for 1-3 months at a time), but I always lose the motivation and go back to self loathing. I'm sure this question comes up a lot on here, but I've yet to find a solution and something that works for myself.

TL;DR: How can I get the motivation to work out and continue with it?"

Before entering college I was trying to find a career that pays good money but does not require graduate school. And quite honestly what attracted me to actuarial science was the exam process, believe it or not. I just liked the idea of passing exams to advance in my career. I personally like studying and passing exams. The third reason was the mix of different subjects that you would be learning. Like probability, mathematics, statistics, finance, economics, financial economics, and computer programming. So it seemed like the best career choice for me.

So far I had 2 actuarial internships (in the middle of the 2nd one now) and 1 exam passed (p) and I still have 2 years left to graduate. So far I do not regret it and I enjoyed studying for the first exam. 

To summarize why I like the career:

1- Good money without a degree beyond B.S.

2- Exam process

3- Learn a mix of different interesting subjects

So what is your reason?"
392q5y,1,2015-06-08,26M4F Unleash your inner slut; five prompts!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/392q5y/26m4f_unleash_your_inner_slut_five_prompts/,"I've had a LOT of fun with these prompts in the past, and I'm at it again. A bit about myself: Firstly, I'm a writer by trade and I pride myself on quick, detailed messages (a few paragraphs, and generally I can play out each scenario in anywhere from a few hours to a few days). Physically, I'm 6'3"", brown hair, brown eyes, average build, and addictions to both receiving dirty orange envelopes and making women have earth-shattering orgasms while RP'ing!

As advertised, I've got five prompts here, and I'd really love to act some of them out. Kinks/dislikes at the bottom of the page.

---

1) You're an intern at the office I work at. You've caught my eye before, as a young college/university student (18-21) with huge breasts, a great ass, and a slim body that looks like it's built for sex. However, we've never had much of a relationship, outside of a few stray chats around the office.

I'm not a manager, just a mid-level employee, so lately, I've picked up a side job editing some videos for a few clients to pick up some extra cash. One was pretty shady but offered good money, so I took it. It turned out this guy is acting as a manager for a chain of strip clubs and had videotaped auditions of girls dancing on poles and the laps of ""customers"" to show the president. This has gotten pretty hot, and winds up being more enjoyable than my full-time job...when all of a sudden, I realize one of the girls working the pole.

Her big, possibly-fake breasts are barely contained by her bikini top, and her ass swallows a G-string as she grinds and gyrates around the stage. A few minutes later, her ass and tits are bouncing on top of a man in a chair, one whose erection makes his pants pop up like a tent.

The girl...is you.

I wait until after work the next day to say something to you, all the while feeling REALLY turned on all day long every time you walk by my desk (knowing what's under your clothes). Finally, it's 5:30, and everyone else has gone home for the day. There are no security cameras here, it's just you and me.

""Hey,"" I say, with a tinge of nervousness. ""Can I see you in my office?""

---

2) You're at a wild party or club. Take your pick: Pool party, nightclub, strip club, etc. Wherever you are, you're wearing that one outfit in the back of your closet. You know, the outfit that does a great job of covering up very little. Maybe you're a horny college co-ed on spring break, or part of a bachelorette party, a cougar looking for a young guy, or, if you want to get really raunchy, a stripper/hooker who just wants cock.

Regardless, you see me. I'm easy to spot: I'm tall (6'3""), with blonde hair, brown eyes, and a VERY big erection in my pants. I'm in the VIP area, with plenty of booze to go around. Come see me, have a drink (or seven), and let's get filthy.

---

3) I'm at the gym and can't concentrate. You're on the bike in front of me, wearing yoga pants with ""JUICY"" on the back and bending over to accentuate those gorgeous curves. You know guys come here solely to look at you riding a bike, wishing you were riding THEM.

I'm one of them. I was thinking about quitting the gym until you showed up. I'm single and mortal, so I kept coming at the same time every day just to see you work on your perfect body.

Finally, after what seems like an eternity, I work up the courage to say hi. I wait until you're done (out of courtesy, of course!), and I walk up to you with what seems like the whole world watching.

""Hi, I'm Tom,"" I say, somehow managing a full sentence. ""Seen you around a lot. You new to the area?""

---

4) Any scene where one of us (you or me) is just moving into a new place. We can work out any number of reasons for it: One of us has a new job, just broke up with a BF/GF, going to college, etc. Either way, the scene would start out with one of us discovering the new neighbor, and hopefully end with lots and lots of cum. ;)

I'm open to any sort of scenario based on this premise, and as such, I'm open to a lot of different age groups. If you're moving in, maybe you're a college student living on her own for the first time (or living with roommates if you're open to playing multiple parts!). Maybe you're a post-grad who's just found a job. Maybe you're the neighborhood MILF or a lonely wife who's desperate for companionship. I'm also willing to play different age groups as well, if that's something you're into (I can also do a few characters at once as well, if you're seeking THAT kind of action!).

---

5) Anything else you'd like to do that fits into my kinks; get creative!

---

Kinks: Big breasts/titfucking, dirty talk (an absolute must), bad girls (partying, drinking, and smoking are all encouraged; we can work harder stuff into the mix if you'd like), oral sex (giving and receiving), bimbos (more the bimbo LOOK than the ""dumb as a box of rocks"" behavior), group sex, mild ageplay if it fits the story.

Dislikes: Animals, blood/gore, bathroom stuff, heavy BDSM.

Hope to hear from you!"
392ui2,6,2015-06-08,This Wednesday I'm gonna tackle something that I've been putting off for a long time. It could affect the last two years of my college experience.,niceloner10463484,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/392ui2/this_wednesday_im_gonna_tackle_something_that_ive/,"I'm gonna ask for my car back. I got this car during my senior year of high school when I got very good marks on my SAT and ACT. I was supposed to get it back sophomore year, except a fender bender ruined that prospect. My parents, out of overprotectiveness and just not knowing how trivial a mistake like this is (they're Chinese immigrants who grew up poor) overreacted and said no car indefinitely. And in my college town, which is one of those driving towns (little transport, spread out, bipolar weather) not having one takes a HUGE toll on your daily life and independence. On top of everything else including engineering school, anxiety and depression, social anxiety, lack of close friends, etc this whole incident and it's ramifications have driven my emotions through the roof time and time again. Now, I am hoping that they have changed their minds, and have learned to trust me again. I am in a very peaceful state emotionally right now with the help of therapy all of last school year. This year I am starting my core major classes, really upping the search for internships, and I am also starting a job and summer school session 2 when I go back in a few weeks. I hope this situation works out for the best so I can have a great head start on it all, and if it doesn't I hope I don't fall apart again emotionally or sink back into the depression I overcame a few months ago. I know some of you may think that this whole thing is really silly or that I'm incredibly spoiled for feeling all this about some stupid car, and I would understand why. But I can only hope others will wish me luck :)"

3938cl,0,2015-06-08,I'm [30/f] and my best friend [42/f] is a narcissist and I'm a codependent in hell! Helpful advice please!,rgreene2043,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3938cl/im_30f_and_my_best_friend_42f_is_a_narcissist_and/,"I met my friend 3 years ago and it felt like an instant deep connection.  We did everything together and we were often mistaken for a couple.  It felt like we were a couple.  She ""hooked"" me instantly because she was/is charming, has an outgoing personality, always captures everyone's attention when she walks in the room, very articulate, all the guys are interested in her.  I admired her right away and always considered myself so ""lucky"" that she was my friend.  Once the ""honeymoon"" period of our friendship ended I began noticing her real personality.  I actually thought this meant we were getting closer in our relationship and she was letting her guard down.  I began to notice she ONLY talked about herself, never asked me personal questions, had a way to turn the conversation back to herself, ALWAYS looked in mirrors or windows when walking down the street, and also had a really short temper and would explode into rage (I actually never saw this happen but she told me stories about it).  On several occasions we were out for drinks with a group of friends and if she didn't have center attention she would make a scene and storm off and usually leave.  One time she was so pissed she decided to walk home.  I soon learned that to make her happy the group needed to let her talk most of the time.  Thinking back about it now I feel like a fool because I would often whisper to people in our group and plead for them to just let her talk so she wouldn't flip out.  I always felt (and still do) responsible for her outbursts and for her being upset about things.  Another time I remember the two of us were eating dinner at a restaurant and behind me was a panel of glass.  She literally talked to herself the entire night.  She wasn't making eye contact with me, rather looking past me to talk to her reflection.  Something that should've been a red flag right away is that none of my other friends liked her...or they could only handle her in small doses.  I often told myself, ""Oh, they just don't understand her like I do.""  Now that I think about it, I think they saw something I never did.  I would still like to know what they saw that I didn't.  

She has recently moved to a new city and I don't see her near as much as I did before but we text everyday.  I decided to visit her for a week shortly after she moved and that was the first time we spent that much time together (we went to China together for 10 days and stayed in the same room but the ""thrill"" of vacation made it a different experience).  It was also my first chance to see her in her own ""space"" and in her own routine.  On my way to her house I took the train.  On the way there the train CRASHED....I'm not joking.  It crashed and was on the national news.  When I finally arrived to her house she not once said ""I'm so glad you weren't hurt,"" ""I'm glad you made it,"" ""Tell me what happened.""  Instead I had to listen (for two hours) about how her neighbor made her angry right before I arrived.  I sat there dumbfounded.  How could someone NOT ask about a damn train wreck?!  That turned out to be a week from hell.  She and I butted heads a few times and by the end of the week I was ready to go.  It was also that trip that I finally started speaking my mind and calling her out on things she did to piss me off.  I think things got worse when I did this and let her know I had enough of the way she would treat me.

She often jokes that she knows she is a narcissist (I don't know if this is a common thing they do but I found it weird.  If you know you are one why not change??  It's not a good thing!) and she practically brags about it.  I don't think she would be officially diagnosed but she definitely has MANY characteristics.  A few other things about her: she's 42 and has never been married and her longest relationship lasted 3 years, she keeps her exes close by because she constantly needs sex, she told me she has slept with over 50 men, she trash talks about most all of her other friends to me (this makes me think she talks trash about me too to someone else), we've never had a conversation about anything related to her emotions (we've talked about mine).  The last thing that bothers me is that she is currently sleeping with her ex and she knows I completely disapprove (bc of all the trash she told me about him earlier). She tells everyone else but won't tell me.  I've called her out on this because she tells me EVERYTHING else about her life...EVERYTHING.  She said she doesn't tell me because she cares about me as much as she cares about her mom.  That response didn't make any sense to me and it only pissed me off.

So enough about her...here's what's wrong with me in this friendship.  I have realized I am addicted to her.  I have severe panic attacks when she does something to upset me and if I we don't text for a while I feel the panic starting.  For example, yesterday and most of today I've felt anxiety and panic because she didn't text me at all yesterday until I texted her that night and she gave me a one word response.  I've become so dependent on our texting chats that it interrupts my daily life if I don't hear from her.  I don't think she knows she has this power over me.  I've never told her and I never will.  I'm mostly angry at myself for so many things with this relationship.  I'm mad I let her have this much control over me (she's the first person I've felt like this for), mad that I now resort to self harm (cutting) when my emotions get the best of me after something that happened between us (she knows I've cut but she doesn't know she had anything to do with it), I'm mad that I completely change my personality when I'm with her (I let her lead and have all the attention and I sit back quiet and it feels very obvious that I am the inferior one), I'm mad that I was happy (happier than I am now at least) before I met her.  I thought for the longest time I was so damn lucky to have her as a friend because I had so much fun with her before she moved away.  I hate that I feel responsible for her emotions and outbursts and I hate that I am constantly living my life with her in mind.  The bad part about all of this is that I don't know how to change anything.  I've developed a fear of abandonment that she'll forget about me, not want to be my friend, etc...  I've never cared this much about someone leaving me.  I've also developed this crappy habit where when I am lonely I get panic attacks.  I constantly wonder what she is doing and why she is not texting me (for the record, we typically text throughout the day with at least 150 exchanges...it's constant).  I'm embarrassed my life has begun to revolve around her but I don't know how to make it stop.  Finally, I am in her city this summer doing an internship.  I thought it would be great because I could see her often but so far it's off to a rocky start.  We went out for drinks over the weekend and she got so mad when guys started talking to me and not her.  It is on her body language, she stopped talking to me, and she got pissed off at me because she wasn't receiving the attention.

I could go on but I will stop.  Please provide helpful advice...sarcasm and joking won't help me or do any good. Thanks!    "
3939om,1,2015-06-08,Me (23f) with my close friend (23f) and the same man (28m),almostloversnh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3939om/me_23f_with_my_close_friend_23f_and_the_same_man/,"I'll try to keep this short and I'm on my phone so forgive typos please.

Sarah(23), Ryan (28), and I (23) all went to college together. Ryan was a grad student in our department. Sarah and I became very close during school. Sarah and Ryan only hung out when I brought Sarah to various parties and events etc.

From the first time I met Ryan I was pretty into him. We had this weird unspoken (so I felt) thing going on between us that just never worked out timing wise... We went on a date but then I had to leave for a semester abroad, I get home and he's seeing someone, that ends and we hang out once but then he has to go off for an internship, that sort of thing. Goes on for two years and this whole time I'm carrying a sort of torch for him for some reason; albeit a muted one, as our lives take us in and out of other relationships, states, and countries. Sarah knows all about this and was already my friend during the times Ryan and I did go on dates. 

About a year ago I moved away for work after school. Since then Sarah and I have talked every couple weeks and texted weekly and Ryan and I less frequently, every two months or so we will talk on the phone for a couple hours. 

So I'm headed home in two weeks and am really excited to see them both, Ryan and I had a really great long talk about a week ago and I told him I would be in town and we made plans to see each other that night, get our old group together and all go out. Secretly I'm hoping this leads to alone time with Ryan of course and given our last interaction in person (long talk in my car too 3 am and a goodnight kiss, although it WAS a year ago) I'm hoping he is hoping for the same. 

Sarah calls me today and tells me she and Ryan have been seeing each other. She was extremely nervous to tell me, I could tell, and kept asking if it was okay. I'm not exactly sure why but  I was really disappointed and also felt hurt that she didn't tell me right when she started developing feelings for him as it's been going on a few weeks and we have talked since then; plus she obviously knew it would upset me. I care about them both as friends a lot and I have no right to be upset as I don't even live there and Ryan and I never actually ""dated"" (never even had sex) but now I don't really want to go hang out with them both. I think it will be hard to act normal, plus it will be hard for me to not act a certain way in front of Ryan, you know, the way you act slightly different when you're around someone you like? Like my interaction with him will not be platonic in its motivations. Ever. And I don't think that's fair to my friendship with Sarah.

I don't really know what to do or how to communicate my feelings to her because I don't want her to feel bad. But I am upset. She still wants to hang out my night in town and says we don't have to see anyone else but I feel like... I don't know. I don't really want to be friends if they begin dating seriously and that  sucks because  she's one of my BEST friends. 

Does anyone have any insight or input? I'm pretty bummed out and I don't know what the ""right"" thing to do is. If I see Ryan I will 100% secretly be wanting him to like me. I don't know if by default that means I should avoid him. Sarah is my priority. 

**tl;dr** had a crush on a guy for a few years, moved away, best friend starts dating him and tells me two weeks before I have plans to visit them both 

Edit I want to add that Ryan is innocent in all of this, since I moved away all our conversations have been completely platonic and we have discussed our love lives with one another ( he didn't mention Sarah, but she did say it was very recent) "

393k6m,3,2015-06-08,Me [25/F] with my friends [20'sF]. The bachelorette from Hell.,Ohwhoaeskimo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/393k6m/me_25f_with_my_friends_20sf_the_bachelorette_from/,"Okay, so I'm feeling a lot of emotions right now, but I'm going to try to keep this as to-the-point as possible.

One of my very good friends, L, is getting married this summer to the best guy ever.  They're a great match and I'm over the moon for her.  She could only have a small bridal party and I wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid.  Initially, I was really sad about this, but never told the bride because hey-planning a wedding is enough stress.  She later asked me to be a part of her ""house party"" which in the South, is being in the bridal party but not a bridesmaid.  I'm thrilled to be a part of her special day and instead of sulking about not being a bridesmaid, have tried to be as helpful and supportive as possible.


Because I live in a beach town and work in hospitality, I took on the responsibility of the bachelorette.  It's the first time our group will be together in over a year, so everyone has been looking forward to it.  We budgeted for a specific number of girls, I offered a few options, and we picked an option that would fit everyone's budget.  The bachelorette is this coming weekend.


About two months ago, it became a question whether the bride's sister and Maid of Honor, K, would be able to come.  K is still in school and just got her dream internship.  About a month ago, we figured out that it just wouldn't work out for K to come.  We tried to invite someone else to keep the budget the same, but it didn't work out so the price for everyone went up about $40.


Today, I went to invoice everyone for this trip, since I am paying for it with my card and really didn't want to front $2,000 and wait for everyone to pay me back.  It then came to light that one girl, N, said she actually was going to be a day late and didn't want to pay the whole amount because she wouldn't be using the room last night.  This would have raised everyone else's costs even higher.  The bride offered to pay for her share of the room the night she wouldn't be there.  


I obviously didn't think the bride should be paying to keep everyone happy and told N that to please remember that everyone does have really tight budgets.  She basically responded that she was broke and we could pick up the slack because we have ""real jobs"" and she was completely broke. (She just graduated from grad school and started a well-paying full time job that she said would approve her to be there the full trip.)  Then she said she was pulling out of the trip completely because she was so broke.  She even mentioned that she didn't own a black dress for the night we were going out and would have to wear a swimsuit coverup if she went.


Normally I'd be sympathetic, but N has taken overnight trips the past few months, adopted a pure bred puppy, and generally done some pretty expensive things.  She's always been flakey about money since I've known her and it's pretty clear that she just didn't budget.  She offered to pay a portion of her share of the trip (because that's all she has) so everyone wouldn't be screwed over money-wise.  I'm just so mad at her and don't know what she was expecting.  Did she think everyone else would be paying her gas, food and drink bills?  Why did she wait until the last minute?  If we knew from the beginning we would have planned something different but she approved of this trip and budget months ago.  I haven't said much to her because I don't want to completely ruin our friendship or make things awkward for all the wedding events that we'll be in together that are coming up.  

The bride is understandably, very upset.  She even offered to pay money for N's expenses if she didn't go.  However, like me, she is also extremely angry and doesn't know if she'll be able to trust again.


I don't know if I should accept payment from N that she isn't even coming.  She wouldn't be able to pay me until after the trip (even though she said she had money saved for the original cost.).  Since she isn't going, should I accept it to alleviate the cost increase to the rest of the group?  Am I a total bitch for not being sympathetic?  How can I best support the bride during this?  I just need insight from a different group of people please, anything is welcome.


**tl;dr**: A girl on our upcoming bachelorette was flakey and bailed and I don't know whether to accept money from her to offset the cost of everything else."
393kur,6,2015-06-08,Me [21 M] getting sick of flatmate [20 M],Britito,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/393kur/me_21_m_getting_sick_of_flatmate_20_m/,"Ok, a bit of background first.

I'm a student in the UK, just finishing my 2nd year now. During my 1st year, I became close friends with two other students, lets call them Chris and Nick, living in accommodation close to mine. Now then, during the 1st year, Nick would break down, a lot. It would be 1 in the morning, I'd be climbing into bed, and I and Chris would get a suicidal text of some kind from Nick, usually resulting in a quick meetup and walk around a quiet portion of the town to see what was wrong. Other times we'd be walking down from Uni to our accommodation blocks and Nick would start talking about how he messes everything up and can't keep going.

Other times it would get rather more personal. Nick tends to get very emotional very easily, especially after drinking. He'd often claim that because I exist, he shouldn't because I do everything better, apparently. He'd say that I was the bane of his existence or that my tendency to be positive was the thing wrong about the world. We notified the university about this, and after a couple of incidents in his flat he was sent to meetings with a therapist, and was pronounced perfectly normal, somehow.

But, and here's the odder it, when he wasn't in the midst of a breakdown, he was normal. We'd play Civ 5 together, joke about things, go on nights out, help each other with schoolwork. There's be absolutely no indication that he despised me as much as he would occasionally claim.

In 2nd year we lived in the same student house, with Chris and a few others. While the breakdowns had mostly stopped, they'd happen when work got tough and he'd been drinking. He'd slump against my door because Chris had closed and locked his and talk about how pathetic his life was and how he had no friends. We'd at least try to dispute this, point out that he did actually have friends, but he'd usually change the subject. 

Fast-forward to now. I'm packing to go home, but spend most of the night eating and talking with friends, Nick included. After the others had gone home/to bed, a slightly drunk Nick started talking, quite viciously, about why he apparently hates me so. Below are reasons he gave, worded in how he gave them:

I come across as emotionless because I have never broken down or lost my temper in front of him.
That I'm afraid of people because he's never seen me break down or lose my temper.
I feel and act positively about life and things, as opposed to (as he was explaining) thinking about how much war and destruction is going on.
I try to solve problems before they arise, like applying to internships early.
I, using money saved from a part-time job, went on a backpacking trip around Europe, that he ""just couldn't do"".
I only really talk to people about my problems when I believe they can help solve them, rather than wanting to let people hear my problems just to vent. (I explained that I prefer not to put undue stress on people by telling them problems they have no ability to fix nor help with, and was once again met with accusations of being emotionless).
I ""act in a logical manner"".

There were other things, but explaining them would take more time than 1:20am requires. Honestly, for most of his complaints I see nothing wrong at all, except for simple personality clash that shouldn't be this drastic.

Bother of us are going on our industrial placements soon, and are unlikely to see each other for a while. Nonetheless, while I'm fairly sure the problem lies with him, considering he's like this with other people as well, and I've never had people react in even a vaguely similar way before, I'd like to see what people have to say, and maybe see what I can do to help. I can't really tell you what I act like in everyday life, but I don't think I act emotionless. I laugh, I smile, I get sad, I occasionally cry, I hug cats at 5am. Whenever I become angry or sad I tend to isolate myself to prevent lashing out at people, so I rarely display anger to others. 
He has often talked about a rough childhood, parents splitting up early, a mum who went through 12 men growing up, each of whom he was told to treat like a new father, and who may be near sociopathic anyway..

Tl;dr

Friend who may/may not have been suicidal claims I'm an emotionless robot that is the antithesis to his being, I don't think I am. Has done this to other people. Referred to a therapist, was pronounced normal. "

I'm in Nashville for the summer for a research internship, and I was wondering where people have caught catfish around here.

I'm limited to shore fishing, and I've tried a handful of places, without a bite yet! 

If you could include which area, if you're going to mention bigger lakes, that would be helpful! I tried a spot each at Percy Priest and Old Hickory, but both were lousy shore fishing spots for catfish."

39414p,1,2015-06-08,"19 with a year of corporate Web-Design under belt, sudden promotion to Web Manager -- deserving of being put on salary?",mytren,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39414p/19_with_a_year_of_corporate_webdesign_under_belt/,"Hey thanks for taking a look at my post! 

To start off, I'm 19, and have been working at a multi-million dollar corporate that specializes in a medical manufacturing field. When I started, I was hired as an intern for Data Entry, however after a couple months I was put on a project to create an E-Commerce website with a Sr. Web Dev. I was given a raise to $13 an hour at this point.

Fast foward 8 months, and now our Sr. Dev is leaving, leaving me the only one with the knowledge and skill set as he does. I'm a full-time student (willing to change for evening courses) and also work full time at this company. 

Now that he's leaving, I'm curious if anyone with more corporate experience has a clue as to what could happen next.

My assumption is they bring in another Sr. dev and place him above me -- but I have expectations to leave/find another job if this occurs; leaving the company in a not so optimal position.. but I mean hey, what's best for me is most important to me.

The other possibility is the company decides to make me the new Web manager, coming with new roles and responsibilities that I didn't have before. This would come at a sacrifice to my education (graduating later than anticipated) thus in my opinion requiring sufficient compensation. A salary would suffice for me, however I know that's pretty far fetched of me to want. 

Thanks for reading, and if anyone has any advice as to what course of action I may take, or if they've been in a similar position?

PS: I know I'm very fortunate to be in the position I'm in. My major is Computer Science and this company has given me a great step forward in advancing my career. If anything, I'd like to remain here."

394jxu,20,2015-06-09,More stories from Boyfriend #2,[deleted],hotpast,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotpast/comments/394jxu/more_stories_from_boyfriend_2/,"I knew that my wife hired a professional photographer and did a ""naughty"" photo-shoot for ex-boyfriend #2.  She told me about it but doesn't know that I found them on her computer a while back.  When we went out this weekend (and got a bit tipsy), we talked about our random past experiences and I asked her if she's ever been naked in front of a stranger.  I assumed she was going to bring up the photographer because I wanted to hear more about that, but instead she told me that she was naked in front of strangers (plural!) twice (more plural!), and neither involved that photographer I knew about!

My wife and I went to the same college, she met Boyfriend #2 at a summer internship but he was at a different college.  They decided do the long distance thing and visited each other's campuses often.  During one of his visits, a campus bar had a foxy boxing/oil wrestling contest, it's mostly visited by freshman (18 to enter but 21 to drink).  To get more girls to enter the contest, the girl and the guy that brought her in got to drink free the entire night.  Boyfriend #2 had never been there and wanted to drink free that night.  She agreed to go, strip to her underwear, and wrestle while a random guy poured oil on her.  I couldn't believe it when she told me since I've heard stories about how crazy the girls get.  One of the unwritten rules was that to win, you had to rip all the clothes off your opponent and the winner gets an extra shot.  I couldn't believe she did it because she was a senior at that point and was also a teaching assistant for two periods of physics.  I just imagine some lucky an underclassmen being taught by her, going to a bar, and got to see my wife covered naked (and covered in oil) before I did just because she wanted her boyfriend at the time to have free drinks for a night.  

The second time was for his graduation and she visited him.  Him and his friends celebrated by playing poker.  These were pretty high stakes apparently, like $200 to buy in.  Anyway, at the end, they were all pretty drunk and started betting non-cash items because one of the guys was really good and they didn't want to stop playing.  Someone wagered their car even.  Well boyfriend #2 had a really good hand and nothing to bet with. So he said he'll streak the campus if he loses.  That offer was turned down because no one wanted to see him naked, but would take him up on his bet if my wife did the streaking.  Of course, she said no.  But after a lot of prodding from her boyfriend (claiming he couldn't lose), encouragement from the two girls that were there, and her negotiating the terms... the bet was that she would be a ""runway model"" and would wear 5 outfits that the girls picked out to model for everyone in the room.  As you might have guessed, the boyfriend lost and she had to do the runway walk.  There was two caveats that she didn't realize.  One of the guys was in a frat and had a bunch of his frat brothers stop by for the show.  The other was that one of the that girls lived there was a theater major and she had a large wardrobe.  She doesn't remember all 5 outfits she wore but the first one was a sexy Halloween maid custom.  It wasn't too revealing and the guys got rowdy and asked the girls to pick out more slutty clothes.  The next one was her in her thong underwear and a red body stocking.  By the last outfit, she wore elbow long gloves, knee high socks, a choker necklace, high heels, and a large hat... nothing else!  When I asked if she felt uncomfortable, she told me that she liked it after a while because if felt empowering, so much so that she ""wore"" the last outfit for a couple hours until they decided to leave.  I couldn't really relate to the empowering part but it's crazy hot that she was just lounging around naked for everyone because her boyfriend lost a bet.  

P.S. She said she's going to recreate the last outfit for me one of these days!"
394nmf,2,2015-06-09,She is playing with my head and testing my intelligence and its really fucking bothering me,Burnaccount101,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/394nmf/she_is_playing_with_my_head_and_testing_my/,"Started talking (hate this phrase, early parts of relationship i guess where people get to know each other before they begin actually dating.)  for those who question what ""talking"" is.

Okay, back to the point.  Talked for 5 months, found out she was still with her ex (kinda), after we had talked about being together.  She left for an internship (out of state.) I stopped talking to her about a week and a half ago.  Got a text sunday saying she missed me and wanted to talk to me.  

So me being me, I respond.  We chat she asks why I did not talk to her, I tell her shee has a bf, and that she drunk called me while away on her internship and told me she was going to go back to her boyfriend and for me to not wait for her.  She tells me when she drinks she does not know what she is saying.  But I am a firm believer in drunk words= sober thoughts.   She tells me she likes mee and wants to be with me.

Now my second issue.  Checked her bfs twitter today, and a week ago (when we stopped talking and she stopped texting me, and deleted me from snapchat.)  Was a tweet that read he was leaving for her location from his hometown.  Which means too me that we did not communicate because he was down by her internship and i was deleted from snapchat because she wanted to hide me from him.  She has told me SO MANY TIMES they were broken up.
She also told me she deactivated her snapchat because of some bullshit, but I am speculate that she deleted me because she did not want her bf to see us snapping or something.

I feel like I got played for a fool and we have been texting the last 2 days because she told me she was single.  I know this post is all over the fucking place, but I hope someone can understand where I am coming from.

 I was happy with no contact with her.....  I was moving on, then she tels me she wants to be with me then I see her ""bf's"" twitter that he was visiting her a week ago (the week we didnt talk.)  I am just dumbfounded that I can be so fucking stupid....

Sorry for the long post reddit...  Really just needed this one off my chest.

Thanks guys

Edit:  Sorry for grammar, just mad as fuck with myself right now for being a complete fool, and wanted to type this out as fast as possible and try too not make it a snooze fest of a story.

TL;DR-  Girl told me she wants to be with me, has bf, says they broke up, bf visits her a few states away a week ago, feeling kinda dumb"

394whu,3,2015-06-09,"I'm pretty happy where I am right now, but I feel like people look down on me if I try to express it (warning this is super long and meandering)",missfishersmurder,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/394whu/im_pretty_happy_where_i_am_right_now_but_i_feel/,"I've always been ambitious. I wouldn't call myself cutthroat or ruthless, but there's been very little in my life that I wanted that I haven't been able to get through sheer willpower, hard work, and luck. I would consider myself selectively competitive; I don't feel the need to be the best at everything, but when I take an interest in something, I have no interest in coming in second or lower. My parents sent me to an incredibly expensive private high school and I took out some loans and got some scholarships to continue at a private college. All of my friends are in white collar jobs and have little to no experience working for minimum wage; many of them are in finance, law, securities, or...other industries that I don't really understand.

Anyway, I dropped out of college in my last year due to mental health issues. I ended up hospitalized for a little while, but since I was legally an adult and didn't seem too unstable, I was put back in school, which was a huge mistake because I was in fact extremely unstable and I self-destructed big time--hence the dropping out. Since then I've moved states and have been working as a dog walker for the past two years.

And frankly, I'm really happy with this job. I love animals; if I could tell my younger self one thing, it's that there's more to me as a person than a desire to write novels or draw comics. Also, starving is not fun. The hours are flexible, my boss is accommodating, my fellow walkers are really sweet people. A lot of clients are pretty nice. And honestly, I'm getting paid to run around all day with dogs and take them to the park and take pictures of them looking cute and happy.

But the job doesn't pay that much, it doesn't come with health insurance, it's physically demanding, and the hours can be long and unpredictable. I don't get sick days unless I'm dying, and I've definitely gone to work running a fever or had to pull over to throw up into a trashcan. Vacations are basically something that have to be requested and are not guaranteed.

And, let's face it, my parents invested so much money and time into my education; in addition to putting me in private schools since birth, there have been private tutoring sessions and summer classes and nepotism internships. They're both really disappointed that I've been working as a dog walker for so long; I haven't talked with my dad since I started, and my mom lies to her friends about what it is I'm doing. I've technically applied to go back to school in the fall, but I haven't sent the transcripts in, and they're several months late at this point and I frankly don't want to. School was hands down one of the worst experiences of my life, I'm terrified that re-entering that competitive and achievement-focused mindset will just result in me self-destructing in a more permanent fashion.

Idk, I'm really happy where I am right now. It feels like my life has been really fast-paced and I'm finally able to catch my breath. I don't think I'd be able to work in an office environment at all, actually; interacting with people makes me tired and cranky and unproductive, and after a certain point physical stuff starts kicking in because I take such shoddy care of myself when I'm depressed. But I can't talk to any of my friends about this--it feels like all of them are waiting on me to shake off this stage of my life and join them in the six figure salary zone. Saying that I would be happy to run around as a dog walker for the rest of my life feels taboo.

The attitude is pretty pervasive. Clients have asked me what I ""really"" do...and yes, technically, I am a freelance writer and I do partially support myself that way, and I'm more than glad to talk about that. But I don't know why I can't just say that I'm a dog walker because I like dogs and I want to work with them.

Why is it so wrong to say that this job makes me happy? It doesn't come with fancy perks, it doesn't sound that impressive when you talk about it, but it's the first job I've had that I've genuinely enjoyed and wanted to do well. I'm not even sure why I feel so upset about this.

**tl;dr**: whine whine i love my job but it's a shitty service job and ~~everyone in my life is condescending about it.~~ internalized classism sucks."
39572c,4,2015-06-09,Sales job offer advice requested.,sugawaterpurple,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/39572c/sales_job_offer_advice_requested/,"I have an offer and I would like some input. The position would start at the end of July. It's for a 5 years old company in San Francisco, CA with maybe $30mil in revenue and has millions in funding. (end stages of startup) It has very big growth and also doubled its size and revenue year after year. You may have heard of the company.    
  
I need help deciding... I've been up late for the past couple days trying to make an important decision. Experience salespeople in software, tech, saas, startup, etc. etc. who want to give me advice, itll be appreciated.  
  
  
I'm a new graduate with some sales part-time, retail and corporate sales internships as well as other work. My degree is in Business. While I have done every sales related job function like flyering, cold calling, etc. this will be my first full time commission based job. I'm fairly confident I will do ok ESP since they are incoming leads, I have done well in the past but I have doubts for things out of my control related to the company itself.
  
For this particular startup of 5 years.. what are some potential redflags/downsides (mainly related to risk)? What are the chances that I'll be out of a job in 3 years? or that sales will experience major shifts and growing pains and it'll be very hard to make the quotas? bad management? Other risk associated with a younger company i'm not thinking of?  
 
  
Currently their base salary is $32,000 and commission is at 10%. $10000 is their minimum quota and if you hit $20,000 twice consecutively, you get promoted. The promotion moves you out of SMB into middle market. It raises your base to $45k and the OTE they give is $100k. Your commission goes up as well as the min quota but I don't know the numbers.  
From there if you hit $25,000 6 times in the year, you get promoted into their corporate consultant position. OTE is $150k and I'm guessing base is around $70k.  
If you manage to hit more goals, then their last level is enterprise sales where the OTE is $315k.  
  
A few concerns:  
- job stability and risk. there is tremendous growth but unsure how long it'll last. 
- Is there a possibility of the company exaggerating the OTE? possibly at the higher promotions. They dont have ANY current sales staff at the enterprise level, so it kind of makes me think they put it there to motivate everyone but in reality it'll be next to impossible to get there. But they are a young company. 
Out of 65 sales people, they have 4 at the corporate consultant level and they are outside sales people. So it's doable but not easy at all.  
- stress of losing job or making little money once the golden years runs out?  
- The company's main business model is to target the SMB market. Their software allows small businesses leverage to compete with the bigger corporations. This makes me hesitant to believe that there is true opportunity at the Mid market or corporate level. If their business plan is to corner the SMB market, then they must think that the corporate or bigger fishes are not viable, or have strong competitors right? Is the pay/promotion structure just a motivational scheme?  
  
Opportunity cost - I have a job offer to work in accounting audit making $65k a year. It has stability, a proven promotion schedule that will ultimately lead to $100k+ if you put your years in. It's boring, it's long hours, it's full of travel, it's not as fun, I dont enjoy it as much as sales. But it's a damn good secure spot so if this job with the startup sounds like something too good to be true, I'll take the safe route and kiss sales goodbye. I also may be able to go from audit back to sales, but next to impossible to go from the sales opp back into public accounting for my situation.  

What are your thoughts?"

Could I ask for more advice?,thisisbutamask,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/395dk6/nsis_is_still_going_nowhere_but_im_on_my_road_to/,"Hello, you may have seen my post nearly a year ago. I just want to thank everyone for their support and words of wisdom. I really couldn't have come to this point without it!

Here's an update: after some more observation and conversation, I think my sister either has some heavy FLEAS or is a full blown N herself. Her eating disorder hasn't improved, and neither has her neurotic personality. It's unfortunate I can't help her but it's out of my hands. And that's lifted a great weight in my heart. Being in college and away from my family also helped.

That being said, I've got some FLEAS myself. I find it hard to take criticism, I mortify myself with social blunders of any kind, minor or major, and I still have outbursts of unreasonable anger. But I can finally take phone calls and I'm much more comfortable being out in public. I've become more adventurous and outgoing, even causing people to believe I'm some sort of extroverted fun person! Can you believe that?

But that seems to fall apart in anything vaguely 'adult'. I've been looking for internships and volunteering opportunities but I freeze up whenever I'm handed responsibility. I also panic at handling my own finances after being dependent on my parents to take care of anything. I can just hear my NMother saying, ""Can't you do anything right? This is why you shouldn't do things by yourself. Why didn't you just take the job dad offered?"" Ugh! Get out of my head!

This whole thing upsets me greatly. I thought I made great strides in improving myself and getting ""detoxed"" but I'm so afraid of failure and messing up. What if she was right? What if I'm doomed to be irresponsible and terrible at everything?

What do you all do to get rid of this heart-stopping anxiety? Or stop the hurtful comments swimming in your head?"

3967rg,2,2015-06-09,Me (27M) with my girlfriend (26F) of almost 6 months; giving each other space this week to figure things out by not talking,fartnoisesthrowaway3,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3967rg/me_27m_with_my_girlfriend_26f_of_almost_6_months/,"Long story short: my girlfriend and I are giving each other space this week by not talking Monday through Friday in order to “figure things out.”  It’s a short term plan for an issue that just recently popped up.


Some background: We’ve been dating for almost 6 months, and things have been perfect.  There’s so much I like about her and the relationship, however the past few weeks have been tough for several reasons.  We are both under extreme amounts of pressure, which in turn has applied pressure to the relationship.  She has been incredibly busy and stressed out with work, family visiting from out of town, personal illness, and traveling.  I have been incredibly busy with moving to a different city for the summer, starting an internship, moving into a new apartment back home, traveling a lot for work, and dealing with family illnesses.  During all of this, I didn’t expect for things to be the same for when we were starting out, but I did expect to feel like a boyfriend – right now I feel like an accessory.  She is a naturally introverted person, and with so much going on, she has been seeking her own personal space and in turn has started to push me away, which is what has made things tough and not seem normal.  She has difficulties dealing with stress, and her solution is to just be by herself and sometimes cut off contact with others.


Speculation: She mentioned that she is so used to being by herself that she is having a hard time figuring out how to satisfy another person in a relationship.  Could it be that since she had been single for so long, she is starting to fall for me and it is scaring her and in turn she is pushing me away?  What hurts the most is that she said I did nothing wrong in order to push her away – I in fact had been pumping the brakes on the relationship a little bit in order to give her the space she needed.  It also hurts because I myself have been so used to being single – I hadn’t been in a relationship for 5 years before meeting her.  I took a leap of faith and opened myself up to her because I felt so comfortable in the relationship, and now it feels like she is shutting the door on me.  I feel like I’m falling in love with this woman, but I don’t know what to do.  I do also feel like this is a temporary setback for us, as she won’t always be this busy with work and my internship ends in early August.


Next steps: The problem that we face is the next few weeks are going to be even harder – she will be even busier with work, and I will be traveling 2 weekends in a row and won’t be able to go home to see her until the 4th of July weekend.  We spoke on Sunday and agreed to take it week by week.  I am going home this weekend and we are going out on a date Saturday evening and then will resume our conversation later that night.


Advice: I need your advice on what to do over the next few weeks, and for the remainder of the summer.  We both agreed that we want each other and that we are committed to making this work.  She is unsure about what to do, so I’ve tried making this easy on her.  What is a reasonable approach to communicating with each other but giving each other space?  If she is afraid of getting close, how can I help her navigate through this?  How can I communicate that this is hurting me and I need her input without upsetting her?  I don’t want to lose this woman, and I’m remaining optimistic, but I do need some insight.


TL;DR – Girlfriend of almost 6 months and I are not speaking this week in order to give each other space and time to think.  Approaching weeks look to be even more difficult with time being spent away from each other.  Need help organizing my thoughts and feelings, as well as figuring out a game plan to navigate through the rest of the summer with her."

396qko,2,2015-06-09,Ignoring my narcissistic mother.,floralpapers,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/396qko/ignoring_my_narcissistic_mother/,"I have been ignoring my parents for a week now; the only person I speak to is my older brother.  We are both ignoring our narcissistic mother.

Our fallout began with us telling her that we wanted a dog or cat.  But all our mother could focus on was the fact that the pet would be a nuisance to her; she didn't consider our feelings at all.  She even had the gall to say that my brother and I were irresponsible children that did not respect out parents' wishes, despite the fact that I had never disobeyed her once.  

A little background information, I had always been the stereotypical Asian “star-child:” perfect grades, great college, obedient to a fault, never dated or stayed out late, etc.  The rest of my family would always herald me as this perfect girl that they wished was their daughter; my mother always bragged to her friends and even strangers about me.  I literally got a near 4.0 at a very difficult university known for grade deflation; however, all of my achievements just seem “normal” and expected of me.  On the other hand, the rest of my family sees my brother as a fuck-up: “sub-par” grades, not familial at all, disobedient, etc.  Except, he is not.  He is the actual normal child.

At this point, I just can't wait to go back to college for the fall semester; I won't have to interact with them on a daily basis.  I will be employed this summer: part-time sales associate and an internship beginning in July, all of these opportunities that I have found for myself, without any family help or guidance.  I had always been relatively independent, but now I am trying to be completely self-sufficient.

My brother suggested I start seeking some counseling, since he believes that I have self-esteem and self-worth issues that go much deeper than this.  Is there anything else that I could do?  I don't want to completely cut off my family, but it is as if I can never fully communicate my feelings to them (the language barrier doesn't help either), without them making it about themselves and guilt-tripping me into thinking how ungrateful I am being."

**Here to buy only? Skip down to the table.** 
I have noticed that some people are not happy that I am selling samples of shaving soaps. I would like to share with everyone a little about why I’m doing this.  I am a University student struggling to get done with my bachelor’s degree and I’m currently out on summer break. I have been looking for summer jobs and internships but I have had a hard time finding stable jobs. I have been working odd jobs trying to support my family and myself but that has not been enough.  I have been trying to get money anyway I can even if it’s a little bit, as in the case of selling soap samples.  I combine everything I get in money to make at least something for the week.  I do not want to get stuck in getting welfare from the government, as I feel I should be able to work for myself. Once I get a job with my degree (about 2 more years) my hope is that me and my family’s economic status will change for the better, but for now I will keep doing what I can to sustain my family.

396wa9,2,2015-06-09,I(/19) still miss my ex,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/396wa9/i19_still_miss_my_ex/,"Hi Reddit,

I really need your help.
At the end of 2014 I was together with this internetguy, we'd developed feelings for eachother especially during the summerholidays, and we were very good friends before and even after that. Around October we decided we'd just start dating and all went ok, until he started to get emotionally abusive towards me. I'd already lost a lot of friends over the summertime because I grew closer to him, but he'd always change my view on things by talking it out of me. I never realised it until our close group of friends had split up and people that used to be my best friends now really disliked me. 
Since we'd met on the internet, I was already packing up and planning to move in with him and get a job there. I had everything planned out, there was an internship waiting for me over there I could do first and then after a few months decide whether I'd stay or not. 

Around November he started sending me screencaps from dating apps/sites he was still on.. and he did a lot of other things I didn't like, another example would be him sleeping over at girls' their houses, watching movies with them until they'd fall asleep. Just what the fuck? I started to feel awful about going to meet him for the first time.

I guess I didn't know what to do or what to think. I had no friends left but him. I decided to download the same datingapp as he was using and I met a guy on there I'd never seen in real life before. A mutual friend of our is a girl I used to hang out a lot, and she told me she used to be best friends with this guy. Since my relationship with the internet-ex was a secret anyway, I met up with the guy. We didn't do any intimate things - I knew I could if I wanted to, because no one would find out. But I didn't want to.

Thing is, my ex always said 'we were not really together anyway', because we'd never met in real life. He sure was right, but I felt committed. I wanted us to work out. When I met this new guy, I saw a way out - and I kept 'chilling' with him. We'd watch series together and just have fun in general. I saw my life get better everytime I'd see him.

When he kept going on calling me out on things, just being the emotionally abusive dick he was, he started to realise I wasn't going to stay... I guess it made him angry. We had an argument about a person that he thought was a 'waste of space', he wanted to know what that 'waste' had told me about something. I lied at first, then I refused to tell him what the 'waste' said.
He turned every-single-person that used to be my friends against me. Even the people that didn't like him. It made me realise how two-faced people can be. 

I am very happy with the guy I met during those dark times. I love him an incredible lot. We've been going strong for quite a while now. 
But when I lost my ex, I lost a lot of friends too. I lost a community of people who were very close together. I have been shunned. I can't seem to get over the feeling they got rid of me as if I was worth nothing, because I did care about every person I knew.

I know all of this shouldn't bother me. I know some people feel like 'internetfriends aren't real'. But some people actually *were* a huge part of my life. I can't get my ex out of my head. We were so strong for a long time. We had our ups and a LOT of downs, but for some reason, when I remember those times, I only see pink-blueish skies and unicorns dancing around. What is this? Why?

TL;DR - I miss my shitty ex I've never even met, my boyfriend is absolutely amazing and we never even fight, but I still can't let go."

So after stumbling across this sub, I have decided that I want to try my hand at home brewing. I have done a bit of research, and I am at the point where I think I am ready to start looking at starter kits. Unfortunately, money is the biggest obstacle for me. I am living at home during my unpaid internship and have no job yet to provide any kind of income. I do, however, have about $50 in amazon gift cards.

 I found a starter kit at my LHBS website for $49.99 that allows me to pay through amazon. [Here is a link to the kit.] (http://wineandbeermaking.com/product/brewing-equipment-kits/10-gift-certificate-copy/) 
That seems like a really low price from what I have seen at other places. What I really want to know is:

*  Does this kit actually have everything I need to get started with homebrewing? I know that it is likely about as bare bones as it gets but at this point I really just want to get a feel for the process.



* Will this kit allow me to upgrade further as I gain experience and more money? I would like to expand and upgrade in the future, so I want to make sure that some of the stuff included in this kit will still be useful to me and I am not going to have to completely scrap my $50 investment. 

I am really excited to start down my personal home brewing journey! Please share your thoughts on this kit or any other alternatives that I should consider. Thanks!"
397dnn,1,2015-06-09,Not enjoying my job/life abroad. Advice is welcome.,casterapple,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/397dnn/not_enjoying_my_joblife_abroad_advice_is_welcome/,"Hey, all. Buckle in--it's gonna be a long one.

I'm a 20-year-old girl, I recently graduated from college, and I'm currently living in Antofagasta, Chile. I've only been here for a month so far, and I've only been working for two weeks. When I say ""working,"" I mean at an internship rather than a real job. I'm teaching English at a small language institute. I don't get paid much, but that doesn't bother me. Going into this, my expectations were that I would just about break even on this whole venture.

My motivation in coming here was to learn Spanish, experience a different culture, travel, gain work experience (both for my own benefit and for my résumé), and discover if I wanted to teach English as a career. I definitely feel like my Spanish is improving, as well as my teaching skills. However, I feel fairly certain that I don't want to teach as a career.

Also, the institute I work for is pretty disorganized, which makes my job more stressful and less enjoyable. I do often enjoy my classes, but I feel like novelty might be a strong factor in that. I also would say that I don't look forward to my classes; I'd much rather not teach than teach. I don't get paid much, but my hours are very flexible and I often get a lot of free time.

I've been considering alternatives to my situation because I don't feel fulfilled here. I know that nine months is a short time, but when I think about doing this same thing every day for nine months, I can't imagine it.

However, there are some solid benefits to staying here. I'm living nearly rent-free in a nice apartment downtown, close to my job, with the sweetest roommate in the world. Like I said, I get a lot of downtime--I'm not working 40 hours a week. I've been able to practice my Spanish. I'm making friends with students (who are about my age) and other teachers, plus I'm friends with many members of the organization that matched me with this internship (again, my age).

Obviously, there are plenty of downsides as well. The institute is so poorly organized that I can't plan classes until about 10 minutes before class starts. I don't always work with the same students; a single student could be taught by a different teacher every time, making consistency impossible. Students are roughly divided by English fluency level, but these assessments are inconsistent, and an ""upper basic"" student might speak English easily or might have a lot of trouble with speaking and comprehension.

Another downside is that the city isn't really that interesting. It's beautiful, but I haven't found much to do other than go to the library or mall. I go out on the weekends with friends, which is lots of fun, but by myself there's not a whole lot to do. I think I'd prefer a more modern city--or maybe one with more greenery. Either way, it's not my ideal place.

The bottom line is that I don't know what to do. I know that I haven't been here long, and I plan to stick it out for as long as I can. But at the same time, the main reason I did this was to have a fun adventure, and there are very few times when I consider this a fun adventure. I'm only 20 years old; I have a bit of money saved up, and I feel like this is my time to travel and make stupid choices, rather than resigning myself to nine months of doing work that is bearable, but that I don't particularly enjoy, in a city that is all right, but that I don't particularly enjoy.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

**tl;dr: Moved to Chile to teach English for nine months. I don't really enjoy the work or the city, but I don't want to give up. I also haven't been here long. What should I do?**"

[23/m],DeepDish815,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/397hkc/what_to_sacrifice_love_or_dreams_23m/,"Hey there r/relationshipadvice. I'm kind of reaching out in the darkness here; I remembered how supportive and helpful the reddit community can be in bad times, and so here I am. First, the background.

I'm a [23/m] in a relationship with a [24/f]. We have been dating for a little less than a year at this point, but we have been best friends for about 8 years. She was my first girlfriend in high school, but that relationship ended poorly, I broke up with her over the phone on the bus. We were 15 and 16. Since then we've been best friends and both been in and out of other relationships, but we've had a sexual relationship ourselves intermittently during that time. She took my virginity when I was 18. 

We both went through college at different places and went through the ups and downs of college romance. She is now done with two years of law school, and is in the middle of her summer law internship in the large midwestern city that we grew up in. She will receive an amazing job offer from this firm to return upon graduation after one more year of law school. I've been in the city we grew up in for the past year since graduating, trying to make it as a singer/actor.

The next year of our lives is what is inciting all of my uncertainty. This Satruday, I am leaving to perform with a summer stock theater company for the next 11 weeks. By the time I get back to the city we are from, she will be gone studying abroad in Europe for the fall semester, and then will have one more semester of law school in upstate new york. This past year has been a somewhat trying time for both of us while trying to build and maintain a relationship at a distance. 

The rest of my uncertainty stems from the different places we seem to be at in our lives. She is about to be done with law school and is totally committed to her career and making a life in the city that we both grew up in and both love dearly. She isn’t ready to be married or engaged, but she is ready to be with the person she marries and start making a life. I, on the other hand, have this desire to try to make it as a performer, to live in some other cities and maybe countries, probably go to graduate school in another city for at least two years, and to just have some more diverse life experiences before I am ready to settle down. I do ultimately want to end up in this city-its where my entire family and many of my friends live-but I want to do and see some other things first.

If I had to choose today, there is no one else that comes close in my mind to someone to spend the rest of my life with. She is my best friend; we seem to think with the same brain a lot of the time. I respect her, I admire her, and I feel the closest thing I’ve ever felt to love for her. But I have intense doubts. She stopping by my place after she finishes work tonight, and she has noticed that I’ve been upset lately. 

So…reactions? Advice? Am I crazy? Thanks.

1. How competitive are the paid IT internships/co-ops? Does having lots of certs help? How picky are employers about experience and references? Any rough idea on what percentage of ICTS majors get paid internships/co-ops? 

2. From what I understand the unpaid ICTS internships are with ECU's IT Dept.  What kind of positions do interns usually end up working?  How much do certs determine the kind of position that you'll be working? E.g. Would you still be likely to work a tier I help desk or desktop support position, even if you're CCNA or MCTS certified?

397oze,4,2015-06-09,Host has come back and is making ridiculous threats about legal action over what they believe is an unclean room,crazycrazyPeople,AirBnB,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/397oze/host_has_come_back_and_is_making_ridiculous/,"***Update for anyone interested***

Since I posted this, the host escalated the complaint so that airbnb were involved and a case manager looked at the complaint. Airbnb has ultimately sided with us and is not pursuing us for payment. They informed us that they believe the pictures the host posted just show general wear and tear and they have advised the host in future to add a cleaning fee to their listings. In a last act of douchebaggery, the host posted practically everything they could find in their small apartment including a small rug with splotch marks on it (this could have been from absolutely any point in time I doubt this was inspected before she left), sweeping dust together on the floor and then taking a photo so that it looked like large clumps were just laying around (we then sent a photo to airbnb of the small hand vacuum she owned), and a photo of the oven which is so old that I doubt the marks on it could be removed short of sandblasting it. To be fair, it does look like a shit job (lol) was done on the toilet seat, but the bowl itself was clean so I guess the underside of the seat was missed, but either way it does not require $30 to fix just a wipe with disinfectant. 

As I said earlier this is our first experience with Airbnb so it does suck a bit but I am just putting this down to a nutty host who has unrealistic expectations. Your apartment doesn't get a makeover just because you had guests staying there. Oh and if there is still talk of legal action we will contact the landlord. Anyway thanks for your comments and support.

************************************************************************************

Hi,

I've had only one experience using airbnb and I just want to find out what I can do to make a host basically go away and leave my gf alone. We stayed at her place and left about 8 days before she arrived home from overseas (she was doing an internship). Before we arrived, someone else had stayed there after she left and we were her second occupants.

Long story short she arrived home yesterday afternoon and called my gf in a weird kind of way. My gf said the host wouldn't state her name or why she was calling until about two minutes into the conversation. She then expressed some complaints about her dissatisfaction with the cleaning regarding the toilet and the oven and also things like dust and blood on one of the bed posts (this was real wtf as neither of us bled while we were there that we can recall). Anyway the chief complaint was that there is now a stain on her mattress and also two pillows and a blanket were left there that weren't hers. My gf asked her what was the problem and what  was she expecting as a fix as the host had already cleaned the mess. In a round about way the host finally suggested we get a groupon coupon for house cleaning for about $40. Upon hearing this I fired off an email in (in reply to a follow up email she had sent) basically telling her she was nitpicking and we left the place as clean as we found it. For the mattress I told her that we had no idea that the pillow and blankets weren't hers and just assumed they were (why wouldn't we) and that we also went straight out to downtown to by some sheets to use on the bed, which don't have any stains on them so we don't know how her mattress could possibly be get stained but our sheets didn't. I then said we will not be paying any money. 

I said I would cut this short but apparently I am unable too. Anyway she is now emailing my girlfriend and texting her, saying she recorded the conversation and is threatening court (over $40 its ridculous lol). She has also requested $30 through airbnb.

What is my best course of action to close this down quickly. Should I contact airbnb or would this make me look bad? I really think we did the right thing and we did clean the apartment. I just think she is a little crazy. For example she doesn't have a vacuumn cleaner but wanted us to get rid of the dust. We're travelling for fucks sake we don't have a vacuum cleaner! I think the real issue is her landlord, once or twice during our stay her landlord was mentioned as being difficult and the host didn't want the landlord to know she was subletting the apartment. I think she is now trying to scam us to pay for her place to be cleaned.

Can anyone please give some advice. Thank you"

PROS:  

* $103K base salary. Made $135K last year with bonuses/overtime

* Short commute

* Help people get better when they are at their worst

* Close relationships with colleagues. 

* Very flexible schedule. 12-hour shifts allow for 3-4 shifts/week, maximum. Vacations without using any vacation time. 

* Nights I'm off I can chillax at home and play games, etc.
 
* I'm damn good at what I do. 

* Job security.

* Hourly. Any time I'm in the building I'm on the clock. 

* Hopefully buying a house soon and changing jobs would gum up the loan process. 


CONS:

* Labor-intensive: patients are getting larger and larger. Back hurts from time to time. Tore an ACL once. 

* Depressing: most patients do not do well or we are keeping alive needlessly. 

* Toxic/backwards corporate culture at current hospital were nurses are powerless and bureaucracy is infinite. 
 
* Intellectually unfulfilling: 50% of my shifts are making sure the appropriate checkboxes are checked for the rare audit or court case. Literally no other persons will look at said checkboxes. Knowing at times what patients really need and not being able to facilitate it for any number of reasons not limited to but including interns, family drama, stupid policies, etc. 

* Ever since I've been on nights, I've had odd medical issues ranging from near-constant eczema, what seemed to be IBS for several months, insomnia, fatigue when I'm off of work, weird sleep-induced achilles tendonitis. These issues may be completely incidental to being on nights the last few years, but their correlation should be noted. 

* I can't see myself doing this for 30 more years until I'm retirement age. 

* High-deductible health insurance with HSA.   

* I work a fair amount of holidays and every other weekend, so I miss out on many extended family gatherings, local festivals, etc. 

* No real upward mobility without seeking advanced nursing degrees which are about 90% fluff and depress me to think about. 



**PROSPECTIVE JOB: NURSE EDUCATOR/SPECIALIST FOR LARGE BIOMED PRODUCT COMPANY**  
PROS: 

* 50-75% travel: Explore different areas, rack up frequent flyer/hotel points. Eat at awesome restaurants on company dime. 

* Company car: If I sell my current car, I would save approximately $600/mo in gas and carrying a car note. New car every 3 years. No worries ever for maintenance. 

* I already know the product well. I'm a tech geek and this appeals to me greatly. I'd be good in this role (at least as described). I'd be educating ICU nurses, so right up my alley. 

* No office 9-5. I'd either be remote out of home or on-location with a client. 

* I would return to a diurnal lifestyle and hopefully above-mentioned health problems would improve. 

* Essentially labor-free. 

* (Most) weekends and holidays off. Rarely might need to fly/drive out on a Sunday afternoon or something. 

* Slightly better health insurance. Stock. 

* Other fringe benefits: cell phones, laptops, etc. 

* I can see myself doing this for many years if it works out. 

* Upward mobility though it's in a corporate environment. More results based than requiring pointless additional degrees. 


CONS: 

* Initial offer expected to be 85-90K. Up to 10% annual bonus. Unclear of what cap is. It is salaried, so any overtime worked is unpaid. 

* Travel: I have three children. If I have to be gone for long stretches, it ~~may~~ will put undue burden on my wife. After a year of training, the travel requirements will hopefully be more local and car-based, so hopefully this is minimized. I also have to account for the fact I'm essentially gone for 12-16 nights a month as it is merely by working them. 

* Huge multinational conglomerate. Stock prices are stagnating. Concern for long-term job security (although I guess I could always go back to being a bedside nurse in the interim).

* I've never been a corporate pawn and I have no idea how to fit into the norms of such a lifestyle. I've worn pajamas (scrubs) to work all my adult life. 

* Isolating -- any colleagues to speak of would be via conference call from another state. I'm probably okay with this, though. 

* Loss of flexibility with schedule. Vacations may depend more on when I can work it into calendar with product rollouts than when we would like to go. 

* I want to buy a house soon and changing jobs would complicate the loan qualification. 



**MY THOUGHTS**  
If salaries were equal, I'd chose the latter in a heartbeat. It has the potential to be more fulfilling to me as a person. The travel would be fun, at least at first, and if I were to move up the corporate ladder, its requirements would decrease somewhat. However, the thought of going from potentially $135K to 85K as the sole earner scares me. That's a *huge* potential decrease. That said, overtime at the hospital isn't as available this year as it was last year, and therefore I should base my salary expectations on what I am guaranteed- namely, 103K. In that context, I have to consider whether the fringe benefits and possible bonus on a salary of 85K would basically even out the differences. 85K with $600/mo savings in auto and a 10% bonus would be an additional 13.5K, so that's already 98.5K. I wonder, with taxes coming into play, if it's a wash.   
  
  


TL;DR: I have to choose between soul-crushing and back-aching for 135K or potentially fulfilling for 85K+fringe.

This is why it's important to have a job that provides you with wealth as well as personal happiness.

Even if you're gainfully employed and not thinking of jumping ship, you might still want to consider dressing for success, keeping your resume up-to-date, or even asking for a raise.

#1. If you're a student who is free this summer and haven't done so already: get yourself an internship!

Taking an internship or co-op in your undergrad is by far [one of the most important career boosters out there](http://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2010/04/15/when-a-degree-isnt-enough), and can still benefit you even if it's unpaid. It allows you to network, get real world experience, get professional feedback, and [other important things](http://www.laneterralever.com/the-benefits-of-internships-before-college-graduation/).

So if you haven't done so, consider padding your resume with intern experience, especially if you're free this summer. Speaking of resumes...

#2. Keep your resume up-to-date and constantly get feedback

Even if you're not jumping ship, optimizing your resume and keeping it up to date is still important. Here are some good resources for resume building:

* [from Florida Gulf Coast University](http://pkyonge.ufl.edu/modules/groups/homepagefiles/cms/1506775/File/How2_OptimalResume.pdf)
* [from Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/emcs/oce/alumni/resume-writing)
* [from resume-help.org](http://www.resume-help.org/resume_writing_tips.htm)
* [from the /r/resumes FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/faq)

If you have a professional profile (like LinkedIn, professional societies, or trade societies), make sure you update that too!

And final thing: Don't forget to polish up your interview skills if you're going to go job hunting.

#3. Remember to dress for success

In the workplace, you should keep your hair neat (facial hair included!), your clothes should have the proper fit, and your outfit should be clean. Appearances and first impressions matter, and one source states ""41 percent of employers said that people who dress better or more professionally tend to be promoted."" ([Source](http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/07/30/cb.dress.for.success/index.html?eref=rss_latest)) 

If you are out interviewing, make sure your suit or outfit is appropriate. There is also /r/femalefashionadvice and /r/malefashionadvice to help you on your way.

#4. Consider the best time to ask for a raise or promotion

Remember to **do your research** on this one before acting on it. A lot of raises are dependent on company policy, timing, negotiation skills, negotiation tactics, and several other things.

Here are some good sources on asking for a raise:

* [From Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2014/05/07/how-to-ask-for-a-raise-and-get-it/)
* [From Monster](http://career-advice.monster.com/salary-benefits/negotiation-tips/can-i-ask-for-a-raise-yet-hot-jobs/article.aspx)

3987e2,2,2015-06-09,"Me [21 M] revealing my secrets and talking about moving forward with my Ex[20 F] who keeps trying to reconnect, without acting on it.",Brightsided,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3987e2/me_21_m_revealing_my_secrets_and_talking_about/,"Hey r/relationship, I've found myself(21 M) in a precarious position with my most recent Ex(20 F) and I'm really hoping for some sage advice, wise words, or perspectives to figure it all out.

The relationship started in the end of Winter last year (2013) while we were both University students and to say the least I was in a bad place when she came upon me. I was smoking weed every day, playing league of legends every day, only taking one class because I was to lazy to schedule my classes on time because frankly I had stopped giving much of a shit about college. Somehow this chick liked me though and we hit it off almost immediately, we went the whole 9 yards and became seriously dating almost instantly. Let's call her Kat from here on. 

So as I said my own life was in a precarious position, and I handled what went from there even more poorly. I was accused of plagiarism in the single class which scared my shitless and I was so deep in my hole I did not sign up for classes the following quarter. This was a shameful but worse I went along and decided through inaction to not tell a single soul that I was in such trouble including Kat.

Somehow this went on for more then a whole year of my casually pretending I was still taking classes, lying to anyone who asked, and generally doing fuck all to fix my problems, which understandably led to some depression and a lot of anxiety and stress and overall left me feeling how I can only imagine a Bi-polar person would, intense highs and normal times and then the opposite where i felt so ashamed of myself i considered suicide. Yet through all this me and Kat had quite a wonderful relationship going, we stayed together most nights, enjoyed going out and doing activities together. What we had had grown into a beautiful thing I still regard as love on a level I had yet to experience, I would have done anything to her, and without her I thought I might simply die.

This lasted until around the beginning of winter quarter, when maybe I got worse, but Kat also had her fair share of stresses, between family issues and working , and school she had very little time for me, she would stay over a few nights a week, but the novelty was lost and things became more strained, even when she was around it was as if she wasn't all the way there, with her head stuck in her stresses.(this is probably how I often seemed to her.) 

Then the weekend spring break started right before she was supposed to go with a family vacation with me to Mexico she broke things off. She didn't have many definitive reasons but said she was dealing with too much. Many tears were shed, I tried to convince her otherwise for a short time, but we both knew it was over.

Now here I am, two months later with sporadic contact in between(text and fb only), since the break up both of us expressing that we still feel deeply for one another and her even expressing many regrets saying she may have made a mistake.

Moving on for me has been tough and it has caused me a lot of pain, but I honestly have made it into a good thing in some ways. I came clean about my deceit to my family, and some friends(ones I care about) I have re-enrolled into my university(I somehow was not kicked out) and am working full time with an internship for the summer. I've kicked some of my more dangerous habits and I'm doing my best to commit to my self-improvement. 

This is where things get hairy because I originally was going to see her and talk to her because I wanted to come clean with her as well. Needless to say that not being honest about being in school is a huge deal, and she deserves to know, especially if we were ever going to be together again, which may be a naive thought but is something I've truly wanted. Yet somehow through our texting I found out that despite her saying how much she still cares for me and wishes she could rewind the clock, saying she thinks I might have been the best thing for her ever, she has been seeing another dude ""casually"" for who knows how long. When she first told me I was quite sad, and it still pisses me off, and after I decided not to see her to explain, feeling pretty bad about I and myself. 

Now a week later she texts me to essentially tell me the same thing, this time even more definitive, expressing her feeling for me, and again O ask her if she is still seeing this dude, and it come out yes. I just don't get why she thinks she can try to bring me back emotionally while sleeping with another man. 

So we are talking tonight over the phone, and I plan to tell her how I lied to her during our relationship, and to get some finality out of it all because my heart has been hurting for to long.

This hasn't been the best retelling and I plan to clean it up when I return home. But I'm hoping I can find some words of wisdom from r/relationship folks over how I should proceed and that to think of this allm I have plenty of my own ideas but I haven't gotten to talk to anyone about this in depth at all really.



   
**tl;dr**: I had a 1 1/2 year long relationship with a girl who though I wad in college while I was not. She broke up with me but talks as though she wants to try to get back together but is simultaneously sleeping with another guy."

I was smart enough to make it to a relatively good university and get relatively good grades, but never to make it to the top tier: the 1.1s and the good internships. I'm okay at most sports, not terrible at any but nor am I particularly outstanding at any. I am quite active: I play sports and I go to the gym 4+ times a week, yet I spend days at a time eating junk food and watching Netflix in an apathetic haze. I'm not good looking enough to be awarded a seond glance, and I have accepted it as an established fact that I will never be someone's crush just from looks alone, or approached in a nightclub by a girl, although (in my honest opinion) I'm not ugly enough to suffer for it (as unfortunately often happens in society). I mostly don't click with people, sharing the awkward strained jokes and the even more awkward pauses, yet click with about 1/20, so I guess enough that people know my name and some of who I am. I have a few friends, but I'll never be considered popular. I'm a nice guy, but with a crude streak which I find difficult to suppress. I have limited job opportunites once I graduate from university, and I have little interests which could translate into a good job. I have many interests yet I am oftentimes a boring person. I have never, and probably will not any time soon, been in a relationship (except for one short car crash which suggests maybe I should avoid them in future), and instead what passes for a relationship to me is daydreaming about girls who I cannot seem to take down from a pedestal. I don't feel motivated by anything, as it seems that for anything I am even quite good at, there will always be a close friend or family better at it. I love to read, and it would be nice to become a writer, but I am not creative. I have had a relatively privileged childhood, and have not been left wanting for material things, and so I am guilty whenever I feel like I am depressed. I have no confidence. I feel like if I were to die tomorrow, the only people who would be sad would be those ""obligated"" to, i.e. family and people I went to school with. I feel like a nonentity, and what frightens me is that I feel like it is all I will ever be. And that one day I may be okay with that all being all I will ever be. I doubt many will read this, but that's okay. It was important to me that I wrote this for myself. "

actives, if you have any other misc advice you want me to add leave a comment and i'll put it on the list. feedback is welcome too.
It doesn't matter whether you are ex military, socially awkward, 46, poor, or anything other than a rich non-white 18 year old. You should rush.
What do you expect from a fraternity?
I can think of two main reasons to join a fraternity.
You want to make friends, party, brotherhood, connections etc...
Your only goal is to make connections to help you get a job after college.
If your main reason is number 2, you should look into joining a professional fraternity. Beta Alpha Psi is the national accounting fraternity and are highly recruited at my university.
If your main reason is number 1, you should join a social fraternity. lambda chi, pike, fiji, sigma chi, etc...
Rushing a Social Fraternity
Answer these questions:
What interests do I have?
Do I prefer smaller or larger groups?
1- Try to find a fraternity where the members have similar interests to you. Are you a country boy? Find the fraternity that best fits that characteristic. Like video games? There's going to be a fraternity for you. If you're a gym rat, sports star, or an alcoholic, there will be a fraternity for you. You just have to do your homework and find the right one.
2- The size of the fraternity can be a big factor. If you don't do well in situations with a huge amount of people, you should look into the smaller fraternities.
Misc. Advice
You have to be willing to make compromises. There will be a lot of events that you will hate to attend but will anyway. You don't have to compromise your morals. Any fraternity worth a crap will be willing to work with personal beliefs/personal aspects of your life that might be affected during the pledging process.
It is what you make of it. You get out of it what you put in. If you're a dead beat pledge who never puts an effort into anything, expect to have a terrible time. If you go to all your events with a good attitude, pledgeship will be exponentially better.
Don't be a fuck up. I can't explain this one and you will do this at some point. Just try to minimize the damage.
How fraternity life has affected me
My junior year I received an internship for an accounting firm in my hometown. While I was there I worked with a supervisor who was in charge of new hires. During conversation she told me she saw on my resume that I was in a fraternity and immediately put my resume in the call back pile because she was in a sorority herself. I received a full time offer after the internship and will be moving up North after I finish my degree. It didn't matter what fraternity I was in, just the fact that I was in one put me at an advantage in this particular circumstance."

For the past two years my husband and I have been gaining agricultural experience to run our own farm business.  We're now at the point where we need to make a move out of the city into the area where we'd like to start farming.  At first we'll rent in the area and search for suitable farms over the next couple of months.

I work from home and my husband is f-unemployed but looking in both areas.

We want to grow apples to make our own hard cider.  Just pretend this isn't a completely insane idea for the moment.  Apples grow really well all over Ontario near the lakes, but the main apples growing areas are up near the Bruce Peninsula and around Prince Edward County.

My husband did his farm internship near Owen Sound last year and we both really love the area, but I know that Prince Edward County has a lot of benefits to it too.  They are both really beautiful parts of the world, property prices are pretty comparable (PEC is slightly cheaper) and are both close enough to cottage country regions that we could attract potential customers to our business, while being close enough to city centre to sell.

It seems like it's going to come down to the place we find to rent, but I'd love to hear any other thoughts and opinions.  If anyone's had experience living in both places, I'd appreciate hearing from you.

Thanks!

3993zl,1,2015-06-09,"Supposed to start at Big4, they changed my start date, now thinking about switching or other options. Need advice!",DrunkenBlowfish,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3993zl/supposed_to_start_at_big4_they_changed_my_start/,"Sorry in advance for the length of this post. I'm anxious and just want to lay out the whole situation so I can get the best advice possible...

So I did my internship at one of the Big4 last summer in Audit. Decided tax would be a better fit, and got the offer. I was supposed to be starting this October, after graduating this spring. 

After again confirming my October start date in the beginning of the year, I later was told that I would have to start in July instead. I really freaked out because I was planning to take my CPAs over the summer and have them finished by the time I started. I will have FAR done (and hopefully passed) by the time I start, but would need to take my other 3 while working full-time. 

As I'm seeing how much time studying for the CPAs is taking, I'm really starting to worry even more. I'm studying full time right now and already feeling stressed. I don't realistically think it will be possible for me to pass the other 3 exams while working 50-60 hour weeks (several people in the tax department at my firm said these are their usual hours/week). I'm a bit of a slow studier and although I have been/am smart, it can take me a bit longer than other people. I'm not sure I could handle this for a full year or so that it would likely take me to pass the other 3. I have depression and anxiety and I really fear it might put me back in a bad place to have Big4 stress on top of the stress and time pressure of the CPAs.

I'm trying to figure out what to do at this point. I see my options as:

* Start at the Big4 firm, see how it goes with trying to take the 3 remaining CPAs. If it's not working, quit and try to find work at another regional/national firm, possible taking some time off to complete the exams. (I fear that I may not be able to find a job elsewhere after only say, 6 months or so at the Big4. How common is it for other firms to hire people not directly from campus recruiting at the staff level? I never see staff job postings on their sites and am worried I would have to resort to industry. Any experience with this?)

* Just tell them I'm quitting now, and apply at the regional/national firms that would have me starting later in the fall instead. That would give me time to get some of the exams out of the way. (Most firms have already hired for their new staff so I don't know how feasible this is. I did apply at a Top 10 firm today for either Fall or Winter start, but that will probably go nowhere).

* Ask them to defer my offer and go for my Masters so I could get gain some time. (Doesn't seem like a great option because of the loans, and it might look bad)

* Ask them if they're willing to let me start later (unlikely, but most of the other people starting with me have finished their CPAs as they graduated earlier, so perhaps they wouldn't need me to start as soon?)

* Anything else anybody here can suggest!?!

Thanks to anyone who can offer some helpful suggestions or relate their experience. I feel so lost and confused about what to do here.

I'm here on an internship and all the other interns already know each-other, what are the odds. They leave me out of plans and don't even invite me to do stuff even after I told them that I'm up to hang anytime. I've had problems in the past with being social, but I've massively improved in the last 5 years. I just want to make friends, but this time it's proving to be more difficult than normal.

With all this alone time I've been over thinking my life. I've never been in a serious relationship before. I've had glimpses of what they are like, but nothing remotely long-term. I've found that I've been craving this affection of a relationship. This is a moment in my life where I feel very unloved, and it's starting to get to me"

I wake up, struggle to motivate myself to get out of bed, wander to my computer, and try to find some way to keep my mind off my life. I left my old job because I felt abused(restaurant life), my new job has been delayed two and a half weeks now, and I was told I'd be trained to be a bartender but I don't believe it. Shit doesn't go my way ever. I used to smoke weed to kind of fill in the spaces between but it was getting expensive with no job, and it felt like abuse to me. 


Financially I'm ok, but I have almost no cushion. I used a third of it to bail my sister out of probation so she didn't go back to jail, and she's paying me back but its slow. Another third has been spent through housing, food, and a couple of set backs I didn't forsee. I haven't seen my family in months, most of my friends are too busy to interact with me so socially I feel so fucking alone. 


My ex broke up with me in February and its been a mess because we both love each other but she can't get over her ex of 6 years because that was 25% of her life. I fucking hate the guy and I've never met him because he has everything I want. His parents are rich and pay for him to take casual trips to Europe between school they pay for, he has my ex because they were together first even though he treated her poorly and no one wants them together, he went to the best school we're they're from and has been handed all the tools you could ask for to succeed. 


Meanwhile, my family situation would require a post just as long as this to describe how fucked up it is. I have to pay for school my self out of my own pocket, and I was denied entry into the university I want, even though I'm in a program that guarantees admission to it, because I took a few classes there before going to the associated state college. So now my only chance at getting the degree I want without starting all over AGAIN is to get a degree at this school in a related subject I hate, then try again to pay double the price of the first degree. 


I have one girl I was interested in for awhile, and she really likes me, but she's my room mates cousin and tried to get me to cheat on my now ex while we were together, so I don't trust her. Not like I could even do it though, I go to sleep and wake up every day thinking about my ex. Wouldn't be fair to anybody. 


My only solace in life is the gym, but that only fills up 2/24 hours in the day. I'm trying to lose weight so I'm eating less, so I don't have the energy for more. One of best friends is moving from 4 hours away to 2.5, so that's good I guess, but he's a third year med student with a gf so that won't change much anyways. 

I'm laying in bed right now with a test tomorrow and I just want to say fuck it and get drunk. But I know I need to avoid abusing drugs and alcohol. I had someone offer me a possible internship but I just can't muster the effort to go out of my way to make it happen. If I wasn't so depressed I could get 2, 3, or even 4 times as much done in a day. Unfortunately, I'm just going to keep ruining myself.


Fuck."

39a8tx,56,2015-06-10,[AMA Series 2015] Anglican/Episcopalian,Shivermetim,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/39a8tx/ama_series_2015_anglicanepiscopalian/,"Welcome! We are Anglicans. For those who are unaware of our history, Henry VIII is more or less irrelevant, so stop bringing him up. 

*(The following text is reproduced without permission from the Church of England [Website](https://www.churchofengland.org/our-faith/being-an-anglican/anglican.aspx).)*

**History**

Anglicans trace their Christian roots back to the early Church, and their specifically Anglican identity to the post-Reformation expansion of the Church of England and other Episcopal or Anglican Churches. Historically, there were two main stages in the development and spread of the Communion. Beginning with the seventeenth century, Anglicanism was established alongside colonisation in the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. The second stage began in the eighteenth century when missionaries worked to establish Anglican churches in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

**Organisation**

As a worldwide family of churches, the Anglican Communion has more than 70 million adherents in 38 Provinces spreading across 161 countries. Located on every continent, Anglicans speak many languages and come from different races and cultures. Although the churches are autonomous, they are also uniquely unified through their history, their theology, their worship and their relationship to the ancient See of Canterbury.

**Theology**

Anglicans uphold the Catholic and Apostolic faith. Following the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Churches are committed to the proclamation of the good news of the Gospel to the whole creation. In practice this is based on the revelation contained in Holy Scripture and the Catholic creeds, and is interpreted in light of Christian tradition, scholarship, reason and experience.

By baptism in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, a person is made one with Christ and received into the fellowship of the Church. This sacrament of initiation is open to children as well as to adults.

Central to worship for Anglicans is the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, also called the Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper or the Mass. In this offering of prayer and praise, the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are recalled through the proclamation of the word and the celebration of the sacrament. Other important rites, commonly called sacraments, include confirmation, holy orders, reconciliation, marriage and anointing of the sick.

Worship is at the very heart of Anglicanism. Its styles vary from simple to elaborate, or even a combination. Until the late twentieth century the great uniting text was *The Book of Common Prayer,* in its various revisions throughout the Communion, and the modern language liturgies, such as Common Worship, which now exist alongside it still bear a family likeness. Both *The Book of Common Prayer,* and more recent Anglican liturgies give expression to the comprehensiveness found within the Church whose principles reflect that of the via media in relation to its own and other Christian Churches.

**Today's Panalists**

/u/adamthrash I'm a member of the Episcopal Church in the United States. I've been more or less Anglican in my theology for about three years, but I've only gotten the chance to begin attending Episcopalian services in the last year and a half. I'm formerly from the Baptist tradition (SBC) where I was a youth minister, and as such, I love trying to mix a bit of evangelical flair with my Anglo-Catholic leanings.

/u/VexedCoffee I am an Anglo-Catholic in the Episcopal Church. I grew up nominally Baptist, converted to Roman Catholicism in high school, and then to the Episcopal Church at the beginning of college. I've been Anglican now for 8 years and have begun the official discernment process for ordained ministry. I have a BA in Philosophy and currently work in edtech. I am also one of the mods of /r/Anglicanism and am on my church's vestry (essentially a board of directors).

/u/TheWord5mith I am 24 years old, having been an Episcopalian for the past 8 years. I identify as an ""Anglo-Catholic"", though I have a respect and familiarity with the ""Evangelical"" and ""Progressive"" branches of TEC as well. I currently serve as an assistant youth minister and assistant parish administrator (basically a glorified intern).
I had a sporadic religious upbringing as a youth, spending much of my time in the faith tradition of my father: ELCA Lutheran. In middle-school I left Christianity after a few bad experiences and a few poorly answered questions. I eventually “reconverted” back to Christianity by way of my mother’s tradition: Anglicanism (more specifically, The Episcopal Church). I was a regular and committed layperson for the remainder of high school and, to a lesser extent, college. Towards the latter half of college though, I started attending a new Episcopal parish that really catalyzed my “active” faith and eventually lead to me to having a “crisis of faith” about my secular vocation, which was National Security. After my graduation and some uncomfortable soul searching I decided to join the Texas Episcopal Service Corps to explore the one thing that I knew I was still passionate for: ministry. My year with the TESC will be coming to a close this July and I hope to continue working in ministry somewhere in Texas.

/u/Shivermetim  I'm an Australian. 23 years young. Registered nurse by trade, so I bring a lay perspective to this AMA. I've been an Anglican since my early childhood and so I've been in and around a bunch of different churches. There was a period where my dad was preparing for ordination, so we traveled around a bit. I was confirmed by the then Bishop of Gippsland, Jeffrey Driver, and I've had a strong Anglican identity ever since. These days I fit more in the liberal and Anglo-catholic camps rather than the evangelical camp where I was brought up.

/u/ThaneToblerone I am an American currently working on a BA in Religious Studies at a well ranked, public university. My childhood was spent in the Southern Baptist tradition, being raised by a SBC pastor, up until I became an atheist in high school. I was non-religious (and even anti-religious at times) for about four years, but ended up taking a couple of classes in Christianity because I figured they'd be easy. After accidentally falling in love with religious studies, and changing majors I began attending a synagogue both due to an interest in Judaic Studies, and in probing my own spirituality. I was introduced to the Episcopal church some time later and felt I had found my home. Through the guidance of my priests, rabbi, and others I returned to a life of faith.
I was confirmed into the Episcopal church by Rt. Rev. Michael Curry not long ago, but also identify as an Affirming Catholic. The Affirming Catholic Church is a liberal strain within Anglo-Catholicism which supports the ordination of any qualified, called individual regardless of gender or sexuality. Excluding these issues, I maintain a relatively traditional faith in affirming the creeds, transubstantiation, the intercession of the saints, the seven sacraments, etc.

/u/UncommonPrayer I'm a member of the Episcopal Church, currently 32 years old and a member for around 5-6 years. I grew up in a theologically conservative evangelical church, and I found myself searching for something that was both historically defensible (i.e. kept some of the earliest ideas of the church like the importance of apostolic succession, the Real Presence in the Eucharist, etc.) but which was still capable of evaluating its doctrines through consensus and discussion.
This led me to the Episcopal Church and more broadly speaking, the Anglican tradition, especially both the ""Latitudinarian"" divines and the Oxford Movement. I identify as being Anglo-Catholic, with progressive social attitudes and support for the rights of GSM within the church. I appreciate the Anglican tradition of theological inclusiveness, willingness to be in dialogue even when we disagree, and (of course) our choral tradition. I've lived in several dioceses that have had a wide variety of churchmanships from our more protestant, evangelical tradition to more those that trended to more ""catholic"" worship. I'm most at home at a place that has a relatively choral mass and brings out the incense for high feast days or special seasons in the church year.

/u/JosiahHenderson I grew up, was baptised and was confirmed in a charismatic/evangelical Anglican congregation, itself belonging to the rather more liberal Anglican Church of Canada (ACC) Diocese of Montreal. In 2007-2008, most of my congregation (myself included) left the ACC and constituted an ANiC (Anglican Network in Canada) congregation. ANiC is now a diocese within ACNA (the Anglican Church in North America), an ecclesial province ""in formation"" created for North American Anglicans who felt unable to worship and minister under the authority of theologically liberal bishops. ACNA was created with the help and under the authority of several South American and African Anglican bishops and their provinces, and aligns itself with the declarations of the Global Anglican Future Conferences (GAFCON I &amp; II) of Anglican bishops from the ""Global South"".

Last month, I graduated with a Bachelor of Theology from a secular university (where I studied under several liberal/Anglo-Catholic profs and alongside a number of ACC ordinands). I am now at the very beginning of a discernment process towards ordained pastoral ministry within ANiC. I currently work at a day shelter for homeless people, run by my ANiC congregation (out of the building of the ACC church to which we formerly belonged). I have previously worked in children's ministry in parishes across the ACC."

I'm doing an internship at frankfurt for the summer and I've been looking for an apartment to live in since May. Unfortunately with no luck. 

I've mainly checked WG-Gesucht, but also Airbnb and immobielenscout24.

Budget for the housing is max 550€/month and it should have a bed. No allergies, special needs, just a place to rest my head and sit in front of the computer while not working ;).

I don't speak German that well, and my colleagues believe that's one ofthe reasons there aren't that many people answering back to my applications. We have also called to some of the apartments with my boss and no luck.

So if someone you know is looking for a roomate between **june 14th and sept. 4th** please msg me for contact info. I'm already in Frankfurt so I'm available to see the apartment whenever.

Thanks!

I'm 23 with no formal education beyond A-level and I've managed to find myself working as a BI consultant through a bit of luck and putting in hard work after making a good impression during an internship on a consultancy firms support desk.

ETL work has been my mainstay in my day to day consultancy, as well as building models to spec and adapting our existing clients models as business needs change.

I've been working in the field for about 8 Months (not inculding my time as an intern and support desk tech) now and would appreciate any input on the best things to learn and focus on to develop this into a solid career direction.

I currently have experience with cube based solutions but I've seen a few post around claiming that it's 'a dying methodology', what leads people to say this?

It also seems that the big thing at the moment is Tableau (at least it gets the most reference on this subreddit) is it something I should be trying to transition to over time?

If it helps at all my current companies focus is the use of data for budgeting forecasting and statutory consolidation in the financial sector.

Many thanks.

We first met 2 years ago, but we didn't live in the same city. We sent messages that became increasingly flirty. It turned out he was moving to my city (coincidence, the plans were made before I met him), so we dated for a couple of weeks before he told me that he wanted to be single. That hurt a lot, but I got over it, went no communication etc. Then it transpired that I got an internship in the city that he would be moving to (lots of moving around I know), so I had gotten over my upset by then and wrote him a friendly message. He was the only person I knew in that city, so I figured having a friend would be a good thing. 

We met up twice in my hometown before he left and ended up having sex again, but we were very clear that it was purely casual. Then he left, and I followed a couple of months later. We met up, and I told him that I didn't think our relationship should be sexual anymore, because I needed to keep him as a friend. Low and behold, we had sex that night - oops! 

I saw him a few times over the next few weeks, and he told me more about how he was still in love with this girl that he had had a brief fling with 18 months before. I was doing my best not to fall in love with him again. 

We got closer, especially in the last month of my 3 month internship, but there was still the issue of this other girl (who had been ignoring him for 18 months, and he still hadn't gotten over). I moved back home for 1 month, and we stayed in contact, then I moved back. I admit that a good part of my motivation was him. 

Then it turned out that over that month, this girl had got back in contact with him, but she wasn't who he remembered her being. We soon became exclusive. Then, a month later, he's visiting her hometown for work, and they arrange to meet. He wants to clear the air one last time and hopefully get over her. She bails, which convinces him she is not a nice person, and he finally gets over her. In the month following that we got increasingly close, until we finally got together officially. 

That was 2 weeks before I had to go home for 3 months to take some exams. Brilliant timing. So we have been long distance, but I've done 3 visits back to see him. In a few weeks I will be done here, and moving back to his city.

We finally decided to move in together, because it felt stupid for me to be paying rent on a place when I stayed at his 5 times a week anyway. 

Sorry for the total wall of text, but I think the long history between us is important to get a feeling for our relationship, with the key point being that I am much more emotionally invested, because my feelings started developing much sooner. 

So I'm a bit worried about moving in together for a few reasons:

1) I have never felt very secure in the relationship, because for so long it was 'casual' and he was very clear about not liking me in a relationship-y way; this means that I find it very difficult to tell him if I'm upset with him or anything, even though he is properly with me now. I tend to just not say anything and wait until I get over it. 

2) He gets moods sometimes (I guess most people do), especially if things are hard at work, where he is a bit reserved and not affectionate and it makes me worry, even if I'm sure I'm not the problem. I am a consistently happy person, so I guess I find it hard to understand, or know how to act when he's like this. 

3) He is crazily clean and tidy, and I worry that I'm going to piss him off, despite my best efforts.

4) I'm moving into his apartment, so I'm worried it's going to feel like an invasion of his space, and that it may make him resent me. 

5) He says he will need some alone time, which is perfectly reasonable, but I worry I'm going to end up just hot-footing it out of the apartment every time he is in the least bit cold towards me because I'll think he wants alone time!

6) I want to contribute towards food and rent and all the rest, but I don't have a job lined up out there, or a whole lot of savings, so it may get tricky. He has a very comfortable income and likes to go out to nice places a lot. I'm not sure how to discuss this with him. 

I know it's only for 3 months, but I've never lived with anyone before, and I guess I'm getting a bit skittish. This man is genuinely incredible, to the point where his awesomeness kind of intimidates me! He makes me the best version of me I can be, and I learn so much from him. I just want to do whatever I can to make living together as wonderful as it has the potential to be, and not let it drive a wedge between us. 

So Reddit, sorry for the total wall of text, but it also feels good to tell the whole convoluted story of our relationship, even if it is to internet strangers :) I would really appreciate any advice on how to make this transition easy, and any experiences you want to share about moving in with people.
   
**tl;dr**: Moving in with my boyfriend, we have a slightly complicated relationship history, but it has a lot of potential for the future. How do I make the transition go well and avoid resentment on either of our parts?"
39axt4,11,2015-06-10,Am I being financially abused?,Kel-ahrairah,ACON_Support,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACON_Support/comments/39axt4/am_i_being_financially_abused/,"OK, ACON_Support, here's the sitch.

I've been living at home with my mother since I graduated college two years ago to help pay the bills. I am not sure if she is an N, but she displays N traits for serious and for sure. During that time, I've had three jobs (well, two jobs and an internship). The first one was temporary, and paid well for five months. Then I spent eight months unemployed and looking for work (while getting constantly berated about how I wasn't trying hard enough to find a new job while *she* didn't do much in the way of looking either - you know, that whole song and dance). Then I got my internship, which was part-time and *paid*; that lasted five months per the terms of the internship. I was lucky enough to get hired two months later at the same place that I interned at, and have been working there since January.

I make decent money for living on my own in this area, which has a pretty high cost of living. Note that I say ""living on my own"". Living at home with my income means I get to pay the mortgage and HOA fees. Combined, those wipe out 75% of my income. My mother gets SSI once a month and does a few odd jobs for friends and family for supplemental income aside from (allegedly) looking for work. All of this could be solved if she could get a job in her field, but she's 65 now and not many orgs in her field are going to take her on even as a consultant (allegedly).

I have no qualms about pitching in, and have offered to pay some of the bills if she pitches in with mortgage, but, well...I have my own bank account now (and she took that news quite poorly, and sniped at me about it this morning). Thing is, I have *just* enough to pay the mortgage, and I'll *still* need to draw the meager amount I'd stashed in savings to pay it. Then I will be *dirt broke* until I next get paid on the 22nd - which is a problem since I still have therapy and medical bills and IRS payments and student loans that just came due. I don't want to ask her for the extra money to pay the mortgage, even though she has a few hundred dollars right now, because I don't want her to feel like she can wield that kind of power over me.

(Spoiler alert: she just spent God knows how much money on more bullshit non-FDA-evaluated ""health"" products. Such bills. So responsibility. Many financially smart. Wow.)

I feel bad because I spent money on myself at AwesomeCon the other week, and with that extra money I could take care of this no problem. I feel like I'm not allowed to spend any money on myself at all.

I'm planning on moving out, but I know if she doesn't get a job she won't be able to support herself if I leave. But I just *cannot* live there anymore. I'm nearly 25 and my mother is invading my medical privacy and getting angry when I try and assert financial control of my own life. I haven't told her that I want to move out yet. I'm not sure how or if she would retaliate.

So is this financially abusive, or just Kel's good ol' paranoia kicking in? I tried to google ""financial abuse of adult child"" but all that brought up was articles about elder abuse and how nasty adult children can be to their poor needy parents, which wasn't helpful.

ETA: I'm at work right now (and was when I posted this, oops!) but all of these comments are so, so appreciated. I have a fabulous support network both online and off, who are going to help me move some of my things out when my mom is out of town at the end of the month. (Mom's been bugging me to clear stuff out of my room for a while, so she's gonna look at that like it was all *her* idea. This serves my purposes quite handily.)

I'm going to push the refinancing angle for her so the payments are easier for her to deal with on her own. I'm also going to be asking the family friend who tentatively mentioned a part-time job for her a while back if that job is actually going to happen, giving mom enough money to maintain the place on her own in conjunction with her SSI, or if it's just wishes and unicorn dreams since this friend can be a bit flaky. I used to pay rent when I was in my internship, which was reasonable, but now that I am the breadwinner of the house she seems to think that paying the whole mortgage is all on me, which, nah. Y'all still got income, lady."

Before that my son was the only child mostly since my 8 year old lives with his father most of the year. We were doing time outs and spanking for discipline. When I say spanking, I mean hand smacks on the butt, outside of the pants and that was only when he was doing something really bad like chasing the dog with things.

 This was working great until the baby came and now spanking doesn't fazes him and he flat out refuses to sit in time out. I can't do much in the means of physically picking him up and moving him to time out since he's 30lbs over my weight limit and when I do pick him up my bleeding comes back for a few days. I'm exhausted and alone 5-6 days a week while my fiance is out of town doing an internship until August so it's up to me to discipline him. The problem is when I ask or tell him to do something he tells me no or when he tells me he wants to do something and I don't allow him he'll start screaming and throwing a huge fit and hitting. I ignore it for the most part but it's getting so bad that he's even starting to act out when I go to get him from daycare. His teacher had to carry him to the car kicking and screaming yesterday after he'd been throwing a fit for 20 minutes inside while I was trying to get him out the door when my one free hand. 


Clearly what I'm doing isn't working and I'm at a complete loss for what to change. Would he be old enough to understand the concept of a rewards system? Any ideas would be appreciated since my next plan of action is selling him to the circus for wine. "

A year ago I started reading this sub after going through a break up with somebody, who in retrospect, was needy, whiny, stressful, and not worth my time. The following is a reflection of the past year, with a few key insights on what somebody can reasonably expect to gain from applying TRPs concepts in their ""freshman"" year.

**HEALTH**

Improving my health and establishing the habits of an alpha has been by far the most difficult transformation to make. I signed up for a gym. For the first few months I honestly fucked around. I'd go for an hour every now and then, but more often than not, I'd justify NOT GOING because *&gt;&gt;queue male hamstering&lt;&lt;* I had a ""hard"" day at work and deserved a ""break."" A break meant rolling a couple fat joints and cozying up with the computer.

After those first few months I got serious about improving my health. I was having pins and needles issues in my extremities and regular nerve pain. This was because I was spending some 15 hours a day in a chair -- whether at work or at home. My mattress was shit because I didn't care about my surroundings. My food was shit because I didn't care about my diet. My lungs were shit because I was always on a ""break."" 

I purchased a standing desk for home, a new mattress that alleviated back pain (go foam!), started taking more walking breaks at work, and for the first time in my life, established a regular gym routine. Because of my poor health, I was rather skinny. I promised to gain 35 lbs over 5 months and then cut 10 lbs over 3 months. I subscribed to r/fitness and started reading their sidebar. I read u/gaylubeoil's posts and other posts concerning lifting and nutrition. 

My diet changed substantially in this timeframe. Turkey, chicken, brown rice, fruit, veggies, eggs, legumes, quinoa -- these foods took the place of pizza, take-out, Chinese -- basically junk food. I was going to the gym 4x per week CONSISTENTLY, taking a yoga class 1x per week, and finally had my weed habit constrained to weekend use only. The weight came easy and quick. And for the first time in my life, 8 months after reading TRP, I discovered I had biceps.

On a side note, the first time I woke up with a boner in the morning, I almost cried. My T levels had been so low for so long, I'd almost forgotten what it's like to wake up pitching a proud flagpole. 

There's still a slight layer of fat over my belly and chest, but my arms and legs have never looked better. I am cutting to try to shave the remaining fat, but I have never felt more energetic. The pins and needles pain is gone. A month ago a girl told me I was too muscular and she needed to feed me so I could look like a real man. Then we fucked.

**WOMEN**

I've slept with five women over the past year. One was an HB7 (easy going, liked to toke and chill) -- we were seeing each other for eight months -- she recently de-plated herself because she wanted exclusivity. What really happened is I fell off my alpha routine for a month or so, allowed myself to get close to her, and started acting beta. Nobody is willing to share a beta, but she was willing to share me when she perceived me as alpha. This was a good mistake to make though, as it has reaffirmed my dedication to myself and my sense of mission.

The second was an HB8 who I met at a party two cities away. We didn't fuck when we met, but then she visited my city and called me up one day to let me know she was in town. We hung out, I escalated, things went down. Here I learned a crucial lesson: if a girl wants to fuck, she will take a bus five hours and drive it straight up onto your dick. I made another mistake here though by showing too much interest afterwards through phone and text. We haven't really talked since.

3-5 were sixes or less; one of them is a friend from childhood and she's actually rather talented with ropes (I enjoyed the experience, just wish she was hotter). The other two I had beer goggles on for and regretted the experiences the morning after. Learn from Hawke34: do not feed the chub chubs.

I've made some key errors with all of these women, but I've been overwhelming sexually successful compared to the prior few years. Some notes in no particular order: cocky/funny and agree/amplify are two of the most useful tools in your arsenal. If you haven't internalized an alpha state of mind, just saying ""OK"" or ignoring shit tests altogether is perfectly acceptable. Avoid PUA gambits, she's heard the cube before. Online dating is only your friend if you're attractive and have good pictures, don't waste your time if your SMV isn't top 20%. Fail one shit test and more will come. Listen to your nature: if you want to grab her ass or twist her nipple just do it and laugh when she tries to counterattack. Never take what she says seriously, listen to her tone of voice. Remember to reward positive behavior -- over-negging is a legit issue (but it's better to go overboard in the beginning just so you can recognize it). Don't let your feelings cloud your judgement -- oneitis set me back a month or two.

More notes: always be escalating. If she holds eye contact from the other end of the room, she's DTF. If she adds you on FB immediately after meeting you, she's DTF. Fuck her friends hard enough and she'll want to fuck you after hearing the positive reviews (even though you're a ""player""). Always hold your frame. Avoid pointless debates, she's not going to be logical. If she pushes for exclusivity, just say no. Her opinion doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.

**SOCIAL**

There are two kinds of people in this world: those that will increase your SMV (social synergy), and those that will decrease your SMV (social entropy). In the past year, I've culled the most toxic individuals from my life, while at the same time, building relationships based on mutual benefits. Some examples:

 *SMV - entropy*

Let's call him J. J lived five min away. We would often smoke together. He worked an internship and often complained about how he needed a real job. I stopped hanging out with him when I upped my gym routine -- he would often text begging to hang out, so I invited him to the gym instead. Well, J ended up getting very depressed. His mother decided he should move home, and like a good little beta, he obliged. After all, he applied to six ""real jobs"" and didn't get any of them, so he was ""struggling.""

R. R is a drug dealer with an apartment she can't afford without help from her parents. She is a ""freelance makeup artist"" who doesn't get work and regularly complains about having to always look for it. R is extremely unhealthy and likes to spend the day on a high dose of ketamine. Her closest friends are also drug dealers and she likes to sleep around with whoever is interested. Cutting her out was one of the smartest things I ever did.

*SMV - synergy*

N. N is my best friend these days. We met a year ago, he recently lost fifty pounds and decided to move into the city. My apartment opened up and he asked to move in, I said yes. He's still in a half beta phase, sort of in the anger stage, but is on a mission to improve himself. I invited N to the gym, he signed up for a year. N has a car and loves to travel, so we now travel together regularly and go see music. He's asked if we can live together for the next few years, I've said yes because seeing him improve his body and health is inspiring to me, and it's a joy to adventure with him. He takes charge whenever there's a situation and has accepted ownership over his life.

H. H is an older fellow (42) who sells pot to the local college and works as a set designer. He knows massage as well, and has a number of personal clientele. The man worships his health and looks like he's 25. H likes to host parties at his large studio apartment that has a beautiful lawn that he takes amazing care of. There's a garden, an archery range, stone benches, and a small altar. The most eccentric and interesting people come to these parties. I like to hang with H every now and then, smoke a bowl, and shoot the shit. He's got great life experience and wants to be a helpful mentor in any way possible. He takes no shit and I saw him in action once when some ladies dog shit in his neighbors grass -- he yelled at her to curb her fucking dog and stop disrespecting the neighborhood. Alpha as fuck.

As you can see from the previous four examples, there are people who add value to my life and people who subtract. SMV neutral people exist, and are good for friending to build a social circle, but if you already have a developed circle they'll just waste your already precious time.

Some notes on social: when you fuck the women in your circle, the beta men will complain. Ignore them. Just last week my friend said to me ""Hawke34, you do not share the girls..."" -- it was playful and teasing, but there was a very real truth in his joke. I wanted to spit back ""Tim, the girls are right over there, go talk to them,"" but I just laughed. Read the 48 Laws of Power, and then read the condensed summaries of each law daily until you've memorized them. Men with high SMV typically are very hard working and value respect. Women with low SMV are your most dangerous social competitors because you aren't sleeping with them. Cultivate 5 good people in your life. Fuck social media, it's garbage. If you're not happy at a party, go home and hit the gym early in the morning. Always say less than necessary. Avoid talking about yourself seriously.  Drinking for the sake of drinking is ok every now and then, but hosting and organizing activities really earns the respect and trust of others. Keep your nails trim and cultivate daily hygiene. 

**PROFESSIONAL**

In the past year I've gotten two raises, a promotion, and I'm expecting another this fall. The first raise I got simply by asking for it, my supervisors praised my work ethic. It's amazing how much we undervalue ourselves: if you think you deserve a raise, and live in the U.S., look up the metropolitan numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and ask. The second raise I got with the promotion.

There's a lot of excellent career advice on Reddit and I don't really need to go to much in depth. The basic things: dress to impress, approach your work with stoicism, focus on solving problems rather than creating them. If the firm needs somebody to step up on a project, BE THE MAN. Perfect your craft every day. I've been very successful at a young age because when I'm working, I'm fucking working, or I'm developing the skills that will get me the next big raise.

Pick a career with hard skills, depth and advancement options. I started as a designer, now I'm doing motion and sound design, the next step is evolving 3D modeling into the workflow. There are great subs/online resources that should be bookmarked on your computer (if you're a desk jockey like me). Be curious. Try to improve work processes.

There's always going to be workplace politics. I've found that the easiest way to win at them isn't to ever directly engage, but instead become an invaluable member of the firm who can't get fired. If there's a conflict, it's easy to flex when you have the power.

--------

Well that's the year in review, gentlemen. Because of TRP I'm happier, healthier, richer, and on the path to becoming the man I want to be. Some general notes: when you start out, read the sidebar and the highest rated posts. Then stop by this sub every week or so. Ignore the anti-feminist posts as well as the ""AF/BB"" x-posts from r/relationships or r/deadbedrooms, this is a waste of time if you read the sidebar.

Areas I want to improve for next year: physical development (shaving that belly fat), building a soft harem (need to approach more...) without getting the itis. Disconnecting completely from social media and reading TRP less (applying more). Taking life less seriously.  

Thanks for reading."

I was hired after being frustrated with my job in my hometown in Utah. I was given a chance to move to a new state and start fresh living how I wanted for working for a promising startup company working with a distant relative that i'll call Ben.

Ben growing up has always worked in the fire service and that's all he knows. His Mom passed when he was 21 and his Dad disowned him for various reasons. He has constantly searched for help with lots of his issues that affect the workplace. All of the which have proven to not help.

**Rant**

I've been working here for almost three years now and I have had my absolute ups and down with this job and my family relationship with Ben. He's an asshole, manipulative, and down right an abusive person and I don't take any of it from him.

Many times I have had a sit down conversations about my employment with the company to see if 'I still want to work here'. I've invested so much time, into this company by going above and beyond what is expected of me. On some occasions absolutely nailing it, and some occasions absolutely bombing it.

Last October I had a vacation planned to go back to Portugal with a good friend to visit some friends that we had not seen in some time. During that time I was fired over email by Ben for not launching our online store in time and not having marketing material to use for it. Numerous times during the building out of the store I had expressed that I wanted to be removed from the project because I knew nothing about it, and did not feel comfortable with doing it because I am not a coder. I made it all work out but it was complete shit and I recommended for it to be sent out because it's not my profession. Long story short, Ben was not please about any of the result from my email announcing that it had been completed. When I landed in Portugal I was told I had two weeks to find a new job and coincidentally.... I was on vacation for two weeks... so thanks for the grace period.

My job role is a Graphic Designer, but that doesn't even encompass a fifth of the items that I do on a daily basis. I am the office admin making sure contracts are signed, dates and files. I am the janitor making sure everyone's trash is being taken out and the 3 bathrooms in the office are clean. I am the receptionist making sure everyone who steps into our office is quickly helped. I am the marketing specialist who pushes out all of our content to the internet. I am the graphics designer who makes all content for the company and for our customers. I am the IT guy who fixes everything when it doesn't work including for the 2 other companies in our same office. During fire season I sit in a trailer and make sure that everything is working and keep the coffee pot full, and I make sure the trailer is towed to location and setup.

When my co-workers (3 others) found out that I was canned they immediately were up in arms saying they would quit if I did not get my job back because I am instrumental to the company's success. During my vacation I didn't even waste a minute thinking about being fired, I enjoyed myself and my down time. I flew back to California not knowing what to expect, or what to do. I showed back up to work and thought, ""if I just keep working... maybe nothing will happen."" In the middle of my campaign for City Council I thought... well I am just going to have to figure it out. Here I am almost a year later still working and being paid. Ben has never explained why I was fired, and what I was allowed to return to work. 

Fast forward to now. It's still the same gruelling day to day work but we have an intern that is supposed to alleviate all my work but he's utter rubbish and I spend more time helping him with things he should have learned in college than I do finishing my work. 

My Day Yesterday --
Because we are in the middle of a company merger I agreed to head up trailer operations freeing Ben from anything. I sent him an email giving him a heads up saying I was going to prep our trailer for deployment due to a large lightning storm coming through the county. I setup an appointment for the company who maintains our copiers to come do a checkup in case we are deployed. I took the time to clean up, organize, and get us roadworthy. On my lunch break I invited our new city manager up to see the trailers, but the hangar that we went to show it's derelict condition and quickly get back to work. I later show up to the office after all has been done and wash my hands. I get pulled aside saying I took too long to work and there is more important things to be done.

I ended up staying until around 8PM so I could get a large jump on a project coming up and called it an evening very pleased with my full day. I get home and get an email from Sam on my city council email regarding how displeased he is with the city no taking the effort to see how the hangars look and said some rather rude things about myself, the city manager, and overall conduct of the city. Then I get a call from the alarm company at our building saying that it needs to be reset because someone triggered it and it has to be manually reset and I send a text to Ben, and two others asking if they can do it and I am told that it's my responsibility to care for the building. So I drive back to the office and reset it.

During the evening I responded to two medical calls for the fire department. Both were very aggravating because they are honestly pieces of shit doing drugs and are literally killing themselves. I got to bed roughly around 3AM.

8AM comes and I get numerous calls saying I have to open the office for the someone. I didn't get the call until my alarm went off at 8:30 and ran as quickly as I could to get to the office to let him in. Ben was there to cut me down saying that I dropped the ball and I needed to go home and look more professional for work. (I left without showering and my hair was messy.)

I come back and as one of my additional responsibilities is doing copies in the office for the public. I start on a project and establish a price for the customer and get to work. I get chewed out for not doing my 'other really important work' that was started the night before, and competed in the morning and I get a nasty email from Ben and the customer is attached to it saying that I have to prioritize my work better and was completely thrown under the bus.

I'm burnt out from doing everything and getting zero respect / appreciation for it. Conditions have been the same for 3 years and I have no reason to stay where I am not happy.

39dahu,1,2015-06-10,I (21 M) in peculiar relationship with her (20 F) and am unsure how to proceed.,love22jumpstreet,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39dahu/i_21_m_in_peculiar_relationship_with_her_20_f_and/,"Hey! 

So, we're both in college and we live on the same street as one another. 

During last year her house came over a lot and we drank and had fun and I had a girlfriend (20 F). We started to text a lot (we have a good amount of common life and career interests), and started to idk get a little handsy (not sexually) and I realized I was going into emotional infedelity. 

Eventually -- I took too long --, I broke up with the girlfriend not only for this reason, but also the relationship with the girlfriend was stagnant for a while. To note, my girlfriend and this girl were acquaintances too, as they went to high school together, but not in the same class.

Also, I didn't break up with her expecting to immediately get with the new girl I knew that it was no guarantee that it would occur.

So, anyway the last weekend of the summer occurs and the girl came over. It was about 3-4 weeks after the break up and the first time we hung out where I was single. 

Anyway, eventually at the end of the night it was just us 2 hanging out, and I kissed her. She kissed back -- but that was that. We talked some more and then she left. 

I tried to organize a dateish thing (more of a 1-on-1 dinner to a place we both wanted to go) but it was only about a month before school ended (we were Juniors) and with finals and other things going on we could never get it scheduled. While I don't think she was necessarily creating excuses not to go on the dateish thing  with me, I also don't think she was making it a priority to go on the date with me, if you understand what I'm saying. 

So, I left for the summer going to an internship about 3 hours away thinking that our chances for anything passed what we were were slim and I accepted that. We stopped texting and I was OK with it, come last week. 

So, last week she texted me for the first time in a while, and we got to talking again. I was going to the school to hang out with the roommates this weekend and she said she would be down to hang out again. I know as soon as I see her the feelings are going to come back and I'll try to pursue something. I'm getting excited about seeing her. I'll only be there for this weekend, and then will be gone for the rest of the summer except maybe one other weekend this summer.

 Is this futile? Does she just see me as a friend to play with her hands and hair when we get drunk? Idk, it's just an odd thing -- all of my buddies say we act like a couple when we are together because we tease each other a lot too.  

Come this fall she'll be moving off our street to another place 10-15 minute walk away where it'll be more unlikely to maintain what we have/had. 

Should I be more blunt about my feelings with her? I think we're at the point where I think she knows I like her, but maybe not. Maybe I should just tell her frankly, and see what she says. 

Thanks for responses! 

tldr; Met girl while in a relationship - liked her - ended relationship, not as quick as I should have - now unsure of future of current relationship with new girl."
39dopw,5,2015-06-10,Chatrealmer's Ridiculously Unofficial Movie Draft Update Memo (CRUMDUM) - Summer '15 - Week 10,MovieLeagueMike,DiamondClub,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiamondClub/comments/39dopw/chatrealmers_ridiculously_unofficial_movie_draft/,"Despite three new movies, not much changed this week in the Summer Movie League. Everyone held their position, so this may be an abbreviated CRUMDUM. In completely unrelated news, news which will in no way hamper our laser-like focus on providing insightful SML analysis, there's a basketball game on.

**1st Place - Amtrekker - $491M ($64M last week) - $100 Spent - 4.9 Multiplier**

Amtrekker pushes their lead to $53M on the strength of $29M from *Spy* and $23M from *Insidious 3*. *Spy* didn't hit projections of $35-$40M, c'mon take it to the hoop but with great reviews and *Ted 2* the only adult comedy until *Trainwreck* in mid-July, it should have a good run. And *Insidious 3* has the horror field to itself as far as the eye can see, which may help stave off the genre's typical quick burnout. And John and Brett will need strong legs from these two, another first quarter lead, let's see if they can hang on as their next film doesn't open until... the Winter Movie League. That's right, week ten of nineteen and Amtrekker is all in; their complete slate is out there, fending for itself, the comfort of the nest called *potential* left behind.

**2nd Place - GFQ - $438M ($21M) - $63 - 7.0**

It did better than *Queen's Boulevard*, but after a respectable $8M over Wednesday/Thursday, *Entourage* went on to fade a Cav injured, that's new over the weekend, dropping to a daily average just over $3M to end the five days at $18M. Still, after a quick Ari Gold-like tantrum where he fired half a dozen people who didn't work for him to begin with, Andrew realized that GFQ is hell yes that's a foul--he had more shirt in his hand than I did in every date in high school combined still comfortably in second place with potential big guns *Magic Mike XL* and *Paper Towns* still to come.

**3rd Place - Frogpants - $369M ($35M) - $72 - 5.1**

Frogpants' mid-May trio of *Pitch Perfect 2*, *Mad Max: Fury Road*, and *Poltergeist* pulled in $35M, drawing them gotta hit those foul shots $14M closer to second place. As that earning power winds down though, no, no good, Curry, the clock reads zero it's Brian and Scott's turn for an extended wait on their next film--seven weeks between *Poltergeist* and the July 1 release of *Terminator: Genisys*, when, you could say, they'll be back... to earning real money. You could say that, but don't. Friends will abandon you. Strangers will kick you. If you use an Austrian accent, expect a full-fledged beating. Many states will refuse to prosecute your assailants.

**4th Place - Night Attack - $126M ($20M) - $47 - 2.7**

We no longer have to coerce our interns to perform; a twenty-point lead! holy crap! they are in full on thespian mode. This week on *Night Attack Fourth Place Theater*...

""*Inside Out* is going to turn the standings upside down!""

""How does our movie put the first place team in sixth place?""

(pause) ""Well, not everybody goes upside down, just us.""

""You know that just moves us from fourth to third.""

(pause) ""Yeah, so... that's on the medal stand. What's wrong with that?""

""It's gonna have to make, like, $300M to get us there. Probably $400M to keep us there.""

(pause) ""You know, there are times I don't like you very much.""

**5th Place - DTNS - $98M ($37M) - $34 - 2.6**

Their first release, uh-oh, Curry found his stroke *San Andreas*, has done about as well as Jennie and Tom could have get in his face! hoped. $98M and a 6.1 multiplier after damn, he's on fire like 90's downtown Detroit on Devil's Night only ten days, possibly destined for $150M and 9.0+. Everything a twenty point lead is down to one? is going to plan, so we obviously expect DTNS how is this game not over? who's running the clock, Salvador Dali? to slip back into last place this week. Why? How about...

**6th Place - Cordkillers - $37 ($0.08M) - $16 - 2.3**

...Star-Lord vs Megasaur!^1 Two months of waiting oh my god, Dellavedova made that shot! comes to an end for Mulango and Kristi with their release of *Jurassic World*. Projected for a $100M+ weekend, Cordkillers' first he stole the inbounds pass! big movie of the season could propel them two spots in the standings in just three days. Like Amtrekker, Cordkillers bet on a three movie slate, rebound, Cavs! it's over! with two of the movies and eighty-four percent of their budget going into play in the next month. The tall--*Jurassic World*--and the small--*Minions*--will determine their fate.

^1  We would be stunned if this isn't an actual Syfy title.

39dsj1,12,2015-06-10,"My parents are taking this badly, what should I do next?",Faelynn_s,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/39dsj1/my_parents_are_taking_this_badly_what_should_i_do/,"Hi, everyone. I posted a bit ago about planning to tell my parents I was transgender, and writing a letter to them (https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/37ajxt/coming_out_to_my_parents_about_being_trans/). I came out to them last Friday, we sat down together and I read the letter out loud to them. They took it really badly. At first, I thought they'd be accepting, they hugged me when I broke down crying and told me they'd always love me, but since then they have been morose and asking me not to transition at any chance they have. 

They both haven't slept in days, have eaten very little or not at all, and seem very depressed. My mother took my hands two nights ago and begged me, on her knees, while crying, not to transition, and it was a hundred times more scary and heartbreaking than imagining her screaming at me. She asked me not to ""mutilate"" my body, that I'd be unhappy, and that she was scared about my future; she asked me to forget about my feelings and ""be happy"" the way I was. I tried to talk with her, to explain to her how I felt, but she broke down crying and began saying horrible things about not wishing to wake up again, about how I was ruining my life, my future, and everything I've worked for in my career. One in particular that hurt a lot was her explaining how difficult it was for her to become pregnant and have me; it involved years of therapy and insemination attempts, and she blamed herself for having gone through with it, insisting that the hormone medication she took had to be the cause of my feelings, and ended her venting by saying that ""maybe I should never have existed in the first place"". 

Dad has been taking it a little better, but he took me aside the day after I came out and asked me not to transition, too. He said it'd break my mother, break our family apart, and that he felt he'd have to intern her with a psychiatrist on a permanent basis if I did this, that she'd never recover. He told me that he didn't doubt trans people existed, and that he had read about the topic and understood it hurt me to present as male, but that he believed a truly strong person would bear it inside and hide it to protect their family. I felt like he basically told me right there to choose between my family's happiness or my own. He mentioned that they were concerned about me not being able to find a job in my career (electronics engineering), and that they'd both die and leave me behind with no means to sustain myself, and my college loans still unpaid because I wouldn't be able to work. I've tried to show them examples of successful people that happen to be transgender too, to give them hope that it's not as bleak as they think, but...they tell me they don't want to see anything related to the topic every time we talk, and act as though I had just told them I was going to die in a week. Mom actually told me that she had seen dad crying for the first time since my grandfather died the night after I told them, in bed, and that he had told her he would have preferred to hear his mother had died than to hear what I read to them.

I'm not sure how to handle this situation, or what to do anymore. I'm certain I want to transition, that I need to transition to actually be happy with my life someday, but now...how can I ignore my parents, too? I'm not financially dependent on them, and live on my own in USA; I'm visiting them over this month only, so I could very feasibly go on with transition without their approval. I feel horribly selfish, and confused, and scared of the consequences of any choice I make, though. It's horrible, no matter whether I choose to transition or not, I feel like I'm either breaking their hearts or breaking my own. I managed to persuade them to start seeing a mental health care professional, but mom came back in tears from the first session and won't tell me what happened. They want me to see a psychiatrist of their choosing in this country (Costa Rica), too, they believe that I can ""overcome"" these feelings with help from a professional, instead of seeing the therapist back in USA that is ""influencing"" me to choose to transition. I agreed to go, if only to try to calm them down a little. Throughout all of this, they keep coming into my room and hugging me while crying, telling me they love me, and then adding to that the ""please don't transition"" lines, and...I feel horrible for hurting them, I love them so much, too, but their words hurt me as well?

I guess...I just want to ask for advice from people here? They aren't terribly computer-literate, so it's hard to point them towards online resources, but they refuse to look at anything handed to them by me. Does anyone have any idea of what I should do? Is there even a right course of action anymore? "
39dtu0,3,2015-06-10,Help understanding Step motor driving with Arduino,steponmyline,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/39dtu0/help_understanding_step_motor_driving_with_arduino/,"To make a long story short I started an internship last week. I'm an undergrad CompSci student but I somehow landed this internship that would probably be better suited for an EE student, whatever, I have the job.

While I do have a little experience with Arduino, I am lost as to Step motors and there isn't exactly anyone else at the company that knows both the software and hardware side.

Basically I am building a 2-Axis gantry system to dispense some thermal paste on boards. I was given two stepper motors in order to do so along with a gantry already built that will arrive in two weeks. So basically I just need to figure out how to drive them on the software side.


My method was as follows:

  ` #include &lt;Stepper.h&gt; `

   *declaring the stepper and all that goes here*

`stepper.step(20); ` to move forward twenty steps and 
`stepper.step(-20) ` to move back twenty steps



However my boss says this is incorrect as I need to be giving the steppers both *step* and *direction*. After some tenuous google searching he recommended I use the AccelStepper library to fix this problem. After looking through this library I'm unsure how this will give me anything I need (distances are so small acceleration is useless) and how I am not giving it both *step* and *direction* in my original example code, I give it steps (20) and a direction with my negative/positive coefficient. 

Am I correct in my thinking? Is there a better solution neither of us have found? I'd love to understand not just that I'm wrong, but why I am."
39dv5q,0,2015-06-10,In light of recent discussion: a shitpost by Zach Jesse,[deleted],magicthecirclejerking,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicthecirclejerking/comments/39dv5q/in_light_of_recent_discussion_a_shitpost_by_zach/,"I had originally hoped that issues concerning my brutal rape of an unconscious stranger in her own apartment would not become as viral as they clearly have. I had not planned on making any public statement on the matter, fearing that doing so would only cause more people to hear about that time I raped someone. Unfortunately, I’m not longer sure that is a viable option. Assuming that Magic authors may make a point to talk about my circumstances (which is how I'm going to refer to the fact that I'm a rapist) over the coming days, I feel compelled to make some sort of statement on the matter.

For those unaware of what I’m talking about, I’m referring to the following:

I did really well at a magic tournament recently, much less importantly, I'm a convicted rapist.

Before I get to what I hope to accomplish with this post, I am going to take a moment to stress what it is not intended to accomplish.

The purpose of this post is to dismiss or minimize my conviction in particular, and to downplay sexual assault in general. For this reason, I do not plan on discussing in any depth or detail any aspect of the circumstances that surround the original incident. For instance, I'm not going to tell you that I received a sentence that was very likely shorter than the length of time it took my ""victim"" (that's such an ugly word) to physically heal after I brutally sodomized her.

The purpose of this post is not to act as an AMA (or “Ask Me Anything” to those unversed in Reddit-ese). I will not be answering questions or otherwise contributing to the commentary below. I don't really care about how you feel about what I'm about to do to you, as should be obvious by now. I’ll be frank; unless I am strongly urged to do so by my friends, it is unlikely that I will return to this thread to read the comments at all. In fact I'll leave you without a thought, as if you were slumped, unconscious, over the toilet in your house.

The purpose of this thread is to get you to like me. Don’t get me wrong. Your feelings, or the feelings of anyone that's not me, have not, and will not, enter into what I choose to do. Ultimately, however, if you remain unmoved, so be it. I'm going to do this anyway.

First and foremost, I hope to address the sole connection that I have heard people make between my conviction and my participation in Magic: the Gathering events: the issue of public safety. After all, there's no way that an unapologetic rapist being welcomed with open arms by this community could have any negative effects on anyone, most importantly me. To that end, the only way thing that I can think to do is to emphasize how successful and unaffected by consequences I've been since raping an unconscious stranger. 

I was 18 (a legal adult) in August of 2003 when the underlying incident occurred. I refer to it as an incident because I don't see it, and I don't want you to see it, as something that I did, but instead as something that happened to me. In April of 2004, I accepted a plea bargain offered by the prosecutor in this case. I had rejected his previous offers because the thought of being made to face even the most perfunctory of consequences for my actions made me sick; however, I ultimately accepted this offer at the advice of my extremely expensive attorney who encouraged me to do so in order to mitigate the risk that I face any real punishment. After suffering basically no consequences for raping someone, I am profoundly thankful for this advice.

The plea deal entailed pleading guilty to token count of aggravated sexual battery and serving a three month sentence. Its start date was delayed to allow me to finish my semester at UVA. If that sounds strange to you, it's important to know that I am very wealthy. Therefore, the criminal justice system showed me extreme deference in deciding when and how I wanted to go through farce of pretending to pay my debt to society. Although the woman I raped was unconscious for the entire event of my raping of her, I think it's important to point out that I would not have shown her anything close to that kind of deference is she had asked me. The sentence also allowed me to serve my time in a work release program so that I could continue the internship that my parents had set up for me, despite the fact that there were presumably a wealth of non-rapist candidates that could have been given that internship. To elaborate, I was allowed to leave prison every day and then come back when it was convenient for me.

In closing, I'd like to clear up some misconceptions. While I have expressed regret about my circumstances, I think it's important to point out that that regret is pointed only at the fact that I got caught. I am not sorry, and have not apologized, for raping this stranger and then using the threat of a protracted legal battle, during which my very expensive attorney would have certainly dragged her name through the mud, to blackmail her into asking for leniency for me, her rapist. Furthermore, while I do admit to raping, both vaginally and anally, a complete stranger while she was unconscious in her own home with such brutality that she was visibly injured afterwards, I want you all to feel free to come to your own conclusion, despite all other facts, that I am, in fact, innocent and that my rape victim, who you know nothing about, is actually a lying whore.

I have written this to hopefully convey that I have attempted to make amends by being extremely successful, as my parent's great wealth almost assured my of being.  If you chose to continue to dislike me, feel free to do so. If you’d like to shun or vilify me, I can’t stop you. Unlike my victim, I can't sneak into your homes while you are unconscious and inflict my will upon all of you. Although I would if I could. I will continue to do what I am doing, being an unapologetic rapist."

My dad decided to get addicted to fentanyl (he's an anestheseiologist) and lost his job. What this means for me is that he's refusing to pay for my last year of college because he can't afford my school + his rehab(it's something like 30k/3 months. My mom doesn't have much but is willing to pay for my living situation so I'm primarily worried about paying for school.

College currently runs around 32k a year for me. I'm one year away from finishing my B.S in Computer Science, have about 22k saved up (so I need 10k), am currently in an internship making 20/hour and I have the potential to get a job at 35/hour after. I'm not very concerned about paying off a 10k loan, but I need a way to get it, and in ~2 months. What is the most reasonable loan I can find for such a high price tag and with such a little amount of time. 

Thanks!

TL;DR Dad's a druggy, I need quick money"

I'm going to try and make this as coherent as possible but I might have a little bit of a difficult time. I've had minor issues in the past with anxiety, when I was in high school It was over grades and things of that nature. It wasn't too bad I would have a panic attack from time to time but all In all I could manage it.

Nowadays it seems to be getting worse. College was a big step for me and I'm thriving academically. The whole ""what am I going to do with my life"" question has caused me to have many sleepless nights where my heart would be racing and I wanted to pull my hair out. Many times I feel like I'm just breaking down but I talk about it with my parents every so often and that calms me down a little.

However I recently started an internship and everything has gotten worse. I get along great with my coworkers that's not an issue but I'm doubting and questioning myself at every possible moment. My heart is constantly racing. Even now lying in bed my heart is pounding in my chest and I can't control it.  I'm so nervous and worried and frustrated.

I hate living like this. I want to try an enjoy life and try to worry a little less but I don't know how. "

39e9oo,6,2015-06-10,"[RANT/VENT] Raised by Ndad and Nmom, both raised by Nparents. I'm getting out.",chroniccomplainer,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/39e9oo/rantvent_raised_by_ndad_and_nmom_both_raised_by/,"I apologize in advance for the length and rambling that you're about to read.

Like the title suggests, both my parents are N just like their parents. Ndad was the GC among his family of 3 kids, and his parents are wealthy people who do not talk to their 5 grandkids because why should they, we aren't their kids (Ngrandma's words ~5 yrs ago). Nmom is the only child of my disturbingly wealthy Ngrandmother. Though my parents come from wealthy parents, they went through a shit divorce and are now both broke because my mom got all his investments, cashed in, blew it on a house she couldn't afford. 

I'm 18F, and am off to college this fall. I've made my decision that once my 4 years are up, I am OUT OF HERE. Why? Because my parents make my life a living hell. Ndad lives with his girlfriend, her 7year old, and my 15 yr old sister. I live with Nmom who is moving in with Ngrandma in July due to her financial situation. Ndad does not want me living with him because I make everyone miserable. I've been in treatment for anxiety since I was in 3rd grade, I've got endometriosis which puts me in heinous pain all the time, and apparently I bitch too much about being in pain. Sorry, dad. I didn't choose this. I do not want to live with Nmom and Ngrandma, but I'm sensing it's my only option. I despise my Ngrandma more than anyone I have ever met in my life. At least my dads parents have the decency to leave us alone! Why do I despise this horrible woman? Many reasons, but 2 events stick out the most, and I think you guys will be amused/horrified by these.

Event 1: In August 2013, a childhood friend committed suicide while I was on a mission trip w/ Ngrandma's church (I go because we do construction in areas of disaster and I have friends there, not the religious aspect like some). I was a wreck all week. In August 2014, on the anniversary of his death, I was on another mission trip. I teared up a bit after seeing some Facebook posts dedicated to him, and Ngrandma told me I better stop crying because I was embarrassing her, and I shouldn't be sad because he wanted to die and I should be glad he got what he wanted. Ignorance must be bliss, grandma. 

Event 2: April 2015, Ngrandma took me to Paris for my 18th birthday. I had recently switched birth control to help w/ my endometriosis, and had a bad reaction while overseas. Did I get treatment while over there? No. Did I get to go to a pharmacy for painkillers? No. Why not? Because Ngrandma didn't spend all this money for me to mope around and waste her time. Instead, I spent my days in the hotel room with no room key or money to prevent me from leaving. Flowers in the Attic type shit right there. I had my doctors number, so I called her office from my hotel room to explain my bad reaction and she told me I needed to get to a hospital ASAP. So you know what I did? Called the front desk, had a key made, and marched my ass over to a hospital not 3 blocks away. GOD BLESS THEIR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. Wasn't given everything I needed but at least I got a prescription that my insurance would cover for some relief. 

I could write a novel about this woman, I really could. Having to live with her for the month before I leave for school, which Ndad is paying in full for (part of my parents' divorce agreement) and the summers that follow is driving me crazy and it hasn't even started yet. Have no fear, I have a plan! I have a job right now and my pay is divided into thirds. 1/3 goes to checking. 1/3 goes to long term savings. 1/3 goes to apartment savings. I figure that if I get an on-campus job, and continue to get jobs/internships over my college career, my savings plan should give me enough to move from the Midwest to either Seattle or Portland (I'm studying finance, I think I will be able to get a decent job so long as I work hard in school and with internships). RBN, wish me luck please! "

39eemk,0,2015-06-11,[19/F] My boyfriend [21/M] and I of a year broke up a few days ago. He cheated... three times...,jgiggelson,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/39eemk/19f_my_boyfriend_21m_and_i_of_a_year_broke_up_a/,"So my boyfriend broke up with me about 3-4 days ago and I had no idea why and I was devastated. I mean, I thought this was the guy I was going to marry. We had been together for a year now and he just went to New York for this summer internship.
Monday, he called me and told me why he broke up with me. He had cheated on me. This isn't the first time this has happened. It has happened twice before. The only reason I didn't break it off right then and there was because 1) he told me about it and seemed remorseful (any other douche would have not told me. PLUS he was crying the entire time he was telling me) 2) I had faith in the relationship and I thought he would change and 3) it was just a kiss every time (kissing someone else is cheating in my eyes).
I warned him ""three strikes and you are out"" and this was the third time.
He was drunk each and every single time and refused to take my advice of 1) not drinking and 2) not going out. Of course I can't control what he does, so clearly I was wrong to believe that he was actually going to change.
I had to cancel flights to New York because I had planned on seeing him. Not only is he upset but his mother is also upset.
But my real issue is that I wasn't the one who cheated, but he would get really jealous and overbearing when it came to me talking to other people. It felt like I was the one who cheated.
It is just tough. The relationship is over and I know I can't go back, but part of me still thinks that he is going to realize that he could change, but he is going to realize it when he is too late. 
I spend my days on Tinder just talking to people because my friends and family tell me the same shit and I just want someone to talk to; a fresh face that knows nothing about me and can just listen. 
I know I am doing the right thing. But I just want to know if there is a possibility that there could be a future with him someday? I want to be over it, but I don't. I want to move on but I don't. I want him to come back.... but I don't want to answer the door when he wants to see me. I don't know what I want. "
39elkj,0,2015-06-11,"Me (25F) with my brother (22 M) and his GF (23 F), a year ago the GF and I had a big blowout, and she may be resurfacing soon...HELP",LetsgotoThePig,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/39elkj/me_25f_with_my_brother_22_m_and_his_gf_23_f_a/,"Hi, relationship_advice, this may get long so you may skip to the tl;dr at the bottom if you wish. 

So relevant backstory: My brother used to live with me and then seemingly overnight, he moved in with a new girlfriend. They lived together for about 10 months before she backed out on renewing the lease after her parents offering her to live with them again....behind my brother's back. 2 months before the lease was up, his GF gave him 4 days notice to move out with no one to go to except for me. 

I had a 1 year old at the time and was finishing up school so I bargained with him. He could live with me rent free if he was my babysitter during the day. Monday thru Thursday, 8:30 to 1. After a few short weeks, his GF would come over to visit while he was home. However, it became more of a problem as she would stay from, literally, 9am to 11pm. Most days of the week. I didn't say anything because at the time they weren't causing any trouble so why make it an issue?

Then the fights came. They would go all day seemingly fine but when it was time for her to leave, as per her parent's curfew (and their rules for her living with them), she would purposefully stay later through God knows what logic...and she would call him on her way home and they would have absolute terrible fights. 

I started realizing something was off about her when she would seek other men's attention because my brother pissed her off, and one time she threatened suicide. While I was in class, the landlord called because my brother was yelling profanities. I threw down the gauntlet and told him that it stops now or he can't live with me anymore. And no more complaints were had but, they started leaving dirty dishes in the kitchen and when confronted they would fight about who was supposed to take care of the dishes! Ugh. 

Anyway, we were getting cramped so my husband and I decided to move into a larger place in the same complex. The move was hard. I was taking my classes and my husband was working 2 part time jobs so he was gone all day and night....so when I got home, I did most of the packing and cleaning and moving into the place. On top of taking care of my 1 year old in the process. I was so burnt out that once I got all the boxes in the new house and mostly unpacked, and after cleaning the old place so we could retain our deposit, I was burned out. My brother handled his own things during the move and got set up relatively quickly and spent the rest of the time gallivanting around town with GF. 

Shortly afterwards, I started my internship which turned into a full time job. So my brother was nannying Mon thru Fri 8:30 to 5. I had a pretty short fuse as a lot was on my plate. Brother fought with me about changing the mailing address because it was around his birthday and he wanted to wait until he got his b-day cards even though I told him everything would be forwarded, he still wouldn't hand over his key...so I yelled at him in front of his GF who started scowling at me...

Then, once again dishes became a problem as GF was using them and expecting Brother to clean up AGAIN, but this time she scratched up my cookie sheet and ruined the non-stick finish and I just had it and told him that I don't need more work to do and to not use the kitchen unless they're microwaving shit. GF didn't like that and angrily said she'd buy me a new cookie sheet. I told her that it wouldn't be necessary, I just don't want people cooking in the kitchen anymore. And she blew up getting mad that I apparently wouldn't let her rectify the situation, when that wasn't my angle at all. I wasn't even yelling at her, I just vented to my brother and then calmed down. He was the one talking to her about it anyway. 

So, one day, in the middle of my internship I get a text from her stating ""You told (Brother) that he didn't have to watch (Son) today. What do we do with (Son)?"" Long story short I immediately called Brother asking what was going on and that I didn't have a back-up and he tried telling me that we talked about it the night before but that's odd because that was the first time I was hearing about it. It just didn't sound like something I'd agree to the night before a workday...it resulted in a fight in which GF ended up taking it upon herself to take the phone and get involved and tell me that Brother can't be worked so hard, he needs a day off, I have a dirty house, I'm a terrible mother and she has been tempted to call CPS on me...amongst other things. All of the ""terrible"" things (i.e. running out of diapers and having no money to buy more) she witnessed were during the weeks that I was solely moving everything into the house and was burned out.

I immediately banned her from the house to which she hemmed and hawed about. She has since snuck in while I was at work and asked my brother for current pictures of my son because she's ""worried"" about him. For the record, I keep up on all his Dr. appointments, he's not neglected, we've since gotten everything out of boxes and organized our house. We regularly have family and friends over. No one else is worried about my son. He's very loved and very healthy. I ended up kicking Brother out for letting her come into my home after not only threatening my family but after I banned her.

Now, a year has passed and she's started getting Brother to contact me about some things she's apparently left at my house...they're stupid things like a pair of shoes or headbands that I've long since given away. She's started adding family members on FB and has been viewing my profile. 

Tell me I'm just being paranoid but I don't want her drama in my life...is there anything I can do? Do I just drop it and let it roll off my back? 

**TL;DR**: Over the past 2 years, my brother found a GF who appears to be somewhat crazy and we got into a fight where she threatened to call CPS on my family and is now resurfacing asking for things that are of no consequence that I don't even have. I don't want her in my life, I don't want to deal with her drama. WHat do?"
39ev3x,3,2015-06-11,"Me [18 F] with my friend [18 F], talking to her always depresses me and I'm not sure what to do about it.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39ev3x/me_18_f_with_my_friend_18_f_talking_to_her_always/,"I've been friends with Cathy for several years now. A rather large part of our relationship has been her seeking advice regarding her problems or just generally venting about her life. I'm not naturally inclined to talking about myself, and she definitely is. Lately, this trend has intensified due to her poor grades, lack of a boyfriend, weight gain, and general self esteem issues. In response to this I've tried to help her in small ways, such as helping her find an internship this summer which she initially seemed to be enjoying. Today, however, she told me that she finds it too challenging, which scares her, makes her doubt herself, and apparently adds to her existing self esteem issues.

I should add that we've definitely had fun times together, and I don't want to cut ties altogether. 

In general I'm a pretty happy and optimistic person but I've found that whenever I've hung out with her recently, I come away quite sad. Mostly because any time I try to introduce some more substantive conversation topic, it always ends up circling back to how pathetic she feels her life is, which makes me in turn consider the problems in my own life. 

I even suggested therapy. She insisted that she's not depressed but is simply sarcastic and has a poor attitude. She told me that others have told her that she's depressing to be around, and I fear the consequences of me - one of her closest friends (she's referred to me as her best friend before) - reinforcing that. I suggested that voicing negative thoughts may magnify them, but I'm not sure if she really got the hint. 

What should I do? I need to safeguard my own mental health, but I want to help her as well. I'm not sure that it's my place to outright suggest that she's depressed though. 
   
**tl;dr**: A friend of mine is either depressed or just has an extremely negative attitude, and I always come away from conversations with her in a bad mood. Starting to feel both like a therapist and someone who needs therapy myself. Not sure what to do. "

From January to April, I was having difficulty coping with the programme from January to April because it was hard juggling internship and stronglifts. Since my internship ended, I've been doing stronglifts seriously since 1 month ago. At the start of the year, my weight was 69kg and now my weight is 74kg. Not sure whether that's an excellent or poor gain. Everyday I've been eating 1800 calories and tracking my calories using MyFitnessPal.

Since I started the programme a month ago, I could some changes in my body like my thighs and arms started to get thicker and my chest is not as flat as before. It's nice seeing some progress but is the progress as fast as I wanted it to be? I would say it's a no especially my chest. It still seems flat and whenever I wear my shirt, my chest still looks flat and I could see my belly.

Considering my visible belly when wearing a shirt and constantly seeing those fitter and leaner gym goer (They're dragon boaters fyi), it makes me want to go on a cutting mode. I want to quickly lose my belly fat as it's quite discouraging to see my belly whenever I sit down. My belly fat quite thick when I sit down. I could just pinch it near the belly button and it'll be like 2-3 cm thick.  So I thought I'd start swimming 3 times a week as my cardio workout.

Looking at how I want to bulk and be more muscular and at the same time, I want to cut to lose my belly fat. (I envy those with flat tummy with visible abs :( ), I am starting to get confused. I am not sure whether should I bulk or cut first. Any advice?

My current stats:

height: 1.77 m

weight: 74 kg

TDEE: 1800

**edit:** 
Since my workout days are Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, should I swim and or HIIT on my rest days? 

Also, what are some recommended abs exercises? Currently I am doing 4x30 seconds of plank with 1 min break in between. So that's 5 minutes for plank. And also 1 set of crunches till failure."

39g0mo,0,2015-06-11,"23 w/ credit debt, student loans, and no job. What's the best way to pay it off, if that's even possible?",itsmattlee,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39g0mo/23_w_credit_debt_student_loans_and_no_job_whats/,"Hello, redditors. I'm coming to you because I've seen someone of the wisdom a few of you possess when it comes to giving advice.

I've lived a very inexperienced financial life, and it's now coming to bite me back. 
So I'm in a bit of debt with no job anymore, and no real way of making an income. The stupid 18 year-old me decided to get a credit card, and since then I've only been recklessly spending, bringing forth the spawn of satan they call ""debt."" I've managed to make my minimum payments, if not more, on time, and haven't missed a payment to date. Unfortunately, that season of having money to pay off my CC debt is coming to an end. I no longer have a job, and my credit debt sits somewhere around $2,000-$2,500. I know it might not be much to a lot of you, but being a guy with no source of income, paying it off seems impossible. I used to be in the ""sneaker game,"" so buying and selling J's and other sneakers was a solid way of making money. Granted I think I spent more on myself than I did trying to profit from it. I no longer have any more shoes to sell for money. Having been out of that game, as well as bring jobless, it only leaves me with a slowly shrinking checkings account.
As for student loans and whatnot, that's something that'll be handled in it's own time. I'm still in school, so my loan payments right now are deferred(?). That's not much of a worry...for now. I'm more worried about the here-and-now, which is my credit debt. I would say I have a couple months left before I'm completely drained of all my money. I'm freaking out!
I also have a friend whom I've borrowed a hefty amount of money to pay off my CC debt at one point. The card balace was zeroed out, but in time, I've managed to raise it back up, making it no different from where I started. The only difference is that now I owe that friend a little money still. Now I'm sitting on that number mentioned above AND I now owe my friend some money still. I've somehow managed to make a horrible situation worse. He says I can pay him back slowly because he has an idea of what my situation is. 


So yeah, got any pointers on how I can handle this situation? Again, I'm aware that there's no money coming in for me, thus making my situation hard, if not impossible, to resolve right now. I just want to clear my credit debt...right now would be a good time for Tyler Durden to blow up these credit buildings.

Second note: I don't really care about my credit score and all that jazz right now. According to soruces, my FICA score is around 750-760. I'm taking that as a good thing. Anyway, like I said, I'm not worried about my credit taking a hit. I just want this balance to be gone. I hate living with the thought that I owe thousands of dollars, and there's nothing I can do it about it.

Side note: I know there are some of you guys who are &lt;23 years old with a solid job, salary, etc. Sadly for me my parents spoiled me as a kid, never really let me live independent, and babied my my whole. I've been given allowances for no reason when I was younger, so money, to me, was something that just fell out of the sky. 
I'm also a little hesitant to go to my parents to ask them for help because, well, it's a bit embarrassing, and I don't want to burden them.

Sorry for the long post, and thanks for reading.

Edit: I forgot to mention that finding a side job is really hard for me. It's not that I don't want to work, but more of the fact that I can't. With full-time school, and being a full-time pastoral intern at my church (fri/sat/sun I'm at church for every living minute), finding a job is hard to imagine. That's actually one of the reasons why I'm having a harder time than I should. I'd be working my butt off over the weekends if it wasn't for my future becoming a pastor."

I have a car, but it is a piece of crap and I don't know if I want to try to make the drive to Tampa with it, so the closer I can be, the better. Does anyone know of any other reliable websites that I might be able to find a room? I don't know officially what I will be paid yet, but I doubt I will be able to afford more than ~$600 per month. Thanks for any and all help and advice!"

39hcbk,15,2015-06-11,Finding a gym rant.,Radcliffes_Asshole,gainit,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/39hcbk/finding_a_gym_rant/,"Not really looking for any advice, I'm just pissed about this and none of my friends really lift.

I never realized how fucking lucky I was, the last two years, to have close and free access (with my tuition) to all the gyms on my college campus. The main gym is massive - 5 cages, 5 more racks you can squat on, tons of benches and incline benches and weights and all kind of shit. I've never taken my fitness very seriously - always been ""skinnyfat"", essentially. Underweight, but not much muscle on me. Getting in shape has always been something I'll do next week, or next month, or after this midterm, or this summer.

Well... this summer finally came, and I can't find a fucking gym. I moved about an hour away from my college town for an internship. The first week I was here, I actually found a gym I loved, but it was just too damn expensive. It was a training type gym, not a do your own thing gym. They wanted $130 a month for three classes, or $170 to do unlimited classes, and I just can't justify spending that much money. I've been searching endlessly for another gym, but they just don't seem to exist.

I don't want a wall of cardio machines with a 15 foot TV. I don't need a ""women's only"" area so that I don't feel intimidated (not a woman, but that shit just seems unnecessary). I don't need someone to watch my kids. I don't want to pay a 80 dollar signup fee in addition to the monthly cost. I don't want to do a year long membership when I'm only here for two more months. I just want a gym that's cheap, that has plenty of racks and benches and weights, and that's close to my house and work so I can go there without wasting a ton of gas. Apparently, that's just too much to ask for.

Fuck, man. I was really excited about gaining some weight this summer and I've been putting a lot more effort into eating more (still don't track my calories but eh), but at this rate I'm just gonna get fat if I keep eating like this without finding a gym.

39hswu,1,2015-06-11,Please help me understand the tax implications of the differences in the two IRA's.,PokemonDoodler,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39hswu/please_help_me_understand_the_tax_implications_of/,"Howdy PF,

I am currently in college and working in an internship and I'm starting to read more about saving for retirement and I would like a little clarification that I haven't gotten from the wiki yet. 

After I graduate we will use a hypothetical salary of 100k for ease of math if any seems to follow. I know I need to be contributing to my company 401k because the company match is very rewarding and practically free money. 

Once I max that out (I believe it's $5,000 year) where should I begin to save my money? I've read that contributing to a traditional IRA for someone who has a high taxable income is more beneficial due to being taxed at a lower rate once you retire because it assumes that you are going to be withdrawing less than you currently make. But a Roth IRA is good for someone who will withdraw at a higher rate than their current salary. 

For the hypothetical example let's say I want to retire with 150k/year withdrawal. Is there a way to contribute to a Roth IRA now since my salary is less than my withdrawal amount and later in life when I am making more than the 150k should I change my deposits to a traditional IRA to prevent being taxed on my higher income? 

What determines if I am considered a high earner and should deposit to a Roth IRA or am I still a lower income tax bracket and should add to a traditional IRA?

Thanks for the help and please correct me if I've said anything incorrectly or misunderstood something."

39hz5m,2,2015-06-11,My so-called high school life.,Snucka14,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39hz5m/my_socalled_high_school_life/,"My high school experience is something that has always bothered me.  My family was rather prominent in the local political scene, and my grandfather was the mayor of our town for 16 years (before I was born through my fifth grade year).  Around my sixth grade year, he was indicted on public corruption charges.  Within 18 months, he was in prison – where he would stay for eight years.  He lived next door to us, and we were close, so this was especially hard on me.  I was also really into politics as a kid, and the conviction pretty drastically changed our family’s involvement in that world.  We found out how many of our friends were actually just “political” friends, and our social circle got a lot smaller.  Plenty of people did support us, but any chance of my actually being involved in local politics ended.

Near the end of grade school, I started to distance myself from the friends I had in childhood.  I went into total self-preservation mode, which was aided by my family’s “us against the world” mentality at the time.  It’s hard to fault them for that, since our name was in the news a lot and fighting the federal government can make one feel very helpless.  Unfortunately, all of this happened right when I was entering high school. I don’t specifically remember when things changed inside of me, but I know that by the time I got to high school I had no friends, and almost no social interaction with people my age.  The shame and sadness that I felt stopped me from ever feeling comfortable letting people into my world.  The people involved in the trial became like characters in our lives, and most of them were villains.  I started to see the world in that light, and so I avoided getting close with anyone. 

I was not involved in many extracurricular activities in high school, and the one or two I did partake in were not helpful in expanding my social circle.  I don’t recall ever hanging out with people after school, going to sporting events with them or going to school dances/events.  At lunch, I would sit with different groups, but I always felt out of place and never really had a relationship with anyone.  I’ve always had a really sharp and sort of intellectual sense of humor, so while people probably thought I was funny, I never related to them enough to make them comfortable laughing with me rather than at me.  Because I normally dealt with people older than I was, my sense of humor was always more geared towards them.  My peers, if they noticed me at all, picked on me and made fun of my social anxiety.  Strangely, I didn’t rebel or show any outward signs of distress.  I worked, got average grades and stayed home (when we weren’t visiting my grandfather in prison 500 miles away). 

Those four years shaped who I was for a long time.  I feel like I missed out on a real rite of passage by not having a social life in high school.  At times, I feel like it’s a fatal flaw in my personality that I can never fix.  Looking back, I don’t know how I got through high school without losing it.  I guess I was being strong so my family wouldn’t worry about me.  College wasn’t much better, but I was able to get an internship which turned into a full time job. I had “work friends” there, but  I still never really addressed the issues that my high school years caused and I ended up getting into legal trouble for some of the coping mechanisms I developed.  I lost that job, and essentially had to start over at age 30.

I have since gone through a lot of internal turmoil, therapy, etc. and have a pretty good grasp on how I can avoid sliding back into those patterns.  I realized, among other things, that my childhood religious and political beliefs were not actually mine, but my family’s.  I am now very comfortable with and open about my thoughts on those topics, and that makes a big difference.  I was able to make friends after college, mostly thanks to the internet and the live music scene.  A lot of the friends I have today, I owe to that.  Even my girlfriend, who I’ve been with for seven years now, came into my life through that group.  So, while I am doing OK now, there is always this feeling that I’m somehow forever broken because I had hardly any social interaction from age 12-22.  It’s just such a formative time, and it was almost a total loss for me.  Anyway, I’ve never written all of this out before… so, thanks for reading.

**TL;DR**… I had no friends in high school and I'm afraid it fucked me up for life."
39i6cu,1,2015-06-11,An Ode to the Past Four Years,RPI_Grad,RPI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/39i6cu/an_ode_to_the_past_four_years/,"Scientists said that time is relative.

As we studied concepts in physics lab, we learned that time is relative.

Now we are the scientists. Where did the time go? 


&amp;nbsp;

I knew the day would eventually come: four years – no more, no less – after that first day as a resident of Troy, New York. Four years after meeting classmates for the first time, figuring out how to navigate campus, joining a club, making friends, taking that first exam.

Wasn’t it just yesterday that I learned how to spell “Rensselaer?” Now, this word is staring back at me, written in a fancy font on a piece of paper. This document, supposed to represent the “knowledge and thoroughness” that has been imparted by this institution of higher learning, will never come close to embodying the intangible lessons learned over the past four years. 

These real world lessons were learned both inside and outside the classroom. Leadership. Accountability. Responsibility. Decision making. Should I change my major? Should I become the president of a club? Will I be successful as an intern? How do I become a better public speaker? How do I balance academics and a part-time job? 

RPI has taught me to keep asking questions, to keep learning, and to never give up.  

&amp;nbsp;

Saying goodbye is always the hardest part. To whom should I say “goodbye?” To whom should I say “see you later?” Friends and classmates are now scattered like seeds to different corners of the Earth, ready to take root and grow outside of the campus community. 

There have been many “lasts:” the last time enjoying the gorgeous sunset over Troy, the last time studying in a favorite study spot, the last time eating at a favorite restaurant downtown. Now, it is time for many “firsts:” first day of grad school, first day of a real job, first opportunity to explain what it feels like being a graduate of RPI. 

Sure, you can come back to visit, but it’s not quite the same, and never will be. 

Enjoy your time at RPI. It may just be, relatively, the best four years of your life.

I've never lived in a city and am not finding anything reliable, but need to figure this out soon so I don't get towed. 

Basically I can't afford to pay anything expensive for weekend parking on top of what I'm already paying. Is it free without a sticker? I'd love any advice or references to give me reliable information. 

Thanks very much, I look forward to my first city experience

My car is completely paid off, so I don’t have any debts from that. Insurance is minimal( just under 60 bucks a month) since it is an older car, but it is in good condition and I take decent care of it. I have no plans to replace it in the near future.


My student loan payments are roughly 400 dollars a month right now, and I plan on making the payments while I build my credit so that I can consolidate the student loans next year with hopefully less interest. The reason I haven’t done that yet is that my credit score is low. (I didn’t get any credit cards until I was hired full time for my own state of mind)
I currently live with my parents, but there are apartments that are right across the street from my job that I will be moving into at the end of June when they are finished being built. This will change my commute from a 45 minute drive to a 10 minute or less walk. The apartment is 720 a month, but the lowest cost for one bedroom apartments in my area is around 650 and in a not so great area. I drive a gas guzzling SUV, so the gas costs of changing from my home to these apartments is pretty much the difference in cost between this apartment and others in neighborhoods further away.

I have minimal credit card debt, just 150 bucks that I will be paying off from a purchase next month.

I have no real emergency account to speak of, but I don’t live paycheck to paycheck and I keep a decent buffer of money (roughly 1k) in my bank account above the costs that I have for the month. This will continue to get bigger, but I have been putting most of my checks into paying some money I owed my parents for various college expenses. Those debts are done now, so I don’t have those either.


My company offers 6% matching 401k and has since I was an intern. As of today, I have 4k in my 401k, and I am meeting the matching but not going further.

I developed a budget that shows me saving roughly 600 a month from my paychecks. This will be going into a couple things, the first is developing an emergency account, and the second is paying for a wedding sometime next year.

I do pay for a Netflix subscription and a Kindle Unlimited subscription which I guess could be eliminated but I don’t think I am in a place where I need to be on a very tight budget.
 
I have estimated some of the costs in my budget, because I can’t really know them until I move in and begin making payments, but I think I estimated things at least in the ballpark for the costs.


Item | Monthly Payment/Budget
---|---
Total Post Tax Income  | $2725
Student Loans Payment | $391
Car Insurance | $57.50
Apartment Payment | $720
Utilities Estimate | $125
Water Estimate | $50
Internet Bill | $119
Food,Gas,Dates,Miscellaneous Costs | $660


 
Leaving me around 600 a month of a buffer/savings
 
So with all of that, and I apologize for all the text. Do I look like I am in good shape? Am I missing some glaring problems/mistakes that may not have occurred to me?
 
Tl;DR Just graduated college, about to move in to first place. Making 50k a year, matching 401k, 600 bucks of savings per month on top of expenses. Am I being dumb?"

39isra,7,2015-06-11,"I'm an adult, and I wish someone would tell me I'm doing a good job. [Warning: Really Long]",CapricornWithButter,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39isra/im_an_adult_and_i_wish_someone_would_tell_me_im/,"As it stands, I am currently in school in an attempt to finish my bachelors; in due time, I will pursue my masters  as well (probably during an internship). At the moment, due to not having parking passes for either of the cars and our new place being much further off campus, I take my sister to and pick her up from school so that she has a reliable and safe mode of transportation. As her classes sometimes end later or earlier without warning, I usually have to modify my plans in order to accommodate the lack of consistency in her school schedule while still trying to do my own school work and getting the apartment clean and situated. I am accustomed to working anywhere from 24-32 hours a week at a part-time job in addition to school in order to assist my parents with the expenses that come with them giving us a place off-campus to stay. I'm used to doing this by providing myself with the funds needed to keep gas in my car, cover smaller bills such as water or cable, and rely on them less for non-essentials. I will be starting a new part-time job soon (at the end of the month), and plan to put some of that money away toward rebuilding my savings, which I had to empty out in order to cover a parking ticket that was completely my fault because I was in a rush and wasn't paying attention.

Over the years, I have made sacrifices for my family and friends, given up time sleeping to help them work through problems or assist them in some way. I have damn near lost my childhood best friend because, in addition to just plain being busy, I'm pretty sure she's been avoiding me because she knows I want to be more than friends, although I have on many occasions put that aside to assist her with whatever guy problems she is having and would do it again if it meant just being able to sit down and watch TV together and talk about school and our futures.

I take on the  financial responsibility so our parents don't have to sacrifice so much. That's why I worked so hard to find a job, and although it doesn't begin until late June, it's something.

 In  August, if I hadn't screwed up on my grades, I would be going into my first year of engineering school and would have almost completed my physics degree. I spent all my time studying and making good grades so I could get into a good school that I ended up screwing up and dropping out of anyway and having to transfer to the same school my sister is in, where she is a few years behind and watching her friends graduate and move on with their lives.

I just turned 21 in September, and my sister will be 23 in a few days. Of the two of us, I am better with finances and time-management, but I can also be a bear to live with because I need a clean and spotless place to live in order to function. I'm diligent about my school-work, and as of writing (11 June 2015), I'm in the middle of finishing a class that I could not finish during the Spring semester due to being ill.

My sister and I recently had to move apartments due to safety concerns. During this process, it ended up falling on me to turn in the 30 day notice to our previous land-lord, negotiate the pros and cons of the places we were looking at, call in to the place we finally chose to tour it  and have our parents tour it, call in to double-check the upfront payment, pay the final rent on our old place, begin the process of cleaning up the old place and moving into the new place, turning in the old set of keys, and having my stuff moved to the new place quickly (so that when our parents came, there would be less for them to do). The only things I could not do were pick up the boxes (which I promised I would do the next day, but our parents ended up delegating that to my sister because I couldn't do it that day) and get the cable moved over (because it's in my sister's name).

My boyfriend and his brother also had their wisdom teeth removed during this time, and I had to split my time between helping my boyfriend recover (because their mother had her hands full with his brother and his father couldn't take off) and get my own stuff together, preventing me from doing my school work and having to put it off.

All of that is to say this: I am unhappy with my life. I know if I said this to my family, they would respond, “Why are you being ungrateful? Your parents are paying a lot in order for you and your sister to have a place to live and go to school. Why aren't you happy? You should be thanking them instead of complaining.” I understand where they're coming from, but that just doesn't factor in. I am unhappy with my life. I understand the sacrifices my parents make; I understand what it takes for them to support my sister and me.

And knowing all of that just makes it worse. It makes me more unhappy because I know I'm making their lives harder by being unemployed, by being in school, by not giving them tangible justification or compensation for their hard work. I'm also unhappy because I can rarely afford to “go out and enjoy life”, as my mom says, because what funds they put in my account go toward necessities, and it's rare that I have extra funds or time to go out on a date (and I'm grateful for my boyfriend being understanding of this, as his siblings and grandmother became his priority after high school due to parental absence, which prevented him from going to college and has him in a low-paying job that doesn't pay nearly enough for how many hours he works). I'm unhappy because I sacrifice time and energy and patience and my feelings to benefit the people around me, and I feel like only my boyfriend notices and appreciates it. 

**tl;dr:** Despite my sister being older, I am shouldered with more responsibilities because I made an effort to improve my time- and money-management skills so that I could be prepared for life. I offered to bring my sister to school so that our parents could save a couple hundred dollars this month because moving is expensive. I split my time between helping my boyfriend's mother take care of him and his brother after surgery. I try not to ask for extra funds for dates or to go out, which means I'm always strapped even when I am working because most of my funds go to necessities. I am infinitely blessed to have parents that can provide for two young adults who are trying to fix their lives, and I am grateful for their support. But I feel like all of my hard work is going unnoticed and has become simply expected of me, and there is no way for me to express my unhappiness without being viewed as “ungrateful” “spoiled” or “selfish”."
39iswx,14,2015-06-11,"So after years of making other's miserable, my deadbeat brother is succeeding in life and I am sitting here alone, sick and working a dead end job. I hate life.",orbitalpottery,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39iswx/so_after_years_of_making_others_miserable_my/,"I have younger brother. To say we do not get along would be an understatement. We're polar opposites, with the exception that we are both gamers. He loves soccer to the point of obsession, I can't stand watching sports, as it bores me to tears. I love reading, he doesn't even read comics. I love science, he failed biology and chemistry 101  repeatedly and was eventually forced to attend a different school as his grades were too bad.

Now I would have felt sorry for him back then, accept that he's an asshole. He's confrontational, aggressive, rude, bullied and beat me as a kid, chose shitty friends, and  finally,as a teenager, he almost got our dad sued for fraud. How? He sold stuff online he didn't own and he did it under our dad's name. Fortunately, a friend alarmed me before the police got involved, and somehow I managed to defuse the situation by paying for everything. He never apologized for it, never even talked about it. He never reimbursed me. 

A few years later,  stuff started to disappear from our local gaming store. The Owner and I are pretty much convinced that he stole it, but we cannot prove it, since the store doesn't have CCTV. At that point my brother, Me, and the Owner had been friends for years. He was banned from the store, and even so he was given the chance to apologize and make amends in light of said friendship, he never even said sorry, in fact he just broke off contact with the owner and just acted as if nothing had happened. He almost got me banned too, but luckily the owner believed me when  I told him  that I had nothing to do with it (which is the truth). Otherwise I would have lost the majority of my friends I had at that point.

Shortly thereafter my mom kicked him out. He was 22, still living at home and my mom just lost it. Several times he had come home wasted in the middle of the night, barfing all over the bathroom. Another time he had sex with his then-girlfriend in my parent's bed. The list goes on. But he found a flat of his own and my mom forgave him.

Then there was the time when he decided to break off contact with our parents for no reason at all. He just stopped calling and never answered any calls. My mom almost had a nervous breakdown, as she started to imagine what might have happened to him. Again, I calmed down my mom and after several weeks I somehow got him to call her. Again, he never apologized.

So why am I listing all of this. Because two weeks ago this fucking asshole got a job with a starting salary of almost 40.000 $ with a great company. He has a drop gorgeous girlfriend who's on her way to become a teacher. Apparently she loves him? I want to know what  she sees in him. 

NO, he didn't change. He is still the same idiot who hated school, who made people miserable and who never admits any wrongdoing, even if he is caught red-handed. He still hasn't apologized to me, my parents or my friends. Nothing  about him is different.

Oh, and the kicker? 

I had to drop out of college. Not because of my grades (I aced my final examen), but because I couldn't do the required internship. I called dozens of companies. Not one was interested in hiring an intern. Mind you, my major was environmental engineering, not philosophy.  I was diagnosed with glaucoma and allergic asthma. the glaucoma drug makes the asthma worse . Since  I am a college drop-out, I now work in a call center answering questions that are so moronic that half the time I just want to ask the caller if his/her call is a prank. The other day I talked to someone who had used a cactus as a dildo. Yes, I am serious. Someone took a cactus and shoved it up his bum. Yelled at me and wanted to sue someone for his suffering.

I have no girlfriend. I hate my job so much, that I want to scream every morning. I am poor. I am sick and there is no cure.  

AND MY SCUMBAG OF A BROTHER IS GETTING EVERYTHING IN LIFE. FUCK. THIS. SHIT.

39iziw,3,2015-06-11,Any suggestions for how to get a medium or big law without OCI?,philthadelphia,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/39iziw/any_suggestions_for_how_to_get_a_medium_or_big/,"Based on my grades, chances are I will not get too many interviews through OCI. How can I maximize my chances of getting a medium or big law firm job that could lead to an offer for 2L summer (and hopefully a post grad offer)?


Here are my specifics (top 25% of the class, very well respected regional law school in T50, federal 1L summer internship), but I am posting this for the many others who will also likely strike out at OCI. Because of my status, I still have a chance at landing something at OCI, but that chance is quite slim.


From what I gather the most important thing is networking. Meeting people, trying to make a decent enough impression that they would be willing to talk to me, and trying to develop a relationship. Along these lines is to try to figure out any friends or family (if possible) that can lend a hand in introducing me to people and/or putting in my resume somewhere for review.


Any other suggestions? Anyone here strike out at OCI and still land something in big or medium law? If yes, how did you do it?


Any help is appreciated!"
39j57l,4,2015-06-11,I got an offer from a dream job but I'm more nervous than ever due to a past job experience. Need reassurance,Sheehan7,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/39j57l/i_got_an_offer_from_a_dream_job_but_im_more/,"Last year I put in my two weeks at a retail job because I got a new office job at my college. However just 2 days before I was about to start the office job (and now being unemployed) they told me I couldn't work there because I was ineligible due to me having loans and they don't give work study jobs to loan students. I was pretty devastated and had to lie when people asked me how it was because I was embarrassed. 

Fast forward to know I have a decent retail job but I applied for an internship (paid) at pretty much my dream company and they called me and that they loved me and that I got the job! I have since signed and scanned back the written offer (still an at-will employee) and I start in a week. I gave my weeks notice at my retail job and they are PISSED because they don't have enough staff now. 

I'm now terrified that what if the offer I got some how ends like the last one did and I'm out of a job. I can't even use this retail job as a reference now as I doubt they will give me a good review. 

Basically I have an irrational fear because of what happened last year and am terrified it will happen again (even though I know that's deeply unlikely). Help reassure me? "
39jcd8,2,2015-06-11,Me [21 M] with my gf [21] of a year and three months went to study abroad and now wants to be alone and put us on break after almost breaking us up.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39jcd8/me_21_m_with_my_gf_21_of_a_year_and_three_months/,"The past few days have been pretty shit, it all happened three days ago when I was having a pretty good day at work for once and a pretty good morning altogether.Through out the day my girl friend who recently went to Germany to study abroad finally got good wifi to skype to me that day and I was pretty excited to go home and finally talk to her. Got through the day and raced home. Showered and we got on skype.

She looked amazing, I said hi first and started to ask how her run before the skype was and how classes were. But the silence was there, the look on her face was something I could tell was wrong. Not the one you would make if you were excited to see your boy friend.

She then started to talk from a piece of paper that she wrote it down on, I guess she couldn't do it from the top of her head because she wouldn't be able to do it at all.
She read it and I shouted for her to stop and that it wasn't happening. It was hitting me, I could see the signs that we needed some space, but we weren't the kind for taking breaks and we were almost always together when one of us had a free day. Almost never apart and I knew we needed space to develop ourselves again.

One part of me felt like it was people around her or she fell in love with somebody else. Or that she just lost her mind, but no it's not that I feel like she just doesn't know herself anymore.

I was insecure from past relationships about breaks since my ex went around with other guys during one and I just didn't believe in it and that two people could rationally talk out how they feel and I don't know, just love each other without getting too worked up about something that rational minds can fix. That's not exactly how humans work though.

She hadn't thought about taking a break or asking if we could instead of breaking up which hurt me most after we talked about how a break would be best. We talked and cried for each other, man it stings still to think about it. We cried so hard to hold each other and to be together during that moment. 

We both were together for too long of periods and it seemed so real and too mature for her, I never intended to get to that point. But I noticed how grumpy we got around each other during winter since she never got out much and I worked a lot, I knew we needed space but by that point she was afraid to be by herself and her mind. I was her safety though, I protected her from thing and she did as well. We helped each other when we were at our lowest and now all the time and memories can't help us here. 
I tell her people change every year, me a year ago thought differently than I do now, it doesn't mean a month away will completely change you into a new person void of all love and memories for another person.


That was the first sign that this was eventually going to happen. Now we're at a point where we are both together on facebook but she's afraid I'll reject her when she gets back or if she'll even still love me when she gets back. 

She didn't want me to wait for her to return and to be somebody completely different. To which I said is bullshit since it's just a month long trip and she'll be back and happy to see me like she always was, and who she is is who she is. Just have new things to talk about is all and to have all the space she needed and that when she gets back we'll be cute and lovey with each other because that's what's probably going to happen. She agreed with me there and said it could be something in her gut that she doesn't need to follow but she has to and needs to know that I won't be stuck here waiting for her.

But, she's going to another state in the south next year after a semester for an internship, we already had a long distance relationship, but that was large. I would've prepared for it and we would talk about our options. And that hurts her more knowing we don't have much time left.

She said I was the best thing she's ever had in her life and that everything I am is what she wanted and that I deserve better than her, she's not happy with herself and wasn't when she left. Personal things and insecurities slowly ate away at her during her junior year and it really took a toll on her along with constantly being with me to feel safe from herself.
I just want her to be happy, but the one part of me cannot accept losing her forever and after a year and three months too. 

We were so happy together when she was here and I helped keep her bad thoughts away, I just don't know how to feel about this whole thing. I personally feel as though her depression got the best of her and made her think that she wasn't being the best girl friend and that the distance was hurting her wanting to be with me and feel better. She was happy there and I loved seeing her pictures and how her day was.

Now I can't call her cute names or be cute with her, now I have to just be her friend and let her breath and wait until she comes back so we see what happens.
   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend showed signs of losing herself over the last few months due to being with me constantly and now that she's in Germany for a month studying abroad she wanted to break up, but we decided on bending our break rule and are now on a break but I'm afraid to lose her. I wish there was a way to help her feel better, but I also want to not talk to her and give her some space to breathe. I'm so lost right now and scared."
39jd66,30,2015-06-11,A Different Path,bold78,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/39jd66/a_different_path/,"First of all, I want to say that this is not an anti big 4 or anti big firm post.  I have just noticed that most of the posts on this subreddit come from people who work for those companies (which makes sense since those firms are bigger) and I want to show that there are other paths in this career.  I am not saying what I have done in my life is better or worse than what people who have decided to go to larger firms; it is just different and I would like to share it.
 
That being said, this is my story.

I graduated college with a GPA of just under 3 and a GPA in my businesses classes of around 3.2.  I went to a school that isn't heavily recruited by the big four (i believe Deloitte is the only big four firm at our recruiting event), and I believe that only 4 of the top 25 firms recruited at my college.  In college it was drilled into my head during school that the only way to be successful in public accounting was to go to a national firm. Because of this I basically sent my resume to the national firms that come to our events and no one else.  I had a few interview but nothing came of them.  I was depressed as crap.  Like many of the students who post on this subreddit, I thought I was up shit creek without a paddle...

Then, during class one day, a friend told me to email the owner of a small firm (8ish full time people) in town and tell him I was interested in an internship.  As luck would have it, he was still looking for an intern during tax season and after an interview I got the job.  Throughout that tax season i did simple tax returns and I was under the impression that April 15th would be my last day and then I was on my own.  Apparently, throughout the year, the small amount of knowledge that must have accidentally sunk in during school and/or my work ethic was noticed by the owner (or my good looks and charm... who the hell knows).  I was hired on full time at the end of my internship.

I have now been their 2.5 years.  I have done some interesting things so far in my career.  I work with many small business owners, some just doing their returns every year, others I do all their accounting including their general ledger work.  I help with transition planning.  I have potentially saved a family millions of dollars because a larger firm botched an estate plan.  That family had paid tens of thousands of dollars to get this estate plan done by a larger firm (top 100) that is a major player in their specialty area.  Me, an accountant, not 8 months after graduating found the multi-million dollar error in their work that would probably have gotten thrown out by the IRS when it was examined.  I am very slowly becoming our firm's expert in an area of government regulation that deeply affects our clients.  I have worked with the leading experts in this area of regulation.  I work with wonderful people and I rarely work more than 42 hours a week in the summer or 60 hours a week during tax season.  I have learned many things that I never would have if I had gotten into any of the jobs I had wanted to during school. 

I have my good days, and I have my days when I would like to throw myself off a bridge (and take my supervisors with me). I have never done an audit.  In fact, I am certain that I would be completely lost if I was ever asked to do any assurance work more strenuous than a compilation (I have done a total of 1 review, but that is it).  I know that there are many things that those at large national firms know much more than I do in many subject areas, but that doesn't mean that their experience is better or worse than mine in any way.  I wish them success in all their work.  

I just want all the students and people just getting started to know that there is more than one path into public accounting and I am sure they are all very rewarding in their own way.

As always, please excuse my spelling and grammatical errors.

I love wearing slim dresses, lipstick, and high heels. I don't wear these things all the time, but I get dolled up for school at least a few days a week.

I'm confident in myself and my look, but I'm worried that my girly style might get me off on the wrong foot in the engineering world? I don't mind fighting the good fight for respect, but I'm finding myself a bit nervous that I won't be taken seriously."

39jue7,1,2015-06-12,I Feel Myself Getting Sucked Back into this Cycle,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/39jue7/i_feel_myself_getting_sucked_back_into_this_cycle/,"I was in a huge cycle for a long while, then I had a 38, 67, 58 and now a 11 day streak. This downward trend worries me. What am I gonna do? I am gonna list my reasons here and read it. 

Probably I am writing all these out of ""the relapser's remorse"", but anyway. I was a late bloomer, and I gained my sexual drive much later than my friends had theirs. They were all talking about how amazing porn is and bragged about how they masturbated daily, and as a young boy I wanted to be like my friends. I started watching porn daily, although there was a missing detail, porn was disgusting me, I didn't even have my sexual drive yet, but I was watching these objectifying spitty penis focused videos. I was not even orgasming, I was just rubbing my dick, hoping ""something"" will come out eventually. What I didn't know was by watching porn, I was delaying this even more because I was increasing my tolerance every time I had the dopamine hit. I was always a high academic achiever and was a decent student athlete. All my life seemed perfect from outside, all of the successes, a loving family, outgoing personality, but deep inside there was always the little kid who was trying to escape from his biggest insecurity: His sexuality. I am not saying I'm gay, and I'm indifferent to whom acknowledge themselves as such, but I was becoming extremely insecure about my sex life, though I had not had one yet. I wasn't even courageous enough to kiss my first love, who broke up with me because I was extremely distant from her sexually. Though she didn't say this openly, I was acting as her best buddy rather than her boyfriend. Being dumped by her got me upset, especially when combined with the fact that I was going to study abroad for 4 years in the US. In my home country, there was my parents, a more limited pornography access, and a structured life, yet when I got here, I was completely undisturbed and extremely unsuccessful at making friends, so I did what all of us here did: I gave myself to porn. I sold my soul just to feel a little bit better, just to feel a bit of a pleasure. Then in the summer I got back to my country, with a Dean's List GPA in spite of my habit, then met this girl. We clicked together, dated for a month (no sex yet), then I had to go back to US. She was extremely jealous and hard to get along with especially when you're overseas away. That fall semester was the worst semester of my life. My roommates didn't like me much (they were all random because I hadn't made real friends the year before and the fact that I was only leaving my room to get food and water didn't help). That semester was the beginning of the 6-7 month cycle from which I was able to get out only by confessing to my parents. In the winter break I and my girlfriend got together, and I was extremely happy. I had my girlfriend besides me, We've made out before which felt pleasurable at the time, and I was home! Then the time came, she was lying naked in front of me, looking at a limb dick and a frustrated guy who didn't have any knowledge about the matter at all. Deep inside I thought I was gay or asexual, and she thought she was not pretty enough to arouse me. Then I've made some research about the topic, emailed urologists trying to figure out what's going on. Eventually I was able to figure out I had PIED, combined with TMS. Yes, I may have forgot to mention until that time I always masturbated by grinding to my bed. I guess I wasn't insecure for no reason.. That fall semester, my GPA went down to 2.9 from 3.7. I had no friends. I was a 19 yr-old physically healthy dude with a limb dick. That gentleman, was my so-frequently-mentioned ""rock bottom"". After that semester, I came across Nofap thanks to my research, had a 25-day streak and when I met my gf I was able to feel the changes substantially (No sex, only foreplay). Unfortunately I was not able to get along with her because her jealousy was unbearable, nor was it manageable from
overseas, so I broke up with her. In that summer I was not able to get from my cycle, however I met a girl with whom
I sometimes exchange snapchats currently. To get out of that huge cycle, I once had a nervous break down, and confessed my parents crying. One of the worst moments of my life. That day I made them a promise, which is in danger of not being held if I maintain overconfident and keep slacking off from my Nofap journey. From that day on, I substantially reduced my porn consumption, my GPA is 3.3, this semester being 3.9. I have an internship which is directly related to my major and I have important responsibilities. I've gained great friendships, in which my friends care about me and I care about them, and love them. 

Look at my life back, I've done nothing wrong. I fulfilled all my responsibilities, have not engaged in a behavior I knew was wrong. All I did, all these years, was to watch porn, starting with only a little, not even for my own pleasure, but to feel as I belong to the environment in which all my friends were. This long-ass post, is my reason for starting this journey. As I improved my life I realized I started forgetting it. How miserable I felt back then. How I seriously weighed pros and cons of killing myself once, and how challenging was to convince myself to fight back. But that's what you do with life. If it gives you lemons, you make lemonades. If it hits you and makes you fall, you spit that blood out, smile
with your red teeth, and keep getting back up. That's what I did so far, I did not regret it yet. I am a good man, who has unknowingly did some mistakes, which became his reason to cling onto life. Because that's how winning is done. It's all about how much you can take and keep moving forward. 

From now on every time I doubt my reasons for quitting porn, I will come back and read this long post, the length of which I apologize. I will not forget my reasons. 

What is your reason? "
39jzvl,1,2015-06-12,Is attempting to force a 50/50 gender split in a workforce a good or bad idea?,gavinok,PurplePillDebate,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/39jzvl/is_attempting_to_force_a_5050_gender_split_in_a/,"In some industries and fields, there is a gender imbalance to one side. An example would be that over 90% of kindergarden teachers in the US are female.

Do you believe, that in hiring practices for such fields, a gender cap should be imposed? This is specifically what I mean.

Say in the summer, Google hires 1,500 software engineering interns. When the open up the application process, they accept applications as they normally do, regardless of gender. However, once they were to hire 750 male, or 750 female interns, they would switch to **only** hiring interns of the unfilled gender, and reject any applicant of the filled gender(the one already at 750), regardless of their credentials or experience.

Do you think overall this would be beneficial? Or in other words, do you believe that any workforce of a split 50/50 gender ratio would be superior in terms of efficiency, intellect, and organization than any workforce which **did not** possess a split 50/50 gender ratio?

If you have any specific examples, feel free to share them."

Jason and I ride BART to meet her.  We have half an hour to kill and sit outside in the bay wind with the wandering tourists and screaming gulls.  I sprawl out on the bench and sip a bagged bottle of beer while Jason perches on the back rest above me, smoking and reading mail.  


My city revels in it's architectural glory from this spot.  The bench gives us commanding views of the Bay Bridge spanning over a bumpy, jade sea.  As the sun sinks slowly in the west, the clock tower behind us begins to glow.  Somewhere within the arched Roman arcades of the Ferry Building's Great Nave, Kym is locking up her cafe.


I contemplate what marvels we can achieve with our prehensile thumbs and math as the first star of the evening grows visible through the fabric of the approaching night.  


""Check this out.  Dear Mr. Severson-"", reads Jason.


My ears perk up because I'm Mr. fucking Severson!


""We have received your dissertation on applied mechanics for the 1997 summer internship program.  Out of 300 qualified candidates, we are pleased to inform you that your application was accepted...""


I look up at Jason and grab my letter.  Course requirements include applying for internships but I never thought I’d actually qualify.  Rowan University in New Jersey…Hmm.  


Then Jason and I both jump as the backs of our skulls are simultaneously slapped with a resounding SMACK!


""What's up BITCHES?!"", taunts Kym as she hops over the bench and plops down between us with a thud. 


I slip the letter in my jacket as she shoves Jason's legs out of her way.  She growls at me and snaps her teeth before slowly moving in for a kiss.  Her face softens and she is so beautiful in the light of our disappearing sun...I move towards her lips which are slightly parted and her eyes close gently for the kiss...but she turns her head at the last moment and I kiss air. She chuckles and I smell the freshly ground coffee mixed with her scent and lunge at her neck like a starving animal.


""Jesus! "", complains Jason as he looks around and then lights a joint.  ""The Japanese tourists are staring.  You're ruining the moment!""


""Mine!"", snarls Kym grabbing the joint and sucking a huge hit.  


She passes it back to Jason and kisses a lungful of ganja into me that ends with her biting my lower lip.  


Ah Kym...I want to tell you how lost I am in your deep, sea blue eyes...How your carnivorous smile at the end of a day proves how perfect the Universe is...but instead I cough.  This weed is so fucking harsh.


""Goddamn!"", I choke and gag so hard my balls hurt.


“Hey!  You guys hungry?  Check out the haul!"", smiles Kym proudly opening up her bag.  


On Saturdays, the Great Nave of the Ferry Building is an open air farmer's market.  Anything from quail eggs and local produce to artisan cheeses and smoked venison.  At the end of the day Kym can score large amounts of gourmet food by simply handing out a cup of coffee to the right farmer.


Tonight we dine on an free range spit roasted chicken, sourdough bread, plums, minestrone soup and sodas swiped from Kym's cafe.  We watch the red glittering traffic lights sparkle and hum across the Bay Bridge.  Kym dips bread into the soup and feeds me as Jason tosses crust to the cyclone of gulls screeching for scraps.  


This is my life.  A good life.  New Jersey seems far away.  And fuck, it's New Jersey.  I look at Kym.  She holds a piece if chicken in her hand as a brave seagull hovers above her slowly flapping and descending....


""Closer..."", commands Kym.  A Japanese tourist starts snapping pictures of the girl with pink hair calling seagulls from the sky.  More birds heed the call.  


The seagull's flapping wings make all the bags, tourist maps and paper trash whirl up into the air like a twister as Kym slowly coaxes birds to her and hand feeds them chicken.


""Cannibal!” yells Jason, ""Abomination!""


Kym, bored with her power over birds tosses the last hunk high in the air.  The sky explodes in a chaos of wings, feather and bones which rain down on us as she shrieks with delight.


On the BART ride home I show Kym the letter.  She grows silent and points her face out the window away from me.  I see her huge wrap around sunglasses reflected in the train window as we shoot through the tunnel.  Halfway home she finally looks at me.


""I think you should go.  Don't you?""


""I wanted to intern in the city.  Not New Jersey...""


""But wouldn't it be good for you?""


I nod.  Yes.  Kym turns back to the window but she also holds my hand.


Jason and I smoked H before we went to the Ferry Building.  I think Kym's been taking oxy but as we near home we are all a little antsy.  Bouncy, jiggly, nervous knees and every other sentence includes how fucking cold it is.  The anxious twitchiness is coupled with endless cigarettes.  We were supposed to meet one of Jason's connects at the BART station but after an hour Jason yells ""FUCK!"" and punches the black DevL tag inked above the ticket machine.  Two BART cops walk over so we leave.  Back home the cupboards are bare.  Kym scrapes our glass straw, Jason scrapes bags.  We share the meager bounty and then Jason takes off to the park.  


Two hours later I can't concentrate on my English assignment.  And poor Kym looks absolutely miserable on the couch.  This creative writing assignment drive me nuts.  Waste of time.  


I look at my letter again.  Paid internship, dorm room and three meals a day.  I cover incidental expenses but I can use my student loan for that.  


And then reality rushes in and SLAPS me.  Boy...you're a goddamn DOPEFIEND.


An addict.  Just sitting here with my ear tuned to our porch waiting for Jason's footsteps like a fucking dog waiting for his master...and what if Jase can't score?  Highly doubtful as he is incredibly resourceful when it comes to finding smack but What if...?  The thought terrifies me.  My spine aches.  I CAN'T sit still.  There is only one way out.


I stand up and grandly announce, ""I am going to kick!""


Kym looks up with her hazy, lazy, sleepy, dopesick tired from working all day face and arches an eyebrow at me.  


""Really babe...?""


""Yes"" I vow solemnly.  


I feel better now that I have said it.  


And then...I hear his footsteps.  Boots bouncing off the wooden stairs with the chains he wraps around his waist a-jingling...


""BOOM!"", Jason cries dramatically as kicks open the door.  


He tosses a plump little bag to the couch.  Kym reaches up with one hand and snatches it out of the air.  The next bag is tossed to me and I hyperfocus on the arc as the prize sails into my open hands.  I look at Kym.


""Taper"" I mutter opening the bag.


Jason and Kym are rabbit quiet when they see me use.  But I can feel their thoughts.  When I am grouchy I believe they are smug.  When I am high I think they are sad.  Am I projecting?  Do they actually care about anything other than H?  


I stop getting REALLY high.  No more nod.  My spirit no longer bounds wildly across the threshold of sanity.  The endless poppy field is beyond me.  But life is a circle.  I start my day with Kym and end my day with Kym.  I smoke a tiny ball just to push away the cold, the pain and the sadness.  Kym smokes HUGE looping Van Gogh spirals she lighter dances across foil.  And Jason...the fucker shoots dope.  


I wish I had ECP rather than tar.  Just do little bumps.  I'm dopesick but I'm sick of tar!  I ask for ECP.


""Hmm now?  What?"" questions Jason who is clutching the kitchen chair so he doesn't slide off to the floor.  God, I never realized how fucking drugged out my roommates are.  I've been having a lot of one sided conversations lately.  


""I SAID can you get any powder?""


""Naw man.  Just tar.  Oregon Ed had some of that dragon pearl but he and Patty got busted creeping cars at the park.  So...""


I wait for him to finish but he doesn't go on.  I go in my room and find Kym on the futon with her arms lifted over her head, just serenely staring at the ceiling.


""Babe...come cuddle with me"", she smiles all sleepy, euphoric kitten-like.


I lay down and she curls into me.  Her fingers feel like tin spikes probing my fevered flesh.  My twisted and frayed spine nerves transmit pain to my shoulders and back.  My stomach is all fucked up too.  I feel ill and Kym is talking so quietly I can't hear her.  And I don't care.  She rubs my back with ice hands.  I squirm away and sit up.  Kym stares at me with her lazy lioness grin.  She has euphoria.  I have nothing.  But then I realize Kym is waiting for a response.


""Sorry.  What?""


""Internship?  When?""


I stroke her hair and her face.  Fuck, I almost feel normal doing this.  Almost.  


""A month and a half.""


""How long will you be gone babe...""


""2 months.""


""Oh"", her voice is small.  I sense melancholy but her pin point pupils staring at me make the pain seem dull and far, far away...


""Kym.  When you're at work do you ever use?""


""H?  No...nope.  Nopey, nopey, nope...""


“What do you do?""


""Oxy and X and weed babe.  Mostly oxy!"", giggles Kym.  ""Oxy makes my day fuckingA OK.  Put some oxy my bullet and take a few to chew...chew, chew, chew Mr. Magoo..."" and I lose Kym to giggling.


Oxy.


I have been taking these for fun.  Unlike the droopy, sedated pleasures of smack, these little pills bring a buzz to the party.  I score some from Ari and find about 50 - 60 mgs takes the edge off the H craving. 


But I go through them so fast.  As pills dwindle I try my best to make them last by breaking them up.  I start to avoid Kym before and after her work because she is so high it breaks my soul and resolve.  Fuck I am dopesick.  Holding her when she nods out is as good as it gets.  I find myself stealing her oxy when she passes out.  But it's just not enough.


By the end of the week I am going insane.  


Night class was a blur.  I have no idea what happened.  All I can think about is how miserable I am.  No H for 4 days and the oxy is almost out.  I have two 30 mgs in my pocket.  I keep clicking them together.  I laugh because these 2 little fuckers are SUPPOSED to last me three days.  No fucking way.  I can already feel the chills vibrating their way across the Earth to stab me one million times.  


These thoughts plague me as I cut through Capp Street towards Bay Mart to get smokes.  The prostitutes are already out but they ignore me.  This is a rough area and I keep my head down as I plow through like a good city dweller.  I pass shuttered storefronts and the foggy night air gives me violent shivers.  I sniffle and hate life.  


But why?  I don't have to put up with this.  I reach in my pocket.  No.  


But...I've been good.  Right?  Without another thought I grab both pills.  And the gods mock me.  Two pills slip apart in my grasp and shoot off in opposite directions.  I watch one bounce across pitted concrete and land near trash cans.  I chase it and send three cats scurrying.  The pill rests on a lump of gray cat food.  I rub off the wet meat and pop it.  The fishy taste gags me but I chew to release the chemical tang.  


But the other pill...I look around.  Stopping on Capp Street anywhere between 18th and 24th is just not a good idea.  People notice.  What is that mohawked freak doing?  I study the gutter.  The other pill could be in the dark water by the squished, dead pigeon.  I trace my fingers through the water trying to feel a pill.  Two women and a man across the street stare...so I stagger off feeling vaguely ill.


As I walk through Mission smoking cigarettes to kill the cat food taste I start laughing.  The laughter is like drowning as I sink into the hysteria my cackles turn to a crazed ROAR.  I hoot maniacally like a loon and start to choke.  Two women walking towards me quickly cross the street.  


And light fills my path.  It floods the earth and drives the moths and darkness away.   


A car blasting Eazy E trails me.  WHO'S KICKING ASS?  I look over and see Kym's red Acura slowing down.  She leans out the driver's window wearing my black 49er's beanie with wisps of her pink hair trailing out wildly behind her as she bounces along to the music.  Dev sits in the passenger seat.  Her head is tilted back, mouth hanging open as she stares blankly forward at god knows what.  Jason's in the backseat laid out from a fat shot.  He cynically flashes the Norte XIV westside gang sign.  The car stops and Kym reaches back and pops open the door.


This is not the best part of town for a car with 2 white suburban punks and a hippie chick blasting TOO MUCH POSSE!  They obviously just scored and Dev and Jase are staggered.  Kym probably had just enough to see sideways as she drives through one of the worst neighborhoods in San Francisco blasting NWA.  The dome light casts an eerie shadow in the empty seat.  Is that Jason's shadow sitting there?  An illusion?  I wish Dev was conscious so I could ask her.  Fuck it.  I get in the car with the shadow.  


Kym peels out and cranks the stereo to eardrum damaging levels.  There will be no talking.  She tosses her Lancôme makeup bag at me.  Jason's studded black belt is still on the seat.  I unzip the bag and see alcohol swabs, three bags of tar and a rig with half a shot left.  Her blood is still suspended in the amber liquid.  Light from traffic illuminates her wide blue eyes in the rearview mirror.  Vampiric mascara smeared over these penetrating eyes feast on my predicament.  Well?  But she knows.  She just wants to watch…I think of Jason's pet name for Kym.  The Devil's Daughter.  


Kym is like a star in deep space.  She draws you into her power, her glory and light.  But at the end of the day I chose this path.  So I wink at her and pull my arm out of my leather jacket...

""Naw man.  Just tar.  Oregon Ed had some of that dragon pearl but he and Patty got busted creeping cars at the park.  So...""


I wait for him to finish but he doesn't go on.  I go in my room and find Kym on the futon with her arms lifted over her head, just serenely staring at the ceiling.


""Babe...come cuddle with me"", she smiles all sleepy, euphoric kitten-like.


I lay down and she curls into me.  Her fingers feel like tin spikes probing my fevered flesh.  My twisted and frayed spine nerves transmit pain to my shoulders and back.  My stomach is all fucked up too.  I feel ill and Kym is talking so quietly I can't hear her.  And I don't care.  She rubs my back with ice hands.  I squirm away and sit up.  Kym stares at me with her lazy lioness grin.  She has euphoria.  I have nothing.  But then I realize Kym is waiting for a response.


""Sorry.  What?""


""Internship?  When?""


I stroke her hair and her face.  Fuck, I almost feel normal doing this.  Almost.  


""A month and a half.""


""How long will you be gone babe...""


""2 months.""


""Oh"", her voice is small.  I sense melancholy but her pin point pupils staring at me make the pain seem dull and far, far away...


""Kym.  When you're at work do you ever use?""


""H?  No...nope.  Nopey, nopey, nope...""


“What do you do?""


""Oxy and X and weed babe.  Mostly oxy!"", giggles Kym.  ""Oxy makes my day fuckingA OK.  Put some oxy my bullet and take a few to chew...chew, chew, chew Mr. Magoo..."" and I lose Kym to giggling.


Oxy.


I have been taking these for fun.  Unlike the droopy, sedated pleasures of smack, these little pills bring a buzz to the party.  I score some from Ari and find about 50 - 60 mgs takes the edge off the H craving. 


But I go through them so fast.  As pills dwindle I try my best to make them last by breaking them up.  I start to avoid Kym before and after her work because she is so high it breaks my soul and resolve.  Fuck I am dopesick.  Holding her when she nods out is as good as it gets.  I find myself stealing her oxy when she passes out.  But it's just not enough.


By the end of the week I am going insane.  


Night class was a blur.  I have no idea what happened.  All I can think about is how miserable I am.  No H for 4 days and the oxy is almost out.  I have two 30 mgs in my pocket.  I keep clicking them together.  I laugh because these 2 little fuckers are SUPPOSED to last me three days.  No fucking way.  I can already feel the chills vibrating their way across the Earth to stab me one million times.  


These thoughts plague me as I cut through Capp Street towards Bay Mart to get smokes.  The prostitutes are already out but they ignore me.  This is a rough area and I keep my head down as I plow through like a good city dweller.  I pass shuttered storefronts and the foggy night air gives me violent shivers.  I sniffle and hate life.  


But why?  I don't have to put up with this.  I reach in my pocket.  No.  


But...I've been good.  Right?  Without another thought I grab both pills.  And the gods mock me.  Two pills slip apart in my grasp and shoot off in opposite directions.  I watch one bounce across pitted concrete and land near trash cans.  I chase it and send three cats scurrying.  The pill rests on a lump of gray cat food.  I rub off the wet meat and pop it.  The fishy taste gags me but I chew to release the chemical tang.  


But the other pill...I look around.  Stopping on Capp Street anywhere between 18th and 24th is just not a good idea.  People notice.  What is that mohawked freak doing?  I study the gutter.  The other pill could be in the dark water by the squished, dead pigeon.  I trace my fingers through the water trying to feel a pill.  Two women and a man across the street stare...so I stagger off feeling vaguely ill.


As I walk through Mission smoking cigarettes to kill the cat food taste I start laughing.  The laughter is like drowning as I sink into the hysteria my cackles turn to a crazed ROAR.  I hoot maniacally like a loon and start to choke.  Two women walking towards me quickly cross the street.  


And light fills my path.  It floods the earth and drives the moths and darkness away.   


A car blasting Eazy E trails me.  WHO'S KICKING ASS?  I look over and see Kym's red Acura slowing down.  She leans out the driver's window wearing my black 49er's beanie with wisps of her pink hair trailing out wildly behind her as she bounces along to the music.  Dev sits in the passenger seat.  Her head is tilted back, mouth hanging open as she stares blankly forward at god knows what.  Jason's in the backseat laid out from a fat shot.  He cynically flashes the Norte XIV westside gang sign.  The car stops and Kym reaches back and pops open the door.


This is not the best part of town for a car with 2 white suburban punks and a hippie chick blasting TOO MUCH POSSE!  They obviously just scored and Dev and Jase are staggered.  Kym probably had just enough to see sideways as she drives through one of the worst neighborhoods in San Francisco blasting NWA.  The dome light casts an eerie shadow in the empty seat.  Is that Jason's shadow sitting there?  An illusion?  I wish Dev was conscious so I could ask her.  Fuck it.  I get in the car with the shadow.  


Kym peels out and cranks the stereo to eardrum damaging levels.  There will be no talking.  She tosses her Lancôme makeup bag at me.  Jason's studded black belt is still on the seat.  I unzip the bag and see alcohol swabs, three bags of tar and a rig with half a shot left.  Her blood is still suspended in the amber liquid.  Light from traffic illuminates her wide blue eyes in the rearview mirror.  Vampiric mascara smeared over these penetrating eyes feast on my predicament.  Well?  But she knows.  She just wants to watch…I think of Jason's pet name for Kym.  The Devil's Daughter.  


Kym is like a star in deep space.  She draws you into her power, her glory and light.  But at the end of the day I chose this path.  So I wink at her and pull my arm out of my leather jacket...

Why did you join NCIv?
-I have largely been a lone wolf player since Planetside 2 came out, but feel I have been missing a lot in regards to team play. Emerald's VS outfits and squads are largely disorganized and zergish, and I have long admired Moukass' slick squad play on his YouTube channel.

I have data from a complex survey. I need to test if Smoking status (1 yes, 0 no) among men(1) is significantly different than smoking status in women(2) using a p-value of .05.  Because it is a Complex Samples dataset, I cannot use a simple t-test, I need to fit it as part of a regression model.  I have read linear regression is appropriate, but since it is a dichotomous outcome, shouldn't I use logistic regression?  To complicate things even more, the estimates of the percentage of respondents who smoke is different in the logisitc model, linear model, and when I just do a frequency analysis.

Can anyone help? I've asked several people at work and keep getting passed off to different people."

39l8xu,87,2015-06-12,Two of of my [25f] co-workers [23f; 31f] have asked me to set them up with my boss [35m]. I said no and they won't let it go.,RedVelvetRevolver,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39l8xu/two_of_of_my_25f_coworkers_23f_31f_have_asked_me/,"I am the single staff member to a young politician. I have been friends with my boss, *Mark, for years and met him when he first ran for office. I hold my boss in the highest regard and I owe him a lot. He's been my mentor and my professional cheerleader. I have no formal training in political science, which made it extremely tough to break into a competitive field where applicants with political science degrees and relevant internships get turned away on a regular basis. But he took a chance on me and offered me the job at a time when I really needed it. 

Mark is articulate, extremely kind and good natured, and very good looking. He is single. Mark and I get along great, but our relationship is quite formal and professional and we don't discuss our private lives beyond chatting about what we did that weekend, etc. 

Mark gets a lot of attention. While most of the lawmakers we work with are older, paunchy, balding men, he stands out and more than a few of my co-workers have the hots for him. At first, people would just joke around about how he's the most eligible bachelor in these parts, but recently it's gone beyond that. 

One of my good work friend has always carried a torch for him, and a few weeks ago she asked me if I would set her up with him. I told her I wasn't comfortable with that, and she switched gears, asking me to create opportunities for her to interact with him. I conceded and let her know once that he was in the office and she could come say hi if she wanted. Big mistake. Now, she wants me to do this on a regular basis and asked me if I can bring her up/speak highly of her/mention she's single. I think that would be awkward and unprofessional, especially since Mark and I don't talk about our personal lives much. I don't even know if he's available (by single I mean unmarried) and it's none of my business whether he is or not!

Three days ago, I was walking with another co-worker when she started asking about Mark, if he's single, talking about how attractive and nice he is, etc. She said ""well you know I'm on the market, could you set me up with him?"" I told her that's not my style and his personal life is his business, but she laughed it off and said ""well I know you have to say that. Maybe you could just bring me up in conversation? Our little secret."" I was caught a little off guard that this situation was repeating itself and gave her an unenthusiastic maybe.

I don't think these women mean any harm, but they need to realize I'm his employee, not his pimp. I don't like seeing him treated like a piece of meat. I've already put my foot down about setting these women up, but I can't stop them from hovering over our office trying to catch a glimpse or make small talk with him. I know the solution is probably to get real with them and tell them they can flirt with him if they want but I'm not going to facilitate it, but I work in politics and forming strong relationships with other staff members is essential to my work. I don't want to burn any bridges, but I'm not going to treat my boss like a prize to be won. 

Do you have any advice on how to put a stop to these requests without seeming hostile or alienating my co-workers? The tricky part about this is these women will act like they're just joking sometimes, but I know they're not. I feel like if I tell them to stop, they'll say ""chill out I wasn't serious!""

TL;DR my boss is a babe and my co workers want me to help them date him. I want advice on how to tactfully tell them I'm not going to facilitate that.

They want to help their portfolio companies grow so their websites show you all the open positions at each of these companies. 

It's easier than looking up individual companies one by one, and it also helps you know they're backed by solid investors (not that that's always a guarantee they'll be successful.) It's a good jumping-off point to do additional research on the companies once you find one you like.

39lw0a,7,2015-06-12,"21 year old, want to be a Radio host/DJ",4yearstmj,radio,https://www.reddit.com/r/radio/comments/39lw0a/21_year_old_want_to_be_a_radio_hostdj/,"Hey guys, long story short, I've always been fascinated by radio shows. On one hand I listen to classic rock radio stations in the Toronto area, and on the other listen to talk-shows like 102.1 the Edge, Howard Stern, .etc.

Anyways, I'm working for the summer but upon my return in September I was looking for a radio job. I have no direct experience in broadcasting but I do have some qualities:

- Great communication/presentation skills
- The classic deep, slightly raspy radio voice
- Vast knowledge of classic rock/modern rock
- Relatively computer handy, used to edit sound clips in the past and could definitely learn a soundboard, interface or program fast
- Young, charismatic, sense of humor, ""fresh""

I'm thinking of recording myself in a ""mock radio situation"" i.e find a format for a show I listen to, basically copy it with my own voice and prepare it as a ""demo"".

Any suggestions or advice?

I know most radio guys don't get ON-AIR as they say, for years and usually start behind the scenes as interns or whatever. I'm willing to do that to

Any suggestions/info appreciated!"

39m63h,10,2015-06-12,What NOT to do as an intern,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/39m63h/what_not_to_do_as_an_intern/,"After all the frantic ""am I screwed!?"" posts we get from students and interns, thought I'd share this experience since I believe it's a trap some personalities can fall into.

I'm an intern at a F500.  This summer's group is about 15 of us, and the program really tries to connect the interns and get us to do stuff, and we've mostly all become friends 4 weeks into this.  

But we have one intern, lets say ""Bob"", who really, really, **really** wants to fit in.  Bob does a lot of things right.  Bob does a lot of things wrong.

We interns go out for drinks, sometimes we run into full time staff, it's a small town.  Bob is younger than us so he can't legally buy alcohol, so Bob invested in a fake ID, which he decides to use at these bars in a small town while mentioning to everyone at other times that he's not 21.

Bob also likes to hang with some of the non-accounting interns.  To seek acceptance and prove he's one of them and not one of us, he proceeds to talk blatant shit about the accounting/finance interns and how ""annoying"" we all are and about how he's better.  

Small town, word gets around fast.  It's a week later and with the internship not even half over, he's already made enemies with the entire intern group by running his mouth in a poor effort to ""network"".  In turn, full time staff members who talk to us and know his age now know two things:

-Bob uses a fake ID to buy alcohol at one of the less than 3 bars in the town

-Bob is talking shit about interns and the finance department as a whole

Bob doesn't really have any friends anymore.  He tried really hard to be the cool kid, and failed miserably because we're not 13 anymore.  If any of you are in an internship like I am, don't overdo it.  The hard part is done, you have the internship.  Be nice to people and you'll get a good response.  "
39m8dl,8,2015-06-12,If only I could shower.,kittizenkane,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39m8dl/if_only_i_could_shower/,"All I wanted to do was go take a shower, but noooo, it is slowly filling with the neighbor's waste water. Yeah, when the neighbor showers it backs up into *my* tub. Fucking disgusting, right? I've already called maintenance about it and they've already been in twice to ""fix"" it this past week. Every few months this happens because I live in a shitty fucking apartment that I hate. I hate it. I hate everything about it. Every summer the AC breaks. Every winter the heater breaks. There is no insulation. The windows are...well, barely windows. I can be sitting on the couch and still enjoying a nice breeze, through my closed windows. Oh great. There are mice. There are ants. I hate this place.

Why do I live here? Oh, right, because my boyfriend and I were going to get an apartment together. He had strict requirements about the rent. You get what you pay for I guess. We had actually found a nice place in ""our"" (his) price range, but he waffled too long on the decision and we lost it. I didn't understand at the time. We had already agreed to move in together but he wasn't ready to pull the trigger on signing the lease. ""I just want to talk to my dad about it"" he said. Yeah, right. Why couldn't you have this life talk before you agreed to moving in with me? We found a different place. I was feeling a time crunch. It was in the price range, we needed somewhere to live. I regret it all the time, I regret saying yes to living here.

The real reason we live here? Because my boyfriend thought we were going to break up before we moved in. The real reason he was waffling on the first place? The was feeling guilty about the lies that were piling up. His lies. Before we moved he dropped the bombshell on me. This 4.0 GPA pre-med student I was dating? He had almost failed out of school and had no hope of getting into med school I guess. He was majoring in biology but had no idea what he was going to do, except maybe join the military. He's not academically stupid, he had just been depressed and unmotivated, surrounded by shitty influences, and he fucked up. He never told me for fear of judgment. Which is ridiculous. I'm an understanding person. The lies are worse, way worse, than the truth. But I forgive him. He gets accepted into the engineering school. We move in together, because we've already signed the fucking lease. He thought that he would have to drop this fucking bomb on me and that we would break up and that I would be living here alone. That's why he wanted to get a place with such cheap rent, so that after the truth came out I could afford it on my own. Why didn't you fucking come out with this before we signed a lease? Fuck, then we could have had a reasonable budget. Jeeeezus, the logic just boggles the mind.

It's not even logic. It makes no sense because I was living alone before paying significantly more in rent and doing just fine. He knew this. He had a roommate and their apartment was significantly more than this place. We could have afforded it. He just wasn't thinking. So we live in a shit apartment, because we had a fucking shit budget.

Engineering starts. He stops coming home. I feel neglected. ""I'll be home at 9."" 9 o'clock rolls around, 10, 11, 12. I fall asleep. 4am and he's slinking in the door. It's not that he's cheating. He's not, and I know this. He's pulling all-nighters at the library and any of his classmates would confirm this. But he tells me he's gonna be home at fucking 9, and I don't hear from him until he shows up hours after that. I just want a fucking text, you know? ""Hey babe, this is taking way longer than I anticipated, I don't know when I'll be home"" How fucking hard is that. I ask him to give me a heads up next time. He agrees and apologizes and ""feels bad"", but never does. It becomes a point of contention. 

Every semester he swears up and down that the next semester will be better. Next semester, next semester. I mean, it's not that he's lying per se, but it's not true. He believes it for whatever misguided reason. I get my hopes up. My hopes get crushed. Every semester is worse than the last. We spend less and less time together. At least he is excelling at engineering. This time around he truly does have a 4.0 GPA but it only does so much to improve upon his previous fuckups. He pushes himself this hard as a form of repentance. He lands an internship.

Oh, the internship. ""It'll start June 1st"" he says. I hang on to this. Yeah, sure it'll suck being apart but we'll have a few weeks of just him and I, not interruptions, no school. Hah! No...no, it starts the Monday after finals. We don't even get a fucking summer break together. We get a weekend. After his worst semester yet, we get a fucking weekend. Why? Because the other two interns wanted to start early. ""Well I can't be the only one who doesn't start now."" I mean, *you could*, let's be clear. But you won't. Another hope, crushed. The light at the end of the tunnel of a shitty semester just winked out. He'll immediately leave. I graduate from college and we don't even get to spend one fucking week together. 

The night before he leaves his friend is celebrating graduating from law school. He feels obligated to go, but I don't feel like going out. ""I'll be half an hour, I'll just have like 1 drink."" Two hours later he shows up completely drunk. I had been staying up waiting for him, but at this point I'm a) completely sober and b) upset that he's let me down again. I just go to bed. Again, the same old story...just be fucking honest with me. If you tell me you're going to be half an hour and not get drunk, I fucking believe you. But I shouldn't. I shouldn't believe anything you say.

So here I am alone in this shitty apartment. My boyfriend is off in BFE for his internship. ""I'll come visit you on the weekends!"" Guess who hasn't visited me? It's not that he doesn't love me. He is completely head over heels for me. But he's a say-er not a do-er. He tells me what I want to hear and does the opposite. I guess it's easier that way. For him at least. Meanwhile I'm sitting here in an apartment I despise because my boyfriend couldn't be honest with me and he's not even here. Well, maybe the neighbor's waste water has drained out of the shower by now."

39mdyh,163,2015-06-12,[Update] A cult [18-21 M/F] started at my church. One of them was my friend and she's starting a social media war.,goawaycult123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39mdyh/update_a_cult_1821_mf_started_at_my_church_one_of/,"Well it's been a while since I last posted and I honestly wasn't intending to post an update but it's a little therapeutic for me to get it out and maybe someone else who is dealing with a similar situation can read this and learn from it I suppose.

Previous post http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/36ukv7/a_cult_1821_mf_started_at_my_church_one_of_them/

I guess a fair bit has happened since the whole social media war. The first thing that happened was that all the cult members deactivated their Facebooks within a day of the whole thing except for Joanne and Bob, whom both decided it was a terrific idea to lambaste their parents. I guess the whole ""Honor Thy Father and Mother"" part of the bible went over their heads...

Anyways, I think everyone decided to just leave them be and nobody really responded to all their crazy Facebook posts to begin with except to ask them why they had to drag a whole bunch of people into it. They were pretty much repeating ""LEAVE US ALONE, IT'S OUR DECISION TO LEAVE"" and nobody was replying so they would... post it more? It made a lot of sense. 

They all just ran off to somewhere in California living off the money Sean stole from his dad and after a while I stopped caring because they are adults and if I heard about 6 college students being stoned in some Muslim country it was whatever, until yesterday.

Hopefully none of the them Reddit because it turns out on Wednesday Flora ran away. She got in a fight with JD and when then all went out in the morning, she drove her car away and came back to us and showed up at the college ministry and apologized to everyone. 

It's all very hush hush right now because she doesn't want JD to find out she's been conversing with all of us, but apparently the 6 of them + JD's family of 5 (he was approved to leave the state?) moved to California and were living in a condo. At some point Flora came to her senses and started to feel unsafe so she left. JD and the rest of them are now trying to get her back and locked her belongings and ID in storage. They did it cause she has some sort of internship and now she doesn't have anything so she can't go to it...?

It must be really hard on her and I'm supposed to meet up with her today after work just to catch up with her. I'm thinking about giving her some of my clothes and a purse, hopefully they fit her and I probably won't bring anything up about the cult so that we can just meet up and she can feel normal again for a little bit.

A little part of me is afraid she'll just blow me off and not show up... So I'm nervously typing this on my lunch break. I really don't know what to say or do. If anyone has any advice on how to best handle this, it would be much appreciated. 

   
**tl;dr**: Flora ran away from the cult. The others are trying to get her back and have her stuff held ransom in another state. I'm going to meet up with her today after work, hopefully it turns out well. 

**Edit:** I was supposed to meet her 2 hours ago. :( I tried, friends... I really did. 

**Edit 2:** We met up! She was 4 hours late but she brought Harrison with her! I was honestly surprised and I'm not gonna lie, for a second I thought they were going to kidnap me or something. I was wondering why it was taking her so long to reply to my messages... it turns out she convinced him to leave, picked him up and drove him all the way back. We went to Denny's and had a nice chat along with my husband and another mutual church friend. It was really good to see them and they're trying to convince the others to leave. The two of them have a lot of guilt and shame about the things they've done but we'll try to support them along the way. :)"
39meq4,9,2015-06-12,Best housing solution for a 6-month internship in Tokyo,RdNetwork,japanlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/39meq4/best_housing_solution_for_a_6month_internship_in/,"Hello /r/japanlife !

I was accepted at the N.I.I. (National Institute of Informatics) in Chiyoda, Tokyo, for a research internship from late February to late August 2016. 

Therefore, even if I already searched for information about that by myself, I'd like to hear your opinion about the best way for me to get an apartment that would be close enough to the lab and not too expensive.

I looked at the pinned post on the right, but excluding guest houses, most of those websites are fully in Japanese, which is definitely not very useful to me (even if I'm learning Japanese; I'm unfortunately not yet at that level, I guess). It seems that most expats going to Japan for such a period of  time choose those guest houses (mostly Sakura Houses or OakHouses), which seem to be good solutions, but I'm struggling to find something that would suit perfectly. Namely:

- I'd rather live in an apartment: I don't like dormitories, and I'm not a fan of shared houses (maybe you can convince me that it's the best way ; share your opinion on this too !). I know that's it is more expensive, but I thought I could find apartments that would be okay without being greatly expensive (I didn't. Minimum is about 100kY/month). I don't really mind a small surface (I mean, as long as I can live in it. That's probably like at least 9m²).
- I'd obviously like it to be not too far from the lab, but I don't mind walking. I guess a good criteria would be that if I can go to work in less than 40-45 minutes (total), I'd be fine. Not sure though if that is a surmountable amount of time in the Japanese transportation system. 


I think I look like a pain in the ass for most of you, who probably don't want to help such a demanding person, so I'll just say that I'll welcome anything that looks like a tip or a good idea, even if that means criticizing my demands (after all, I assume you are the one who know about Japan life).

39nbpi,13,2015-06-12,My thoughts on the new Lil Durk album,rapintel,hiphopheads,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/39nbpi/my_thoughts_on_the_new_lil_durk_album/,"This new Durk has been in the works for years, seeing as he has been on the label for years, but jail time and other backups caused delays.  The album, “Remember My Name”, was generally expected to be the biggest commercial album for a young drill artist out of Chicago since Chief Keef “Finally Rich”, but it didn’t live up to my expectations.  While Durk predicted his album to sell around 100,000 copies the first week, it only moved 27,000.  

There are some standout tracks on the album including the opening track “500 Homicides” in which the listener can hear the raw emotion and anger in Durk’s voice.  Perhaps some of the reason the song is so good is due to the lack of autotune, a decision I wish the artist made more often, and many people agree with this point.  A large part of the reason for this artist’s success stems from blending street-hardened experiences in his lyrics alongside melodic hooks into verses that are not quite raps but not singing either.  Think Future, but if he didn’t try so hard.  On this first track, Durk skips the chorus altogether, which actually works well and adds to the urgency in his lyrics and voice.  Track 3 is the single on the album and features follow Chicago artist and fellow Def Jam singer, Jeremih.  Musically, this cut stands out on the album due to its higher level of commercial appeal and catchy chorus.  The level of autotune on the song seems pretty on point.  The first verse moves along well and my only complaint is that Malcolm In The Middle reference that I’ve heard in multiple rap songs.  Jeremih adds a nice bridge before the second chorus.  The second verse starts well (“you ain’t never been to my town n****, a good place to go but the murder rate is so ridiculous”).  As the verse moves along, it seems a little lazy, especially near the end.  Further, some of the lyrics are rather simple (“I’m a boss, Hugo…  I got them pissed, I’m the shit”).  Overall, I think the song is good: the feature helps quite a bit. Durk does a nice job of blending Chicago, romance, cockiness, and money.  Violence is noticeably absent in the song, which perhaps adds to its marketability, but you can hear about violence on almost every other track.  That being said, I do not know if this is the best idea for a single, because while it was clearly manufactured by the label, the course itself contains the N word, the F word, and the word “drugs”.

Most people’s favorite song on this album is “Tryna’ Tryna’”.  It is basically a party song about trying to turn up.  Logic, another relatively new rapper on Def Jam delivers a rapid flow that is easily one of the best verses on this album (from chi city to the f****** bank, Sinatra money, I been frank).  That being said, I don’t love this song, and it isn’t as catchy to me as I feel like it wanted to be.  I think the best song on the album is “What Your Life Like”.  The content includes violence, people criticizing him, and how crazy his life is.  In addition to the brutal honesty in the lyrics, perhaps the song is so good because of Young Chop’s production.  The first line of the first verse: “you can’t turn up on them social sites thinking it’s gonna be alright”.  How he closes the track: “name my n*****’ names in a song, police match the faces, I do it for the Vine not knowing it’s building cases”.  An interesting theme throughout the songs is social media and the role it plays in the violence in the Chicago gang scene.  Essentially, Twitter and Instagram are very important ways to promote artists, and fans are curious about the lifestyles through pictures in addition to the musical content.  However, posts can be easily misinterpreted as insulting or personal when they are not meant to be.  Additionally, conflicts that used to happen behind closed doors are now out for the public to see.  I saw on an interview that Durk manages his own social media about half the time, and allows other people to do it about half the time as well.  I would really need to trust anyone writing under my name because if you post the wrong thing one time, it could cause quite a bit of conflict.  Social media is a double edged sword: it can add to popularity and help connect you with your fans or even your friends, but it can also lead to conflict.

Later in the same song, “What Your Life Like”, he references his frustration that 20 of his shows were canceled due to the violence at his shows and his lyrical content.  He describes it as “money down the drain” because he has children to feed.  At 22 years old, he has three children from two different women.  Durk’s clearly a fan of young ladies seeing as it is probably one of his top 2 subjects to rap about behind the violence.  A lot of girls think he is cute according to the various interviews I’ve listened to.  In fact, when he was at The Breakfast Club they read a rather crazy e-mail a female fan sent him discussing as she was celibate for quite awhile and saving herself for him, and also seemed a bit suicidal.  Keke Palmer, a talented and beautiful young actress discussed her rather close friendship with Durk in an interview just days before Durk’s interview at the same radio station. An intern at a radio station of a different interview (at Hot 97) got her hair done and was extremely excited and nervous for Durk’s interview.  In these interviews, he frequently cites his children as the reason he is staying away from violence.  He moved to a better part of Chicago and his mom got out of Chicago.  He says he doesn’t go back to the hood very often.  I’ve heard both schools of thought: once you get out you stay out completely so you don’t get hurt and you can help from a distance if you want, or you frequently go back to demonstrate how real you are and to give back.  However, I really respect that he is trying to better his life and focusing on music and his children to a significant degree.  In the interviews, he frequently references a tragedy involving a four-year-old getting shot in the head and surviving, and how he doesn’t want this to happen to his children or any children.  Yet, he does have a song on his album called Amber Alert, which is the child abduction emergency signal, so it seems like a hypocritical song.  While the content is about adults and the song itself is OK, I think the title of the song leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

The other tracks on the album are not terrible but they’re not particularly memorable or good.  There is no breakout song like “Dis Ain’t What You Want” or “L’s Anthem”, perhaps the two most Durk-like and defining songs in his career so far.  There is not a song as catchy as “Bang Bros”.  I really feel like the album could have used some giant features from people like Rick Ross, Meek Mill, or French Montana.  Some artists he wants to work with include Eminem, Drake, and Future.  If he had put songs like “Don’t I” as well as “Purge” on the album, which are recent but not on his latest mixtape, the album would have been much stronger.  Further, if he had put one of those features I just named on either of those two songs, I think the songs would have done really well.  The album could have used more Young Chop.  Overall, it was too short of an album, with only 10 songs on the regular version and 12 on the deluxe. Overall, I would give this album a “B”, and it is worth a listen, but perhaps even better would be watching the music videos of all the songs I mentioned.

While Chief Keef’s debut album and music in general is more demonic and he doesn’t seem to care about much, Durk seems like a war general making calculated statements to his enemies and fans alike.  In interviews, Keef’s aloof presence makes him seem young and rather unmarketable whereas Durk’s rather well-spoken and seems very likable, as likable as the criminal that frequently raps about hurting other people could be.  Therefore, even though he sold less albums, I doubt he gets dropped and I could see a second studio album doing very well, packed full of features, with better writing and production based on what he learned from this first album.  With his three children only being a few years old, his father getting home from prison in a few years (apparently a well-known drug dealer), Durk has a lot of personal things to look forward to.  But with his manager recently being murdered, and having lost between 20 and 30 friends due to violence over the years, danger lurks around every corner.  Perhaps that is another reason why he is called Durk.  Other than lean, he does not really drink or smoke because he prefers to be aware of what’s going on around him.  He seems very cognizant in interviews and rather sober on his songs.  As long as he continues to tour, creates gritty music videos, releases mixtapes, and stays relevant through social media and the guest features, while also avoiding violence and criminal charges, but staying loyal to his fans and friends, I could see him having continued success and growing as an artist.  It’s a lot of responsibility, but if anyone has proved they could do it, it is Lil Durk.

I'm a mechanical engineer grad and I'm starting an internship soon at a place that works heavily with PLC's and automation.

Did any of you have interns that you were really impressed with (or vice versa)? why?"

This is all very new to me, could you help?",justd0oingit,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39nmu7/22yo_lower_income_kid_now_making_65k_has_25k_in/,"Hello reddit! Long time lurker here! As the title states, I'm a 22yo kid from humble beginnings who busted their behind in college and landed a pretty nice job, which I'm grateful for. Coming from a family of blue collar workers and paycheck to paycheck living, a lot in the world personal finance was foreign to me and I wasn't told much besides ""go to school and get a good job"". Thus, here I am! I've really read some amazing, life changing stuff on here in regards to budgeting and saving from some of you so I'd love to get some opinions on my own personal financial situation (whether it be me not saving enough here or spending too much there) and how to go forward with my current situation.

**So here it goes, my financial breakdown:**

* Salary - $65,000

I also will be receiving two bonuses, have an old 401k, and I also have some cash:

* Signing Bonus - $5,000
* EOY Bonus - 9 to 10% of salary
* Cash on hand - $6,667.08
* Old internship 401k - $2,006.57 (I no longer work there and I have **no** idea what to do with it)

My current debt is as follows:

* Student Loans (Stafford) - $25,032.56 
* CC1 - $2089.77 @ 11.99%
* CC2 - $571.20 @ 22.99%

As far as budgeting goes:

* I'll be paid $2,708.34 twice monthly ($1,929.53 after taxes according to ADP) for an estimated $3859.05 in monthly take home pay
* I plan to contribute 2% of my income to get the 8% match offered by my employer, bringing my total monthly take home pay to $3781.87
* Cellphone, Netflix, Xbox Live, &amp; Gym expenses are $65.00, $17.30, $32.46, $10.65 respectively. These are the only monthly payment services I have
* Currently I plan on paying $1,020/month for rent. Unfortunately the complex I'm looking at also requires a monthly fee of $130 for valet trash, high-speed internet, and DirectTV cable
* I also want to put $450 monthly into an emergency fund

In the end that leaves me with $2,056.46 monthly in left over income. Now, I'm more of a macro-budgeting type of guy so I don't plan on budgeting all of that out for food, movies, dates, etc. *but*, I do know I want to save more than I already plan and leave the remainder to live off of. I'm just not sure how much.

The last factor in regards to my financials is a car. My job assignment will require me to move far from where I currently am and my current vehicle (bought used 5-6 years ago for $5,000 cash) is in no shape to make the drive. For that reason I plan on leaving the vehicle at home to be used by younger siblings once a mechanic gets it up to shape, they'll need it. 

As far as a replacement goes, this is the one area where I *really* want to treat myself (and have something nice to drive for once!). The exact car I'm looking at is about 29k and estimated to be 31k total after taxes and fees. Assuming I put $5,000 down I would need to get a 26-27k loan from a credit union I'm a member of and with a credit score of 741 I'm thinking I can get a pretty sweet rate.



Let's say I can get it financed at 2.89% (a friend got that recently) for 72 months. That would leave me with a $400.16 payment per month. I've also been quoted for $140-ish for full coverage insurance. Considering those two extra expenses monthly, I'd be left with $1,516.30 a month to live off of and hopefully save some more with. One thing I should say is that, since I'm leaving so far for home, I'd also like to have money for a holiday plane ticket to visit to family once or twice a year.

So, what do you guys think? I think that's everything.. Before considering a car, does my budget look sound? Where do I go from here or how can I improve/adjust it? Am I pushing my limits with attempting to get this car? I'm really not trying to buy another $5,000 used car but if I am doing something I may regret or pushing the limits of my finances, I'm okay with something cheaper. What *can* I afford? 

I know r/personalfinance can lean a bit on the r/frugal side of things (which I myself don't necessarily subscribe 100% to) but I am truly open to any and all opinions, viewpoints, and perspectives! 

One of my *biggest* fears, coming from where I come, is to make it this far and *still* become a slave to my own finances, bills, and debts. I want to be able to enjoy myself while also remaining secure. That is the stuff they don't teach in schools so I am grateful for anyyyy help!

39o1xt,215,2015-06-12,LEc² was a disappointing event...,yallahall,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/39o1xt/lec²_was_a_disappointing_event/,"Hey guys I just attended the LEc² event in Fredericksburg VA and it wasn't great. It was so bad that I left 4 hours after the event began on day one and headed home. This will be a long post so I will provide a TL;DR in the beginning but if you want the full details please read, it won't take you that long tbh. This is also a vent post and is open to debate but I don't think many will disagree with me.


**TL;DR :** East Coast convention in VA. League tournament to be held there called L.A.S.T. There were also to be famous streamers and youtubers. The event was poorly planned, behind schedule and really had nothing to do. There were little to no booths, very poor audio quality and a overall failure of an event. My team entered to play in the L.A.S.T tourney since there was a $10k USD prize pool for the top 4 teams, we were cheated out of our spot while other teams were treated differently and when we asked why we were told pretty much tough shit.


**The Actual Full Detailed Story :**


This event all came about one day at my school, Pennsylvania College of Technology in Williamsport, PA by the president of our League of Legends club. The event was called LEc² and it was going to be a large convention in Fredericksburg VA. We got a few people who were willing to drive the 6+ hours and pay $50 for tickets plus around $200 for hotel fees and food/gas to go. But this event was also hosting a League tournament and the president and I found a team to play on.


There were 20 teams in total, and the organizer of the whole event, Matt told us we would break into 4 groups of 5 and play each team in our group twice plus one random team from another group for a total of 9 games and the winning team in each group or the team with the best record would play at the event. Each group happened to have a challenger level team in it, and then a mix of other elo teams. Frank Fang Gaming was in this, Inertia Gaming, VWS, some of the players on the rosters consisted of players actively playing in the challenger scene or retired LCS pros.


My team was called Legendary Threats and we were placed in group A along with a challenger/master level team called Dreamek, two gold level teams and a bronze/silver team, my team was diamond/plat. So we looked at this as a way to gain some experience. We wound up being 3-0 and tied for first in our group with Dreamek who when we played them beat us in a 5v5 in about 32minutes. So we move to 2nd at 3-1. There was a new game each week and we stuck to our schedule of practice and playing and we knew we could have a chance at going to this event if we could just beat Dreamek one time and play them again in a tie breaker. So before our 2nd meet up with Dreamek we prepared non stop.


Fast forward to the day of the 2nd match vs Dreamek, it is scheduled for 1pm EST we showed up as a team by 1245pm EST. All of the games were streamed on Hitbox btw since Twitch wouldn't give LEc² a subscribe button. Now before I get into how we were cheated here let me go over the rules for this tournament, oh that's right there aren't any. $25 per player to enter, so $125 per team and a cash prize of $10k and there are no official rules for this whole thing.


The only source of rules we had was from a Teamspeak meeting in the LEc²'s official event teamspeak about a week or so prior to game one of the group phase. In this meeting which required but wasn't limited to one representative from each team we discussed how the tournament was going to work and have a Q&amp;A at the end. Matt summed up the meeting and emailed it to the contact emails of the teams, I was one of my team's contact emails so if I need to provide proof later on of the email I will but in this email Matt had the only rule for attendance to games and that rule was ""The team captain MUST show up 15 minutes prior to game start time and alert the admins that his/her entire team will be here and ready to play for the match start along with being in the official teamspeak for any complications that need to be discussed."".


Okay, so now you know the extent of the rules, back to where we were, my team is in the custom game lobby with the admins at 1245pm waiting for Dreamek to show up. By 1255pm they still don't have anyone in the lobby and that's when one of the admins tells us that Dreamek was playing in another League tournament and that they dropped out of that one and that they haven't heard from them all day. So we begin to wonder if they're even going to show up, we start to get excited because if they don't show and drop out then we finish 1st in our group and get to play at the event.


At 1258pm one of their players joins and apologizes for being late but also states that he thought he would be the last one in the lobby and has no idea where his team is at. We ask the admins since there really aren't any rules what happens if they don't show past the game start time of 1pm? The admins respond with every 5minutes past the start time they lose a ban and if it reaches 15 minutes they forfeit the match. By 1pm a 2nd player for Dreamek joined the lobby, and said they are going to use their sub, by 106pm the sub joins and they lose 1 ban. 110pm comes and goes, they lose a 2nd ban and now have 5 minutes before the forfeit. A 4th player joins the lobby and it's FSN Trance, I was excited because I love Nintendude and Nien so I asked Trance about them and he told me that Nien is cool and that Nintendude is the dankest memer alive.


So after the happy chatting for a few minutes its now 115pm and we apologize to them for having to forfeit but then the admins start panicking because they need something for the stream(they only cared about the stream ever and rarely ever cared about the players). So we offered to play Dreamek in a 4v5 fun game since they have to forfeit for being past 15minutes late and not having a complete roster. The admins tell us to hang on as they go and talk to Matt, they come back a couple of minutes later and tell us this. ""For the L.A.S.T event in a 4v5 you have to play and it counts towards your record, if it was a 3v5 then you could choose to not play and just take the win.""


So we say what that this isn't fair, we shouldn't be risking a free win and plus they showed up past the allotted time of 15minutes, they should have to forfeit but since you need something on stream we will play a fun game and let them grab a 5th just so its even. The admins tell us no and force us into a 4v5. Some mistakes happen, Trance played Corki, their mid played Ziggs, they wave cleared and eventually got the best of us and we lost. Pretty pissed off we stopped practicing because now we were just going to finish 2nd place since we lost to them twice.


Two weeks go by and Dreamek loses to their random team out of our group making them 8-1 in 1st place and us 7-2 in 2nd place. I contacted Matt and said that this isn't right we should have gotten that win making us 8-1 and them 7-2, we should be the ones playing at this event and not them. Matt got back to me a couple of days later after I asked him to review their decision on our 2nd game vs Dreamek and he told me that there was a ruling and it stands.


Pretty pissed off I sent Matt a strongly worded email with some advice for him if he plans on running an event like this again. Fast forward a few weeks, school ends and I move from PA to MD to start an internship. After my first week of work on my way home on Friday ready to begin my weekend I check my phone when I get settled in around 445pm. I had an email from Matt at 427pm and it was asking if we wanted to play at the event because 2 teams that finished 1st in their groups can't go and since we had a good record we were offered a spot. I was ecstatic I responded to this email right away and told Matt we would play. It felt so right like we finally got what had been taken from us. Before I had the chance to contact my team, around 515pm Matt emailed me back and said change of plans, the team we were supposed to replace is under new management and got the team together and is now going, sorry but you are not playing at the event, but thank you for being willing to.


So now we lost our spot again. Fast forward to the actual event. I meet my 2 friends from PA there and we get a hotel for a few nights. Today starting at 10am was the event, we were pumped, my friend Kyle was cosplaying as Syndra and we couldn't wait to have some fun here and forget all about how poorly we were treated. Well going into the event check-in was from 10am to 1030am and that wasn't done until about 11am, then Sky was supposed to give a keynote at 11am which got pushed back and then so did the 1st best of 5(BO5) match between two of the 1st place teams from other groups.


We met up with the rest of our team who actually lived in VA and started discussing the event and sat down to watch game 1 of the 1st BO5. It was between Team Cave Gaming, the winners of Group D and Warriors Anonymous, the winners of Group B. WA won game one and while watching the game we saw another group of guys in jerseys called Super Nova, another team who lost in a tie breaker to Team Cave Gaming of Group D. The other group of guys we saw in jerseys were Maelstrom Gaming. Having no idea who Maelstrom is I opened up the eSportsHQ website on my phone, the official name of the company running this event and hosting LEc².


I find out that Maelstrom Gaming is from Group A, and that they replaced Dreamek with a whole new roster that had ManCloud as their mid, xPecake as their ADC and BloodWater as their support. Well knowing what these guys look like and seeing the guys in the Maelstrom jerseys and not seeing ManCloud, xPecake or BloodWater I was confused. After game 2 of the the 1st BO5 we went and asked the casters who was playing in this tournament and they told us Maelstrom and Super Nova. So Group C's winners Frank Fang Gaming couldn't come and their spot went to Super Nova some how.


We found Matt at the event or well one of my teammates from VA found him and asked him some questions. Why was Super Nova chosen over us? Matt said it's because they responded to the email before us so they got FFG's spot. Okay some bullshit right there but w/e. 2nd question, why was Dreamek allowed to completely change their roster multiple times and have 5 players come to this event and play under new management with a new team name? Matt said that only 3 of their players were changed, ManCloud, xPecake, and BloodWater. And since the other 2 were on the team from the start and they beat you guys in your group they still had rights to play at the event.


Idk how this makes you guys feel but it made my teammates and I pretty upset, we were salty and a little pissed off, we worked hard for this and got cheated so badly for no reason at all. We tried to follow what little rules their were and the admins just didn't care. So after finding this information out I didn't want to be at this event anymore, there wasn't much to do since Panels weren't open, and Smash Bros didn't start till later on. There was a few merchandise booths and some cosplay but overall there wasn't really anything to do.


So I left and went out to lunch with my 2 friends from PA, we had Chipotle and then walked around the Mall for a little while. We went back to the hotel room and watched some TV and had these biodegradable balls of water meant for plants that take 6hrs to form, we pretty much played dodge ball in our room with them it was the highlight of the event and that saddest part of all is it wasn't even at the event that this highlight happened. I waited for traffic to pass and left the hotel around 715pm and got back home to unpack, and write this post. I feel bad for my friends who traveled 6+ hours for literally nothing.


This whole event was a massive disappointment. I'm actually glad that no one from my club at school wanted to go because if they did and this turned into an event with school vans and professors coming, holy shit this would've been embarrassing on so many levels. But I do want to say thank you to Sky, and the other steamers/youtubes who were there, you guys really care about the community and tried to make this event worth it but in the end it really wasn't and I am disappointed along with many others.


If you went to this event please post here about your experience and whether or not you went back on day 2. Where did you travel from? Was it worth it? Are you also disappointed?


I was told some of the cosplay's will be posted along with my friend's Syndra cosplay to the Dignitas website in the near future so if you want to see them they should be posted within a week or so.


Thank you for listening to my venting and hopefully you're on my side about this whole thing."

I know that Charlotte and Charleston have better markets but my current situation bars me from moving for the time being. All I wanna do is get my foot in the door but I can't even find an internship.
39oqxu,5,2015-06-13,"Me [28M] with my coworker [24F] of 2 yrs and former boss of 1 yr [38F], having mixed emotions about coworker leaving for new job.",embarrasingstory,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39oqxu/me_28m_with_my_coworker_24f_of_2_yrs_and_former/,"Throwaway because that's what we do here.

Background is somewhat important so please read.

**Background**: ""Rachel"" [38F] hired me at my current job. I absolutely adore her and consider her the best boss I've ever had. She taught me  a lot, which I consider integral in making me the person I am today. After working together for about a year, Rachel left my company to start her own, which is an in-market competitor for my current company, though they pursue clients generally not in my company's wheelhouse. I consider Rachel a mentor and borderline friend.

""Jenn"" [24F] has been my coworker for about 2 years. My company hired her after she was an intern largely because one of our employees she worked closely with quit for another job. I consider Jenn a personal friend outside of the office. We don't hang out regularly, but she and I occasionally go to movies and eat brunch together. We used to get dinner every Friday as a sort of ritual, but lately we've not been doing that quite as much. The point is that Jenn and I are close. Also, everyone at our small office (7 employees) knows we're close.

**Current situation**: Normally at our company, every employee signs a non-compete contract as part of the onboarding process. This non-compete prevents employees from leaving for a competitor and/or stealing clients in the market our HQ is in for 1 year. Apparently, according to Jenn, she is not bound by a non-compete because when she was hastily hired, she was never asked to sign one. Rachel signed a noncompete, but our owner decided not to take legal action when she started her company since while she  was a competitor she wasn't seen as a direct competitor as much as another company in our space. She was going after clients we were unlikely to pursue.

**The problem**: This morning, Jenn asked me for a reference because she was applying for a job at Rachel's company. I agreed at first, but after thinking about it, I was uncomfortable providing a good-faith reference considering that Rachel is both a competitor and former employee of my company. However, before I was able to process my feelings, I was already entrenched, as Rachel sent me a text message asking if I could talk with her office manager about an hour after Jenn asked if I would provide a reference. 

I felt bad about going back on my word since I agreed to give Jenn a reference, but as the day wore on, I was increasingly uncomfortable providing a reference for Jenn. I eventually provided what was a good, yet fair, reference--it was definitely good, but I was mostly honest about what I perceive as Jenn's deficiencies. Don't be fooled, though, it was a 90% positive reference. I believe my reference was very influential because even before we spoke, the office manager gave a couple of iterations of ""Rachel has spoken very highly of you, and it's nice to put a voice to the name.""

Well compounding matters is that last week I sent an email to Rachel expressing my displeasure at my current company. I feel like I've kind of stagnated and am not growing at my current company. I'm also worried about my advancement opportunities (or the lack thereof). I told Rachel before I sent her the email that I wanted to ask her for career advice, and she encouraged me to send the email. However, in the ensuing week I haven't gotten a response, though she was quick to send me a text asking if I would be willing to talk to her office manager in order to give a reference for Jenn. I will say that while I didn't exactly ""trash"" my current employer, I did express displeasure in the fact that I felt like I was just treading water at my current company, and asked her what she thought my value would be on the current market. For what it's worth, Rachel has said many times that she wishes she could hire me. One of the reasons I've stayed with my current company is because I got a promotion as well as two substantial raises (&gt;10% each time) in the nearly 3 years I've been here.

I'm currently upset with both Jenn and Rachel for putting me in a precarious  situation. Everyone  at my company (again it's a small shop) knows I'm close with both Jenn and Rachel. I fully expect them to hold the belief that if Jenn leaves that I will have had advance knowledge of her move. I'm worried that holding this information will reflect poorly on me within my company, considering they would expect me to have known Jenn's moves in advance of her telling anyone else. I'm also upset that Jenn gave me all of 1 hour's notice that she was using me as a reference prior to me being contacted by Rachel's office manager. To make matters worse, I recently went to a conference and one of my bosses wanted me to have a workshop next week where I'm expected to fill the rest of our company on what I learned at the conference. I feel very uncomfortable essentially training the competition since I assume Jenn is going to get the job at Rachel's company. I'm hurt that Jenn would put me in such a precarious position with my company in order to get a new job, and I'm upset that Rachel didn't have time to answer my email imploring her for advice, but she had time to promptly text me that she wanted to make sure I was going to give a prompt reference for Jenn. 

So the TL;DR of my emotions is that I feel used/betrayed by Jenn and Rachel in order for Jenn to jump ship to Rachel's company (which again is a competitor started by a former employee). I'm mad at Jenn for using me as a reference pawn, where she has everything to gain, and I have only downside. I'm mad at Rachel for not informing me of the conflict of interest presented when I sent her the email asking for career advice and also for not responding to my email in general. I've consulted a few friends and have gotten a mixed bag between ""You've just got sour grapes,"" and ""You're a good dude and they exploited you while leaving you with the shit."" So I want to ask Reddit: am I being too sensitive or am I justified in my emotions? I may calm down over the ensuing days/weeks, but as of right now, both Jenn and Rachel are dead to me.

**tl;dr**: Co-worker/friend leaving for new job to work under former boss who left to create competitor. I feel like I'm carrying all the risk with them bearing all the reward, but might be overreacting. What does Reddit thinK?"

39pnr8,3,2015-06-13,I [M21] just lost the love [F24] of my life after 6 months and it came out of nowhere.,Kolten_Wong,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39pnr8/i_m21_just_lost_the_love_f24_of_my_life_after_6/,"My girlfriend and I and had amazingly healthy relationship. Out of nowhere shit hit the fan. We had been together for about 6 months but had known each other for about 8. We talked every day and before I moved away for an internship, we saw each other every day. Always smiling, laughing, and having a good time. I went back to visit her for a couple of my off days from work and it was smiles as usual. Had a blast the entire time I was back and we both admitted it was painful for me to leave. Before I left though we made sure to plan out as many dates as we could that we would be able to see one another. 

About a week after this, she started getting distant, short tempered, as well as short in her responses. She just overall seemed uninterested. We talked about it and she said she didn't know what she wanted anymore. Said that since we weren't together every day now that she had some time to sit back a look at our relationship. A few days later she came back with some things that she felt were the cause of the issues. She said she needed me to be more assertive, she wanted to have more stimulating conversations, and some other very nitpicky things. I was totally caught off guard because it was just a week earlier she was almost in tears about how healthy our relationship was and how she had never been in love and loved like this before (past two boyfriends we're abusive). So I worked and worked on it and eventually went back to visit for another couple days. 

Things were kinda off but we still had a really good time. I went to a therapy session and my therapist basically said I needed to tell her how I felt and what I needed from her. So I did, and then we both ended up getting angry. She hung up and got in the shower and I out of frustration sent some texts basically breaking up with her. It turns out her biggest gripe was that we were at two different points in our lives and that we weren't that compatible even though we shared similar viewpoints on damn near everything. She also mentioned she didn't want to be the cause of making me grow up faster than I should. She said she didn't have time to wait for me to grow up. It really hit me hard that she was in love with me but wasn't willing to be there for me as a grew into a better and more mature person. It just came off as being really selfish. We had so many plans about our future and where we were headed. She's already admitted to me that she has commitment issues and warned me at the beginning of the relationship that she had a habit of doing some self sabotage on her relationships. I just want her back but at the same time I want to protect my heart.

TL;DR; I was completely blindsided by my girlfriend and I can't help but think she's running away from the commitment and sabotaging her happiness."
39pocr,40,2015-06-13,My co-worker hook-up gave me the best orgasms ever!,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/39pocr/my_coworker_hookup_gave_me_the_best_orgasms_ever/,"During my fourth year in college,studying architecture, i had a compulsory internship semester of four months. When i joined my internship, there was this guy who just joined as well, and we both reported to the same person.
For a couple of months, neither of us talked much and were actually very competitive as to who would impress our boss the most.
When we were both assigned to do the 3d model for the same project together, we finally started exchanging pleasant conversation, mostly about architecture and design. One day, he randomly asked me to go get some coffee together, and apart from some more pleasant conversation exchange, there was nothing more to report.
It wasn't until a whole month later, that he asked me to get some drinks with him.We went to a bar that is usually clouded in smoke and sat next to each other in a booth. I'm pretty sure both of us were thinking of hooking up with each other that night, as was clearly evident with him putting his arm around me, and pulling me closer and stuff. All of a sudden, we were making out, It started out pretty soft and we even laughed a little after and continued talking. 
It wasn't until an hour later, when we were making out pretty hard and i wanted to start ripping his clothes off!
We decided to leave the bar, and he invited me over to his house. 
We made out some more in the elevator, the car and finally reached his house half an hour later.
It might help to add, that i was pretty horny considering i hadn't had any sex for atleast 14 months. As soon as we go in, the making out continues and escalates quickly into him taking his clothes off. I immediately thought we'd just have fast, hard sex on his bed, and i was wet enough already to do so. He had different ideas though. 
He took off all my clothes and threw them aside. He proceeded to move me towards the bed and continued to kiss me. He slowly started kissing my neck and then moved to my breasts. He licked and kissed my nipples ever so lightly, and i couldn't help but writhe and moan in his hands. He slowly started moving towards my pussy and softly kissed my thighs.
After much teasing, he started lightly licking my pussy and would occasionally let his tongue enter. He then moved towards my clit, and started to lick and suck passionately. Having not had any clit stimulation for a while, i started to get very aroused, very fast. After only a few minutes, i came, and i moaned and grasped his hair as i did. He didn't stop licking my clit. He then started to rub my clit with his fingers and simultaneously, rubbed one of my nipples. It was a pretty cold night, so my nipples were already very hard. He constantly fingered my clit and my nipples, both almost close to being sore, while i continued to moan and writhe. I was so close to cumming, i gripped his hand and yelled out loudly ""i'm going to cum!"". I could feel so much tension on my clit and my nipples, both very sore already. I finally screamed out ""fucckkkk"" and he started to lightly lick my throbbing clit while i came furiously. I felt like i had a simultaneous clit and nipple orgasm, my whole body just lying still and feeling the depth of the most intense orgasm i've had. He then took his fully erect penis and started to stroke my pussy a few times, until he entered it. He started to thrust slowly, all while kissing my nipples lightly.
Slowly his thrusts started to become harder and faster, and i started to rub my clit again. Every thrust of his was pounding into me, and i was so wet, and so loving the fullness i felt. It looked like he was very close to cumming, and i started to rub my clit furiously. He let out a very low groan and asked if he could come on my tits. After he came, he took over rubbing my clit, and a minute later, i had a body shaking orgasm! While my clit was throbbing, he started to lightly suck it, which made it feel so much more intense! We were both so exhausted, that we kinda napped for a short while, and he drove me home later. Our last two weeks of interning, we continued to have sex in his house, and even fooled around a little at the office, twice! He left the city at the end of his internship, but we continued to sext and have phone sex/video sex for a little while. I still fantasize a lot about the night! Those three orgasms were definitely the most intense i've had so far!   "
39pofr,1,2015-06-13,I'm [17 F] confused about my ex [15 M] after the breakup.,ichigopanda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39pofr/im_17_f_confused_about_my_ex_15_m_after_the/,"So I've always been skeptical of dating guys younger than me in high school, especially since I was a senior and he was a sophomore. He (let's call him Peter) was a the friend of my original crush from junior year, and he knew I liked his friend (let's call him Jake). To be honest, Peter was not my type at all and I knew him as one of the funny sophomores because of twitter and facebook. I also heard about him a lot through my underclassmen friends, and he sounded like the class clown of the grade, but I never really paid attention until I actually meet the person.

During the summer, I started to skype with Peter everyday because of our mutual friend (let's call him Danny) and it was pretty obvious Peter liked me. Since I liked Jake, I just ignored his advances. He still kept trying, and at one point, I had to ask him if he likes me because I don't feel the same way (my friends felt so bad for him because they said he must have been really hurt), and he lied that he didn't, but I knew that he did. I asked Danny about Peter's feelings and he told me that Peter really likes me, but he's a bit skeptical to date me because I'm spending my senior year on a college campus, so I won't be at our high school so often. I wasn't mad or anything, because it was true that it would be hard to date Peter or Jake because I wouldn't see them as much in my senior year, but I always thought it's about the effort we would have to put in.

After the whole confrontation, Peter and I still remained friends and we still skyped everyday, and he still liked me. He said he would support Jake and I when the new year starts, but he would still like me. I respected his feelings and I didn't really shut him down if he made advances, because he already knows that I didn't return the feelings. When the new school year started, I felt that whatever I had with Jake disappeared because Jake didn't put in effort with me anymore unlike last year, and it seemed like I was the only one trying. Jake constantly lied to me that he was busy or that he had a lot of homework, and then Peter would tell me that Jake would be online playing League or that they didn't have a lot of homework. I guess over the summer, Jake lost feelings for me because we didn't keep in touch since he was in another country all of summer. Peter told me that Jake kept in touch with their classmates over summer, so there shouldn't be any reason why he didn't contact me.

So obviously, I started to stop visiting Jake at the bus stop and I stayed home and waited for Peter to come home so we could skype. I thought I liked Peter for sticking around, but I didn't want him to be a rebound, so I told him to please wait until all my feelings for Jake are gone and I feel absolutely nothing for him. Peter respected my feelings and he gave me time until I moved on. At one point, Peter went to visit relatives in another state and I missed him like crazy and I realized my feelings for Jake were gone. When he came back, I was so shy and I couldn't even look at Peter on skype because I was too embarrassed that I missed him like hell, but Peter saw right through me and we talked about our feelings.

We waited until we saw each other in person for him to ask me out, and during that week while we were waiting for the Friday for me to come to the high school, we were basically in puppy love. After we were officially together, we had a pretty nice relationship, but we had many many ups and downs. We fought a lot and had many disagreements, but it's not like we didn't try to fix them. We come from two different backgrounds and two different families, so our way of seeing and dealing with things really affected us. We were each other's first love, first kiss, first **real** relationship. Pretty corny, but it's true. Our relationship was like a dream come true, like something from the movies. We were young (well, we're still young) but we admitted that we felt love and not infatuation or a mere crush. 

Over time, our relationship started to crumble from our problems. At one point, his friends thought I was abusing him because my jokes were harsh or that I forced him to do my work when I told him he could do it if he wanted to, but I never asked. I only asked him one time to do my essay because I was really stressed and we fought that night, so he did it to make it up to me. I didn't like him doing my homework, but he really wanted to make me happy, so I let him. I returned the favor by making him food or comforting him (because his house is really shitty) or even physical affection (we never had sex due to our abstinence, so if anything, it was oral). And because of the house he lived in, he always brought himself down and called himself stupid and worthless, but I always tried to help him out. Of course my parents made me feel down once in a while, but I didn't need constant reassurance like him. I kind of felt tired of constantly reminding him that he's worth my time and that he's not a mistake or he's not stupid, because it would feel like I'm just a record machine. He also never wanted to do the things he wanted to do, because ""it was for me"" which would upset me because it made me feel selfish. Long story short: there was always an imbalance in our relationship because he would try to always do what I wanted or expected, while I wanted to do what he wanted or expected once in a while and he wouldn't let me. There's many more reasons to why we fight, but this was a main one.

So after 5 and a half months, he broke up with me. Oddly enough, we ended on good terms where we said that as long as we're happy, everything's good. In the end, we just wanted the other to be happy. I really wanted to be with him and he did too, but he didn't want a relationship.

After a week or two, I found out that he's talking to his ex and that he may possibly have feelings for her again and that he's calling our relationship abusive, and I knew it was his rebound because one time in the summer, he ranted to Danny and I how he never liked his ex. Also, I was in the middle of this internship for the sophomore English class (which was weird after the breakup), so Peter and his friends had to see me as a teacher and call me by my last name and I had to grade their papers and such. During that internship, his friends thought I was stalking him, when I had a legit reason to be there. Peter also started to smoke pot four weeks after our breakup, even though this boy has asthma, and he told me about it when he knows I'm not into doing stuff like that. He also ran away from home at one point and sometimes he accused me of talking shit about him when I'm just trying to figure out his feelings because it would always be mixed. If I saw him in the halls, we would look at each other, and if I tried to greet him, he would look away. Even now he's still doing that and it's been two months after the breakup.

I just question if he thought I was abusing him, or that I'm judging him, or if he agreed we're just friends, why does he keep looking at me in class and in the halls? When I try to greet him when we meet eyes, he instantly looks away and ignores me too! I'm not overthinking it either, because my friends have seen him stare at me recently. I don't think either one of us has moved on, and regardless if he's smoking or he's doing things I wouldn't like, I still like him. Yeah, people change and he's not the Peter who I initially met in the summer, and yeah he's 15, so he's going through a lot right now, but I guess I'm just wondering if there's ever a possibility we'd get back together? Even if it's not now (because I already graduated), but in the future?

Sorry if this was super long and confusing! Also, sorry if my grammar sucks.


**TL;DR**: After a nice relationship that started to fall apart after a while, my boyfriend broke up with me. The breakup was civil and nice, but the post breakup had a lot of drama. I still like him and he shows actions of liking me still, but he is really bipolar about it. He still shows he cares, and I still care too, so is there anyway for us to get back together or are we done for good?"
39q2gs,1,2015-06-13,Am I depressed? What do I do about this?,Athylus,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/39q2gs/am_i_depressed_what_do_i_do_about_this/,"A little anecdote will make my situation clear.

I've been studying for the past two years in something I chose without realizing the job I'd be doing later. I ended up really liking most of the classes, since it's mostly math and physics related subjects. At the start of the first year I went to every lesson and got 80%'s on my tests and all. From second period onward I stopped coming but still managed to make it through the first year. 

Now I'm in my second year, and I need 45 of 60 study points to be able to go on internship. However during the year I began smoking more and more weed, and living totally out of my circadian rhythm. It's gotten so bad that I barely go to classes anymore and even if I  manage to pass all my upcoming tests I'll have 44 points. Meaning I can't go internship and I'll have to wait probably another year.

Myself personally? I'm a bit of a loner, I like people but hanging out for too long drains my energy and it's hard for me to small talk because I don't see the point. I like sports, but haven't been kickboxing for 2 weeks since I was 'busy', mostly sitting on my ass and not studying. I wanted this internship though, and progress towards my graduation so I can start working. Right now I am 21 years old and I want to get out of the house and start working which could have been in 2 years but now it will probably be 3. 

So I want this. Yet I sabotaged myself by skipping nearly all classes and being a lazy, undisciplined person. I'm exactly doing everything I DON'T want to do. Smoking weed, procrastinating, fucking my study up, not working, etc. The list goes on. It makes me feel bad, and I like being alone. I'm at rock bottom now and I have very little hope and motivation left to do anything now... I need a little guidance. If you've read this far, I thank you."
39q48p,1,2015-06-13,Prestige or Practicality: Help with college admissions,CreativeLemon,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39q48p/prestige_or_practicality_help_with_college/,"I am a rising high school senior, and need some outside help making the largest financial decision of my young life: college.

I am very fortunate in two regards: firstly, my parents are very well-off and have offered to pay for my college, and secondly, I am a very good student and have plenty of options college wise.

However, as I researched and visited many different schools, I noticed that every school I'm considering fits generally into two different archetypes. Let's call them School A and School B.

**School A:**

School A is the old-money, country club, private school with an endowment in the billions, tons of prestige with employers, a huge alumni network, and worldwide renown. It has an unparalleled quality of education. I believe School A would give the best chances in the job market based on its track record.

However, School A costs $60,000-$64,000. I cannot get any kind of scholarship. My family does well enough to not get any financial aid. My parents have graciously said that they would pay for my college, but later admitted that they would not be able to handle the entirety School A's price. I would have to get a small amount of student loans to pay for School A. I know that student debt is probably the worst kind of debt to pay off, so this option is not that intriguing to me.

That takes us to **School B:**

School B is still a decent school. You may have heard of it, maybe not. It has solid programs, well-respected alumni, and is located near a good job market. Because it less competitive than School A, I would have an easier job getting spots in programs and internships. 

And here's the catch, I could probably get a significant scholarship to School B, and go there either for free or for enough that my parents could easily pay it. That means I would have zero student debt, which would be a relief. But, to make it even better, my parents have said that if I get a full ride to School B, they will gift me all of the money that they have saved over the years for my college tuition. About $80K.

So here's the picture. I could graduate from School A in the hole with a decent amount of debt, but also with the limitless potential and connections that a degree of School A affords, or I could graduate from School B with not only zero debt, but with nearly six figures in the bank from the start.

My question for you guys is: what should I pick? Do the opportunities, connections, and potential for later earnings at School A outweigh the *huge* financial head start I would have coming out of School B? Am I crazy for even considering School A? What should I do!?!?

And I lastly, I know I may come across as the typical clueless, affluent kid, and I know I am ***extremely*** lucky to have the opportunities that I have. But I've never faced a decision like this before and I fear that my naivety will lead to the wrong choice. I could really use some guidance.

Thanks for your help! "
39q5gh,10,2015-06-13,"Me [20 F] with my bf [21 M] of 3.5 years just blindsided broke up because he ""fell out of love with me"".",wavingasiancat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39q5gh/me_20_f_with_my_bf_21_m_of_35_years_just/,"We were known as the couple that could.  We were that couple where everyone wanted to have a relationship as good as ours.  We never fought because we also talked things out and were rational; but we had a passionate relationship overall.  We started dating in high school and even though we went to colleges that were 2 hrs apart, we made it work for the last three years.  We were both super busy - we both had a ton of extracurriculars and just visiting the other meant the weekend, aka 2 of 7 days, was gone productivity wise.  But we loved each other so much that we always said it was worth it and we'd never consider not doing this.

The last three weeks or so I felt like he was avoiding me.  He didn't text back as much, maybe only 10 times a day.  Even when we texted/talked, we never really ""talked"" like we had just a month earlier.  I thought he was just tired from his new internship; two weeks ago, he complained to me that I was avoiding him but I was just tired and way more busy during the day because I was at work.  I didn't bring it up because I thought it was the same as that.  We saw each other 3 times during this period- once a week.  One of those times I helped him move out so it wasn't even really a date.

Last night he picked me up from work.  We had planned that I would stay over the weekend.  But that morning he said he wanted to stop by my house first, and sat me down on my bed and said ""I still really like you- but I don't love you anymore.  I've tried, but I can't"".  I asked if he thought we should take a break and come back in a week- no; if we should work on it together - no; how long he'd been feeling this way- the last couple of weeks; did he think he could fall back in love with me?-no.  I told him I felt it but thought it was exhaustion. He confessed he tried hiding it but I knew him too well- even got the time when he started  doubting right. He wanted a clean break, and just like that, we were done.  

I'm mad about a couple things, namely that he didn't communicate it to me so I could be warned/worked on it with him, and also that I don't see that effort.  He never tried to see me more often-no difficult right now to just see each other after work since I've moved home for the summer.  He didn't try to change up our two dates (not counting moving out).  He was more distant.  It seemed more like he tried doing the same things as usual/ignoring it, and then just gave up.  Part of me feels like he let his tiring job get to him and he didn't really try at all. He said it himself, I was the perfect girlfriend for him. But in three weeks, three weeks compared to 3.5 years, and he decided it was over.  


He let me keep making plans for our summer too. We had just a month ago- literally one week before he started his job- talked about doing the long bike trail on the Cape together. We were gonna party hard for my 21st bday (which is in a week. He broke up with me one week before my 21st bday.). And he let me keep thinking that everything we had talked about- the summer, moving in together, getting married- was still going to happen in the future. Even our last date, this past Sunday, he said, ""Well regardless of what you plan for your birthday, know that I have that weekend reserved for you"".  Later I found out that he texted my friend the next day and asked her to make sure I had a really good birthday party. So that Sunday he already decided to break up with me. It breaks my heart to think that he waited another 5 days to actually do the deed.  It just breaks my heart in general.


But I'm so sad.  So so sad. He was a great boyfriend. My first serious one, the one I gave my first everything to-kisses to sex.  He was so thoughtful to me and he made me feel beautiful and he was always there when I needed him.  He accepted my very weird and clumsy self and loved it. And I just can't believe it only took three weeks for him to lose that love.


I don't know where to go from here. I don't even really know who I am; I know me myself as a person, but I've spent every day thinking about him for the past three and a half years, sacrificed so much time to go visit him, let him and me become the same person, thought of him as my other half (""the one"" if you will.  He was my best friend, the closest I've ever been to anyone and the only person who knows EVERYTHING about me.  Not to be cliche, but I lost my boyfriend and my best friend, and so suddenly too.  I'm shocked and I'm numb and I'm heartbroken.  I simultaneously can and can't make sense of what happened.  I can and can't accept that this is over.


**tl;dr**: Despite our perfect relationship, 21M bf broke up with 20F me because he fell out of love with me. I don't know where to go from here. Any advice is appreciated."

I’ve already budgeted out this upcoming school year of my expected income and expenses (costs are extremely low due to scholarships and a little help from my parents). I’m expecting to have $1500-$3000 left over after everything is paid for (rent, tuition, books, food, everything. Also don’t have a car).

I’ve been able to accelerate my degree plan so that in three years I’ll graduate with a bachelors and master’s degree. I’ll be graduating with no debt, and in my field of study likely with a high starting salary at my first job. I realize I’m in an extremely fortunate situation, and I want to take as much advantage of it as I can and not squander it.

So what’s the best use of this money? Invest it in stocks and bonds, put it in a savings account? Upgrade my laptop and such to be more productive? I’ve taken accounting, finance, and economics classes so I mostly understand the gist of the options available to me but I’m not sure which course of action I should take.

On a side note, what's the best way to deal with California taxes, and is there any way to recoup any of it? I'm still a dependent of my parents.

Thanks in advance!!

A little background on me and what I've down so far: I am 5'3"" and at the beginning of march I weighed around 150. During this time I started dealing with a tight IT band/knee issues so exercise was hard. I mostly just kept myself to around ~1000 calories per day and by the end of march I was around 142, which I've maintained since I had to move across the country for an internship. I'm settled in and ready to get started on some real work. I just bought a fancy new scale and learned that I am currently 142 lbs, 24.8 BMI, 26.0% BF, and 35% muscle mass. Now I know that my BMI is on the high side of normal, but from what I can tell my BF is average and my muscle is above average. (I also have big boobs for a small person. 36DD. Not sure if this would affect my stats. That might be a dumb question).

My goal in all of this is to lose a little more of the excess fat, maybe get down to 22% BF or so, while not losing any muscle, before I start to try to build muscle. I plan to eat at a deficit based on what IIFYM tells me, watch my macros, and work out (I do lots of yoga to help with my knee) 4-5 times a week. So I guess my question is does that seem reasonable? 

I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing so any advice or critique is welcome. Please feel free to ask questions if I forgot to add something in here. Thanks for the help!"

39qsxp,3,2015-06-13,How should I pay my credit card this month if I won't receive my paycheck until a week after my CC bill is due?,peter178,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39qsxp/how_should_i_pay_my_credit_card_this_month_if_i/,"So I just started working my internship for the summer. I'm a college student, so I didn't start off with much money before starting work. After paying off all of my rent (my landlord made me pay all of it up front for the summer) and other expenses needed to start off the summer (which isn't cheap since I'm in D.C.), I now have a credit card bill of $2,384.46 due July 9th. I have calculated all of my projected expenses and income, and by July 9, I will only have about $1,100 in my bank account. The thing is, on July 15, I will receive a paycheck around $1500 which would allow me to pay off my credit card bill. Still, I won't have it by the time my CC bill is due. So, I've considered two options and was hoping to get advice on which would be the best for me:

1. Pay as much as I possibly can on July 9 (about $1,100) and then pay the rest once my paycheck comes in less than a week. Unfortunately, this would be the first time in my life that I wouldn't pay my CC bill in full and thus would have to deal with my APR rate. My Purchase APR is 15.99%. How exactly does this APR compound? If I pay my remaining balance off within the week, is the APR interest charge less than if I were to wait until the end of the month? Or is the APR interest simply charged on a month to month basis? 

2. The other option would be to get a payday loan. I really, really don't want to do this since they are such a risky business to get involved with. Also, I can't seem to find any payday service that will give me an amount up front of how much interest I would pay for this week loan.

Are there any other options out there? Thanks again for the help, I've never been in this situation before."

I attempted the mirror jump, but couldn't last more than 10 minutes or so without backing out. I didn't see or feel anything. I tried just focusing mentally and ""releasing attention"", but I couldn't stay concentrated for too long.
I never noticed any changes is, so I figured both attemps were failed ones.

But a few days after attempting, some weird things started happening.

Things just started going right for me.

I was waiting to hear back from a job that hadn't contacted me in two weeks to offer a position, who suddenly did the next day. Not to mention, I was so desperate to move to New York with no opportunity to do so, only to randomly come across this amazing, ideal internship set in NY that lasts a year long and would be perfect in my situation. I haven't finished my final interview yet, but I've always been fantastic with phone interviews and I expect to do well and move there for the internship at the end of the summer.

Everything just randomly fell into place out of nowhere and I'm wondering if I may have jumped accidentally. I had all these ideas in mind (getting more money, moving to the city etc.) but I didn't think they would happen simply because I wasn't concentrating enough.

On the other hand, my close friend who was kind of being distant in the past, has now become like 10X as distant. However, I feel like this might be the universe preparing me for leaving in a few months by distancing myself from her so that it's not too painful.

I haven't noticed any other changes."

It's not that I don't study enough, it's just when the test rolls around I get horrible panic attacks because I'm so scared I might fail.. so I do sub-par because I'm freaking out the whole time.

The worst part is, I'm financially dependent on my parents still. They make too much money for me to get any aid and I'm going through hell with my financial office trying to get any loans. If I don't get good grades, I get cut off and I'm essentially homeless and I can't pay for school.

The fucked up thing is I don't even care about the money. I'm so desperate for my Dad's approval that I feel like if I get bad grades I'm not worthy of love. It's so fucked up because he screwed around in college and graduated with a 2.4 with an accounting degree. 

I know what I need to do to get a good job when I graduate. I need to keep my GPA above a 3.0 and be involved in clubs and get an internship or two. The problem is, I have to be so focused on grades because if I dip down below a certain point, shit is going to hit the fan. 

The worst part is he has no faith in me. Every time I come home and tell him that the pressure is killing me, he says ""what, are you failing something now? it sounds like you're warming me up to say that you're failing something"" and he looks at me disgusted. He knows about my panic disorder but he either doesn't believe me or he doesn't care. His solution is ""just take a pill"" or something. I've heard it all. As if I haven't been trying to cure it for years.

I hate it. He acts like he's this great parent because he will say things like ""I don't know why you make me out to be the bad guy, I don't care about grades THAT much!"" but then he'll look at me like a piece of human garbage when I come home with anything not up to his standards. 

Here's the kicker - I think my anxiety is sabotaging me on purpose. I think I'm so scared of failing that I *need* to fail. It isn't that I don't love what I'm doing, I do. I love coding. I love working with computers. I know this is the major I'm supposed to be doing. But there's a voice screaming at me that if I succeed, he's still not going to be proud of me, he's going to take all the credit, and he still will give me a hard time with everything. But if I fail, maybe, just maybe, he'll feel guilty for pushing me to my absolute breaking point, and he'll change.

I know that's irrational, and I wish my rational side could win out so I could live a goddam happy life and support myself and not have to deal with this asshole anymore, but he's never *really* been proud of me because he has a lot of self-hatred and sees a lot of me in him, which kills me. I've done some pretty amazing things in my short life, more than he could ever handle at my age, and I guess I'm just sick of him not trusting that I know what's best for me."

Growing up I always did really well in school; straight As for the most part, never anything below a B, and those Bs brought me great personal shame. But I also never really had to try to reach those grades.  When I reached high school, I started getting more Bs.  Algebra was where it started.  I understood the concepts and formulas but not my test scores. I always made stupid mistakes.  Forgot to carry the 2, forgot to drop the X.  On the End of Grade tests, I always did much better because they were multiple choice and if I didn’t get one of those answers I could just redo the problem.  These tests always saved my C averages and brought them up to high Bs because of how they were weighted.  The same went for my social science/history classes.  I just couldn’t make myself even try to remember specific dates. These classes didn’t have EOGs but the final projects were usually papers or presentations which I’ve always exceled at, even if I always put it off until the last minute…

When I was a sophomore, I found theatre and it changed my life.  I loved everything about it and quickly developed a taste for the design and construction side of things.  Set building, costuming, cleaning out the store rooms, sound, fly systems, and lighting.  It was all beautiful.  I even loved acting, just not as much.  I would get restless in class and ask if I could go work on my projects for theatre.  Most teachers didn’t even care because I wasn’t a trouble kid nor were my grades terrible.

Eventually, I took Honors Chemistry, which I admit was a huge mistake, but the only time the regular chemistry class was offered was during the only time that I could take a teaching internship for Theatre. My teacher hated me.  Not directly as a person, but definitely as a student.  She made a show of me in class, flaunting my bad grades, calling on me knowing I wouldn’t know how to do the formulas and then smirk when I couldn’t answer and ask the guy who did understand it all.  One day, in front of everyone, she told me that I needed to spend less time focused on my Theatre studies and focus more on chemistry.  I had a 68 in that class the day before the final.  To my teacher’s disbelief, I scored a 94 on the exam, pulling my final grade up to a 72, so I passed.  Barely

Looking back on my journals from this time, I realize that I was very depressed.  I was dealing with a substance-abusing mother and aunt that was resentful that I chose not to live with her after years of demoralizing treatment. I started skipping class and would only show up to school for my Play Production and then walk home so I got there about the time school would be out.  I’d hang out at home until I couldn’t stand it then walk down town where my favorite coffee shop and the community theatre were. This would total about 10 miles of walking a day, assuming I got a ride home later that night if I ran into somebody I knew.

Outside of school, I stayed out of trouble.  I had no interest in drugs or alcohol.  I barely had a boyfriend who was present so no sex either.  Both my mom and aunt regularly accused me of doing all of these things…my mom because it’s what she was doing at my age.  My aunt because she was told by my foster care appointed therapist that it was inevitable that that’s how I would turn out if left to my own devices.  They forced me to go on birth control (depo-provera specifically) to protect me from the sex I wasn’t having.  That also messed me up emotionally for a while and I had wild mood swings.  After that I developed really bad cystic acne and gained significant weight.  I stopped getting the shot once I turned 18 and moved out.  The issues that arose as a result of it lasted years.

The point of going into all of that, is I just always assumed my depression issues in high school were related to my environment.  I thought the skipping classes and only doing the things I loved were a result of my sadness and inability to take on more discomfort.  I was excited to graduate (and that I hadn’t ruined my chances of doing so) so I could leave my hometown forever and go to college.  

But college was hard.  I was repeating the same patterns, but this time I wasn’t sad.  On the contrary, I was amazed by the level of freedom I felt and the liberation that came with being away from my mom, who I realized in retrospect was emotionally abusive.  That being said, my grades weren’t great. I could no longer put off major projects until the night, sometimes hours before they were due and get a decent grade. Theatre classes-straight As.  I started skipping my lecture classes in math and philosophy.  I dropped my lecture class in Biology after two weeks.  I would get ready, leave my dorm, and as I was walking to those classes, a sense of panic and dread overcame me and I would just…go somewhere else.  Usually to get coffee or I’d walk downtown to see some art.

I barely scraped by in all of my classes (except for the one I dropped) with a C average my first semester.  I’m not sure how, probably because they were designed as intro-level classes to ease the transition from high school learning to college level learning.  My second semester rolled around. I ambitiously signed up for five classes, promising myself that I’d get it together and do well.  I only signed up for one theatre class.  By week two, I had dropped Astronomy, another big room lecture class, because I experienced that same panic every time I tried to go. I switched all of my other classes to theatre-related things: set design, movement, costuming. 

I dropped out completely halfway through my sophomore fall semester.  I convinced myself that college just isn’t for some people and that I was one of them, despite being labeled as “gifted” my entire life.  I got a job at a local restaurant and planned on saving money to go to school for massage therapy.  Being done in eight months was an appealing idea to me, not to mention I agree with the idea of “positive touch” being essential in peoples’ lives.  But I could never save enough money and there were no loan plans for the schools in this area.

Eventually, when I was 21, I decided to try school again and applied to a community college to work on core credits to figure out what I wanted to do.  I had become disenchanted with professional theatre, as I hated the politics, but I knew I couldn’t make a living doing community theatre forever.  Still, I somehow ended up being a theatre major there.  I only took theatre classes, despite that not being my plan. For a whole year I made straight As there, so I was confident I could go back to a university when they cancelled the associate’s program.  

I started off strong and organized.  I desperately needed general ed. requirements, so that’s all I was taking at the time.  It was definitely hard, but I was determined to succeed this time.  I’d only skipped a couple of classes because of that anxiety, but I was managing.  Then my mom struck again.  I’d held her at arm’s length for a while, and rarely went to visit, but one day my aunt called me and was desperate to arrange an intervention.  I agreed to be a part of it.  It failed.  I told her not to talk to me until she was sober for a minimum of three months and that had to include a month of rehab.  She responded by “trying” to kill herself by eating too many Tylenol.  Based on the evidence I was given, I came to the conclusion that it was a fake attempt to get my attention.  My aunt, a nurse, now agrees with me.  I shut her off completely after that.

Immediately after, my boyfriend of four years cheated on me with my best friend.  Shortly after that, my dad, whom I had very little contact with growing up because he spent most of my life in prison, accused me of just wanting his money because I had asked him if he would be interested in helping me go to massage school instead of showering me in expensive gifts that he kept giving me to “make up for lost time.”  He stopped talking to me.  I couldn’t handle life anymore.  I dropped all but two of my classes, and then eventually stopped going to those.  I was too anxious to see a campus counselor, despite them having an awesome reputation.  I would sit in the parking lot at work trying not to throw up at the idea of mindlessly bussing tables all night.

Fast-forward four years.  I have a much more satisfying job, despite still being in the service industry.  I don’t want it forever, but it’s great for the time being. I’m in a lower level management position involving cash handling.  I still make a lot of stupid mistakes, but given how structured the process is, it’s easy to figure out what I’ve done wrong. I sometimes overshare my life stories with my customers, but luckily they don’t seem to mind, since they always ask for updates when they come in again.  Some of my coworkers complain about my “baby-brain” because I developed a terrible memory while I was pregnant that never really seemed to return to normal.  That being said, I’m not sure it ever was, because before I got pregnant I was making mistakes and they were put off to me being new to the supervisor position.  
I have an amazing husband, who listened when I said I’d sworn off dating for a year after my ex in order to learn how to love myself and sort out my head.  The only time we argue is when he gets upset at the weird messes I seem to leave everywhere or when I forget to do something I promised I would do. I totally understand his frustration, and I unintentionally escalate these arguments because I get frustrated that I can’t answer why I do these things.  He jokingly picks on me constantly for losing things that I was just holding, like my keys, phone, and wallet.  That, and how frequently I “about face” when I walk into a room because I suddenly remember why I left it in the first place.

We have a beautiful daughter who has defied all odds by surviving extreme prematurity and losing a portion of her small intestine. She came home after 108 days in the NICU.  She has inspired me so much and now my life purpose is to do the same for her.  I want her to have a healthy, strong female role model, unlike what I grew up with. I’ve adopted a mindset now that my life is in my hands and only I can improve it. Since she came home, I’ve stopped giving into excuses and lost a significant amount of weight, although I have more to go (PCOS and hypothyroidism and having been pregnant are NOT an excuse!). I found a good college that would take me despite my track record.

One of the conditions for the school to take me in with awful grades (which they will remove from my record if I do well) was that I had to take a class called Learning Strategies.  This class was taught by the head of the tutoring department and writing center on campus.  She specializes in figuring out how a particular individual learns and gives them tools to make it work for them.  We did several introspective journals that we submitted to her as well as many in-class activities.  I honestly thought this class was going to be just an easy-A class to b.s. through but it really taught me a lot about myself.  For example, that I’m a kinesthetic learner and need to be able to fidget or play with “toys” in order to focus on lecture-style classes. It finally made sense that all the classes I excelled in were busy, constantly changing environments.  I honestly feel that the reason I haven’t panicked yet is because this class gave me some tools to help me stay organized. Granted, I regularly get overwhelmed by the idea that I can’t do it this time and that I’m just going to drop out again, wasting my time, disappointing my husband and daughter.

Towards the end, my professor sent me an email, in response to a question I had about our work, saying that she thought I should get tested for ADHD.  All of the things I wrote up to this point, I had mentioned in some way in our journals.  She told me that anxiety and depression can actually be symptoms of ADHD and, while she doesn’t like to just throw the term around, she felt I could benefit from looking into it because there are resources on campus that can my education journey more pleasant if it’s determined that I have it. She made sure to clarify that she is not an ADHD professional, but, as a tutor she works with a lot of people with the condition and from them she has heard lots of stories like mine.  
So, that’s why I’m here.  I decided to write all of this out to try to organize my thoughts.  I tried seeing the campus counselor but just couldn’t articulate my needs in person and she told me she didn’t understand why I was there.  I was going to write it all out like this, but shortly after we met, the school got rid of the adult counseling services on campus, so now I’m trying to figure out where to go.  I would absolutely love if you could help me figure out what’s going on in my brain.  My biggest fear is failing college a third time so I’m trying to get the tools I need before my head threatens to consume me again.

39tqxp,3,2015-06-14,Benefits of Weekend Detox?,SweetAliss,Stims,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stims/comments/39tqxp/benefits_of_weekend_detox/,"In advance, sorry this is so long.  There are questions at the end, I promise.  I just wanted to give as much info about the situation as possible.

My husband has long-term issues with chronic fatigue and ADD symptoms (definitely no 'H' in there).  He started taking Adderall a bit over a year ago, and found it very helpful for both.  He occasionally uses it recreationally for stuff like sex, but usually uses it just to treat the symptoms of the ADD and to stay awake and productive during normal waking hours (not staying up all night).  He also started on Zenzedi a few months ago because he sometimes wanted the productivity/focus without the energy, such as in the evenings.  Since starting it, he goes between the two - we've found that he sometimes gets angry in the morning if he takes Adderall to wake up, but 10mg Zenzedi gets him going with no problems.  Usually he'll take 10mg Zenzedi in the morning, anywhere between 10 and 20mg Adderall in the afternoon and early evening, and (depending on how late we're staying up), another 5-10mg of one of them in the evening.  He takes Klonopin for sleep (since starting the uppers), usually 1-2mg, and if he needs to go to bed early, he'll usually take 10mg Ambien as well.

Sometimes, after periods of increased use, he starts having issues with anger and irritability, so he'll stop for a week or so, and then he's back to normal.  During that time, he has a hard time doing anything productive, and sleeps for a long time (at least 10 hours a day, but as much as 16).  He doesn't usually develop a tolerance unless he is using it recreationally (which again, is rare).

Over the last month and a half, our lives have gone through a big change.  We had been taking a year off from work to spend time with family and becoming more active with our religious practice.  But in early May, we started getting ready to move from Florida to Utah, where we were to start Grad school.  This was a big task, and he did the brunt of the work.  Starting probably about a month ago, he was having to work all day and frequently all night packing up our things and getting ready to leave.  It was really stressful, and needless to say, he was taking more of the amphetamines and sometimes taking them round the clock.  Then he had to drive a moving truck cross-country for almost a week.  Then came the unpacking and getting moved in.  He was able to take a couple days off the meds but then had to start again for some preliminary meetings for the place we'll be doing full-time internship starting in August.  And last weekend started our grueling summer class schedule (we're leaving our house at 7am, driving an hour to and from classes, and getting home between 6 and 7pm, at which point we've got hours of homework).  Last week (1st week of classes), neither of us got more than 4 hrs of sleep a night between sunday and thursday.  This meant an increase in the meds, as well as a BIG increase in the amount of caffeine we drink (he had been drinking 2 energy shots per day most days, which comes out to 370mg).  

At this point, we're hoping our homework will be less demanding, but there are still other responsibilities which take hours out of our nights, so it's not like he can come home and crash, and take 12 hours off the meds/caffeine.  

He is taking this weekend to catch up on sleep, but I'm assuming he is detoxing from the amphetamines and caffeine as well, because he's been awake less than 4 hours in the last 36.  Usually when he takes a break from the drugs, he takes a week or so (he calls it his ""detox just to retox"" phase), but at this point that's not an option.  He HAS to be up at 6am tomorrow to start another really busy week, which means he HAS to go back on his meds.  And there's no foreseeable break in the future.

My question is ultimately, is this shorter detox/rejuvenate period actually helpful, since it's so short?  And since he has to go back on the uppers so soon, at what point should I be concerned (aside from when he starts getting really angry)?  He always accuses me of thinking I know what's best for him, which I don't - I just see what's NOT good for him sometimes.  But again, let me emphasize that this isn't for fun, it's out of necessity.  He's not abusing anything. He's still taking less than his prescribed dose of both meds.  Also, what amount of caffeine is physically dangerous?  The bottles say not to take more than 2 per day, but I don't know how accurate that is, as so many people chug energy drinks (which are also full of sugar) like water, and seem healthy."
39tt10,6,2015-06-14,Best housing solution for a 6-month internship in Tokyo,RdNetwork,Tokyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tokyo/comments/39tt10/best_housing_solution_for_a_6month_internship_in/,"Hello /r/tokyo !

This was first posted in /r/japanlife, and as their bot wisely told me, it sounds like a good idea to ask here too. Hope you don't mind the double post if you read both of these subreddits.


I was accepted at the N.I.I. (National Institute of Informatics) in Chiyoda, Tokyo, for a research internship from late February to late August 2016.

Therefore, even if I already searched for information about that by myself, I'd like to hear your opinion about the best way for me to get an apartment that would be close enough to the lab and not too expensive.

Excluding guest houses, most of the websites I found are fully in Japanese, which is definitely not very useful to me (even if I'm learning Japanese; I'm unfortunately not yet at that level, I guess). It seems that most expats going to Japan for such a period of time choose those guest houses (mostly Sakura Houses or OakHouses), which seem to be good solutions, but I'm struggling to find something that would suit perfectly. Namely:

- I'd rather live in an apartment: I don't like dormitories, and I'm not a fan of shared houses (maybe you can convince me that it's the best way ; share your opinion on this too !). I know that's it is more expensive, but I thought I could find apartments that would be okay without being greatly expensive (I didn't. Minimum is about 100kY/month). I don't really mind a small surface (I mean, as long as I can live in it. That's probably like at least 9m²).
- I'd obviously like it to be not too far from the lab, but I don't mind walking. I guess a good criteria would be that if I can go to work in less than 40-45 minutes (total), I'd be fine. Not sure though if that is a surmountable amount of time in the Japanese transportation system.

I think I look like a pain in the ass for most of you, who probably don't want to help such a demanding person, so I'll just say that I'll welcome anything that looks like a tip or a good idea, even if that means criticizing my demands (after all, I assume you are the one who know about Japan life).

Tl;dr: What is the best way to find an apartment for a 6-month internship in the center of Tokyo.

Thanks in advance ! :)

39tyjn,1,2015-06-14,Super high anxiety about an internship I don't want but should take...help!! Feel helpless.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/39tyjn/super_high_anxiety_about_an_internship_i_dont/,"Hey everyone,    

So I just finished my 3rd year of college at a pretty top university as an econ major. For most econ/biz people it's really important to get an internship in the summer for experience. I recently got an offer after applying for a while, and I'm supposed to sign the contract to accept today. IT IS SUPPOSED TO START TOMORROW. Actually it was needed a few days ago but I've just been avoiding it. The thing is, I feel so anxious about it all. I'm not so sure about my future career path, but one thing I know is I'm afraid of the 9-5 cubicle job for life, which I think is where most econ majors end up. I know this is only a summer internship but the anxiety is killing me. I don't think I can see myself in a position like this in the future. It seems like I won't like it. It's been stuck in my mind all day and I've cried so many times because of it. 
    
    
The internship is a commerce/purchasing one in a medium size company, so most of the time I'll be analyzing numbers I'm guessing. I feel like I just randomly applied to internships because I feel obliged to. If I don't get one, I'm behind my peers in terms of experience. I feel like I don't even want this. I don't even know though. What will this lead to? Another crappy cubicle job that pays more in the future? I like helping people and I know I like rewarding acts. I also don't know what I'll do this summer if I reject this. Another option is to travel a bit but that costs money and i feel SO guilty not developing myself professionally. It's an endless cycle that repeats in my head. I'm afraid that I'll end up with a dead end job hating life forever. Also this internship is a 3 month contract so I can't leave if I hate it. I just don't see myself 9-5 full time...I'm not sure if I'm just complaining. I seriously think this is affecting my mental health. I feel like I'm more of a free spirit type? I know it sounds weird, and I don't think I'm lazy per se, but I just can't get myself to sign to accept. I talked to my parents and peers about it, but all of them just say 'you're lucky, just accept. Most people don't get this paid opportunity'. I don't think they understand the distress this is causing me. I've looked at other internships, but no other seems to interest me...they all seem to be desk ish jobs. I long to be creative and not 'stuck'? Does this make sense to anyone? I'm one to overthink and analyze everything, and I don't know if I can handle this 40 hrs a week of I hate it. I've been thinking about self harm quite a bit since this is so stressful and taking over me. I've had past mild anxious thoughts throughout college so far in regards to career prospects and social life in general. Right now it's even got to the point of me wanting to slightly hurt myself. Please help me. What do I do? What can I do? Am I just crazy? What can I do to help myself? Anyone going through the same thing?"
39ua0v,11,2015-06-14,Ensnared special: mustelid spotters guide,amonbotolf,furry,https://www.reddit.com/r/furry/comments/39ua0v/ensnared_special_mustelid_spotters_guide/,"Oh, hello there. Look, I know what your thinking. Probably something along the lines of ""omgjgjghfhgh, you posted ensnared on a Sunday, it only comes out on Wednesday. well, my ever faithful reader, I shall give you the reason for this: this ain't quite ensnared. Sure, it may contain the title of that ever untruthful publication, but this is a special edition. I recently saw a post containing a picture of a ferret with blue feet. Users confused this ferret with a ferret with different coloured blue feet. As such, I decided to make this: a guide to all the notable and/or easily confusable mustelids on /r/furry. You may expect further special editions if other issue arise. Well then I'm sure you know the disclaimer off by heart, or have tattooed it backwards on your forehead, but still we must sacrifice some space to placate the nameless gods that time forgot:

&gt; warning: nothing in this post is true. it is full of half remembered events and blatant lies. we apologise if anything in this turns out to be any way correct .


Well, then. We must continue onwards. Firstly for those of you who ain't in the know, mustelids are a family of a animals . they include: badgers, otters, wolverines, ferrets, unicorns ,weasels (which are weasaley recognised) and stoats (that are stoataly different). There are not as many of these as the canine dog/wolf things that stalk the streets at night, but there are a fair few. Annoying thing is, some are bloody hard to tell from others. So,we have got examples of all the mustelids your likely to see on reddit:

* cyanfootedferret: ~~a counter terrorism operative working for the Sealand Enforcement Agencey~~ an accountant, this cute little fella is armed and highly dangerous (or should I say footed and highly dangerous). He can be told apart from others by the cyan markings on his feet, eyes the colour of an impure emerald and blood spattered on his coat (which, i might add, is a very awesome coat)

* Argent marble scratcher: if you see an otter dog ferret thing walking though walls, its either this hologram, or you've eaten some crazy mushrooms you found in the forest. You think this is the real ~~quaid~~ Argent? It is! Blam blam blam!

* the badger: contrary to popular belief, there is only one badger, he just exists in multiple places. As such, any attempt to cull badgers only results in failure. These quantum entangled badgers who share a hive mind  have only one motive: kill all humans. They are accomplishing this by collecting lots of underpants. No one knows why, but since they don't want to die they don't mention it to them. Do not approach badgers, they will steal your soul.

* wolverines: don't approach wolverines. Through some freak quirk of evolution, their skeletons are made of adamantium. No one knows why, but they are better, faster and stronger than all other mustelids. Keep yer distance from them.

* Fisk Velox: if you see an otter with a nice looking scarf on, ~~steal it nd bring it to me~~ be careful. If you see him unseaming people from the nave to the chaps with his glorious purple insect legs, and with messed up eyes, then now is the time for running. he is ~~an armed and dangerous bounty hunter who will kill all who stand in his way~~ a perfectly normal intern here at the Ensnared office. ignore him.

* john miles: if you happen to see a ferret wearing a pinstriped suit, aviators, bunny slippers and sporting a green Hawk, that is just our science, health and economics editor, john miles. no, we don't know why he dresses like that. yes, we know it looks ridiculous.

* velvet fotter: half fox, half otter (we can only begin to imaging how promiscuous that makes him, but we are guessing alot…). While only half fox, be careful of this one as its likely he will try and eat your shoe, especially if you are a Sagittarius, or its the 5th of April. No, we are as puzzled as you are by this.

* Hipster otter: don't worry about him, he's fine until Burnham wood comes to /r/furry, and plants can't use the internet. ~~yet~~, as well as him giving birth to a woman or some stuff like that.

* ?: you may see a pine marten, wearing a dinner jacket, a monocle and a bowtie. We don't know who he is. We don't know what he is doing. All we know is that whenever you see him, bad things happen. The colour of his bowtie is persimmon, if that helps


If I've left ya off the list, then… I'm sorry! I am bad jackal! Cya on Wednesday for issue 4 of your government mandated weekly propaganda.

39uhfi,8,2015-06-14,I'll break up with my boyfriend because he never gave me the intimacy that I always craved,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39uhfi/ill_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_because_he_never/,"It's June and soon it will be six years ago that I met my current boyfriend. I was 20 and he was 24 when we met.

I always had this imagination of a perfect relationship in my head. I wanted to talk with him for hours, I wanted to get to know him like no one ever did before. I wanted to share secrets and ask stupid questions without being judged. I dreamt of never losing that spark.

Once I worked at a hospital for an internship. There was only one other middle-aged man in my office. He was very nice and patient, I really liked him. My father knew him and said he had never seen people in love like that man and his wife. It was beautiful to watch him when he called his wife. His face lit up, his eyes smiled, there was a warmth and softness in his voice when he spoke with her. His body language showed complete happiness. He never ate at work so he could go home early and eat with his wife and children. He talked sometimes about her like he just met her even though they were married for a long time. I'll never forgot this.

Every since that week I dreamt of having the same. I knew it was possible, I've seen it with my own eyes. I only met once a couple like that since, so I know it's rare. Most couples make me depressed, I mean it's always the same. It starts with complete infatuation, peaks sometime and then it goes downhill with cheating and embarassing passive-aggressive remarks in front of strangers.

I wanted to have that comfort of being accepted completely, to show my ""real"" self without fear of being judged. I wanted to have that trust to build a real, deep connection. I wanted someone with an open, flexible mind. I wanted to open myself completely. 

I tried it. He never really let me in in six years. Sometimes I ""confessed"" things to him to motivate him to open up too, but it never worked. There was always a distance I couldn't overcome. We never talked about difficult, dark topics. It was six years of cocktail party small talk, nothing with real substance. 

When we fought he secluded himself completely. He'd lie down on the bed or couch and then he wouldn't stand up for hours. I learned that this was his way of dealing with his mother, who can have severe mood swings and can be quite aggressive.

Yesterday I hugged him and there was nothing. That warm, tingly feeling was gone, there was no love, it was like hugging a stranger. 

When I was together with my first boyfriend I told him how my father sometimes hit me when I was a child without any reason at all and he said his father did the same. We were laying in bed. We looked at each other and suddenly we hugged each other tight and began crying like babies.

There was a perfect connection in that moment. I know I have some problems, there are happier and funnier people than me. But for me, that moment was perfect and it was one of the most loving and intimate moments I ever had with another human being in my whole life.

I never came close to that with my current boyfriend. I always missed intimacy in our relationship. He'll always be there, alone in his head and maybe he'll never let anyone in. I don’t know why he does that. Maybe he thinks he’s not worthy of love if he shows what he’s really like?

I know that I want to be completely open in a relationship. I talk about every problem, but I also like to listen and give advice. I don’t want a human garbage can where I can dump my problems. I want it to be a two way street. 


I love to read reddit threads where people talk about how they can’t wait to get home and tell their partner about their day or how they love to share books and discuss them. How they miss their partner in a healthy way, even though they have been married so long. I want to have the chance to experience this myself.

I hope one day I can find the same.

I know the breakup will be one of the hardest things I’ll ever do, but sadly it’s a natural part of life and it’s necessary.

[Close up of screen](http://i.imgur.com/ei39G3M.jpg)

[Close up of Aztec Monster SCSI](http://i.imgur.com/PSOQ1pl.jpg)

This was bought off of CL many years ago and used at my work as conversion piece and to prank the interns. I finally brought it home as I wanted to have a perfect one that would last another 20 years.

What has been done:

1. Motherboard recapped [MacCaps](http://www.maccaps.com/MacCaps/Repair_Service.html)

2. Analog Board recapped (also Maccaps)

3. PS rebuilt/capped (yes, Maccaps)

4. Nused tube from a donor SE (less burn in)

5. SCSI to CF Adapter [Artmix on Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/usr/artmix?_trksid=p2053788.m1543.l2754)

6. 1Gb CF card from Amazon

7. Micromac DiiMo 50Mhz '030 Accelerator Card [MicroMac](http://www.micromac.com/products/diimo_030.html)

8. Asante SE/30 ethernet card (piggbacked on the Micromat) (this has the 10bT connector on the daughterboard)

9. Filled RAM slots

So after cleaning and assembling everything, getting the CF partitioned and chopped up into some manageable sizes, System 7.5.3R2 installed and apps moved over it's ready for some light use when I have the need for some tranquility. It's eerily silent now, with only the SE fan making a slight noise. Gone is the piercing whine of those Apple/IBM 100G SCSI disks.

It's in a room without any other computers (AppleTV doesn't count)."
39up7h,0,2015-06-14,Should I(25) attempt to got into a relationship with a girl(20) who is childish and i do not love?,Cydonianknigh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39up7h/should_i25_attempt_to_got_into_a_relationship/,"I am in a weird situation. 
We were friends when we were child. I am a medical intern now. Two years ago something interesting happened. Her (20) mom called me for medical advice/help bcz her daughter has epilepsy. We arranged a meeting and i re-met the most beautiful girl around me. We met 2-3 times with her mom for doctor appointments. I was shocked by her beauty, how she changed so much. 
After a while we started to talk via facebook and cellphone. Then we hang out 3-4 times. The more i know her the more i lost my respect. She didnt go to college (college is not a must for me but one must be educated somehow). She is reallllly stubburn. She is ignorant on some issues and the bad thing is she never accepts that she is wrong or it is normal to not to know everything. Plus she is a bit childish besides me(25). I met many people who are 20 and can act like an adult. She generally acts like a child.

Whatever, after those meetings i started to loosen the connection and i finally stopped texting her or calling her and replying her messages etc.
One day she called me and said to me ""we need to talk"". I knew something is coming but i never expected to be confessed. She told me she is in love with me for 7 years. She was seeing me in the neighborhood etc.(she gave some details ablut how can this happen, how can she love me even we were not seeing each other). This happened like a year ago. I told her i can not be with somebody that i can not respect. I need to find a reason to respect. I told her she is superbeautiful etc. But this doesnt seem like to work.
She accepted this surprisingly in a mature way. Then deleted me from everywhere, facebook etc. We never talked after that.
Now i can not stop thinking about her. Like did i missed a chance? Is it possible to make a girl more mature and educated in a relationship? Did you guys ever do it before? I still have the opportunity to talk to her and probably win her heart. 

tl;dr: i found the most beautiful girl but she is childish. is it possible to overcome this while in relationship?"

I only saw a brief amount of people but from what I gathered I saw jeans, skirts, dress pants and blazers without ties, and button ups but no full suits. [This](http://i.imgur.com/olrhwrb.jpg) is what I wore to the interview. I was thinking basically along the same lines as that but with [this](http://imgur.com/SS9X41k) shirt and tie combo and maybe grey dress pants and the shoes in that picture. Thoughts? Basically dress shoes + button up + tie, too hot for any sweaters or anything. As an intern I want to make a good impression

Also side note what pants, button ups, and ties would go with [those blue and brown shoes in this picture](http://i.imgur.com/Snsw4NW.jpg) I would like to pick those up seeing as I have one set of brown dress shoes and one set of black already.

39uvie,1,2015-06-14,(Abusive parents) How do I qualify as an independent student if I am below the age of 24?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39uvie/abusive_parents_how_do_i_qualify_as_an/,"Hello Reddit

I don't usually post things on here, but I need some help in my situation. I'm going to be a junior in college starting next fall. I'm turning 20 in a couple of months, and I want to achieve financial independence from my abusive family. My parents have been abusive all my life (both emotionally and physically- less physically abusive lately though), and I'm not kidding when I say they argue every day- usually about meaningless things. They blame my sister and I for all of their problems, and make me feel like crap on a daily basis. Whenever I try to make my own decisions, or do anything that anyone else would consider normal, they make a big deal about it and threaten to not pay for my school. They even threatened to not pay for it if I did not break up with my boyfriend at one point. I do not understand this because I get good grades, work, and I don't cause trouble. I know that they are not obligated to pay for my school, and I appreciate that they do. I just want to be able to pay for it on my own without having to live in an abusive situation.

I've been putting up with their abuse for years, but I just don't think I can take much more of it. I don't have a lot of money- I have a job at university and I'm doing an internship over the summer so I think I will be able to save around 4 or 5k by the end of summer. I've been taking steps to become independent of them, but I don't think I'll ever be able to afford university on my own if I am considered a dependent student. I'm opening up a savings account and I will remove them from my bank account (it is a jointly owned Chase College bank account). My boyfriend says that I will be able to move in with him and his mother if I decide that I want to leave home.

My main problem is that I can't afford to pay $3,500 per semester for school. I go to a state university and it is not as expensive as some schools, but I just don't have that kind of income. I make $8.25/hr at my student work job. I don't have any other family members living in the US because we moved here from a different country.

Do any of you know if it will be possible for me to become an independent student? Also, I do not want to file charges against my parents. I want there to be someone who is able to pay for my sister's college, and I do not want to mess that up for her. I want to be able to leave without causing too much drama.

39uyxl,3,2015-06-14,Methadone maintenance,eastbayweird,opiates,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/39uyxl/methadone_maintenance/,"Hi all,

Ive been lurking for quite a while, this community has been an endless source of entertainment and knowledge...

A little background info:

28/yo male living in the east sf bay area, CA. Been using h for the last 3-4 years, currently averaging 1-1.5g/day mostly insufflated.

 I got busted recently and was put on pc 1000 drug diversion. I really have no desire to quit but jail is a non option. My work place is a highly.competitive internship so being late or sick or absent for any amount of time means i lose out on my dream job. Ive tried doing a quick sub taper but subs dont do shit for the mental cravings and i relapsed. I think my best option at this point is trying to get into a methadone maintenance program but the ones ive found so far all keep essentially the same hours which would interfere with my work schedule. I generally work 6am-3pm. The ones ive found are open 5am-1pm and this would mean i would have to be late or leave work early every day to get my dose which would quickly leave me out of a job which would quickly leave me homeless...

Basically, I am wondering if anyone knows if there are methadone clinics that either open at like 4am or earlier or close at 4pm or later...  I have insurance (blue shield of ca) or can pay cash if they dont do insurance. If anyone can point me in the right direction i would appreciate it.

(Ps i hope this doesnt count as sourcing. Please forgive me for any spelling mistakes Im typing this on my mobile. Thank you for reading and safe nods!)

(added) *If anyone has been through pc1000 in the east bay please message me I have some questions I would like to ask. Thanks!!  "

Please Help me Plan an Awesome Week?,LegalPirate,nashville,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/39vblr/girlfriend_is_coming_to_nashville_in_a_month/,"So I just moved down here about a month ago to start an internship, and so far I am really enjoying the city.  Doing the whole long distance thing with my girlfriend and am excited that she is coming down on July 15th.  She will be here from Wednesday night until Tuesday morning, so I want to have a plan of what to do while she is here. I've already started sketching out things to do and would like your input.  I'm not running a strict schedule or anything, but do want a rough outline.  Here's what I got:  

Wednesday  

*  Pick here up from airport at night
* bring her to my home and relax  

Thursday  

* I think I'm going to have to work on Broadway from 10ish to 4, so drive her down and let her bounce around and explore while I work
* Afterwards I don't really know, thinking of going to Cafe Coco for their writer's night.

Friday  

* pack a picnic lunch and go to some nice park (not Centennial, probably going there Saturday)  
* Go out to a nice dinner.  I'm thinking City House and we could walk around Germantown.  
* Maybe grab ice cream somewhere afterwards, go to Love Circle?
* If time is good head over to a midnight movie at Belcourt (hopefully they have a good movie, their calendar isn't that far ahead)

Saturday  

* There's Jazz in the Park at Centennial from 7-10, so I really want to check that out and go dancing
* Maybe hang out at a nearby bar afterwards?

Sunday  

* I got nothing so far

Monday  

* Wake up early and drive to Cummins Falls to hike and swim. Grab lunch in Cookeville and head back.  

Thoughts? I appreciate any and all input.  I feel like there is more I need to do but am unsure.  Gotta fit some hot chicken in there somewhere.  Thanks in advance!"

39vp4f,1,2015-06-15,Internship Anxiety,cinematicc_,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/39vp4f/internship_anxiety/,"I started working as a graphic/web design intern about a month ago in a medium sized company.

In the semester prior to this, I had been working extremely hard,balancing school work and my retail job while also sending job applications everywhere downtown. I knew that I was ready for an internship and did not want to return to retail this summer. I hit a few unpleasant ""obstacles"" in the job application process - mainly interviews gone bad, which motivated me to land an internship even more! I really had my mind set on what i wanted to do and could say i was ""relentless"" in sending out job applications. Eventually by the 2nd last week of school where I could say I was just about to call it quits, my hard work payed off; I got hired, and started working one week after the semester finished. 

Fast forward a month later, i still don't feel like i've settled in properly. I'm having an extremely hard time connecting with my colleagues at work and fitting in in general.  There's constant pressure for me to do extremely well. One of them being that there are other Uni students here who honestly seem far more skilled than me. As much as I push myself, i cant keep up. I've already finished 1 project for my director and he didn't seem to happy about it.

Now i'm fearing i may lose this internship due to low performance and incompetence. I feel like they're expecting me to produce the same quality of work as the other students - even if they're in upper years. Couple that constant worry with a near 2hr commute everyday and an online elective... at this point i just feel extremely drained...

TLDR: Like i said, i'm extremely worried i'll lose this job after all my hard work (even if it's an internship) and will just be discouraged afterwards to try it again.My google history is riddled with subjects like ""Fired from my internship"" and stuff similar to that..I was really looking forward to this summer.

I'm getting my research and data analysis skills from school while I'm getting my computer skills from work. I'm currently interning at a major multinational telecom company as a web dev/design intern, so do actually have HTML/CSS/design skills and I'm learning more backend stuff this summer. I know now is a good time to apply for fall positions, so I was wondering if I could get some feedback from someone who's already working in the web design/development areas at UNT on what I can do to not be dismissed directly because of my major?"

Should I reach out to her?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/39vxgn/22m_ended_15_year_relationship_while_she_22f_was/,"TL;DR: Was in 1.5 year relationship, broke up with ex while she was overseas on internship. It has been 2 months, she has been back for a month and I miss her. Not sure if I should contact her. 

NOT TL;DR: 

I'm 22 and this has been my first ""serious"" relationship, one where I have loved my SO and I could see a long term future between us. I'm also a dunce with relationship advice, hence why I'm here. 

I graduated in the fall and took my placement exam for Gradschool after the new year. My relationship with my gf at the time was shaky... we fought a lot, but made up. On New Years eve we were arguing a lot and I started to feel some anxiety. I asked if we could step outside and she really objected and I felt like it was because she didn't care enough to. Her sisters friends all told her about all of the cute guys she would see overseas on her trip in the upcoming month and it was all right in front of me, which really bothered me. 

Finally, after someone started blasting music and everyone started dancing, we went outside and talked. I told her I wanted to be clear from now on and to settle all of our past arguments. We talked about all of our disagreements in the past year and we agreed we had to be positive, especially if she was going overseas for a few months. 

Suddenly our days went by smoother and we communicated so well, it was like a switch had turned and we were on good terms -- even when we argued it was peacefully resolved. 

She left for the trip and immediately it became more difficult. It was harder to reach her, as we were living on different hours and we both had work, but I tried hard to make it work. I would stay up a little later to chat with her and she would call me during my lunch breaks. 

Things began to turn ugly as our fighting began again, usually over miscommunication. One day, she accused me of going on a date with a girl (I'll call her Susie) she thought liked me. I told her honestly, not only did we both (Susie and I) snapchat the same restaurant a day apart, I had not seen Susie in weeks. She didn't believe me and argued for days, which quite frankly made me suspicious. The age old idea that when someone accuses you of a wrong doing might signal they are feeling guilty of it themselves, perhaps to justify their own -- in this case, alleged cheating? 

She finally calmed down after a few days and we were having a chat during my lunch break. I was awfully tired that day in particular because I had stayed up talking to her and I had a huge workload that I remember particularly well. Unfortunately, I didn't seem as interested in what she was talking about as she would have liked and she dropped this on me: 

**""Maybe I should just be going out instead of wasting my time. You clearly don't care anyways.""**

That echoed in my mind and I responded with ""fine."" 

She texted me a while after apologizing, but it had done its damage and I was furious. I ignored her for 3 days, something I never would have done because I just enjoyed talking to her --- up until then, that is. I got a text from her on the third day saying ""Did you delete me from Snapchat? I can't see any of your snaps...""

I had not. I told her. This only drove her to ask if we were even dating anymore. I thought for a second and it occurred to me I was no longer interested in our relationship. Yes, after 1.5 years, I was just tired of fighting, tired of the stress, tired of walking on eggshells when she was upset, taking blame for anything that went wrong, etc.

I told her we should break up. Now, she was continents away and this was all mid conversation.... so I had texted her saying this. She immediately calls me in tears telling me we shouldn't, if anything we just need time alone. I told her no, it was time that we had a clean break. I tried justifying it by saying it was because I was a distraction to her work and she instead took it to mean I broke up with her based off of her poor scores on the placement test (we had taken the same test). I explained I still loved her, I just knew I didn't want to be with her because it caused both of us a mutual stress and that it just would get worse. 

She didn't take kindly to this, but I answered her calls regardless. One was the crying, one more later was in tears in anger. Finally another a day later in tears, begging for forgiveness to which I almost just gave in to... but I stuck to my gut and I stayed on the line with her. I love this woman and I told her I wanted her to be happy, but I told her we just didn't click and it was heartbreaking for myself as well. 

She called again the next night, but I was asleep and I missed her call. I called back and she told me never mind. 

We hadn't talked for a month and she finally returned. I texted her saying we should talk, not as a gesture of getting back, but as closure and just to calm things down. I was sure that she was upset and I wouldn't blame her for not wanting to see me. She agreed to meet, but later went back on it angrily saying she had seen my true character and never wanted to see me again. That was on April 15th. 

 
It is now June 15th.

I miss her and I really want things to be good between us. I'm not 100% sure I want to get back together, but I do know that I miss our friendship and I really don't like that she now basically hates me. Of course, this is out of my control, but I really wish it could be better. 

I know it would be best to not talk to her unless I was sure I wanted her back, but something tells me even if I did go for it she would definitely not be okay with it. 

As an outsider reading this, should I reach out to her? Would I be disrespecting her healing process? Am I closing a window to make this work if I just don't say anything?"

It's 1 in the morning and I just got off work, second glass of wine already down the hatch. It's the only way I can fall asleep lately even though I've never been so tired in my life? Weird... have to wake up in 6 hours. 

Right now, in my daily life I work 30 hours a week, have 25 hours of classes a week (excluding any assignments/projects done outside of class) and I spend about 20 hours at my internship. I am so fucking burnt out. It's been 9 straight months and I've got 3 more to go. I am starting to lose my mind, to be perfectly honest. On top of having dislocated my knee cap a few months and and recently being told that I've got fairly severe anemia, as well as a parasite I picked up while travelling in what seems like another lifetime ago, it's no wonder I'm so fucking tired. Any amount of stress is almost debilitating at this point. My mind has no more will to deal with it. I feel like a fucking brat for feeling this way though. I've got a good job, good school, and I even landed myself the perfect internship, yet all I want to do is spend a week re watching every season of seinfeld. I've got a loving partner at home who is also busy, but when it boils down to it I am so fucking tired and unhappy. I know that there are many people who have worked harder and done more, but I'm not one of them. I need my rest. My brain's so foggy. 

I have had a long history with depression throughout childhood and my teenage years, I can feel the disease creeping back into my life at this point. A part of me is scared that it will take over. My anxiety is full throttle and I depend on alcohol to put myself to sleep. The only reason I don't let myself hurt myself is because I'm worried my partner will notice. No. I know she will.

39w90v,4,2015-06-15,Magnifying a graphics draw Panel,omaboy,javahelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/comments/39w90v/magnifying_a_graphics_draw_panel/,"Hello,
I created a 'ms paint' style application which uses graphic methods to draw shapes in different colors on a graphic object.
I would like to use this for my next program and I was able to embed it´s Content Pane in the GUI still maintaining full functionality.


Now here´s the part where I need some help.
I want to use the draw functionality to create low res graphic objects (200x200p), but I would like the drawing area (canvas?) to be bigger than 200x200p and to be scaled down afterwards to the small res graphic.

Now when I just draw on a 800x800p canvas and then scale it down with the graphic intern methods most information is getting lost because of the 1p wide lines getting scaled down to nothing.

So I was thinking of either magnifying the small drawing area to a satisfying size, so the user actually only draws a 200x200 picture in a bigger user interface (so the pixels get displayed bigger like magnifying your browser with ctrl+mousewheel).

The other option in my head was to somehow change the drawing thickness, so the program fills 4x4 pixels instead of ony one pixel for drawing commands. Then i hope i should be able to scale it down from 800x800 to 200x200 without losing informations.

Do you guys know if there´s a way to implement any of the two options or is there even a better option available?

Cheers, omaboy

Help/advice wanted",how_sweet_it_is,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39wbcg/me_21m_with_my_girlfriend_19f_9_months_been_a/,"So its been a rough start to the year for me and my girlfriend to put it lightly. We started going out beginning of October last year and the first 3 months were great, amazing in fact. Then shit started to go wrong.

First we found out she had to go to hospital because of some intense stomach cramps, we found out she was pregnant and after a month of frequent hospital and doctors trips she got an abortion. Bear in mind this was whilst we were studying so she missed out of a lot of classes but thanks to a lot of late nighters she managed to pass with about 75% overall for the semester.

Then our contract with our student accommodation ended and it took us a month of couch surfing, back-packing and calling in favours before we found a place to live.

Now our course requires us to do 6 months study then go on a 9 month internship before we start studying again. Since my girlfriend had so much catching up to do it she wasn't able to get one for 3 months which was unbelievably stressful and meant she pretty much spent nothing to do for 3 months.

This all lead to us fighting a lot more than we have ever before and its starting to strain the relationship. Shes been moody and grumpy and unaffectionate, whilst ive been constantly tired, dickish and pretty insensitive. She's said some means things, ive said some mean things and although we love each other it just doesnt feel like it did before.

Everybody is amazed were still together after everything we have been through but honestly we've had some pretty bad fights lately and I just don't know if we can survive.

I guess I just want some advice from people who have been through similar situations as to what do you do when you want to stay together but you're so tired of all the stress.

TL;DR Been through a few hellish months and want to know how to make it through together.

39x9ix,1,2015-06-15,College graduations are supposed to be a good moment in a person's life. Why do I feel the opposite?,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/39x9ix/college_graduations_are_supposed_to_be_a_good/,"In about 26 hours from now, I’m supposed to be starting what’s expected to be one of the best moments of my life – college graduation. It’s supposed to be a time where people celebrate and feel happy about moving on into the next chapters of their life, whether it’s more schooling, joining the workforce (while having $100,000 in debt in some cases) or following whatever dreams still exist.

If it’s supposed to be a good moment in a person’s life, then why do I feel the exact opposite?

All this graduation ceremony stuff has done is cause stress, mental exhaustion and sadness. I’m expected to act completely fine and happy when my a-hole of a Father comes from Florida in five hours to see me for the first time since 2012 for this graduation ceremony. I’m supposed to act like this past year hasn’t been absolute hell, from having my Grandmother die to moving into her house to having hundreds of mental breakdowns. I’m being forced to hide the fact I’m gay from my Father by my idiotic and annoying Mother who expects me during all of this to simply smile and let my Dad spend the night at my house, something she planned two weeks ago and expected me to agree to him staying here. All of this is supposed to be happening the day before the one year anniversary of my Grandmother’s (and my happiness’s) death when she was the one who cared about my schooling more than both of them combined.

I wasn’t even planning on going to graduation until two weeks ago. I had been told by people in the optional third-year that most people skipped graduation last year, but I found out the exact opposite from my program coordinator when I told her I wasn’t coming. She was disappointed and said she “wanted to see me walk across that stage” tomorrow.

I’m lucky I can even graduate this year in the first place. This year was the second year taking my two-year converged journalism program. I was expected to excel the whole year with straight As and produce the best broadcasts possible as the co-lead of our school’s news radio show on a weekly basis.

I had all this expectations coming into last September and ended up falling flat on my face.

I ended up missing multiple assignments for almost every class and went from being a sociable person (despite having Asperger’s Syndrome) and wanting to work every day to not trusting anyone in my classes and being unable to get out of bed most days. Soon, I had to drop my co-lead position and take a month off of my internship during first semester. By December, I had a mental breakdown while trying to write a cover article for HockeyNow Magazine and went to the hospital three times in three months to get help. By March, I had been there six times and the hospital refused to treat me anymore because I didn’t go to the small mental health clinic they sent me to (I had no time to do so unless I skipped class daily). Now, I’m unable to get help for at least six months because none of the psychologists or physiatrists in my area are accepting new patients. In Canada, it seems as though you’ll only get help for mental health if you either A) try to kill yourself, not just say you want to do so or B) are extremely crazy.

During all of this, my GPA started to suffer. I went from having a 3.9 GPA to about a 3.2. I also failed an online elective course, the first time I failed a class in my life. I was lucky I could get an online tutorial course to make up the credit, or else I wouldn’t had been able to graduate until January 2016.

Basically, in the past year, I’ve deteriorated from being confident, happy and able to pass off as normal to being an autistic social freak. I’ve gone from loving attending college to dreading going to classes. I can’t trust my family or any friends I have left anymore, let alone myself. I was supposed to never even make it past high school according to my doctors when I was five, so for some, my “drop from grace and mental stability” or whatever you can call it is probably not much of a surprise.

Right now, I feel like breaking down and crying. Heck, I’ve already done that four times in the past two days. I’ve already contemplated stabbing myself in the wrist or stomach with a dirty breakfast knife and smashing everything I own in my house this morning. The stress of tomorrow and my future is getting to me.

This year has been so full of bullcrap that I don’t know how to see this graduation ceremony as a good moment in my life. Am I supposed to be happy about not having anything to do with myself until next September? Am I supposed to be smiling about having no real friends or people I can trust and being isolated in a house for a majority of the summer? Am I supposed to look on the bright side when I can’t see where I’ll be in two days, let alone two years or two decades? Heck, I can’t even see myself anyone other than working as a Walmart door greeter or going to college still in 10 years due to the stress of daily life and constant burnouts eating away at my brain.

College graduations are supposed to be a good moment in a person’s life, but for me, I’m dreading every second of it, because as soon as the music stops and I walk out of that banquet hall tomorrow, I’ll still be a hopeless idiot who means nothing to the world."

How do I become better at saving?",Radcliffes_Asshole,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/39ygj7/im_not_in_debt_but_im_sick_of_having_no_money_in/,"TL;DR since this got long: I don't have any debt, but I'm terrible at saving money and way more dependent on my parents than I'd like to be. How do I save more of my money? What are ways to stop myself from spending it?

20 yo college student. Like I said I don't have any debt besides plenty of student loans, but that's mostly because I don't own a credit card and don't have a way of getting into debt even if I wanted to.

However, I'm sick of constantly being poor. My parents don't *mind*, but I'm tired of having to ask them for money, or ask my girlfriend to pay for my dinner when we go out. I have literally zero dollars in my savings account. I quit my food service job in November, and couldn't find another one until February so that completely ate through any money I had saved up from that. The job I found only gave me 5-8 hours a week, at minimum wage, so I was getting like 75 dollar paychecks every two weeks - so I left the school year with no money in savings either.

What brought this up was an ER visit that I got a bill for - my parents are kind enough to still cover my medical expenses, but it made me realize that if I had an actual emergency I needed to pay for, I just couldn't do it without there help. All the big things I need or want to buy - a new computer (need), a new set of skis (want) - it feels like I'll never be able to buy because I'm just so bad at saving.

I make ~500 a week over the summer at my internship, but a good chunk of that gets taken in taxes so realistically I probably have 800 every two weeks. I want to learn how to save it so I can buy my computer and pay my parents back some money I owe them, but every time I set aside money for it, I end up needing it instead.

I keep meaning to download YNAB or something like that, just haven't gotten around to it... but I need more than that. Even if I put $100 of my paycheck into savings and say ""this is not going to be spent"", in a week and a half I've run out of money and I need to buy gas and food that that $100 gets pulled out anyways.

So - people who weren't necessarily in debt, but were terrible at saving your money. What changed? How did you learn to keep your money instead of buying things? I love spending money way too much, and ideally I'd like to learn how to save it before I have to become truly independent and get fucked over by real life."

I've written mid-term essays way shorter than this.


I met a girl a little over a year ago at the beginning of summer and fell for her immediately.  By our third date I, for the first time in my life, thought she could be the one.  After a few dates she said that before anything more serious she had to tell me some stuff about her beliefs and her family.  Turns out they're a really religious family and she and I had some conflicting views about a few things. I figured every couple has their bumps, and proceeded.

As summer progresses I fall more and more in love with this girl.  She tells me that she's moving and transferring to a different school in August.  I was upset, but it's only 2 hours away so we'll still get to see each other.  

After she moved, I'd go see her and spend the night once or twice a week and things were great.  I loved her and she loved me. She loved the way I'd treat her, and I loved the way she'd treat me.  We'd always get each other little gifts and leave little notes sitting around.  A damn near perfect couple in my eyes.

She showed me around and I really started to like the town and the school so I decided to transfer there as well to finish my last two years of my degree (it's a better school anyway) and to be closer to her.  Bad idea.  As soon as I moved it immediately became apparent that I'd made a huge mistake.  My second day of my first semester there she tells me she's going to be in New York all summer for an internship then got all pissy when, even though I was really happy for her, I wasn't just jumping up and down on the table at the fact that she'd be gone all summer, for our anniversary, for her birthday, and for my birthday.  

From that point I started to spiral back into that wonderful abyss we call depression.  I have dealt with it probably since middle school, trying all kinds of different medications.  I had finally found something I thought was working and made me feel great which is how I ended up meeting her in the first place.

The combination of being in a new place knowing no one, then finding out that the one person you do know, who's supposedly 'always there for you' is going to very far from there for you hit me really hard.  After that we started to argue more and more and spent maybe one night overnight together my whole first month there. She either always somehow ""had to study"" for 12 hours a day or had some reason to not see me, which made me feel totally neglected. I still went to class, but apart from that at this point I'd pretty much just sit in my apartment by myself most of the time.  Nothing was fun to me anymore.  I lost all interest in music, the sports I play, any social activities. I don't have any friends here except for her, and we just keep fighting now. All I wanted was to curl up in my bed.  She knew I was struggling with it and would sometimes try to help then just get really frustrated when she couldn't magically make me feel better in 10 minutes.

One night I asked her to spend the night and she said no, she had a friend over.  I asked if I could just see her for a minute, again no.  

It really upset me so I just said ""okay."" and left it at that.  She kept texting me that night and I didn't respond for a little while... which turned into ""Why are you always ignoring me?"" ""I'm sorry it's all my fault you hate it here."" 

The next day I asked her to come over and she did.  While we were sitting there I pretty much broke down in tears and told her exactly how terrible I was feeling, how upset I was about her not wanting to see me, why I'm always so quiet or it always seems like something's wrong.

To which she replied ""maybe we should just be friends"" 

I just hugged her and said okay and sat there and cried my eyes out for the next few days.

Once I was over that initial sadness I really thought I was perfectly fine for a few weeks.  I tried to talk to some new girls and tried to make a few new friends.  After about 3 weeks it hit me how hurt I really was.  I was just pretending to be interested in these girls and people I had nothing in common with to make myself feel like I'm not alone.  

Then I discovered that even though I was alone, thanks to the liquor store down the block, I could at least be numb to it which is when I started drinking.  It made life bearable again.  The days were still tough and seemed to drag on forever but at least I could look forward to getting home and making a drink, then another one, the another one, then straight vodka until I can fall asleep basically every night.  

One night I was embarrassingly drunk and got upset over something she said online (stupid...I know) and did something I'll always regret and never stop kicking myself for. I sent her a message that, to this day, I hope I never have the opportunity to read.  I woke up the next morning and realized what I'd done so I sent her another message sincecely apologizing for what I had did the night before and asking if there was any way I could fix it.  She told me to never try to contact her again.  

I probably deserved it for being such an asshole.

So it's been about three months since we broke up now, I still live alone in apartment that always reminds me of her, somewhere I don't really like, where everything reminds me of her, and I can't really take it anymore.

Since then I got a job I do enjoy to occupy some of my time and keep me busy, but since it's summer I don't have class so I still have a lot of time to sit around, over think what I'll never be able to go back and fix, and feel like shit about it.

I know there's no point in beating myself up over it anymore because it doesn't help at all, but it hasn't left my mind since it happened.

I've tried to get over her.  I've tried talking to numerous girls and it always ends up with me realizing that no one will replace what I had and make me feel exactly like that again.  

The old (well, not really) adage ""The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else."" is not by any means true all the time.  I got with a girl and it just felt wrong.  Almost disgusting in a way.  After I got home from her place I felt like a horrible person and like I was just trying to use her to forget about my ex.  She was well aware of that because the whole reason that happened is she had asked about my ex and I told her the situation and that was her solution to forget about her.

I go to work whenever I have to, but other that that Reddit, reruns of tv shows, drinking, and staring at the wall are about the full extent of my daily schedule.

I don't find joy in the little things in life that used to make me happy.  I don't even find joy in the hobbies I've invested thousands of dollars into and have always loved.  I feel like I've lost most of my old friends, one good friend has been there for me so I go visit him and his girlfriend at their place whenever I can, even though he's two hours away.  Even that makes me kind of sad though, seeing them together and happy, probably on the verge of getting engaged.  I'm happy for them, but it's tough to see right now.

I try to go out and do stuff but always end up spending 5 minutes wherever it is then going home because I'm not having any fun and don't know anyone there.

After battling with depression for so long then finally getting over it, followed by meeting her and our whole relationship, it feels hopeless to be stuck back here again. I'm sick of dealing with it. I'd honestly never kill myself because I know it's selfish and will just lead to me hurting more people, but I'd almost gladly welcome being blindsided by a bus that I never saw coming.

The only time I really feel happy anymore is when I'm doing something potentially dangerous and adrenaline pumping, like riding my motorcycle.  There I'm kind of in my own little world.  No one can see into my tinted helmet visor, so I can kind of block out the world, go fast, and feel some sort of thrill again.




**TL;DR** Fell in love with a girl, she moved, 6 months later I moved to the same town/school, soon after we started arguing a lot more and broke up, now I'm extremely depressed again and can't get myself to leave my apartment except to go to work."

39z62r,1,2015-06-15,I'm [22M] dating my Girlfriend [21F] of 2 years; trying to fix the potholes we've created.,Cobra1951,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39z62r/im_22m_dating_my_girlfriend_21f_of_2_years_trying/,"I'll get to the points of the relationship because there is way too much detail. 

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years now. We met in 2012 when she was ending a relationship with a guy I knew who was really messed up. I liked her a lot and we started having feelings for each other; only problem was, I went to school out of town. As the fall semester progressed, she started getting distant from me even though I'd come to visit her (we weren't even dating yet). When January came around and it was time for me to start the spring semester and leave again, she basically told me to take a hike.

I got on the road heart broken and moved on with my life. Didn't talk to her after that. Then once April rolled around I got a short text from her telling me to check the mail. She had sent me a letter telling me how much she missed me, how much I motivated her to go out for her professional sport team dancing dreams, etc. At first I was really apprehensive because I didn't want to hear from her again. Then I opened up when she said she would be in town for a graduation. We met up, long story short, love was rekindled and we got into a relationship when I was back home for July and August.

Things went absolutely great. As winter rolled around about 5 months after, we started having our first little arguments. They were about jealousy. Me having a few girl friends, her having a few guys friends (I went to her work Christmas party and found out one of her coworkers was a guy she was involved with when we didn't talk...and she called me his name by accident!). 

She didnt want me talking to a couple of the girlfriends I had, I told her how the few guys she talked to were REALLY friendly and what not. We argued over social media, really immature stuff. This went on for all of 2014 on and off. Fights getting progressively worse. I would travel and spend lots of money on visiting her and even going thousands of miles away to watch her dance (even though I was pretty broke). I decided to expedite my college graduation and finish up in Dec of 2014 so I wouldn't have to be separated from her again and I could move back home. Did that this year, then in Feb of this year she went behind my back and applied to move to LA for the Disney Internship after I made the decision to come back home which in of itself was partially messed up (even though it'll be a great opportunity for her). 

Now going back to the jealousy problem, no one should tell their S.O who to talk to or be friends with. I never did BUT there was this one guy my girlfriend was ALWAYS talking about, she was best friends with him on SnapChat, she hung out with him EVERYDAY at school, she texted him, FB messaged him, came home and talked about him to me, every day all day and I never really thought any thing of it. One day I talked to my best friend about him and he was like oh yeah that guy screwed up my cousin and his ex girlfriends relationship. It hit me like a train and I confronted my girlfriend telling her I backed off from all my female friends yet now I realize you're always talking about/talking to this guy and it REALLY bothers me. That's all I told her. I barely found out that she went and blocked him and also told him to stop talking to her when I thought she was just going to ignore him or tone it down and leave it at that.

So now this friend who I knew years ago (never interested in) started messaging me and making small talk. I always told my girlfriend when she did message me and all of a sudden she got upset; asking why this girl came into my life all of a sudden, blah blah. Every time we've fought since April she throws this girl in my face saying go date her, I can be with her, I can talk to her, etc. etc. I don't even like this girl, I'm not attracted to her (shes 2 years older than me, almost 25 yrs old). My girlfriend even messaged that girl when we fought and said she can have me now...WTF....

We had a horrible argument this past Tuesday and today is the first time my gf talked to me about it. It all boils down to that girl. My girlfriend said I need to block that girl, why can't I even do that for her. She told her guy friend off for me and I cant do the same. My girlfriend pretty much wanted to break up over it and I talked some sense into her. I don't talk to this girl, I don't like her, shes no where near as attractive as my girlfriend, but it doesn't get through to her. We fixed things and my girlfriend is opening up to me (this is as of 4 hours ago) but I don't know if I should block this girl to satisfy her and ""close the door to communication"" or just tell my girlfriend deal with it. I never told her to do what she did to that guy and to be fair, I don't talk to this girl, I haven't hung out with her at all, I don't even have her number! It's just the facebook messages that bother my girlfriend. I don't know what to do...


   
**tl;dr**
-Girlfriend is jealous of a girl that I know who occasionally facebook messages me
-We've been fighting non stop and my girlfriend basically said things wont be normal till I block this girl
-Girlfriend blocked one of her guy friends that  she always talked to him, hung out with him, texted him, messaged him, talked to me about him, etc. and I said it bothered me
-Now she expects me to do the same for this girl that I don't talk to, hang with, have her number, or anything. Shes literally just a friend on FB...
-Now not sure what to do; I don't want to look like a jerk but I just want my relationship back...

PLEASE HELP.

it always starts off, ""we think you're a really good candidate and the staff really enjoyed speaking with you but we cannot move forward with you at this time, there is nothing you did wrong per se."" 

This has happened within the past 5/6 interviews, it's becoming really discouraging and I am losing motivation to do anything.

I have an okay GPA (3.5 overall and 3.5 in accounting) 

I have good internship experience, 

1. 1 small firm public accounting

2. 1 industry fortunate 500

3. 1 not for profit 

Also have good extracurricular and volunteer experience 

the latest rejection was from an SLP at a regional firm, I connected very well with the partners and most of the staff but the recruiter told me the above statement, and literally said she could see me at a big 4 firm rather. this was my #1 choice as well... which is why i am starting to panic, i thought i honestly had a good chance.. 

I've spoken with some of the career services, they say my interview skills are strong and I am overall a pretty sociable person. Hearing this is not helping me, I don't know what I am doing wrong and I am starting to panic because I graduate in December, only 1 more opportunity for meet the firms. I am also geared towards tax and have no interest in industry.

39ze7q,2,2015-06-15,So I had a moment of clarity after experiencing pretty bad (but temporary) panic.,staticrank,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/39ze7q/so_i_had_a_moment_of_clarity_after_experiencing/,"I just started an internship this summer, which has been pretty huge for me. A year and a half ago I was pretty much bedridden. I would panic walking down the street. 

Anyway, I got on an SSRI, got back into school, and somehow found my way into a really great internship program. I get very anxious in new situations around new people, so it's been rough trying to adapt. 

Well, today was a sort of breaking point. I have developed some sort of claustrophobia and of course, I pick a job where I occasionally need to work in the company data center. Unfortunately this is in a highly secured room so I need an escort, and it's in a basement area. For some reason when I can't see windows or the outside, I get very, very nervous. 

So, I really panicked. I felt like I was going to pass out. My face was bright red, I was sweaty, I felt cold and hot all at once, my heart was racing, I felt like I couldn't breathe. This lasted probably 20 minutes, on and off. Sort of like waves of panic and anxiety. At a certain point I think my body was exhausted. I couldn't really panic anymore, I didn't have the energy to do it. I had this moment of clarity...I CAN handle anxiety. I can manage it, even in front of people. I didn't have to leave the space I was in. I just rode it out, and eventually my panic subsided. 

I don't really like the advice to focus on your breathing to calm yourself. This always made me feel worse and feel like I was hyperventilating. I think the best thing for me is to just say, well, this is temporary. It will eventually go away regardless of what you do. 

I'm writing this for anyone who has work anxiety. My anxiety is the worst when I'm in a space I am socially expected to stay in - like meetings, for example. Or even when I'm out with people at a restaurant. I still don't go to movie theaters because I simply can't sit still or focus on the movie. 

I like to think of it as if I'm forcing my body to stay in a certain situation to prove to it that it is NOT life threatening. I get nervous and want to run - like in a meeting - but I force my body to sit still. Yeah, I fidget a lot, move my hands, whatever. But it's a start. 

So I guess what I mean by this is it's good for me to feel the anxiety because I can convince my body to finally relax. I just wanted to share that with you guys! "
39zgc7,209,2015-06-15,"[AWALT] My single mother made swallowing the pill very, very easy.",Redsqa,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/39zgc7/awalt_my_single_mother_made_swallowing_the_pill/,"Let me tell you why I had absolutely no trouble swallowing the pill. It’s all because growing up I had a very good example right in front of me : my single mother. Her life is a certified platinum TRP case study. Seriously, almost all the clichés are in here.

**tl;dr** my mother tried to trick a married alpha, had me, continued to ride the cock carousel, hit the wall then found herself some nice betabux

She met my father where she used to work. She was only an intern at the time, while he had a job high in the hierarchy, and as a matter of fact was already married. **Women are attracted like flies to social status and higher SMV.**

It did not bother her that he had already a wife or two daughters, even though she met them and hanged out with them quite a lot of times. **Hypergamy does not care.** She told me she ditched her boyfriend because she ""fell in love"" with my father, and they had an affair for a little while. **Women do not love, at least not like men love. They use ‘love’ and other justifications to hamster away their amoral behavior.**

Of course, after some time she wanted him to commit. She wanted him to divorce his wife but he would not. How surprising that she became pregnant around the time their relationship ended. 
This reeks of the good old ""omg the pill did not work i don’t know why"". What she told me is that she refused to see him anymore because he did not want to leave his wife, and then discovered she was pregnant with me. What are the chances ? What my instinct tells me, screams to me, is that she tried to force him to commit with a baby, and he did not want to have anything to do with her anymore. **Women will test and trick you.**

After I was born, she raised me to be a beta bitch, of course. She was overprotective, controlling, and I was so feminized I had more female than male friends as a boy. She fed me feminist bullshit all the time, and I grew up thinking that males were inherently evil. **Women will not help you; some will try to break you and make you comply to the feminine imperative.**

Now, even though she had a child (me), she did not stop riding the cock carousel. She would hang out with guys that would be assholes to her and her toddler. I remember one of them burning me with his cigarette on purpose when drunk, and she just told me to go to my room. Another one, verbally abusing me all the time, but she would disregard his fucked up behavior because he gave her the tingles - I could see it, even though I did not know what it was at the time. **Women have no fucking self respect as long as you give them the tingles.**

Anyway those guys would usually come late at night and leave in the morning. She was just pump and dump to them, and in retrospective, it was hilarious seeing her trying to make them commit. I think she was trying to pull the same trick she did on my father with them, because I also remember her telling me one time that I might have a little brother or sister soon... What the fuck.

She reached the wall, and after a few years all of this stopped. She would say that she was tired of being treated like shit, that she deserved a good man yadda yadda yadda. My ass. **Women will argue that they changed when in fact, it’s only their options that have changed. Women will hamster.**

So you've guessed what happens next right ? DING DING DING You are correct, it's beta hunt season !

She found herself a nice, way older beta dude online. They had a long distance relationship for a while. After the first time they saw each other in person, she told me that he was not attractive and awkward. ‘Oh, too bad for you mom, I'm sure you'll find the ri-’ wait no, turns out Mr. Ugly is loaded ! Of course, she changed her mind. **Women will disregard your looks if your social status is higher than theirs.** They dated for a while, and eventually she moved in with him.

I try to visit them as little as possible, because she treats him like dirt and her behaviour disgusts me. Her sense of entitlement is through the roof. He pays for everything and even though, without him, she would honestly be nothing but a washed up old slut without a dime, she is a nagging and controlling bitch. He paid all her debts (if you did not know, single mothers suck at managing money) and he gives her pocket money to spend on buying useless shit. 
What did she do in return ? She stopped trying to be feminine. Short hair, no make up, no more contacts, no more skirts, no more heels. I think she even stopped shaving her legs. Poor guy. But what can you do, betas don't give the tingles. **If you’re beta, it does not matter how good you are to women, women will never respect you.**

Last I heard she was sleeping in another room because he ""snores too much"". Yeah right. I guess he is not getting any. **Alpha fucks, beta bucks.** But he does not care apparently, he still told her that if anything happened to him, she could have the house. They will probably marry at some point. Some guys are beyond saving… And this reminds me everyday of the hell that awaits blue pillers."

39zo4a,3,2015-06-15,Deloitte Advisory,acctpls,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/39zo4a/deloitte_advisory/,"Hello everyone,

I recently was notified from Deloitte shortly after attending their leadership conference that I would be given an offer for next summer. I know I will be working as an Advisory intern, but I was wondering what I would actually be doing, since Advisory practice covers a lot in general.

While I was interviewing, they used the term AERS Advisory to explain where I would be in the future if I were to work there. But at the conference, I was told that AERS Advisory group merged with another group to create Deloitte Advisory (Please correct me if I am wrong).

I am a finance/accounting major and an Information systems minor, but I would not be graduating with 150 credits, and I don't plan on becoming a CPA. I sent them my transcript and indicated that I would be graduating without getting my masters. They did not seem to care.

So here are my questions:

1) Is getting a CPA necessary (or required) for the Advisory practice? Would my options within the practice be limited without a CPA?
2) I know there are a lot of services under Advisory (i.e. Cyber risk, valuation, strategic risk, etc.). Given that I prefer to do finance related work, would I be able to ask them to put me under valuation or other finance-related services?
3) If I end up in a group I do not want to be (i.e. IT side of Advisory), will I be able to switch during/after my internship, assuming I am given a full-time offer?

I know the questions I am asking are very premature, but it's been stuck in my head since I got the good news and would love to know the answers. Thank you in advance."

I’ve started this 12 times so here goes nothing;This is my overall successful experiences with r/raobj, if one person gives me shit this is coming down. Warning: This is written horribly and I’ll probably edit it a hundred times. Hopefully I didn't fuck up and this won't get removed

A little background: In the beginning of March I got out of a really shitty relationship after three years together, once I stopped being sad about it and I started to get really horny, I decided to post on this sub trying to get some more experience, having only been with one person I felt like I wanted to be with more people, and improve my skills. I was completely overwhelmed with response, I probably got close to 200 messages, I spent some time going through them and found a few cool people to talk to and try to set stuff up.

Ultimately I ended up meeting up with somone after a lot of back and forth chatting, because basically we could never find a time and a place to meet up, so I blew him in the library…. Twice. Both times were so much fun, it was really hot to sneak around. He’s a really cool guy, and I hope to see him again in the fall to do a little more.


So the semester ended and I had some time to kill between my last final and the start of my internship and I decided to see if raobj had any love for Jersey, so I posted again. I probably got around 75 responses on this post, one message stood out to me from a guy who explained to me that he was in a very open relationship, he had quite a kinky side, and was very cute too. We talked for a day or two, and after getting horrible cold feet out of fear of death one night, I smoke myself up and I went over the next night. The three of us hung out and smoked for around an hour and just had some casual conversation, it was really nice, put me at easy and made me feel like I wasn’t going to be killed.

One thing I have to say was really awesome was when I got upstairs he asked me “Are you sure? You can leave, no one will be upset, no one will be mad, if you’re not sure you want to do this we don’t have to.” Honestly this was so respectful, I knew I had made the right choice then. We had so much fun. We have met a four times total, each time better than the one before, he constantly blows my mind with his mouth and his toys, leaving me dripping wet for days afterwards thinking about when I’ll be able to see him again. Seriously such an awesome guy, very easy to get along with, and he gave me the best orgasm of my life yesterday so I think very highly of him :)


About 25 days ago I got a message from a girl asking me if I’d be interested in having some fun with her boyfriend, and after having such a great experience with an open couple already I decided to see if this would be just as fun. After talking for a week or so I went over to their house where they were nice enough to not kill me, but did smoke me up. After we spent some time talking, me and him started having some fun and pretty soon we all ended up in bed together… yeah it escalated a little quickly lol Although that was probably the most nervous I had ever been it was honestly a really really fun time, they were both awesome people, I loved having so much attention on me from both of them, I got to practice my oral skills and got more than plenty in return. He left me sore for quite some time, wanting to meet with them more. Which I’m actually hoping to do this week!

Lastly I messaged someone after seeing that he was going to be coming through Philly on a business trip. 
We started talking and hit it off almost immediately. He captured the story pretty well in his version of it which can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfBlowJob/comments/3a05ja/m4f_success_philadelphia_great_first_time_in/
I got a little BDSM play as a sub, and it was awesome. I spent most of time with him blindfolded with a dick in my mouth and I loved every second of it. I got to experience some ass play for the first time as well. It was so nice I went there twice, the next day he fucked my brains out yet again, only regret here is that I wont see him again :(

My experience with raobj has been overwhelming positive, even the people I don’t meet and just chat with are so nice and keep my days very interesting. and everyone i've met has been overwhelmingly attractive I feel #blessed If nobody's getting hurt and everyone is being safe, why not have some fun? I would wholeheartedly recommend hitting up any of these people, you’ll have a great time.

I love calculus, I love reading the works of John Keats, and I love reading about the history of the country I live in. I want to read and write and go outside to pretend everything is alright. But when I open the door to the tiny apartment I am forced to call home through gritted teeth, I am reminded of my life. My mother- as wonderful, caring as she is- struggles financially. I have no father and have no reason to believe I have one. My older sister is in college and toils away for hours at work. My younger sister does small jobs, like babysitting. My younger brother can't work. I am an egghead, but I've done manual labor. My sweat has dropped down onto the soft dirt of places I hope to never go to again; I've seen the sun slowly climb over hills, and I've pleaded many times for it to not grant me heat exhaustion. I've been swindled by families wearing smiles, and my family has been robbed on multiple occasions. I've only ever worked during the summer because my mother insists that I focus on my studies (from 5 am to 5 pm). I have fought my way through some of my school's most talented students to gain acceptance into an internship offered by a prestigious university; however, this has put such a strain on my family's already delicate situation by forcing a long commute and essentially making it impossible to work during the summer. Applications and gas are not cheap, yet other students do not seem to be affected by this at all. Even though I go to parties and hangouts, I feel so alone. I'm pretending to an empty audience that I have a wallet ripe for the picking! Sometimes my family snaps at me, and other days I can see it in their eyes. How can I proudly wear my accomplishments when it has been built on the sweat of my family? They're breaking, and I feel like I should quit. I can still drop my pencil and book and pick up that job or two. I would fit right in with my cousins and uncles and grandparents. They all expect me to quit. As I stare at the ceiling from the pile of covers I've come to call ""a bed"" I think about what I've done and all the money I've wasted. I want to quit, and it would be so easy. I'd drop out of this school and attend a regular high school, take the easiest classes, allowing me to pick up as many jobs as needed to support my family. I'll stare up for a little while longer, and if I'm lucky, I'll cry. I just don't want to feel this hopelessness anymore. I want to so desperately believe that it'll get better."

Any suggestions to help me with that?",[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3a191r/reddit_i_need_to_start_working_on_my_monograph/,"Hi Reddit! I need your help and creativity to achieve something I've been thinking lately. 

First of all, let me introduce myself. I'm from Brazil and study Economics at UFABC, considered the best university of the country in terms of research impact (according to Scimago Rankings). I'll finish my degree in 2016, and I really want to create my monograph related to League of Legends, but I still don't know how to exactly ""close"" this idea. 

I have also been doing internships for almost 2 years. I worked at Total company (a supernational oilcompany) in the controllership, comercial trade and accounting department, and currently working at Itaú BBA (biggest investment bank of Latin America). All of these jobs I heavily use Excel and analyse data. I also have a passion for League of Legends (almost addicted level). I was challenger last season and currently sitting at D1 50 pts as a Quinn main.

And finally, I'm a big fan of of an exciting field that is fairly new to Economics, which is behaviour economics and specially neuroeconomics.

What is my idea? Put together my experience in Excel/Data analysis, game and League of Legends knowledge and somehow try to apply to Economics behaviour, but I don't know how to use EH into LoL. Any suggestions?

For example: collect a bunch of high elo games (specially from Korea), get all the data (farm per minute, wards in the river, number of times an Ezreal used his Q, or number of times a succeed gank worked purely because of wards versus lack of watching the minimap) etc. And then with all these datas, try to create something that can be applied by suggesting some players a few ideas that the commom sense or general tips does not include. These suggestions can often be in the category of economics behaviour, and in the League of Legends scenario, item otimization would be a huge deal, and farm/kills aswell because they all deal with the money you get from the game and then try to manage the gold and proceed to a win/loss ratio of how people actually used their gold, either by farming, getting kills or assists or the items (example: you HAVE to go back to base as an adc Caitlyn with only 1425 gold instead of the 1500 for BF. What would you do considering if your team is losing, and the decision of this pure moment can actually change the outcome of the game because of suceed events that will occur once you make your decision to what item you should buy. Because of massive data, once we can figure out why she had to go back at 1425 gold, and this same scenario happened to other games aswell, another idea would be to undestand this 'pre-moment of going back to base with less than what you can buy as BF' and suggest a change of how you farm or how this happened when you should have stayed to get the BF).

I know this can very silly, and it's an idea that just started to grow on me, SO YEA, I have a lot to think about and that's why I would love to have your input. Doing something in college related to a game I have been playing since I started actually going to college would be awesome for my life. "

Yes, that is me...  She knows I come on here often and she knows my mentalities towards woman and she made me believe in the AWALT.  Want the real story or want to hear my side well here you go.

Was head over heels for this girl, had good morals, did not make her commit to something she did not want to do, nor pressure her because she had a bf.  She just left for her internship all the way in Florida and I said I would keep in contact.  The agony of her having a boyfriend finally caught up too me and I finally had to just cut contact and better myself.

She ended up texting me 3 days after writing that post which was yesterday.  She told me ""Jst so you know we broke up""  as in her and her boyfriend.  I respond with ""Okay cool.""  She asked to give me a call and we talked.

She then proceeds to tell me she really hit it off with another guy in Florida.  I was like then why the hell would you contact me just to tell me that?  She had no answer in which I responded well have fun in Florida and good luck with everything.

I felt I took my knowledge from TRP, did not get mad at the situation and just dropped her like a fucking brick basically.  She was in shock I did this, but why would she contact me saying she is single again, then proceed to tell me she hit it off with some dude down in Florida?  Yes it bothers me, but I cant LET it bother me.  I am trying hard to not let it and I have been feeling better already.  

This just goes to show thaat swallowing TRP and accepting the fact that AWALT is real people.  Shit is real, it took me a while to realize it, but once something happened to me it finally hit me.  AWALT and fuck them for being that way.

Rant over

Where'd all the good people go.....

Thank you TRP

3a2ykg,1,2015-06-16,Education comes full circle at UND: The teacher becomes student,UNDonline,nutrition,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/3a2ykg/education_comes_full_circle_at_und_the_teacher/,"UND's Nutrition &amp; Food service Professional Training Program helps Minnesota woman obtain special license. 

Colleen Zenk always intended on being a teacher. The Waldorf, Minn., native followed the plan and started her career as a home economics teacher. She soon made the move to Wausau, Wis., where she realized her learning had just begun.

Tied to the Wausau job was an occupational foodservice program for high school kids, but it required an instructor with more than 2,000 foodservice hours. After securing a job at a local restaurant to obtain her required foodservice hours and teaching the program for two years, the program was eliminated. Rather than returning to her roots as a home economics teacher, Zenk decided to take a different route.

""I had a few options because of my foodservice background,"" Zenk said. ""I moved back to Minneapolis, took a job at a restaurant and soon ended up in long-term care.""

Minnesota requires a licensed dietitian or certified foodservice professional in long-term care facilities, so it was back to school again for Zenk. After weighing the options and considering evening classes, Zenk was referred to the University of North Dakota Nutrition &amp; Foodservice Professional (NFP) Training Program.

""At that point I was running two kitchens and couldn't manage to get away every Wednesday night to attend class,"" Zenk explained. ""I also considered becoming a dietitian, but because of a limited amount of internship options I decided the UND correspondence course was my best choice. I've never looked back – it was the perfect solution!""

From that point on, she was off and running. Zenk managed the kitchens for an independent living facility, and later worked for Sysco Minnesota and the Minnesota Beef Council. Zenk's approach throughout her career was to ""keep food fun."" She described the lutefisk dinners, Swedish smorgasbords and St. Patrick's Day meals her independent living facility would host.

""Residents really enjoyed these meals; it featured their cultures and provided them with a taste of home. It's important to go the extra mile, and we tried to make memorable experiences for all of the residents and their families,"" Zenk said.

Zenk retired from full-time work in January, but is staying with the Minnesota Beef Council on a contract basis. She hopes to spend more time with family and friends, golf, read and travel.

Along with her education and work experience, Zenk served as the national chair for the Dietary Managers Association from 2002-2003 and participated in several industry committees. It was on the DMA Certifying Board where she served with UND's Nutrition &amp; Foodservice Professional Training Program Director, Becky Rude.

""Colleen is a respected professional and role model to both emerging and seasoned CDMs. She's been the go-to food safety person for the state of Minnesota and the nation; she's an expert speaker and advisor for the foodservice industry,"" Rude explained. ""Our team is proud of her accomplishments and of the fact she's a graduate of our program.""
Industry Outlook

Zenk expects the aging population and number of senior housing units to create challenges for the foodservice industry. She expects the marketing to be fierce, and dietary managers should realize the overall role they play in promoting their facilities. Zenk feels food is a huge factor in determining the overall quality of a facility.
Always Learning

Through her career, Zenk became a Certified Trainer for ServSafe®, the Sanitation &amp; Food Safety Training and Certification Program sponsored by the Educational Foundation of the National Restaurant Association. She's received several national awards, most notably the Distinguished Service Award from the Dietary Managers Association. Zenk has also authored numerous articles published in Dietary Manager Magazine and Today's Dietitian.

""Continuing my education has opened doors,"" Zenk explained. ""I think education is how people get ahead, and I encourage anyone considering a career in foodservice to continue their education and training."""

3a3je5,1,2015-06-16,[Support Only] What was the point of everything?,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3a3je5/support_only_what_was_the_point_of_everything/,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

I worked hard to get to where I am now. Its a fact. Maybe I could have done more, you can *always* do more, but I know I worked hard. I did what was necessary and for a time it was sufficient. Life seemed to go on. Now it's taken a  turn for the worse- I've summarized everything in the wall of text below for anyone who happens to care. Sorrrry.

Satiety is never more than a fleeting moment... I don't know where it comes from. Maybe its because my Asian parents always pushed me or because my extended family is ridiculously successful, frankly I don't give a fuck. I'm neurotic and idealistic and driven, but I wouldn't change who I am, my life hasn't been all that bad and I love my family. Psychoanalysis should be left to those fucking quack psychiatrists. I took a long time for me realize that.

But things aren't going the way they usually do. I used scrape by in flying colors. Getting into college was an emotional roller coaster, I used to crawl under my sink and cry for hours, I was horribly depressed all the time but in the end it happened.

Once in College, initially I had no idea what I wanted to do and ended up minoring in something really difficult and obscure, which dragged down my cumulative GPA to a 3.4 (my major GPA is 3.6). I want to enter banking or consulting in the future and I *know* I can do well in either role and I will put in the hard work to do well in either. I'm also pretty sure my coursework so far has prepared career wise, if there's anything I don't know, I can learn it. I did internships in finance and consulting in my freshman and sophomore years but last year everything went to shit.

First this guy I was dating broke up with me. I was a pretty conservative girl, no drugs, no alcohol and lots of sappy romance movies- I was living in a fairy tale. All those shy smiles across the quad, that awkward conversation outside the residence halls and the way we'd run into each other *all* the time. We'd liked each other for a while and I sort of let slip that I was interested in him and he asked me out. I couldn't have been happier in that moment. I guess it was ironic that I was thinking about marrying him by the end of it. The honeymoon phase was rudely interrupted by something you'd least expect. Right, so his parents convinced him to get married to another girl- I had no idea until they were already engaged. I thought we were still dating. He didn't really think to mention it. A week before he broke the bad news to me, I was reading these super senti texts about how he loved spending time with me and how he couldn't wait to see me after summer and I felt all fuzzy inside. 

I guess I thought we had something, I thought human connections held more meaning, that notions like 'love' where real. It broke me. I've never had any real romantic meaningful connections with anyone in life and I might have just been infatuated. I used to dream all day about finding the right guy. Hell, I still do. I don't know what he felt when his parents told him he had to get married to this girl, but he eventually agreed and I felt like a piece of trash. Oh and who the fuck gets married at 20? Just my luck.

Things had *never* been easy. My family life was unstable and I pressured the fuck out of myself. But this just drained me. I missed a week of my internship, I pretended to be sick and when I got back I just wasn't the same. I wasn't enthusiastic anymore. Even after I got back to school things just weren't the same, I wasn't depressed all the time, but it still hurt. I couldn't think about anything but getting back at him, making him feel the way he made me feel, I wanted to destroy him and his new wife and all it did in the end was destroy me. The worst part is that there was a small part of me that hoped he'd miraculously change his mind. So I started smoking weed, drinking excessively. I have an obsessive and addictive personality- not to point of having any real mental illness, but I'm not quite right. I did okay in my classes. 

2015 has taken my breath away. I ended up getting really upset when an interview went south after which I smoked and drank myself into the mental ward, where I spent two nights. The weed basically gave me a really bad, prolonged panic attack. I had another meltdown about a month later because of constant panic attacks and had to go to the hospital for another two nights because of intrusive sducidal thoughts. The mental hospital didn't help, I wasn't half as fucked up as some of the other people and nothing but animal therapy and ativan made me feel better.

Things calmed down by the end of the Winter quarter, I got straight As because my midterms simply happened to take place during that stable month between my meltdowns. Spring quarter was also okay and I got straight A-s. Besides studying however, I spent ages masturbating everyday (like 5 hours at a time and it still isn't enough). At the time it was very therapeutic, but it was also becoming a big time waster. Now that I've completely stopped I feel really anxious and I can't concentrate, like there's a block in the frontal lobe of my head at times, so I think I'm having withdrawal symptoms from not masturbating, which is just great. The two times I did masturbate I felt great after, and the withdrawals sort of went. I also have constant urges to masturbate due to complete abstinence...

I'm better now though, for the most part at least. But I don't have a fucking junior internship. The past year has taken its toll and my career seems to be the final victim. I had quite a few interviews but for some reason it never worked out. Lots of second round interviews but most places only take one candidate and the bigger places need a diverse set of schools. The investment banks were my best hope, because each of them takes about 3 or 4 kids from my school, but I haven't taken any accounting coursework so I didn't make it past the first round at any of them. All I have is this stupid tech startup which accepts everyone because they don't pay you, not one penny. Today the CEO of the company emailed me, telling they were 'overcrowded' so I should only come into the office when he wants me to. WTF is that supposed to mean? I've been too ashamed to tell my parents that I'm not being paid. 

I feel so burnt out yet at the same time I *need* a job. I feel like society has rejected me. I'm educated and my credentials are fine yet I just haven't been able to get a proper job while *everyone* else has and I swear there's nothing severely wrong with me. It feels awful that I'm not supporting myself and I feel ashamed that my dad still has to pay for my every expense. On paper I'm qualified and I swear I'm not *that* bad at interviewing. Most interviewers in the first round told me I interviewed pretty well.  I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing, like I got this far but now I can't find a job and the next stage of life has been denied to me. All I've had this past year is misery.

I don't really know why I wrote this whole thing. I don't know. What do you guys think, or has anyone been in this sort of situation or have any general advice? I just need to talk to some people about this tbh. Also please don't be mean. The reason I had my second bout of panic attacks and eventual hospitalization was actually because someone was horrible to me on Reddit and I started thinking they might be right and I just spiraled out of control. I know I sound very high maintenance, but these standards or whatever, they're completely internal to me. They exist because I am the way I am, I have a preconceived notion of success and if I don't live up to it I get upset. They aren't unrealistic at all, they fit my resume and I'm upset I haven't gotten to where I want. Similarly romance wise, I'm not bad looking, I take good care of my self, I run everyday and recently started lifting weights and stuff. I guess I do idealize romance. But I like it, its one source of positivity in my life. I've gotten really religious too lately, prayer helps. While writing this out I got an email from a big venture capital firm for an interview and I just feel desperate... before I used to get excited and I would start researching and preparing notes, now I get a little freaked out when I get good news."

3a46y5,12,2015-06-16,[FR] First approach in America,kam-,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3a46y5/fr_first_approach_in_america/,"**Background:**

As this is my first field report, I’ll describe quickly where I come from. I discovered this sub 6 months ago, while browsing Reddit in order to keep my mind off the first girl that took some interest in me in over one year, and losing her. 21 years old, never had a girlfriend, virgin, had 2 dates in my life and failed them. Reading the stuff here made me realize how I was wasting my time, going nowhere, having no passion in life or anything. Years of procrastinating had lead me to stopped going to classes, spend my days playing online games, drinking a healthy mix of coffee, energy drinks, alcohol, and smoking tons of cigarettes. 
Wondering where my teenage boner had disappeared, I decided to follow the Seddit path and letting go of the past. Games was replaced with studying and educate myself, alcohol with water, cigarettes with chewing gum, masturbation with a workout session. I started improving my social life, getting back in touch with some friends, going to social events during the week, and out in the weekend. I took every chance I got to face social pressure, peeing right next to the guy into the urinals (hard one), taking a speech in front of the class, and going out alone if my friends preferred to play call of duty.
I began hitting on girls, at bars, nightclubs, in shops, and asking them out. I’ve had some little successes, get rejected and flaked a lot, and practiced irregularly. I could be far better, but I’m more confident than I have ever been, look good, didn’t spend any Saturday night at home in 6 months and wake up every morning with shits to do. So thank you for that. 

**Context:**

In the goal of self-development, I decided it was time to travel the world and gain a little perspective. I found an internship in America, which I fascinated me since I was a little boy, and got through months of stupid paperwork to get there. So here I come, arriving from France, spending the summer on the other side of the Atlantic. 

**First approach:**

I’ve been here since two weeks, having a hard time getting acclimated to the country and making friends. On this sunny Saturday afternoon, I was walking around the city, looking for things to do or discover. I came across a little festival. There is children playing, little concerts making nice sounds in the background, people enjoying some ice cream. The atmosphere made me feel really good and it was time to do the first approach I haven’t had the balls to do since I came to the city. 
I noticed this gorgeous girl, eating something that looks like Indian food on the sidewalk. It was so sexy. She is alone, no headphones, no phone calls, I’m feeling good, I got no excuses. So I go up to her and drop something along the lines of 
&gt;“This may be weird but I was walking around and I saw you, you look charming and I wanted to say Hi”

to which I got the 
&gt;“Thanks but I got a boyfriend.”

Whatever, I learned than talking to people is always a good experience so I go on and introduce myself, we shake hands and I ask her how she got here, in this nice festival. I sit down close to her, continue the conversation, and she says quickly “Actually, I lied to you, I don’t have a boyfriend, sorry for this”. I tell her that I understand but tease her a little about that. We carry on, learning about each other. She comes from California, is in Boston for a summer job and get some inspiration for her art work. She’s here since two weeks as well, had been mostly exploring the city alone, and got into the habitude of saying “I have a boyfriend” to get rid of man talking to her. I mention my dream of going finally to New York, she would really like to go as well. She is smart, interesting, and truthful. We get along well so I suggest she comes with me to the museum on Wednesday night as I saw it was free. She insist that she really wants to go, and put her name and number in my phone. We walked around the streets for a little more than an hour as we hugged goodbye. 

Approaching goes well most of the time and feels so good, and yet I’m often such a fucking pussy about it. Just do it©.

**Date:**

We texted a little bit, not too much, agree on time and place to meet. I live in a shitty cheap room with another guy so I don’t feel like bringing her there. I was planning on trying to f-close on the second date anyway, since it is my biggest struggle. 
We meet at a subway station, little kiss on the cheek, European style, and walk to the museum. I speak freely about whatever I feel like talking about, she shares some stories about her as well, staying in light conversation. In the museum we visit the American and European art, comparing our two continents and cultures. Making conversation as a foreigner is pretty easy, so much topic to explore. I do some light kino, hands on her arms, lower back. She doesn’t react at all but I don’t lose my frame. 
I suggest to get some drinks, she agrees, and go to the subway station. We miss the train for some seconds, so we find a little spot on the grass, sit down and I initiate her to meditation (she told me she never experienced it). As she has her eyes closed and I talk with a deep and calm voice, I touch her on her hands and knees. She likes it, we take the train, find a bar, we sit next to each other, and order drinks. Here we get a little deeper, I open myself and she reciprocate. She sticks her legs onto mines and I got one hand on her thigh, the other on her shoulder. The timing and situation feels right, so I go in for the kiss. She backs off, saying that she doesn’t know me yet. I laugh it off and change the subject. We pay and head out. 
We walk in direction of the subway station that would get her back home.  We sit on a bench on a nice plaza. I talk about this Old Italian gay guy who approached me two days ago as I was reading on the bench right next to this one. I got the conversation more on a sexual topic. She confess she is only attracted to men, but still has kissed some girl. Me too, was okay, would recommend. At this point we are so close that I do a second attempt at kissing, success. She say that she’s really happy I approached her 5 days ago. We had a good night, it’s late, work in the morning, and far from home. We kissed goodbye, after agreeing to meet up again Sunday night. And I go back home, with a raging boner, my most honest compliment. 

**Aftermath:**

I texted her 2 days after, to set up the logistics of second date. She said that she is too busy Sunday and Tuesday would be better. I know that she doesn’t work on Wednesday so we planned for Tuesday. I texted her last evening saying to meet me there at this time. She respond today late morning something along the lines of
&gt; “I woke up sick, caught a cold yesterday, I’m not feeling better, I can’t do tonight, sorry”. 

Cold, no suggestion of another time. So I interpret this as a loss of interest. The iron seems cold.

I haven’t respond yet, and everything I can think of seems too tryhard and fake. I could spend hours reviewing the whole thing, seeing how I didn’t follow perfectly the rules #23, 37, and 1345 of the PUA’s manual. But I prefer not to be too hard on myself, and writing this was helpful to get it out of mind. The progress I made in all area of my life since 6 months makes me feel confident. It is also such a little time to recover from a decade of inaction. Next time I’ll do better. 

Tomorrow, I’ll be back on the streets. I hope you do as well gentlemen.

3a4gn7,1,2015-06-16,I need some help. I (22M) had a wake up call about my relationship. She (21F) says she's conflicted.,2j4yz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3a4gn7/i_need_some_help_i_22m_had_a_wake_up_call_about/,"**tl;dr: I've woken up and realized I've been a dick to the love of my life. She's nearly finished. I'm really serious about being willing to change my behavior and make her feel special. How do I show her and how do I convince her it isn't over?**

I've been with my girlfriend for 2.5 years. Things started out great, and then they kinda declined to a steady point. My girlfriend suffered from anxiety and depression for a while in the relationship (until recently) because of issues with her parents (they would play mind games and shit with her and rejected her for loving me - kicked her out and all). 

It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I took a long hard look at our relationship and I realized I'm not happy with it. She's away from me right now, about 2.5 hours, and in August, when I return to school, she is leaving for Florida, about 12 hours away, for a Disney internship. I saw that we just didn't have the bond to keep us close over this period. For years she'd tell me how to comfort her, how to make her feel important, etc, but I was too stubborn to get it. I didn't compromise much or compliment her much or care for her fully. I realize now that it had a lot to do with being scared of getting hurt when I was falling for her. It had a lot to do with not having a good parental relationship to base mine off of. It had a lot to do that I just wouldn't open up to her. 

I finally realize this and try to surprise her this weekend and let her know what I'm willing to change, but she wasn't surprised and the talk didn't go down how I wanted it to. Needless to say, I didn't feel very welcome during the weekend. We finally had a talk. She told me she's been through a lot of pain, and she's finally getting over it and hanging out with friends and feeling better. She says she doesn't know if she has any more energy to give and wishes I had realized this sooner. She's currently thinking things over. We're still together. I think she's afraid of me letting her down. I also think she's afraid of me becoming an anxious mess for some reason. I kinda am right now. 

So, how do I show her that I really understand now? How do I get her to trust I'm for real? How do I soothe her and convince her to give it a shot? How do I show her I can be the person she fell in love with in the beginning? 

We've had some talks, and I think she thinks I'm sincere, but she's still really conflicted, ready to experience the world, etc and she's trying to find a place for me. I just need some help on what I can do to save it, because I've loved her, she's loved me, and I love her more now than ever. And I'm genuinely honest about really working to make her feel special and appreciated, which I realize is all she really wanted.

Other relevant info: we've never really broken up, but there have been some rough spots. Things have gotten physical a few times, some me trying to keep her from hurting herself, once or twice me out of frustration, but I never hit her, just holding forcefully. We had it really great in the beginning. She isn't talking to or seeing someone else."
3a51nw,0,2015-06-17,My Best Rejection So Far [FRish],Seductshon,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/3a51nw/my_best_rejection_so_far_frish/,"This is half a field report and half just a personal account of why you shouldn't put girls on a pedestal.

Rewind about eight months. There's a mutual friend of a girl I know that's extremely attractive to me, let's call her BH. Anyway, I'm an upcoming DJ at my university and I had my first ""official"" gig a week before Halloween, and knew she might be coming to the party I was playing at. 

She ended up coming to the party, I was in a pretty good state when she came by (I had not met her before this night, but had heard about her and looked her up on facebook), anyway I hugged her like it was nothing and introduced myself. I noticed that she was very attractive, but did not act like it phased me, because I was much more invested in the gig I was putting on. Nothing happened that night, the group she was with left for another party.

That night I texted my friend (the mutual friend who knows both me and BH), we'll call her G, telling her I thought BH was very attractive. The next day G told me that BH also thought I was attractive. This sparked my interest. She was supposed to be coming to the party we had planned that night, but due to BH being a dingus and getting too drunk, that did not happen.

Fast forward to December (around Christmas and New Year's), she's still on my mind, because tbh I'm still somewhat of an AFC and G keeps bringing her up when we hang out. So I decide to facebook message her. Things go well, I get her number and from that point on I text her every month or so. 

This may sound strange, but she actually responds very well to these conversations, I keep them light and fun, with no real objective other that just to have some funny convos that amuse me. I sometimes infer about meeting up, get rejected quick, but not in a way that seems to indicate that she's no longer interested. 

Side Note: BH goes to a different university about an hour away, meaning she only really comes up to my uni like once a semester, so that's the reason why I was not more forward, and why I made initial contact with her via Facebook. It’s also why her rejections to meet never really seemed to matter.

Fast forward to the end of April, I happen to have an internship lined up in the city she is living in over the summer. This was completely coincidental, but having her there was definitely seen as a bonus at that time. I tell her that I plan on living in her city for the summer, she offers to give me a tour, fuck yeah. 

We go on the tour, although it's clear this is not a date from the beginning. Nonetheless, we have a lot of fun, and I'm definitely interested in her. 

I wait two days after the tour to contact her, ask her what she's up to that night and she tells me she's going out to a bar, I ask her if I can join. She enthusiastically tells me yes. I'm excited. 

We go out, I meet her best friend that goes to her school and things are going well. A few hours into the night we begin to isolate each other, there's a ""bubble"" around us, she's giving me signals that she wants me, although at the time I’m completely oblivious to them (I only recently started looking at seddit, and other seduction information like Models by Mark Manson, etc.). 

We end up outside because she ""needs some air” (another IOI that flew over my head) and I decide to ask her out on a date. She agrees, although she's drunk. I confront her on this, but she assures me she wants to go out with me. From that point on she's definitely interested in me, i.e. holding hands, dancing together, etc. 

The problem is I never make a real move on her after that (no trying to kiss her, little to no kino, except for an occasional holding hands while leading her somewhere), I could've easily made out with her, or even took her home, but was too oblivious to her signals that I didn’t  do anything. We ended up walking to her place together and I ended up with a kiss (just a peck) on the lips, then left.

The funny part was I thought I was “in"" at that point. I was so high on the night, because it was one of the biggest “successes” I’ve had in a long time.

Side note: I’ve spent the past five or six years really focusing on myself after an identity crisis that occurred in high school, so I haven’t really been focusing on girls, and how to improve with them until very recently. 

Anyway, I text her the day after and tell her about the date that she agreed upon, the issue was that she didn’t remember that, she was much more drunk than I realized. Although, she agrees to go out later that week (she agreed, I wasn’t going to let her get away with that). 

This was the first red flag that I noticed, but I ignored because I was so infatuated with her (I put her on pedestal pretty hardcore at this point). Moving on, we went out, to an art museum, but I didn’t really escalate at all, and she had to leave for a soccer game she agreed to go to, but “forgot about” before scheduling our date (2nd red flag that I didn’t realize). 

The date went OKAY, and I mean that in that exact way. It was neither good nor bad, or at least that’s what I gathered from it. We had fun, but again I did not escalate hardly at all. She showed some investment in me, which I thought to be a good sign, but seems was not enough.

From that point on, it was a struggle. I’ve texted her about hanging out, but she only responds when she can’t make it. Needless to say I’m getting pretty skeptical about our situation at this point. 

Fast forward to this previous night, I see her, I’m in a good state, I take her hand and dance with her for a minute, she asks how I’ve been and who I’m with, I sort of avoid these questions, and as soon as I showed up to dance with her, I leave her. This was planned, I wanted to catch her off guard and confuse her (drunk logic), anyway, by the end of the night I plan on figuring out what’s going on, whether I get rejected or not.

I find her, take her hand, and tell her I need to talk to her, she says that she has to take a tequila shot, which she does, but she does not come to me right afterward, she stalls. After being tired of waiting for about a minute or two, I confront her, in front of her friends. I ask her whether we’re going to talk, she straight up tells me “no, it’s not happening”. I scan her friends, they’re all not pleased, telling me to leaver her alone, apparently they’re celebrating a birthday or something, I say “see ya” and bolt. 

Afterward, I’m ecstatic, I finally know where we stand, and that I don’t need to put any more energy into our relationship. The fact that I made her polarized (thanks for that perspective Mark Manson) made me finally realize that I was chasing something that wasn’t worth chasing. 

I’ve learned a lot from this experience. One of the big takeaways is to take the shot when it presents itself, I had an extremely prime opportunity to make something happen with her at one point, but because of my lack of knowledge at the time, and my lack of using my intuition, I didn’t take the opportunity. 

Another big lesson is to not to chase girls, I initially attracted this girl to me because when I first met her I showed that I had value and didn’t necessarily care whether she liked me or not. I’m not saying to not approach women (in fact I’m terrible at this and am trying to get better), but don’t give up your values and principles as a man for a women, or anyone else for that matter. That shizz is unattractive af. 

The last thing I learned is that polarizing women is a good thing no matter it she reacts positively or negatively, by polarizing, you either filter out the women who you don’t want/aren’t worth being in your life or you gain women that actually care and give a shit about you. 

If you aren’t familiar with polarizing, I’d suggest reading Models by Mark Manson, not only is it a must read, but he also explains polarizing in a much better way than I can in this post.

I realize this is long, but I really needed to write this story out for myself. And if anyone can relate and learn from it, then all the better!

Also, if anyone has any feedback about what I could've done better, or where I might've gone wrong, let me know!

TL;DR: I tried to slow game a girl, put her on a pedestal, and had one of the best rejections I’ve ever had because of it. Read Models by Mark Manson."

3a5o4o,2,2015-06-17,I feel like everything I've done has been for nothing,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3a5o4o/i_feel_like_everything_ive_done_has_been_for/,"I worked hard to get to where I am now. Its a fact. Maybe I could have done more, you can always do more, but I know I worked hard. I did what was necessary and for a time it was sufficient. Life seemed to go on. Now it's taken a turn for the worse- I've summarized everything in the wall of text below for anyone who happens to care. Sorrrry.

Satiety is never more than a fleeting moment... Maybe its because my Asian parents always pushed me or because my extended family is ridiculously successful, frankly I don't give a fuck. I'm neurotic and idealistic and driven, but I wouldn't change who I am, my life hasn't been all that bad and I love my family. Psychoanalysis should be left to those fucking quack psychiatrists. I took a long time for me realize that.

But things aren't going the way they usually do. I used scrape by in flying colors. Getting into college was an emotional roller coaster. I used to crawl under my sink and cry for hours, I was horribly depressed all the time but in the end, it happened. I got the acceptance letter and the congratulations and things were fine.

Once in College, initially I had no idea what I wanted to do and ended up minoring in something really difficult and obscure, which dragged down my cumulative GPA to a 3.4 (my major GPA is 3.6). I want to enter banking or consulting in the future and I know I can do well in either role and I know that I will put in the hard work to do well. I'm also pretty sure my coursework so far has prepared career wise, if there's anything I don't know, I can learn it. I did internships in finance and consulting in my freshman and sophomore years but last year everything went to shit.

First this guy I was dating broke up with me. I was a pretty conservative girl, no drugs, no alcohol and lots of sappy romance movies- I was living in a fairy tale. All those shy smiles across the quad, that awkward conversation outside the residence halls and the way we'd run into each other all the time. We'd liked each other for a while and I sort of let slip that I was interested in him and he asked me out. I couldn't have been happier in that moment. I guess it was ironic that I was thinking about marrying him by the end of it. The honeymoon phase was rudely interrupted by something you'd least expect. His parents convinced him to get married to another girl- I had no idea until they were already engaged. I thought we were still dating. He didn't really think to mention it. A week before he broke the bad news to me, I was reading these cute texts about how he loved spending time with me and how he couldn't wait to see me after summer and I felt all fuzzy inside.

I guess I thought we had something, I thought human connections held more meaning, that notions like 'love' where real. It broke me. I've never had any real romantic meaningful connections with anyone in life and I might have just been infatuated. I used to dream all day about finding the right guy. Hell, I still do. I don't know what he felt when his parents told him he had to get married to this girl, but he eventually agreed and I felt like a piece of trash. Oh and who the fuck gets married at 20? Just my luck.

Things were never easy. My family life was unstable and I pressured the fuck out of myself. But this just drained me. I missed a week of my internship, I pretended to be sick and when I got back I just wasn't the same. I wasn't enthusiastic anymore. Even after I got back to school things just weren't the same, I wasn't depressed all the time, but it still hurt. I couldn't think about anything but getting back at him, making him feel the way he made me feel, I wanted to destroy him and his new wife and all it did in the end was destroy me. The worst part is that there was a small part of me that hoped he'd miraculously change his mind. So I started smoking weed, drinking excessively. I have an obsessive and addictive personality- not to point of having any real mental illness, but I'm not quite right. I did okay in my classes.

2015 has taken my breath away. I ended up getting really upset when an interview went south after which I smoked and drank myself into the mental ward for two nights. The weed basically gave me a really bad, prolonged panic attack. I had another meltdown about a month later because of constant panic attacks and had to go to the hospital for another two nights because of intrusive sducidal thoughts. The mental hospital didn't help, I wasn't half as fucked up as some of the other people and nothing but animal therapy and ativan made me feel better.

Things calmed down by the end of the Winter quarter, I got straight As because my midterms simply happened to take place during that stable month between my meltdowns. Spring quarter was also okay and I got straight A-s. Besides studying however, I spent ages masturbating everyday (like 5 hours at a time and it still isn't enough). At the time it was very therapeutic, but it was also becoming a big time waster. Now that I've completely stopped I feel really anxious and I can't concentrate, like there's a block in the frontal lobe of my head at times, so I think I'm having withdrawal symptoms from not masturbating, which is just great. The two times I did masturbate I felt great after, and the withdrawals sort of went. I also have constant urges to masturbate due to complete abstinence...

I'm better now though, for the most part at least. But I don't have a fucking junior internship. The past year has taken its toll and my career seems to be the final victim. I had quite a few interviews but for some reason it never worked out. Lots of second round interviews but most places only take one candidate and the bigger places need a diverse set of schools. The investment banks were my best hope, because each of them takes about 3 or 4 kids from my school, but I haven't taken any accounting coursework so I didn't make it past the first round at any of them. All I have is this stupid tech startup which accepts everyone because they don't pay you, not one penny. Today the CEO of the company emailed me, telling they were 'overcrowded' so I should only come into the office when he wants me to. WTF is that supposed to mean? I've been too ashamed to tell my parents that I'm not being paid.

I feel so burnt out yet at the same time I need a job. I feel like society has rejected me. I'm educated and my credentials are fine yet I just haven't been able to get a proper job while everyone else has and I swear there's nothing severely wrong with me. It feels awful that I'm not supporting myself and I feel ashamed that my dad still has to pay for my every expense. On paper I'm qualified and I swear I'm not that bad at interviewing. Most interviewers in the first round told me I interviewed pretty well. I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing, like I got this far but now I can't find a job and the next stage of life has been denied to me. All I've had this past year is misery.

I don't really know why I wrote this whole thing. I don't know. What do you guys think, or has anyone been in this sort of situation or have any general advice? I just need to talk to some people about this tbh. Also please don't be mean. The reason I had my second bout of panic attacks and eventual hospitalization was actually because someone was horrible to me on Reddit and I started thinking they might be right and I just spiraled out of control. I know I sound very high maintenance, but these standards or whatever, they're completely internal to me. They exist because I am the way I am, I have a preconceived notion of success and if I don't live up to it I get upset. They aren't unrealistic at all, they fit my resume and I'm upset I haven't gotten to where I want. Similarly romance wise, I'm not bad looking, I take good care of my self, I run everyday and recently started lifting weights and stuff. I guess I do idealize romance. But I like it, its one source of positivity in my life. I've gotten really religious too lately, prayer helps. While writing this out I got an email from a big venture capital firm for an interview and I just feel desperate... before I used to get excited and I would start researching and preparing notes, now I get a little freaked out when I get good news."
3a5p02,12,2015-06-17,My college sweetheart cheated on me. I'm so blindsided and so devastated.,inconspicuous_junior,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3a5p02/my_college_sweetheart_cheated_on_me_im_so/,"I just recently graduated from college, about a month ago, and so did my girlfriend. We met the first day of sophomore year and didn't start dating until early into junior year.

When we graduated, I moved back home and she stayed at school to do an internship. Our relationship was very happy, always with each other and did everything together, she told me over and over again how I'm her best friend in the whole world. We talked about being together after she got into an accelerated nursing program and moving into my home town.

Last weekend we saw each other at our friends 21st birthday party and it's like we were never apart. The sex was great, she never left my side, we talked and partied like normal and she even fell asleep on my chest watching TV the night she stayed at my friends house.

Then I get a few texts this morning at 4:30AM..
""Junior, I need to talk to you tomorrow""
""I let another boy kiss me""
""And I love you a lot but that shouldn't be able to happen""

I thought nothing of it. I'm not really cool with the thought of someone else kissing her, but it's just a kiss, right? I call her and we start talking, she spills the beans that about three weeks ago, she got blacked out and slept with someone else. 

Okay, I'm a little pissed off, she has a habit of getting a little too drunk. But everyone makes mistakes, this one just hurts more than usual. No, that wasn't all, we kept talking. Then she says it was a week and it was the week right before our friends birthday. More talking, it was two weeks long. 

I HAD BEEN GONE A WEEK AND SHE STARTED SOMETHING WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

I just feel so betrayed. I don't know what to do. I'm writing this about an hour after I found out. I just feel like someone kicked me in the nuts and kneed me in the face.

I think the worst thing is, I asked her if it would still be going on if the kid didn't go home this week. She said yes.

I just feel like a whole shitstorm of things are working against me. I haven't found a full time job yet and now this. 


Edit: They had sex for two weeks. She showed up to our friends house and never batted an eye. I think she only told me cause the kid went back to his hometown for the summer and she couldn't live with the guilt. And as far as exclusivity, it was an exclusive relationship and was established as such since the very beginning."

Should I even keep trying?,HairFullOfSecrets_,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3a5rog/my_21f_boyfriend_22m_keeps_breaking_my_trust/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 3 years. We have a dog together and are living together (just for the summer). I do all the grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, and even pick out his outfits for work. But I love the kid, so I usually don't mind doing it all.


We've had problems in the past with him texting ex-girlfriends and old hook-up from high school and being really flirty and inappropriate. It always ends the same way; I get upset, he makes a half-hearted apology, and things are good again for a couple months. I always feel super guilty for snooping and let it go because every other aspect of our relationship is great. 

A couple months ago, I found an old iPhone of his in my desk. He had been using it to play games on and browse reddit while at the house. I opened it up and immediately stumbled upon some old text messages (from October) where he is arranging a meet up with someone in which is person needs to ""freshen up"" before he gets there. When he got home, I asked him about it and he lied until he knew I had evidence. Then he admitted that he has had bisexual thoughts for a long time. Back in October, he had met his breaking point and needed to explore those feelings. So, he had sex with a guy he met on the internet. He said it didn't go well, but that he does think he his bisexual. This broke my heart. I was very upset that he went behind my back and cheated, but I felt horrible that he's had these feelings since as long as he could remember and had never told anyone about it. 

After this, we sat down and had a very serious conversion about our relationship and what we both need to change if we want to stay together and eventually get married. We both expressed that we are unsatisfied with our sex life. I expressed to him that he puts me down a lot with comments about my appearance, weight, and various other flaws that I have. I have been working out like crazy and trying to eat really healthy, but my self-esteem has definitely plummeted. The end result of the conversion was that we were both going to try harder for each other and try to find a way for him in explore his bisexuality in a way that I'm comfortable with. 

After this conversation, things have been going great. We went away for the weekend to spend time with his family and for him to visit with a guy friend from highschool who he hasn't seen in a while. When planning the trip, he told me that he would want some alone time to hang out with this friend. I was totally cool with that so I spent the day with his family and our dog. 

Last night, he had fallen asleep so I went to set our alarm (which we usually do with his phone). Open on his phone is TONS messages between a girl, who apparently he met up with on Saturday night when he was supposed to be with his friend. In the messages, he's acting like he has no girlfriend and has been crashing on a friend's couch for the summer.

I confronted him and he told me he did meet up with her to go get drinks. Oh and even better his facebook (that he refuses to add me on) that he uses for his internship is clearly being used to connect with girls. He says nothing happened and he feels horrible about it. He says he loves me and wants to be with me, but he's unsatisfied and wants to have an open relationship. I told him I wanted him to tell this girl that he had been lying and is in a serious relationship, add me on his facebook, and work to gain my trust back and then once that happened we could talk about maybe swinging or doing something of that nature. I told him I'm sick of fighting to make things work on his terms and to make him happy and I want to be the one to be fought for. He did not do the first two things, and was very quiet/ brushing me off this morning when we were getting ready for work. 

I have no clue if I will ever be able to trust him again. I am a wreck. I am hurt that he isn't making an effort to make things work. My friends have advised that I've given him way too many chances and that he will never change. I love him, but I almost feel like I've given everything I have to make this work and I don't have anything left. I hope I was able to convey the situation well, as I'm pretty upset right now and I've never posted on reddit before. 

tl;dr My boyfriend has broken my trust many times. Should I break things off with him or give him one more chance?

Edit: You are all right. I know I need to break things off. My friends said the same thing. I guess I have been mindfucked that things are great and I am happy, when I am not. While my past choices don't seen too rational, I did make sure that while we got the dog together I adopted her in my name and paid all the adoption fees (the vet bills are in my name as well) and the apartment is all in my name as well. So he will be leaving me and the dog, and the two of us can celebrate all the new closet space we're going to have. I have already texted him that we need to talk when he gets home from work. He knows it coming. Thanks for the advice, "
3a6614,2,2015-06-17,I'm [23 M] taking a huge step to the right with my fiancee [23 F] by being forced into a long distance relationship and I have no idea what I'm doing.,theglenlovinet,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3a6614/im_23_m_taking_a_huge_step_to_the_right_with_my/,"So, there is a lot going on here so I'll try to keep it neat. 

I've been with my fiancee for about 3 years this July and we've been engaged since last Christmas. We live in Indianapolis but a turn of events has caused my fiancee to move to Cooperstown NY for graduate school (She's going into museum studies and that is THE BEST school for her field - no joke), unfortunately my job field is a little more complicated. I graduated with a degree in Media Studies and although I have looked and applied everywhere I possibly could and after a year of working odd jobs, the ONLY opportunity given to me in my field is at a local news station in Indianapolis; forcing me to stay for at least a year (I start this job in a week).

What I guess makes this more difficult for me is that my fiancee and I have lived together for 2 years now (not including practically living together while still living in dorms in college). We are inseparable, she is my best friend and my life (and I mean that in the best way). I have ZERO experience with long distance with the exception of a few months one summer when I took an internship in Denver while my fiancee was in Indy--and even that was difficult. 

I felt like I needed to take the job opportunity in Indy because it was the first real offer in my field and I graduated from college 13 months ago. I knew that if I didn't get a jumpstart on my career soon, I never will. Here's one of the catches though... the job is part time and wont fully pay for my rent, bills, loans, etc, so I need a second job (NBD, I know) and I'm fortunate enough to stay with my current job BUT it is forcing to have a 7-Day work week (I don't wanna get into too many details about the schedule and everything).

Though I'm looking for a different second job I hate to admit it but the one I do have pays pretty well. So getting back to the relationship part; I feel like I'm living one of my big fears because not only am I not being able to see my fiancee, I am unable to be able to visit her; let alone able sit down for five minutes. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to keep our relationship strong and make sure that I'm doing well enough to not smother her, annoy her, or get constantly upset about not being able to see her. She doesn't leave for another 2 months but I'm already feeling like she left or everything is the ""Last This or Last That"" and I'm constantly breaking down at least once a day (which, as a 23 yo male, beforehand that NEVER happened).

To be honest, there are a lot of other things going on which have made things worse, to which I'm sorry if I start talking like I should submit to /r/offmychest. Within a month I have a big wedding to attend in Chicago, move into a new apartment, my parents have been divorced for a year but through complications have to still live in the same house up in Chicago--which is messing up my younger siblings, my father has been diagnosed with several types of cancer (I'm not making this up), all while starting a new job and plan a wedding in Wisconsin.

All-in-all, I feel like my fiancee is the only good thing in my life and now she's moving away and I can't go with her. There isn't an issue about trust or anything (which is good), we've started doing this texting thing where we're making up our own story through the texts in a sort of RPG theme, and there will be some breaks; so why am I still a wreck?

I think it's safe to say that I'm terrified of such a drastic change, especially for not being able to wake up next to my fiancee. I'm afraid to be alone (though I have a cat), because I can't be myself to deal with my nearly explosive anxiety now. I have friends here but they like to party, live without problems and stay out late (which I just can't do much anymore). 

If there is anything I really want to ask: what can I do to cope with a long distance relationship? What should I do to keep the communication between my fiancee and I great? How do I deal with being alone while being in a committed relationship?

Sorry about the novel, but I really just need some help to deal with going about a long distance relationship and with everything else going to shit, this is the one thing I want to keep well.

EDIT: My fiancee has been through long distance before which helps, even though neither of them worked out.
   
**tl;dr**: Forced into a long-distance relationship before a wedding, I'm a nervous wreck / How do I go about it and stay happy?"

3a6el6,2,2015-06-17,Macbook Air Needs a New Logic Board,[deleted],applehelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/3a6el6/macbook_air_needs_a_new_logic_board/,"So I was replacing the battery in my Mid 2012 Air (model MD232xx/A) yesterday, and my day pretty much ended up with me clutching comfort food and feeling horrible. 

I opened up the back and was undoing the ribon chord that connected to the logic board. It was not hard for me to do, because I've done it before. I started to remove the ribbon cable that connects the battery, and all the pins snapped off from the logic board, and I nearly had a break down. 

I recently quit my job and decided to follow my gut and put all my faith in getting a Computer Science degree. I quit my job because I wanted to dedicate my whole summer to learning how to code and was hoping to build up a resume and get my first internship in the fall when the STEM hiring fair is. Worst of all, any money I put down will ultimately come from the money I was saving for a special family occasion.

I took it to a nearby Apple Store and they quoted me $755 for repairs. No flat rate or anything. Then I had a break down. There is literally no way I can pay that.

So here's where I'm at:

I'm trying to figure out if it would be more cost effective to simply get a Unibody Macbook and some SSD for it so I can have something. The whole shebang goes for ~$350.

I can order a new logic board from eBay for the befallen Air for about the same price, or I can cough up the extra ~$50 for the updated 2013 version with better battery life. However I don't know if I can simply take the updated logic board and transplant it into the older 2012 frame.

I don't need it for gaming. And I would prefer a longer lasting battery. However, I don't really have a whole lot of money, and I'm trying to figure out the best thing to do. I've scoured google for any answers, and I've got some options, but no definite answers. What should I do?

I've been alone for a while and recently realized that I would like a little intimacy in my life.  So I decided to post this ad!  So a little bit about me...I will be moving to Seattle for a programming internship on Saturday (June 20).  I am mixed race, 5'1, 108 lbs.  I am an electronic musician, I produce my own music, sing in it, and perform.  Some of my favorite artists include Grimes, FKA Twigs, Run the Jewels, Bjork, Odesza, Sigur Ros, and some artists that I really like include Flying Lotus, Nicki Minaj, SZA, Ben Howard, etc.  

I'm also super big on reading (I recently finished ""A Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England"" and love sci fi) and movies/TV (favorites = ""Fight Club"", ""Cloud Atlas"", ""Game of Thrones"", most animated cartoons, etc).  Let's see...what else...I'm very 420 friendly.  I love to dance - mainly hip hop.  I really enjoy biking, but am not a hardcore biker.  I'm studying music and computer science at school.  I'm trying to get my Chinese back on game by reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in Chinese but its been harder than I anticipated.

Anyway, thanks for reading this whole thing!  Please PM me if you're interested.  

Edit: I just got ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" by Brian Greene in the mail!  I'm so excited.  Yes."
3a6o7h,1,2015-06-17,Looking for advice on optimize efficiency on my current routine.,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3a6o7h/looking_for_advice_on_optimize_efficiency_on_my/,"I've been casually working out on and off for the past ~four years. (Sometimes every two days, sometimes once or twice a month.) This summer, I've started pushing myself to get in better shape so I've been frequently going (six to seven times a week) and I'm looking for how best to optimize how I'm working out as currently I just do whatever I feel like. (I have no clue what I should be doing.)


Some information about me: Male. 20. 5'8'. 165lbs. 


Current Stats: Bench: 185. Inclined Bench: 135 Deadlift: 185. Bicep Curls: 37.5 (each hand.) Leg Press/Calf Raise: 360. Pull-Ups: 5. Dumbbell Rows: 45. Laterals: 100.  Tricep Pulldown: 100. Hip Adduction: 120. Hip Abduction: 80.


Goals: Maintain current form (minimize muscle loss). Increase stamina/endurance. Lose body-fat. To expand a little, I currently can only run about 2-3 miles at a 8 min/mile pace which in my mind equates to extremely low stamina. I also have large large pecs, ok triceps, small biceps, large thighs/glute and flab on my stomach. I would ideally like to within the next couple months cut the fat on my thigh/glut/stomach as well. 


Current Routine: Currently, whenever I go workout, I start with either bench or inclined bench. Move on to a combination of bicep curls, tricep pulldowns, dumbbell rows, deadlift, leg press/calf raise and laterals. Then if I don't feel lazy (every two or three days), I do some 15-20min of running. And again if I don't feel lazy, I do core exercises. (Sit-ups, Bicycle Kicks+Crunches, Leg Raises, Side Planks.)


Current Diet: I set my goal to about 1500 Calories a day but I've been maintaining an average of 2000 Calories so that needs to change. (I average 1800 on most days then once a week slip to 2200-2500.) I have no idea what goals to set macros at so I normally average about 50-60% Carbs, 20-30% Protein, 15-25% Fat. In terms of food, I work at an internship so I have nothing for breakfast (barring a coffee/red bull). Sushi for lunch (almost every day). Dinner is a bit varied but commonly Ramen with 4-5 eggs and spinach. Throughout the day I have Beef Jerky (protein?) and sometimes an ice-cream drumstick or Mixed Congee.


Increasing stamina is a huge goal for me, but I believe that doing a lot of cardio at the rate which I do it (usually 160-170 heart rate) cuts muscle as well as fat. Ultimately, my two main goals are increasing stamina and cutting body fat while maintaining current lifts. (Though I have no idea where my lifts are really low.)

Edit: I cannot squat. (I have gotten friend to try help but I have nowhere on my neck/shoulder/back to rest the bar without weights without the pain being unbearable.) Also my title is grammatically incorrect. RIP"

3a6rsg,0,2015-06-17,Is medicine right for me?,AorticEinstein,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/3a6rsg/is_medicine_right_for_me/,"Hi /r/premed!

I apologize ahead of time for sounding pretentious or that I'm boasting about myself. I would just like to give some thoughts about myself and ask for help in discussing if medicine is right for me. 

Right, so.. I'm currently in between my freshman and sophomore year at a private, liberal arts college in the US. I attended a community college in lieu of my high school during my senior year, and after transferring in credits, I'm technically going to be a junior next year, though I still plan on being here for four years (three more) and graduating in 2018. 

I really couldn't decide what to do, and since I've always liked science, I have a biochemistry/molecular biology (collectively wrapped up as ""BCMB""), physics, and biology majors, with computer science and peace &amp; social justice minors. Here's my course breakdown so far, by semester:

**Fall '13:**

Planetary astronomy

Gen chem 1

Calc 1

General English

**Spring '14:**
 
Calc 2

Anatomy &amp; Physiology

Gym class 

Government &amp; politics

**Fall '14**

Advanced gen chem (crams gen chem 1 + 2 into one semester)

Ecology &amp; evolution (gen bio 1)

Spacetime &amp; quantum physics (calc-based)

Freshman seminar

1-Credit biology research

1-Credit leadership course

**Spring '15**

Organic chem 1

Cell bio (gen bio 2)

Electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, &amp; waves

Freshman seminar

1-Credit biology research

1-Credit Leadership course

Currently, I have a 3.9 cGPA and a 4.0sGPA. At the end of this year, I became the vice president of a physics club, community outreach..person.. of a biochem club, I started a coffee club (there's some cool physics in making coffee!), and I won a business competition that provided funding for a nonprofit I'm currently working to develop. I worked about 4 hours a week in a prion research lab last year, and I'm working upwards of 30 hours/week this summer in the lab, and I'll be doing 2-credit research next year and an honors project (maybe a publication? who knows..) after that, during my junior year. I teach a GED math class at a prison to inmates, I volunteer at two after-school programs in nearby towns, and I visit a long-term geriatric care facility to volunteer and work with staff there. 

In total, this past year, I amassed around 400 volunteer hours from all sorts of backgrounds. I'm part of an organization called the Bonner Foundation that has a chapter at my school--we're required to do 300 hours of community service, and we have weekly night classes to reflect on what we've accomplished and what we'd like to do to influence the community. Aspects like civic engagement, spiritual exploration, personal leadership growth, community service, and compassion are very heavily emphasized and since there are only 35 or so members of the organization at my school, we're a close-knit family and I've really grown as a person this year. 

What else... I'm a fellow of a community-engagement focused science organization (I don't really know how to describe it, and I'd prefer against naming it for the sake of anonymity) funded by the HHMI. I work in my school's civic engagement department as a service fellow, where I'm a communications officer who updates web pages, among other responsibilities. I'm a tour guide, and next year I'll work at tech support at my school, and I'll be an intro bio lab assistant. Here's my schedule for next semester:

**Fall '15**

Genetics (200-level bio course)

Organic chem 2

Classical mechanics (200-level physics course)

French 101

Biology of the Neotropics (300-level bio course)

2-Credit prion research 

1-Credit leadership class

It'll be a lot to take in, but I've developed good study habits and overall stress-managing skills during my first year here. I came from a really underachieving public high school, so having that first year of community college really helped in managing college work. 

I'm a 19-year-old white guy, and I like photography, hiking, running really far, um.. I'm a huge Photoshop nerd, I like tinkering with electronics &amp; building computers, and volunteering whenever I get the chance. 

..That's a little about me. I sincerely apologize, again, if I sound boastful or conceited. It's neither my intention nor my desire to simply brag about my accomplishments here, and I like to consider myself pretty modest. Anyway: I came into school as a pre-med after doing an internship at a hospital, volunteering extensively at a hospital, and really loving A&amp;P two years ago. I even got to spend some time in the OR, and I was convinced of my future as a CT surgeon. 

That was when I started getting into biology research. I've loved every second I spend in the lab, and even though it's stressful, gruesomely arduous, and tedious at times, it's been the most fun I've ever had in school. I've since dropped out of the pre-med club here, and set my sights on grad school in some form of applied biochemistry/biophysics-based science, with the eventual intent upon teaching in some degree in the future. I haven't shadowed anyone, and though I planned on obtaining an EMT-B cert and working for my school's EMS company, I dropped that idea after dropping the idea of medicine altogether. 

Then.. I got into population/organismal ecology. I've always been a reptile nerd, and I love snakes. I have two snakes right now, and I actually have a job this summer working with snakes at a local zoo. I looked into doing that with my future, but.. needless to say, herpetology isn't exactly lucrative. I'm taking a biology of the neotropics course in Costa Rica next winter, and I'm super excited for it. My biology major is pretty much contained within my biochem/molecular bio major, which is why I can do all 3 majors, but I'm focusing on conservation biology (and I'm lining up an internship in Tanzania next summer for conservation biology) with my biology major, and I really don't quite know where to go with that. The physics major is pretty much just for fun, since I've always loved physics and math, and I've gotten a little into programming (just basic stuff.. I know Java/HTML/CSS/Javascipt now, but currently learning Python) with a comp sci minor. 

I've recently become interested once more in medicine, but moreso for the community involvement and positive influence they can have, instead of the financial stability and career opportunity I'd originally set out for. I recently experienced my grandmother passing away in a hospital, and to see the care her doctors provided for her in her latest hour.. well, I was super inspired by them, and I really started looking into it as a possible career choice once more. 

I have no idea where I'm going with this, and I think I just needed to word vomit to try to collect my thoughts, and I couldn't think of anywhere else to do it. If anyone is still reading down this far into the novella, thank you. Just to know someone's listening is reassuring when fretting over my future. "

I think Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) died at the end.

Gyllenhaal's character was simply amazing. From the little quirks that went unexplained (i.e. asking Rick to keep his window down) to the clear symbolism of his violently-obtained watch, this movie seemed to be equal parts character development and plot. Excellently scripted and excellently portrayed.

However, I left the movie confused. Such an artful hour of plot and character seemed to fizzle out in a massive deus ex machina. Lou managed to get perfectly clear footage of the police shooting a criminal, he smoothly arranged the death of his employee, he somehow caused a complete character change in Nina, the police took one unsuccessful run at his alibi and failed, and he began anew with vans and interns galore. Too perfect.

I first stumbled upon this possibility when I rewatched the scene of Lou and Nina talking dirty face-to-face while Lou's footage plays on the screen in the background. The footage that is playing is of Rick's death. However, the footage isn't Lou's footage; it is the film footage. It is the death of Rick as the audience saw it, not as Lou filmed it. All of this leads me to believe that Lou was shot on sight by the criminal in the flipped car. Beginning with Lou's shout to Rick that the criminal is dead and the coast is clear, the movie is Lou's consciousness in a transition state imagining events as he would like them to unfold. 

Let me know if you agree/disagree with this! I haven't found this interpretation anywhere else."

Cold emails are actually VERY helpful. Sent out a handful of cold emails (50 or so). Got a bunch of replies, I'd say at least 20 to 25. Of those responses one was a phone interview and another turned into a direct onsite interview (no phone interview). Both turned into offers, accepted one and I've now been an act sci analyst for about a month at a large P&amp;C company.

For some perspective:

* Location: Canada
* School: Large School - Major Stats - Not waterloo
* Exams: P, FM, MLC 
* GPA: 2.2 (no one asked for it)
* Act Sci Internships: 0
* Other experience: 18 months as a Financial analyst at a small company. A lot of reporting/analytics work
* Computer Skills: Excel, VBA, SQL, R (all used daily in the FA role)

Get out there, get a job in any field. Demonstrate you can use VBA, Excel, SQL and other technical skills and start emailing. Hopefully this gives some people hope and doesn't make too many people bitter.

I fucking love it, It's like a drug, It can make you feel sad, happy, angry all in one episode. The character development is the best I've EVER seen, so I've decided to make a list of my favorite characters from seasons 1-5

#1. Jimmy/Steve 
 Jxmmy is definitely my favorite character, he's so fucking cool, and mad funny. I think he and fiona belongs together. The fact that he's not a main cast in the show anymore makes me like him more.

#2. Lip 
Ok Lip's a fucking boss, liked him throughout the show but fuck! Common, that shit with Amanda was so disrespectful. She fucking loved him and he treated her like that?

#3. Carl
Carl's my fucking nigga! Nothing more needed to be said here

#4. Karen
I loved her in season 3 and hoped she and lip would be together.....but fucking mandy! Hate that bitch! How can Lip still have sex with Mandy after what she did to Karen? (Bad Writing)

#5. Amanda
Ok, Amanda is sexy as fuck! Smart, rich and unlike Mandy, she is good for Lip. How can Lip not see that though? She fucking loves him. He took her virginity fa god sakes! I loved when Lip had sex with his professor because it was kinda awesome, but I hated it when he started to ignore Amanda. He didnt even want to have sex with her.

3a7uc8,1,2015-06-17,"Me [21 M] with my old HS friend/'crush' [21 F] all of a sudden feel like I'm being given the cold shoulder, did I cause this?",totallytakenthrowawa,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3a7uc8/me_21_m_with_my_old_hs_friendcrush_21_f_all_of_a/,"Little bit of background, I've known this girl since high school and crushed on her pretty hard back in the day. I got over it though, since going off to college and what not. 

About a year ago my family moved to another state and I ran into her family over my college summer break. I took her out to lunch and spoke with her for sometime over the following semester and found myself attracted to her yet again. That Thanksgiving break I got her her favorite flower and, after me thinking she was being receptive, tried to kiss her. She pretty much flipped the fuck out. (Not about the flower, but the kiss part)

Following that we had a Skype conversation as to what I was intending with that and I spoke that I was interested in a relationship and we just kind of agreed to 'see how things go'.

During winter break, I asked her on a date and she flipped out again, because she thought she had clearly communicated that 'see how things go' meant to be just friends. This essentially led to an argument where I said that we clearly shouldn't be talking if we're both weirded out from some miscommunications, and told her that we probably shouldn't speak until time does its thing. I figured that this was for the best and was alright with never speaking with her again.

At the beginning of this summer break, I got a very unexpected text - she told me she wanted to get back in contact. We were both invited to a friend's wedding and I began our first conversation, after several months of not speaking, by talking about the plans I had setup for the groom and wedding party. Unfortunately, she was unable to attend so I offered to bring a letter to the couple for her. This, obviously, required me to see her.

I fully went into that expecting to be met with some super uber passive/aggressive behavior but I was delightfully surprised. We talked for a bit then I left.

Sometime around my return from the wedding, we got coffee and went bowling. I asked her if she wanted to hangout sometime again before she went off to her internship and she agreed. Before I dropped her off she also invited me to an open mic at her workplace. Me, being incredibly stupid, agreed to show up. (I'm not very proud of my singing, but I've been told its not painful to listen to). I decided to perform a cover of my favorite song, simply because it was my favorite song.

EDIT: Apparently we can't link URLs, the song was Telegraph Ave. by Childish Gambino

In retrospect, I may find that this was a particularly bad idea due to the subject of the song. I didn't really care though, because it's still my favorite song. After the open mic, as I was leaving, I got up to leave and waited for her to be free for a second so I could ask her when she'd be free. She said she wouldn't be the next week and I was all like 'Alright, cool stuff. Cya around'. That night, I sent her a message thanking her for the invite to the open mic, and that I had a lot of fun and wouldn't mind some info about other events at that place. 

Here's where the 'problem' comes in. I feel like I'm being given the cold shoulder right now. I can be pretty neurotic/paranoid about things sometimes but I can usually deal with it. My message hasn't been 'seen' even though she's pretty active on Facebook and hasn't responded to something I tagged her in. It's been a while as well. I'm trying really hard not to be 'that guy' right now though, and haven't said anything else. 

I'm still attracted to her but I've decided that I value our friendship very much so that makes things a little difficult for me. 

So, am I being super paranoid? Should I say anything?

**tl;dr: Meetup with old HS crush, fall for her again, we fall out, we make up, might be getting cold shoulder now?**

We were both in our teens when we met and started dating, never thought it would go past high school. Went past high school, into college. After we both graduated from community college we applied at univerisities, we both got into the same one, my first choice, her 4th choice. i pushed for her to come with me, because i knew her, she wouldnt last. she had never lived away from her family, let again away from anyone she knew. She finally agreed. She accepted to go to my first choice and we moved in together, about 3 hours away from our families.  But thats when things went south. Her parents being from traditions families opposed the fact that we move in together with out being married. So i proposed and got married, not exactly my ideal situtaion but i figured, i been with this girl for 7 years, might as well get married. 
We were both in school, full time students and i was working a full time job. Everything was ok the first year. Then it got to our senior year and we both put our marriage in the back of our minds, We still lived together and acted like a married couple, but affectionate wise we stopped showing each other we loved each other. 
She told me that she wasnt happy but i told her it was only temporary, that i was sorry for not paying attention for her, but between 18 units at school, 40+ hours a week of work, plus an internship, i was really busy and exhausted. 

WE got more distant when she got mono, she wouldnt kiss me or get close to me. Around that same time, one of my coworkers started talking to me. Just texting and kind of flirtatious at work, but i saw it as her being friendly, but i secretly had a crush on her. 
One night when my wife was out of town back with her family, coworker and i went out to a friends birthday party together. we both got drunk and kissed. and kissed. for what reason, that kiss felt more than just a kiss. 
My coworker, then started to say that she couldn't be with me because i was married. So we cooled it. But the following Friday, i went off with my friends and started to drunk text her. I told her i wanted to give it a shot. 
i got home that night, fell asleep. My wife then proceeded to go through my phone and saw my text messages (i should of erased it  but i forgot. ) 
She left that night. 
I woke up and found she was gone, i called her and no answer. I was finally able to track her down via find my iphone. she left to her parents. 

after work i took off to talk to her. we kinda fixed things and she told me, that she doesn't trust me anymore. that she doesn't want me working there. and i texted my coworker that i couldn't do that to my wife, and that we should stop anything before it goes further. 

work was awkward for a while, as i felt that my coworker was hurt. 
fast foward 1 month. work was a little better, co worker was actially talking to me in a work related sense. 
my wife was still hurt but we were trying to push past it. 
but everyday was a constant battle. Constant questions of was she at work, did you talk to her, when am i looking for a new job etc. 
All of a sudden those questions turned into, why am i still talking to her, (mind you, i hadnt talked to this girl other than work related items.) everyday she kept saying i was talking to her. and things got worse. 

i finally got pushed over the edge and texted the girl. and we started talking again. about how we miss hanging out and talking. but its not an everyday thing. we talk more  and shes kinda of flirty at work. but never really anything past that.

i dont know what to think, i love my wife but everyday shes saying that i cheated on her, that i do nothing to show her that i love her. 
she doesnt know we kissed. all she knows is that i started to get feelings for this girl.

she texted me this morning saying that she wants a divorce because everything remnds her of what happened, that i never show her any love ( i am not a affectionate person at all) and to make matters worse, she goes through my mac looking for any evidence, and it just so happens coworker send me a text this morning, saying thanks for taking care of a work related item she left me a message for. 

I am at a standstill, i want her to be happy, i dont know what to do anymore. i dont know how to show her that  i want to be with her. 
im lost and i dont want to lose her. when she told me she wants a divorce this morning it hit me like a ton of bricks, lost appetite and didnt want to do anything else. it was the only thing on my mind at work...

TL;DR married, got distant to wife, coworker showed interest, nothing sexual happened, wife found out that i was starting to get feelings towards coworker. wife was crushed now she doesnt trust me. everything reminds of her what happened wants divorce, says im just forcing myself to love her. 
want to show her i still love her but i am not affectionate at all.

sorry for the wall of text... "

OK so I've just binge watch 5 seasons of Shameless(U.S) and this is now the best tv show I've ever watched. I fucking love it, It's like a drug, It can make you feel sad, happy, angry all in one episode. The character development is the best I've EVER seen, so I've decided to make a list of my favorite characters from seasons 1-5

#1. Jimmy/Steve 
 Jxmmy is definitely my favorite character, he's so fucking cool, and mad funny. I think he and fiona belongs together. The fact that he's not a main cast in the show anymore makes me like him more.

#2. Lip 
Ok Lip's a fucking boss, liked him throughout the show but fuck! Common, that shit with Amanda was so disrespectful. She fucking loved him and he treated her like that?

#3. Carl
Carl's my fucking nigga! Nothing more needed to be said here

#4. Karen
Ok season 2 Karen was wack but I loved her in season 3 and hoped she and lip would be together.....but fucking mandy! Hate that bitch! How can Lip still have sex with Mandy after what she did to Karen? (Bad Writing)

#5. Amanda
Ok, Amanda is sexy as fuck! Smart, rich and unlike Mandy, she is good for Lip. How can Lip not see that though? She fucking loves him. He took her virginity fa god sakes! I loved when Lip had sex with his professor because it was kinda awesome, but I hated it when he started to ignore Amanda. He didnt even want to have sex with her. And by the way, wasn't Lip suppose to get that Internship from Amanda's dad? I really hope she comes back in season 6

#6 Bianca
I know she was only in the show for a few episodes, but that plot was one of the best I've ever seen. I fucking loved her

#7 Mickey
Didn't like Mickey at first but I've grown into liking this guy. His attitude is a fucking masterpiece

#8 Frank
Who else but Frank Gallagher!? He's been kinda like the comedy part of the show to me, he constantly makes me laugh

#9 Chucky
LOL. Did y'all see the last scene in the season finale of season 5? 
#10 Kev

3a8gn3,20,2015-06-17,When to quit/take a break? I'm worried that I'm getting obsessed.,renco,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/3a8gn3/when_to_quittake_a_break_im_worried_that_im/,"I am 22 and 5'6"" and a year ago I was 158. I've always been pretty muscular so it didn't look bad but I was unhappy with my body. In addition, I always had really bad stomach issues, so I switched to a Paleo/Primal diet last August and absolutely love it.

I am an avid rock climber and since January I have also been adding weightlifting and more cardio to my routine. I also had been against counting calories since I became too obsessed with it in the past, but I started to pick it back up and was doing fine. By May I was down to 140, with my goal weight being 135. I had done a BodPod which told me I had 15% body fat, but I honestly don't believe that and wanted to keep losing weight. I definitely look better but have some room for improvement.

Then graduation came, then vacation, and a finger injury which is keeping me from climbing as much. I've only gained 3 or 4 pounds, but it's driving me insane. 

I'm at a new internship and am really struggling to keep to my calorie limit, between 1500 and 1650. I keep going over and it stresses me out, and I gained 2 pounds this week and it stressed me out, and I feel hungry all the time but I end up stressing that I can't eat more. 

I'm thinking about taking a break from counting calories but I've come so far (kinda) and don't want to gain it all back- I really want to get to my goal weight. I just don't know how to handle this. And I've gone to therapy in the past and discussed this issue, I feel like I can figure it out if I just have some outside input. "

Greg Little  |  WR  |  Cut  |  [](/CIN) | [](/NFL)

###**Lost Players of Significance**:

* **Jermaine Gresham** 
     
      -I don't know many players in the league who started their career off like Gresham.  When he was drafted out of the University of Oklahoma he was an immediate contributer to the Bengals offense and developed good run blocking skills.  However, he soon proved to draw the ire of Bengals fans after his consistent fumbling problems and lackluster pass catching ability.
* **Terrance Newman**

   -Possibly the most significant player the Bengals lost in Free Agency.  Although his age is catching up to him you would swear he was 10 years younger in the first half of the season.  He's a starting corner through week 8 with great ball skills.  When the season grows on his body gets beat up and he slows down. 

* **Taylor Mays**

 -Although Taylor didn't find a large role in the Bengals defense he certainly played his part.  A great run support safety with lackluster pass coverage made him a Safety/Linebacker hybrid in his later years.  He doesn't have quick hips or a great football IQ but he should play a role somewhere in 2015

###Players Gained/Re-signed:

Pat Sims  |  DT  |  UFA  |  [](/OAK) | [](/CIN)

Brandon Tate  |  WR/KR  |  UFA  |  [](/CIN) | [](/CIN)
Cedric Peerman  |  RB  |  UFA  |  [](/CIN) | [](/CIN)

**Players of Significance:**

* **Michael Johnson**
 
 -This is unquestionably the biggest Free Agency move the bengals made.  The Cincinnati coaches, staff, and fans LOVE MJ.  He's so loved we pulled out of the Nick Fairly race when he was cut, and for good reason.  He's a system fit, molded by Mike Zimmer and Defensive Line coach Jay Hayes to wreak havoc on opposing teams.

* **AJ Hawk**

 -With Vontaze Burfict having microfracture surgery on his knee in the offseason, our enforcer on defense is questionable for the season's start.  Although he's getting up there in age AJ Hawk is a hometown guy that fans would love to see join the linebacker rotation.  

* **Clint Boling**

 -One of the bright young guards in the league, Boling was in high demand when Free Agency kicked off.  With teams like the Falcons and Vikings among his potential suitors it didn't look like he'd be coming back.  That's why it's not only surprising he's here at all, but for the bargain deal he signed as well.  Boling probably could have cashed out somewhere else but decided to stay in the Queen City on a 5 year / 26 million dollar deal.

##BENGALS 2015 [](/NFL) Draft



Round | Pick | Player | Postion | School
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
1 | 21 | Cedric Ogbuehi | OT | Texas A&amp;M
2 | 21(53) | Jake Fisher | OT | Oregon

4 | 36(135) | Marcus Hardison | DL | Arizona State
5 | 21(157) | CJ Uzomah | TE | Auburn
6 | 21(197) | Derron Smith | S | Fresno State
7 | 21(238) | Mario Alford | WR | West Virginia

###Player Overviews

* **Ced Ogbuehi**

 -When healthy Big Ced could develop into one of the best LT in the league.  He has two great mentors in Whitworth and Andre Smith.  He won't be in the card this year but he has a bright future. 

* **Jake Fisher**

 -Jake will probably see the field as the primary reserve ""swing"" tackle towards the end of the year as he catches on to the system.  He's similar in style to Ced but with less footwork and more power.  A good choice for RT.  Bookends for the next 10 years.

* **Tyler Kroft**

 -Kroft will be asked to do the same thing Tyler Eifert was asked his rookie year.  Learn and contribute.  He's raw but has the chance to develop into a complete athlete at the position.

* **Paul Dawson**

 -The first of many value picks for the Bengals.  Dawson is a straight up game day warrior.  He might not like to prepare during the week but he'll show up on Sundays.  Burfict's main task while out will be to reach out to Dawson and teach him how to be a pro.

* **Josh Shaw**

 -Josh Shaw has a heck of a strange story (Google it) but you can't deny his talent.  To find him in the fourth round is an absolute steal.  He can play corner and safety and will fit in nicely to an already talented group.

* **Marcus Hardison**

 -A big strong guy who will need to develop.  He's going to be buried underneath Geno Atkins, Domata Peko, Brandon Thompson, and Pat Sims right away.  He'll learn this year and hopefully come into a more dominant role in 2016.

* **CJ Uzomah**

 -Alex Smith wasn't brought back as the 3rd tight end so this is where Uzomah comes in.  He's going to be limited to a run blocking skill set but could contribute right away on special teams.  The least likely of the 2015 class to make the roster.

* **Derron Smith**

 -The biggest value pick of our draft (with exception to maybe Dawson).  Smith is an extremely talented (albeit undersized) safety who was a standout player on a bad Fresno State defense.  The main question for him is going to be can he adapt to the NFL level on a good team where he won't be able to blame his mistakes on inferior talent around him.

* **Mario Alford**

 -A pure bred speedster who will try to fill in the role Andrew Hawkins had just a few years ago.  Could very well take the KR job away from incumbent Brandon Tate.

 | | | 14-2 (1st AFC North and Bye) | 8-8 (3rd AFC North) 

###Week 1 (@ OAK)
* Derek Carr has the potential to be great and could scare our defense.  But Amari Cooper won't be fully integrated in the offense yet and there's still plenty of holes.  Bengals should win this.

###Week 2 (VS SD)
* The Chargers are a team I can never figure out.  I never know if they're good or they're bad but they always have a chance since they have Philip Rivers.  Should Andy take care of the ball in this game I see the Bengals winning, but if mistakes are made Rivers will be sure to not return the favor.

###Week 3 (@ BAL)
* Our games with Baltimore have been pretty tooth and nail as of late, but somehow the team find a way to win.  I think that continues to open our first meeting of the year.  However, if the Ravens can get running on all cylinders they could pose some serious threat through the air.

###Week 4 (VS KC)
* The Chiefs are a darn good football team, so don't let my prediction tell you I don't respect them.  This is a team that just scares me much more if we played them away than if we were home.  We're home, we play well in the Jungle, our running game should click all day.  I wouldn't bet my money on this prediction though.

###Week 5 (VS SEA)
* See above.  The Seahawks are downright brutal to play at their house.  Away, they're still a really good football team.  They just have a style that plays to our advantage.  Seattle's secondary is amazing but we want to run.  I couldn't name a Seahawks receiver with confidence and they like to give it to Lynch.  The AFC North is all about stuffing the run.  I like our chances but this game will be tight either way.

###Week 6 (@ BUF)
* The Bills are downright talented all of a sudden a Rex Ryan for all his antics is no slouch as a coach.  But Buffalo, your QB situation is worse than ours.  I would probably take AJ McCarron before I went with any of your QBs.  I think you feel our pain from Dalton and your QB holds an otherwise talented team back.

###Week 8 (@ PIT)
* The Steelers always give us a hell of a game but in Heinz Field they're on another level.  Plain and simple until we beat them in their house again I'm not going to pick against them in the 'burgh.

###Week 9 (VS CLE)
* The Browns have had their fortunes somewhat change as of late, but they still made Brown-like decisions.  Hoyer led them to an outstanding record early in the year and as soon as he slowed down they pulled the plug on him.  It looked like they finally found an answer but they gambled it all away and lost.  It's hard to have faith in the Browns as a team when the Browns management doesn't believe in their own players.

###Week 10 (VS HOU)
* I really don't know what to make of the Texans.  They could be really good or they could be really bad.  My guess is the defense is going to be pretty great but the offense will be abysmal.  Things could work out for Hoyer here but I just have a bad feeling about how he fits in Coach O'Brien's scheme.

###Week 11 (@ ARI)
* Running out of room so I'll keep the rest short.  Arizona is a dangerous team when healthy.  I think this year they're finally able to stay healthy and make a run at the NFC.  They get the best of us on this day.

###Week 12 (VS STL)
* The Rams can beat anyone, as long as they're in the NFC West.  They pull off tons of great divisional upsets but outside of that they're pretty unspectacular.  Their defensive line might be the best in the league but those guys can't win you games on their own.

###Week 13 (@ CLE)
* I don't foresee this having a different result than the first game.  Although the dawg pound crowd will make things a little tougher in the beginning.

###Week 14(VS PIT)
* We have a much better chance against the Steelers when they come to our house.  Here it's a toss up.  Plain and simple. 

###Week 15 (@ SF)
* With all the big names retiring and the Harbaugh circus coming to an end I see it taking till 2016 for the Niners to get back on their feet in the NFC West.  Fans might get a bit worried after a somewhat rocky 2015 (I predict 7-9)  but 2016 should right the ship once again.  The Bengals take this game however.

###Week 16 (@ DEN)
* This all depends on what kind of form Manning is in come late 2015.  In my optimistic prediction he's the same one of late last year.  Turnover prone with less zip in his arm.  On the other end he's regular ol' Peyton.

###Week 17 (VS BAL)
* In a good season for us we finish the year strong against a formidable Ravens team.  On a bad year the Ravens take a week off before their playoff game and we beat a stripped down version of a playoff team.

Overall I think the Bengals have a super talented roster and we put it all together finally.  My realistic prediction is **13-3** as the second seed in the AFC behind an impressive 14-2 Colts team.

##Training Camp Battles

**Cornerback** -  Of the mix of Dre Kirkpatrick, Darqueze Dennard, Leon Hall, and Adam Jones two will find starting roles on the outside and potentially another at nickel.  Who comes out on top?

**Linebacker** - With Burfict injured only Rey Maualuga seemingly has a starting spot locked up.  Who else makes a mark?  Veterans AJ Hawk and Vinny Rey?  Or maybe rookie Paul Dawson?

***

##Offensive and Defensive Schemes

Hue Jackson's offense is very run heavy.  It relies on the power run blocking scheme to make holes for Jeremy Hill to run through while utilizing screens and outside runs for Gio Bernard.  Andy's passing game is kept mostly in the 0-10 yard range with the exception of play action where Jackson likes to stretch the field.

Paul Guenther's defense is very similar to Mike Zimmer's 4-3.  It relies on the majority of the pressure on the quarterback coming from the 4 down lineman without any blitzes.  Rarely you'll see Guenther blitz one or two but more often than not he's either bringing everyone or no one at all.

Around 2 months ago my computer crashed, was beeping 3 times, and would not turn on. I took it to an Apple store, they changed the RAM, and it was fixed.

A few minutes ago my computer shut off and started to beep 3 times. However, now it is back on again.

What should I do? I am out of the country for a software engineering internship, so I can take it to an Apple store but I will have to travel pretty far. What are my other options? Should I keep on using it normally, or take action immediately?

Thanks!

edit: It is a mid-2012 Macbook for clarification"
3a9wu2,3,2015-06-18,"[20/m] My girlfriend (21/f) of two months told me about her past. I love her. Help me deal with it, please. (very long post)",throwawayAdvicePast,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3a9wu2/20m_my_girlfriend_21f_of_two_months_told_me_about/,"Hi, I don't know what information you would need so i am giving the whole story--

This is my first ever relationship. We have only been together for two and a half months but i know things are clicking between us. We both seem to understand each other and I can be myself around her and vice-versa. We both love each other at this point.


For the first few dates, we talked about general life, philosophy, science, universe, meaning of life, music, movies, travel, sports, random stuff and she was someone who loved to talk about such stuff. It was like she is my girl of dreams. We didn't discuss anything about past. After a while, one day we were celebrating her birthday drinking whiskey and watching a movie, only two of us, and I said that I want to kiss you right now but do not want to do it under the influence of alcohol, I want to make my first kiss large and devoid of any negatives. She smiled and kissed on my nose, and I was just busy playing with her hair. After a while, somehow talk drifted and she started crying and said that she was stupid once and got involved with a guy who cheated on her. I comforted her, said it wasn't her fault, it was just that guy was asshole. I didn't heed much then, probably thought that she went out with him a few times and got to know about him being involved with someone else before she got involved in anything.

This incident made me a bit apprehensive of advancing first and i refrained from doing anything unless she starts, thinking that it might hurt her. A few days later, during moonlit night, on my rooftop, large skyscraper in distance on one side and planes taking off and touching down on another side and melodious songs on background and we were lying gazing towards sky; and suddenly she leaned over and smooched me and then we kissed for a good hour after that. It was one of the few times of life I can tag as pristinely beautiful. It was amazing. She asked me, how many girls have i kissed before and I said you are the first one and that made her kinda happy. I asked the same but before she could answer, I said tell me some other time, I don't want to ruin this particular moment. 

After some days of dating, roaming around, we made out and all but this topic never came up. No, once or twice it did. She sometimes asked weird questions like (i) you aren't just doing it because you're lonely, right? (ii) I am afraid that you would leave me. &lt;end&gt; I used to comfort her that no horrible thing is going to happen, we will try things and I will give it everything and I promise it won't be ugly, there won't be any filthy stuff like cheating etc.

During make out sessions, she said she doesn't know how girls masturbate, or how blow-jobs are given etc. and first time giving me handjob, it was evident she hasn't done it before. So i got under the impression that it was her first time too in everything and we were learning together.

2 weeks back, she had to leave for internship and she said she want to do it, to have sex. And I was commenting something on the sorts that first time sex is quite a thing and we will remember this moment for the rest of our lives. Then she told me that this is the thing I have been wanting to tell you but couldn't till now; that she is not a virgin. BAM! Something went right through my chest. Then she started telling that there was this guy who got her drunk and then did it. I comforted her, I was still okay, was mature enough to understand that everybody has a past, all that matters is she is with me now. And then we got condoms, and did it. Yes it was my first time.

She left for internship after that and since i was alone, I overthought about it. And now I needed full information to calm my speculations, what happened, who the fuck had the guts to made her drunk and do this and etc. She shouldn't have told me things at all or now i need complete info. Then sometimes bits and pieces and after stalking her facebook profiles and suffering for the past 15 days, I asked her to tell me as detailed as possible. I guess it was a bad move but anyway I love her, and I want to keep things solid and confront the demons rather than be in denial or forget them, that's what i thought. Here is what happened with her--

High school, her parents left the house for jobs in different cities and her brother was sent to boarding school, she was alone at home. And at that age, you need somebody supporting you and she found that through friends in school. That guy was a good friend to her for entire one year, cared about her and all, but he was committed with somebody else. Then one day, watching a movie in a theater with friends, he planted a kiss on her cheek, she said she was shocked but thought it was cute. Then after some days, she went to his house for some books etc and there he smooched her for a good minute. According to her she was shocked but again didn't push him back(I think that had she not had feelings for him, she would have pushed him and asked him not to do it or something like that. Being a weirdo, i checked her facebook and she posted something along ""that was cute"" and ""i have one word to say-'OUCH' "" during those days. Yes, i know the dates apparently). Then he confessed that he broke up with the other girl and was in love with her. She said that he should be with the other girl and she wouldn't be a bitch. This went on for 2-3 months and nothing happened. Then the guy went to different city for college and was still in touch with her. And then after a period, she got convinced that he loved her instead of the other girl and he had broken up with the other girl. And she started loving him. After 2 months he comes to her house uninvited since he knows nobody lives there except her, and convinces her to drink(which she hadn't before) and proceeds to have UNSAFE sex(here guy tells her that he is a virgin and no need for condoms, which she later after break-up finds out that he isn't). She said,' he came twice but for her, it was painful rather than orgasmic, she didn't come even once'. And that was it -- no fingering, pleasing, handjob, blowjob etc. He gave her contraceptions that day itself. But after a month, after periods were delayed she came to know that she became pregnant. Then after a week, he comes, and being underage, he took her to a shabby place(not proper hospital) where abortion procedure went for 4 hours while she was on anesthesia but still in enormous pain. She asked him to stay for the next few days with her, but he left citing important. Here she was, dealing with mental trauma and physical pain, and he fucking left her for 'something important'. After some days, she got to know that he hadn't actually broken up with the other girl and they were physically involved.(he was having sex with 'other girl' while my current GF was pregnant or had abortion!!!!) It shattered her completely, and she tried committing suicide and screwed her exams and basically screwed her life at the time. But she recovered after some months of being totally numb to everything. Then the guy begs to have a second chance, and after constant begging she gives her another chance but things don't work out. And that was it. I know those kind of guys by the way, they take girls for granted, they think they can sleep around but if she does something then she is a slut(yes he called her that after he knew she started hanging around with other male friends).

That was it. In terms of physical- kisses and one time sex, In terms of emotional it was based on lies told by him and thus cast null and void, Outcome - she was shattered but it taught her many things and she is a very strong and independent woman now(I love that about her by the way).

Now the way it has affected me is following -- I don't think pregnancy has affected even a single bit, it actually deepens my bond that she trusts me in telling something she hasn't told anybody, and I have a liking for broken things having a shitty childhood myself. But what bothers me is that when she was telling the story she was happily describing her first kiss on the cheek or smooch and that makes me think that she actually **LOVED** him. And that doesn't go well with me. It clashes with my concept that a person truly loves only once. To me, true love or soulmate thing is something very sacred and unique, happening only once, a relation unmatched, like the bond we have with parents and own kids.(yes, i have been on 2-3 other dates but had no connection at all so i think it is unique). She is a very understanding person and tells me that whatever happened between them wasn't really love, since it wasn't both ways. But i still think that she loved somebody before and she won't love that innocently ever again. I mean, it just sometimes kills me in thoughts. I am not sure if it is because of her past, because i sometimes do think about our time spent together and then think that how she might have spent it in past, imagining him in my place!! :( Though i think it is the emotional and love part, because I want to spend my life with her and can't bear to think that she loved somebody else once, and this thought takes away the uniques aura from it. Please help. Writing it down certainly helped a bit. Is it too early on to decide about living life together(neither of us has said this, but deep down i think she is the one) because it is my first relationship and we have been together for 2 months only? Is the unique soulmate concept childish? because if it is then i shouldn't take things very seriously because it will happen again, just like friendships, and that thought just kills it for me. What should i do, does anybody understand what i am saying, please I am suffering for the past 2 weeks. And she asked me to ask anything because she is over her past and sees it just as another story, but i knew that she would get hurt recalling that again and again but she convinced me that she wouldn't; so i asked her and she was hurt at some points and i feel bad for that.  I want to keep this relationship, and she is amazing but these demons are haunting me.

Whoever read it, i want to thank you 1000 times, even if you don't have any suggestion to offer. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

tldr - I love a girl, been together for 2 months, she had a traumatizing past, she told me before leaving to a different city, i overthink that and dying in those thoughts, not sure if it is the physical aspect(only 1 guy and 1 time sex) or the emotional(that she has loved somebody else because to me, true love is sacred and happens only once).

3a9xkg,23,2015-06-18,my first emacs defun :p,VanLaser,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3a9xkg/my_first_emacs_defun_p/,"... a small step for me etc.

The path to my 'real' configuraton files (`vimrc`, `init.el`) varies between machines, operating systems etc. and I just wanted to have a ""commodity function"" which visits the file quickly. So I have this function in my configuration file:

       (defun EditInitEl ()
         ""Edit my emacs configuration file""
         (interactive)
         (find-file (symbol-file 'EditInitEl)))

Success! :D

And I can almost bet there is either a built-in way, or a faster way to accomplish the same thing.

(EDIT: already edited the heck out of it)

----

EDIT: `(find-file (symbol-file this-command))` should also work, and it's even more generic  
(you can change the name of the function at will).

----

UPDATE: Here's a macro which, when called, creates a function that will return the filename in which it was created:

    (defmacro place-beacon (func-name)
      ""Create a function that returns the file path in which it was defined.""
      `(defun ,func-name ()
         ""Return the file-name in which I am defined.""
         (symbol-file ',func-name)))
    
    ;; example, create a function to access my 'init.el' (all this stuff is written in this file):
    (place-beacon get-init-file)
    
    ;; and let's use it for the original purpose this thread was made:
    (defun edit-init-el ()
      ""Edit my emacs configuration file, v.2.""
      (interactive)
      (find-file (get-init-file)))


So you can ""place beacons"" in any file to have their path readily available.

----

UPDATE 2: (Following a [suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/3a9xkg/my_first_emacs_defun_p/cscbao2) by [politza](https://www.reddit.com/user/politza)) ... Here's an even more 'automated' *defmacro*:

    ;; When called from a file, this defmacro creates a defun named
    ;; ""get-path-to-&lt;file-name-base&gt;"" that returns the full path to that file
    (defmacro place-auto-beacon ()
      ""Create a defun get-path-to-&lt;filename base&gt; that returns its own filepath.""
      (when load-file-name
        (let ((fn-base (intern (concat ""get-path-to-"" (file-name-base load-file-name)))))
          `(defun ,fn-base ()
             ""Return the full path to the file in which *this* defun was defined.""
             (symbol-file ',fn-base)))))
    
    ;; This content is inserted into ""&lt;some path&gt;/init.el"" file
    ;; place a beacon here (=&gt; get-path-to-init defun gets created automagically)
    (place-auto-beacon)

    ;; EXAMPLE: you can place this anywhere
    ;; Use the beacon: get quick access to the file called *init*
    (defun edit-init-el ()
      ""Edit my emacs configuration file.""
      (interactive)
      (find-file (get-path-to-init)))
    
Of course, to use this, you have to know at least the base filename for which you want to find the full path, but you can check what `get-path-to-...` functions got defined and pickup the name from there."
3aaeod,6,2015-06-18,My Experience and What Lead Me to Anxiety &amp; Agoraphobia (Wall of Text Alert),[deleted],Agoraphobia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/3aaeod/my_experience_and_what_lead_me_to_anxiety/,"Sorry for the potential wall of text here... Just looking for anyone who identifies, and I think venting all this may help me too.

I'm a 35 year old, generally happy guy. I graduated high school in 1999, and for the first 5 years I was out of school, looking back I made some bad decisions, but overall, I was happy. I worked as an assistant supervisor for Best Buy, had a gorgeous girlfriend, things were great. I had not a sign of any sort of anxiety, agoraphobia, nothing. 2004 was the start of that changing.

Later on in 2003, I decided that while I was happy in my job, I wanted more. I signed up for classes at a local college to go into graphic design, and started taking classes. I set things up so it didn't interfere with work, and things were good. Best Buy however, didn't share my optimism with it. Seeing I had no intent to be a lifer, they demoted in late 2003, then fired me on a technicality in early 2004. At the time I was making just south of $13/hr, had a car payment and such. I filed for unemployment, Best Buy challenged the claim and ultimately had it denied, so I was without income for about 2 months, until I got a part time gig for $6/hr less than I was making at Best Buy. One credit card suffered; I had to make my car payment so I could get to work at all. Long story short, that credit account went to collections, so I had collections hounding me.

Compounding this was my now ex gorgeous girlfriend. About a month after losing the Best Buy job, I found out she was cheating on me. I also found out that she'd went off birth control, not told me, and was trying to get pregnant, and trap me. Her friend got wind of it and told me, and once I was sure she wasn't in fact pregnant I ended it. Not sure if any of you have been through one, but a pregnancy scare of the unplanned sort can be pretty stressful. Especially after just losing a job, starting to miss credit card payments, and trying to find a job.

Once I found the Toys R Us job, tried to balance work, making bills that were falling behind and school, I started showing my first signs of what I now recognize as anxiety. I remember my first ""attack""... I was driving to my soon to be ex girlfriends place to break it off with her, now that I knew she wasn't knocked up, and my heart started beating crazy, I was shaking... I pulled over, dry heaved twice, got myself together and went on.

It was the only attack for a while. Things stayed chaotic until late 2006, when they went to full on crazy. I left the Toys R Us job so I could work at the college I was attending for my last semester, had met a new girl, and was at the verge of having my degree, and the means to get life back to normal. Things were pretty good, and I was managing the stress, and just happy for the new love I'd found, and all the thoughts of post graduation life. Then I came to school and my new girls ex bf was dropping her off at school. She too was cheating. We argued a bit, and ultimately after breaking it off for the last few months of school, started seeing each other. During our ""break"" her friend and I started talking, just friend stuff, nothing romantic, and got pretty close. Ultimately I fell in love with her, but never could tell her, she had a boyfriend and I wasn't going to put her in that situation. Her and my again girlfriend decided to room together at a University about two hours north of where we live, and I had landed a paying internship (I was in school for graphic design) locally for more money than I was making when I left Toys R Us. After just getting back together, my girlfriend and I were going long distance, and she was rooming with a girl I was in love with to boot. This put us in June and July of 2007, with them starting school in September.

Summer was pretty uneventful, didnt' see much of the girlfriend, the internship was going ok, life was actually pretty decent. I helped them move to their apartment at the new school one weekend, and they invited me up for a weekend after school started.

Fast forward to then, a paycheck had bounced for my internship, and I was late on a credit card payment again, prompting a collections call. I went up to visit my girlfriend and her friend at school, only to find the girlfriend drunk to the point of near alcohol poisoning while her friend was at work. I dealt with that, calling the medics and such. What'd I get for my good deed of potentially saving her? (The medics told me she was ""on the verge"" of alcohol poisoning) She broke it off with me. And, later I found out, her ""ex"" too, whom she'd been still seeing on the side. I never spoke to her again after that weekend. I never spoke to her friend again either. They both just disappeared.

Once I got back home, about a week later, another check bounced at the internship, the collections people were bugging me like crazy, and I was in a deep depression over losing my girlfriend, and her friend whom I loved. Nothing really would perk me up. I was having my anxiety attacks on almost a daily basis from the stress and the depression. This all came to a head the day after Christmas when I went to work at the internship, and was told that they were shutting down.

I was jobless from Christmas of 2007 to Valentines of 2008, when I started working where I do now. I was being paid under the table for the internship, so I couldn't get unemployment. This made the collections agents really happy. I started getting things under control, then the financial crisis hit in 2008. A credit card I hadn't gotten current went completely default. The bank belly flopped when the markets died, and I owed $2500 immediately. By this point I was having MAJOR digestive issues on a daily basis, could barely keep food down, and was a wreck; unless I was at work.

All of this has lead me to where I am now; my finances have been completely repaired - I have 2 credit cards now, both of which are current and with no balance, just bought a new car a few years ago, and make about 2.5 times what I did at my peak at Best Buy. But after all that damage, all that stress, all that having to be strong for that long, I'm left holding the anxiety bag. It's not an all the time thing. For a while, since it's primarily acid reflux and digestive issues that manifest for me, I went gluten free, thinking that was the issue. It didn't dawn on me until I was going to a concert in 2014 with my brother, something outside my comfort zone, and had 3 anxiety attacks that night, that I had an anxiety issue.

So here I am... it's been 11 years since the start of this roller coaster, and I finally know what I'm dealing with. The worst thing about it? Certain situations outside my comfort zone, knowing they're coming, and that driving me to have the attacks I have. I don't have them every day like I used to, but as all of you will vouch, any anxiety attack sucks. Through all of it though, I try to be positive. I've come so far, and accomplished so much that I know anything my brain can get me into, it can get me out of. I can beat this, I just have to figure out how. Maybe venting all this off will help."

I'm also a bit worried, because I don't live near one of their locations and my wife doesn't want to move. To be fair, I don't want her to move either. While I'm willing to go if it were just me, she is close to her family and it would be sad to take her away from them. Its not really something I'd like to do.

I also feel a bit traitorous about the whole thing because I just got my brother an internship at with my current company :P

Concerns stated, I am really excited to see how it goes. Even if I fail horribly I'm pleased that I'm able to say I've gone this far. The innovation that is huge with Google is something I've wanted to be apart of since I started my career. I'm also excited about the challenge itself. To see if and how I compare to the geniuses at Google with be very engaging to me."
3ab8mf,1,2015-06-18,27 [F4M] The Office Affair,intheofficefun,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3ab8mf/27_f4m_the_office_affair/,"Re-posting because I've already found some awesome partners and I absolutely love world-building! If you meet all of the criteria that I request in this post, then there should be no reason why I don't respond to you.

This is what I'm looking for in your initial message to me. If any of these are not present, I will simply discard your message:

* Effort - seriously, if you don't plan on putting effort into your message, please don't bother messaging me!
* Detail - if your message is under a paragraph long, I probably won't even bother to read the whole thing, as all of the criteria I've mentioned should stretch longer than a paragraph.
* Proper grammar, capitalization... LITERACY! - please proof read your message! It is such a pet peeve to be reading a good response but noticing so many mistakes! I know that no one is perfect, but if I see consistent errors, it's really discouraging!
* Character description - this one should be pretty easy for you guys. Just give me a character description, including physical attributes and some background information. You can even include a picture from Google as a visual aid, I'm perfectly fine with that.
* Kinks and limits - again, this should be pretty easy. Tell me what you like and don't like and I'll be sure to let you know the same so we can come up with some boundaries. 

That's all I can think of for now. One thing you do not need to do is give me a real life physical description of yourself. I don't care how tall you are, where you're from, your age, the colour of your hair, none of that. We're roleplaying with made up characters, so our real lives are irrelevant in this world we create.

Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...

I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

I really hope that I get some worthwhile responses for this. I'll be back in a bit to see what I get. Thank you!"

So as you can assume from the title I'm having some troubles with my parents. A lil bit of background, I'm currently a Sophomore in college with a good gpa and I work 3 jobs plus I'm handling an internship! I'm a good kid who never went through the rebellious phase and I never drank until college. 

Anyways, my parents can't be a bit unreasonable and always analytical. One example would be that I was commuting to my job yesterday from another town, about an hour away, and I made sure to text my mom that I got there safely. Well 6 hours later, while I'm still at work, she decides to call me. Being that I work in an office environment and she knows when I get off, I was easily annoyed. Here's our conversation:

Me: Hey why did you call? I'm still at work.

Mom: I didn't know if it was actually you who texted me back this morning. I was so worried that something happened to you and you got kidnapped.

Me: -.- sigh Mom I'm fine but you can't call when I'm at work.

This is a normal occurrence and I'm really starting to get frustrated. My dad is in law enforcement and he's even worse. Whenever I'm talking to him I can't make any facial movements without him suspecting that I'm lying. 2 weeks ago on a visit home he asked why I kept blinking when I was talking to him and that it was suspicious behavior. 

My dad also has to add his 2 cents on what job I should do with my degree,even though I've told him multiple times that I already know what position I would like and what field I wanna go in. Plus whenever I remind him, he constantly belittles my dreams and tells me there's no way I'll achieve them.

Their attitude towards me is extremely frustrating. I've done more than prove I'm perfectly fine being independent, seeing as I live an hour away, have 3 jobs and manage school full time. I don't know what to do, I've tried talking to them but it's pointless. They're good parents but I'm ready to pull my hair out. Thanks for reading:)

tl;dr: my parents are extremely paranoid and always think I've gotten kidnapped."
3abv69,23,2015-06-18,The Sony Funding is NOT that much - Famistu Article Translation,sheepheadcg,Shenmue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shenmue/comments/3abv69/the_sony_funding_is_not_that_much_famistu_article/,"As you guys know there was a massive article in this Months Famistu. Luckily the user Varion from NeoGaf has translated the important parts and these 2 comments stood out!

- 2 million is the bare minimum for the game to exist, and if that was all they got, it would just be focused on the story. The more money it gets, the more of the things he wants to do will be possible.

- As far as money goes, he expects the game's investment will primarily come from individual backers, so he wants them all to be happy with the finished product. Doesn't sound like Sony and others are giving them all THAT much.

These points are so so important. We have people not pledging high amounts because they think that Sony (and other investors) are going to jump in. These comments state, directly from Yu's mouth that that is NOT the case! The kickstarter is the main funding for the game.

Now I know people are sad that there might not be a physical PS4 copy, and I understand that you don't want to pledge over the $29, but really how are you going to feel when the game that you have waited 14 years for gets stripped of content that Yu wanted in his original vision?
Please guys, lets get Yu as much money as we possibly can so he can make the game that he wants, and that he deserves!

Help share this message, as you still have people in the kickstarter comments, on here, on shenmuedojo saying that there is no reason to back the game as Sony are stepping in to fund it...

Edit: Here is the Full Article [Famistu Translation](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=168899118&amp;postcount=6043) - Thanks to Varion from NeoGaf!

Edit 2: I have been trying to spread this around as much as possible but still see people everywhere saying that Sony are going to fund the game in a big way (which is incorrect). From this point on, I think we need to focus on getting the words Directly out of Yu's mouth. He has said in the Famistu interview that he expects the main funding to come from the Kickstarter, so we need to make he re-iterate that in today's Reddit AMA. More specifically, we know that he cannot comment on the amount of funding that he has secured from outside sources, but I feel that we might be able to get a number of out him that HE WANTS the kickstater to hit. If we can get that number, we can quote him and spread that news like wildfire. Even news sites like IGN, Kotaku etc will be interested in that.

We need to get this info and then need to get it out there. If Shenmue fans see that Yu wants (for example 12 Million), then we will get Yu 12 Million:P.

**Today's AMA Goal:**

**Ask Yu Suzuki ""Where does Yu-san expect most of the Funding to come from for Shenmue 3? And more importantly, how much does Yu-san want the Kickstater to reach in order for him to make the FULL vision for Shenmue 3?**""

If we know the above information by the end of the day, we can flood news outlets with this and intern remove a lot of the miss-information regarding the outside funding."
3abw62,100,2015-06-18,The shadowy world of Blizzard's 'internal testing',Mullet_Ben,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/3abw62/the_shadowy_world_of_blizzards_internal_testing/,"First of all, let me just say how happy I am that David Kim wrote up a[ response](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/18132606976#1) to specifically address a lot of the concerns that people have had about Blizzard and feedback. It goes a long, long way to making it feel like we're part of a conversation, rather than shouting at a wall. Seeing /u/BlizzDavidKim responding in [reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/3a6lcy/what_if_siege_tanks_can_get_picked_up_by_medivacs/cs9yd56) is fantastic. It's clear that Blizzard has got the message and wants to [change how they are communicating](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/3a6pcb/legacy_of_the_void_feedback_june_17th/cs9sa3w?context=10000). I just want to take some time to emphasize why I think all this ado started, and what Blizzard needs to focus on when interacting with the community.

It's really good to hear that Blizzard is testing community suggestions. though we've always had our suspicions.  But when you say things like:

&gt;Some are concerned that the feedback being provided isn’t being considered or used. This has come as a bit of a surprise to us, as so many changes that we’ve *tested* and *implemented* in Legacy of the Void were from player feedback. [Emphasis added]

It's clear where the disconnect is. You may test, internally, every ridiculous suggestion that's ever been posted on the bnet forums. But the only times we ever hear of are when the suggestions are actually implemented (often altered considerably from the original idea), or when the community causes enough of a fuss that Psione or Dayvie finally deigns to tell us that ""we tried it internally, and we didn't feel like it was right for the game.""

To the community, the Starcraft II backroom is a dark, mysterious place. It isn't that we think there's anything sinister going on, it's just we have no idea what *does* go on apart from the very few glimpses we're given. We don't know when you test things, when or why you reject them unless you tell us. Maybe you spent days more rigorously testing DH than anyone in the community. Maybe you spent a better part of an afternoon. Maybe you just skimmed the TL post. For all we know, the SCII team is just David Kim, Psione, and some interns.

It's not that we don't trust you Blizzard but, well... when things like the [Warhound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8VKon9F-zM), and the pre-severalnerfs Hellbat make it through ""internal testing,"" but things like [modified unit formation ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkCx-1VUtU) don't, you can excuse our skepticism. Mainly, though, we just wish we were more involved.

You started the beta early. You said it was going to be a long beta, because you wanted to make big changes. I think [a lot of people](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/39pca5/blizzards_behavior_is_the_exact_opposite_of_what/) took this to mean that we would be privy to a more volatile time in development, where the changes are big and frequent. Instead what we get is... a longer beta. Oh, sure, there are big economy changes to test, and we start with 12 workers now, but is this really that different from the HotS beta? Everything that makes it to the beta has already been vetted by Blizzard's internal testing, and is something that Blizzard is confident, with some iteration, will ship in the final game.

[Posts like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/39figp/i_really_hope_theres_a_lotv_patch_with_some_big/) send a different message. **Blizzard, we want to be your internal testers.** We want to try the things that you *don't* think are going to work. Better yet, we want to be a part of the team that decides whether or not something is worth pursuing. Because as much as we make extension mods, and organize showmatches, none of that amounts to half the testing that one week of beta would.

Maybe I'm being naive, or ridiculous. Blizzard recently [explicitly refuted](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/19801932/legacy-of-the-void-beta-balance-update-preview-june-12-6-12-2015) the idea that they would be trying game-changing ideas in the beta (apart from, of course, the ones that Blizzard's internal testing have deemed fit). But when something gets as much momentum as Double-Harvest (or, do I dare mention, Depth of Micro?), ""we tried it internally, and we didn't feel like it was right for the game,"" is just far too dismissive. Maybe all we need is more communication when you test things internally, so we can hear your concerns and have an opportunity to respond. And when you *do* [make a statement](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/17085919227#1), and the community issues [rebuttals](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/legacy-of-the-void/483599-in-response-to-david-kim-re-sc2-economy), continues to discuss it on talkshows, and organizes showmatches, consider that the conversation is not over and that maybe you ought to say something else within the next couple of months. At some point, it becomes hard to tell if the community is losing support for DH because it no longer seems to do what they hope it will, or just losing hope because they think that Blizzard has closed the book. If we had just gotten another statement or two on DH, or moving shot, or the chat system, then maybe we wouldn't have had the bother we did.

Then again, if we're using feedback from extension mods, showmatches, and internal tests to decide what is the right direction for the game, well, then what is the beta supposed to be for?

^^^^^^^I ^^^^^^^mean ^^^^^^^you're ^^^^^^^cool ^^^^^^^with ^^^^^^^fucking ^^^^^^^up ^^^^^^^the ^^^^^^^chat ^^^^^^^system ^^^^^^^but ^^^^^^^you ^^^^^^^can't ^^^^^^^lower ^^^^^^^the ^^^^^^^hydralisk's ^^^^^^^damage ^^^^^^^point? ^^^^^^^༼ ^^^^^^^つ ^^^^^^^◕_◕༽つ ^^^^^^^Blizz ^^^^^^^plz

**TL;DR: Blizzard, we want to be involved when you test things internally, whether that means putting things through to the beta, or letting us know when and why you won't**"
3ac25k,7,2015-06-18,"Denied Citi Prestige, next steps?",akelkar,churning,https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/3ac25k/denied_citi_prestige_next_steps/,"Background: I'm still in college, working a relatively high paying internship this summer and can scramble extra income from my parents if needed. After the next academic year I'll be needing some credit to start out in whatever city I end up in working. I figured I may as well apply for the card right now to start earning some points to hopefully get some Summer travel in before I start work full time in 2016

So I applied for Citi Prestige yesterday and was denied. No questions were asked by the Citi rep when I called the number to get a final decision, he just said I'll get the denial letter in the mail which will say why I was denied.

My CreditKarma report shows:

- Transunion: 755(Very Good)
- Equifax: 729 (Good)

The only issues with my scores from Credit Karma are:

- I have a new line of credit from an autolease I signed with my father last August so that's still pretty new. Aside from that, I only have a Credit Card from my bank, which I have had for 2+ years now. 

- I only have 2 lines of credit open (no student loans)

- Equifax finds 5 hard pulls for credit history (4 without the recent Prestige check), but Transunion report one

My questions are:

- Sould I wait for the Citi letter stating why I was denied? (I'm assuming it's cause I don't have much old and active credit) before calling their reconsideration line

- Call their reconsideration line now and argue my case now?

- Give up on Citi and apply for the Chase Saphire Preferred Card? I checked their prequalification and it showed that I pre-qualified for it
- Any other card I should consider applying for?

Sorry if this isn't in the right place/I should've consulted another thread first, I'm pretty new to this whole thing

EDIT: Yea, I probably shouldn't have applied to the highest end card that Citi had. How long should I wait before applying for a different card (i.e. Citi Premier or Chase Saphire)? Two of my hard credit pulls will have been 1 year ago by September."
3ac590,11,2015-06-18,"Coworkers being overly rude, what to do?",fvckperry,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/3ac590/coworkers_being_overly_rude_what_to_do/,"Hi there, I'm about to go on a rant but I will TL;DR it.

Also, not sure if this is the right spot for my question but whatever.

To give a little background this passed week was my work conference in my industry, called NEOCON in Chicago. We went down there with all of the staff related to it. Designer, Business Development Manager, Operations Director, President, and myself - Project Manager and Marketing Director. Now to go into finer details I'm 21, the President is my father. At the company i'm pretty much guaranteed to be abused almost 90% of the time with jokes, comments, etc. I'm the young guy and I'm the bosses son. I've worked here for two years, I was brought on board to be a marketing intern, within two weeks I came up with a proposal that has completely been the reason for the success in the company the passed year with my marketing plan.

Fast forward to NEOCON, the whole place is an open bar, we go out for drinks each night and to clubs, etc with the industry. During dinner I am openly insulted by the rest of the staff when the president isn't there. Everyone is drunk and I try and brush stuff off but this is fucking offensive. Stuff like I'm useless I'm riding my dad's coattails, etc. etc. Shit like that. I try not to take it personally but keep my mouth shut, I know i'm the only one in the company who works countless overtime hours, I run multiple projects and most of my days are spent trying to fix projects that my coworkers have screwed up on. Anyways, any input i have in a conversation gets brushed off since i'm young, ""have no place here"", and don't know what i'm talking about. One on one they're all relatively decent to me but together it's like mob mentality and they tear me apart. 

Now on to the nights, it's a pretty great industry party lots of people in the industry meeting with clients, friends, customers, etc. I would be off on my own talking to people when the group of staff come up and say don't talk to him (me) as i'm greasy and gross and young and shit. Again, I keep brushing it off I don't want to be that guy to overreact. They openly tell other people that if I wasn't working for my dad I would be unemployable, etc. Just some pretty offside things in my opinion.

Anyways, how do I go about this? Listening to this ridicule is making me fucking depressed and I feel like if I keep brushing shit off it'll make me sociopathic or something. The main person who dishes it out is the BD. The BD and I sit together in the office, the BD also makes the most money out of the employees I listed because she makes commission for answering the phone and meeting new clients. EVERY single one of these calls is from my marketing plan, not one piece of business has actually been 'developed' by the BD personally. That's what pisses me off the most. I make the least amount of money, have to put up with endless abuse, don't want to bring my dad into the equation too much since I'm a big boy. Part of me want's to just shut off our fucking marketing program and put our BD out of work. Part of me want's to quit and accept a job offer I've received. And part of me wants to stay in the company and continue helping my dad be successful because it's the closest we've ever been. My family is starting to notice that i've been depressed, I can't sleep, I'm just at the point of breaking and I don't know what to do. I like my job, I like the clients, I like the industry, but I can't keep being happy here right now. 

TL;DR: Co-workers are dicks to me at my dad's company. Co-workers get drunk at a conference became even bigger dicks to me, seems to be getting worse and worse. Insulting me in public in front of people I know and try to make business relationships with. Looking for some advice on what to do."
3ac7sg,1,2015-06-18,Currently in desperate need of prayer and a turn around in my life,Doraadams,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/3ac7sg/currently_in_desperate_need_of_prayer_and_a_turn/,"My life for the past 6 months has been very hard. It all started when I broke up with my best friend that I had known since I was 12 (I'm 20 now),  and in doing so we called of our engagement. It was a devastating blow to me and my emotions. Admittedly I was close to the king suicidal thoughts, but I was too scared and new that was wrong. 

On a different note after I broke up with my best friend I started lying about the hours that I worked at my internship. It's been a few months since and I've continued to do it until this past week when I became very ill. I have been sick for the past few weeks, but this last Saturday I had to go to the hospital. I am currently under careful watch because my liver is having major issues, and I have to get blood work done almost every other day. 

The real problem is this: I got an email from one of my co-workers today saying that I needed to call him as soon as I can because it was urgent. Long story short tomorrow morning I have a meeting with him and the head of human resources (which funny enough is my ex's mother) about some confusion regarding my time card and my work. I am absolutely terrified. I don't know where to turn and I am scared my life may be ruined completely. 

I have already told my mother the truth about everything and tomorrow morning I am going to try and be resigning before anything bad happens. I am aware I am in a lot of trouble, as I rightfully should be, but I realize I made a huge mistake and just want to get out fast. I will pay back the money over time if that's what they want, but I am just scared that there will be more than just that. 

I  just need someone to help and pray for me and also to just turn my life around. I used to be all for Christ, but over the past few years things have gotten in the way and I've lost sight of it all. Back then I was always a good boy and never did anything wrong like this. I am tired of being stuck in my sinful nature like this and want to change.


TL:DR - I really messed up in my live emotionally and might be in a lot of trouble legally. I am about to start the long process of recovering from all of this, but am scared of the road ahead.  "

3ad0er,29,2015-06-18,Encouragement for all the current students and those thinking about studying ChemE.,kilnkiln,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/3ad0er/encouragement_for_all_the_current_students_and/,"First off, as a recent grad this sub is quite depressing because quite a few comments seem to be career related, but never the positive side of a career. I wanted to share my experience in undergrad for people who are at the beginning of their college experience. I also want to share what I did leading up to me accepting a full time offer. I also want people to flood this post with positive stories about what they did in college/directly after college that led to be gainfully employed. In addition, stories that showing how you went from a job you hated to one that fit you more would be appreciated. I also think it will be very good encouragement to all the younger ChemEs. 

My story started freshman year. I initially wanted to go the medical school, but knew that if I changed my mind I needed to get some work experience. During the first co-op day I signed up for some interviews. I had so few hours that I only got the scraps.   Every student got 5 interviews, I was only able to scrounge up 3, because all the other slots were taken. I went to the interview day, AND all the interview prep sessions. Long story short I was offered a co-op the first semester of my freshman year. I tell that story to highlight the importance of seizing opportunities as they come up. Unless you are very lucky a ""perfect"" situation will not arise. Its up to you to make the most out of every career related service on campus. What I'm saying is go to the career center every semester and get your resume reviewed and updated. Do not wait until you want to apply to something. Some of you may be thinking but I don't have anything to add to my resume, which leads me to my next point. 

In this era you need to be involving yourself in extracurricular activities if you can afford it. College is more than a set of course work. It is a combination of all your experiences. Get involved your SGA,engineering clubs,honors colleges,business clubs. Signing up and not doing anything is not what I'm advocating. Actually get involved. The experiences from other clubs will give your resume a boost, and it will give you practice working with others, and more importantly give you situations to talk about during your interviews. 

Back to the co-op, when you finally get co-op/internship give it 110% even if its not your favorite field. Your first internship does not determine your first job, while it can influence it ChemE is so broad that if you work hard and open your eyes you will be able to see how different skills are transferable. When you get that internship/co-op, you need to make it your goal to perform better than every new hire in your dept. That means contributing ideas to the team, giving your mangers possible solutions to things you hear about in meetings( if good enough they may let you lead a team to work on your idea). For example, I had an idea to have an outage on a unit, I gave my reasons and my bosses let me find the contractor, develop a safety plan, outage execution plan and start it back up. I was even allowed to start up a piece of equipment that they shut down for a few years based on my findings. When people say stuff in meetings pay attention and ask questions and give people solutions. All this will again help you stand out in interviews when you talk about your internship/research lab. 

Finally the job hunt, it is the most daunting part, but it doesn't have to be as long as you remember that every employer is looking for someone to solve a problem for them. The job hunt is not about you. It is about showing the company how you will help them save more money or make more money depending on your role. The first place to start is the career center/dept chair that you have been cultivating a good relationship with since you have been getting your resume consistently critiqued and have been developing a strong rapport with the people helping you. Second,look to your internship/coop to see if they have open positions. Third, remember all those contractors that you worked with at your internship. Reach out to them. since you were getting fully engaged in the work process they likely remember you. Forth, reach out to your network on campus. Since you have been very involved on campus you have a lot of friends from all walks of life. They likely have family and friends that can help you if you pass your awesome resume to them. Fifth, get on linkedin and cold contact alumni in your chosen field to see if they can help you. 

Lastly grades. They are important. Get help early in course. Getting a greater than a 3.4 is not impossible, and it will keep you competitive for a wide variety of jobs. With that said, don't think you 4.0 entitles you to jobs. There are hundreds of other students with just as good or better grades than you. You need to show the employer you know the material, and you can help them make money. 

This is basically my story in college. I had a job before spring semester senior yr. A few of my friends that followed a similar path as me were also employed. People who only relied on high grades struggled through the hiring process. The single most important thing I will say is get a coop. Try every semester starting fall freshman year until you get one. Any co-op will help you it doesn't have to be at the biggest company. 

tl/dr: You should read it all if you are a student trying to figure out how to get a job. In short, 
1.Go to all career fairs/co-op days. You are not to young. I got a co-op first semester freshman yr. 
2.Use your career center resources consistently. Aka make friends with career center ppl bc all jobs flow through them. 
3.Get involved on campus. It is good for you, and it will help you stand out. 
4.At your internship, seek out ways to make a difference. Act like its a try out. Your goal is to perform as well or better than most new hires by the end of your term. 
5.You have to network. Think about all the friends you made in points 1-4
6.Your grades matter. Dont play with them on the other hand your high grades dont entitle you to anything. you still need steps 1-5

These are just my 2cents. It would be great to hear some other stories. Maybe this post will give ppl direction and prevent so many job related post in the future. "
3ad53w,28,2015-06-18,"Very happy and can't wait for my next therapy session. Made my mentor something for father's day and I want to brag (long but I gotta vent),",whiskey-monk,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3ad53w/very_happy_and_cant_wait_for_my_next_therapy/,"Some background:
You can fish around my history in this sub. I post all the time. But in a nut shell my mother was extremely abusive when I was growing up. Like I have scars--both literal and emotional--from her parenting. 

My father died when I was 12. He was murdered by a wanted felon. I found out when I was 17 that he (my father) was a child molester and abused someone I was close to in my family. Then I was told that my mother knew and did nothing about it. She actually stayed with him and had me not long after. No idea how she continued to touch that fucker but whatever. 

So, naturally, I was a horrible student. Always acted out. I'd miss chunks of the school year then show up on the last day to take the finals and pass with low/mid 90s. I had teachers tell me *to my face* that I was a waste of intelligence and that I'd never do anything with my life. 

Buuut...then I met Mr. D. My therapist said he thinks Mr. D ignored what was legal and did what *he* thought was morally right. Ignored the slack that he got from other teachers (and I had to ignore being teased by other students on my end). What I mean to say is that I quickly became a teacher's pet. Guy was only 10 years older than me--and two years younger than my sister who raised me--so naturally it was easy for me to open up to him.

We got pretty close. I don't know how it happened but after a mere month under his tutelage I began caring about my grades. I realized I actually felt bad if I earned a poor grade in his class. So I did my homework, participated in class. 17 year old me must've been ecstatic because he gave me positive attention. 

I'd stay after school all the time to hang out with him. I quickly realized we had a whole mess in common. Loved the same movies, music, books, hell both of our fathers raised us loving horror. Turns out his father died when he was 11/12, around the same time that I lost mine. Maybe this was why he originally reached out to me; I never asked. 

During the last week he was distributing grades from his computer. We had the option to go to his desk and have it written on paper or to have him say it out loud in front of the class. I opted for the latter and assumed it'd be the usual 30/40 out of 100. Turns out I earned a low 90. When he said it I practically jumped out of my seat and had this *huge* grin on my face. I excitedly yelled, ""Really?!"", and I can't tell you how hard he was trying to hide his pride. It was all over his face.

Senior year comes around and I intern for him. He ends up losing his job because of budget cuts. I was actually with him when the principal came in to call him to his office. Christ, I felt like my parent had lost their job. 

The local newspaper kept interviewing me--I had been sending them letters about the teachers' union fighting the school board for months at that point. Reporter ended up quoting me saying that Mr. D was ""my hero"". The following school day he had the article clip taped to his blackboard. So the next day I made him a t-shirt that had our school logo on the front and the word ""HERO"" on the back in big black lettering. He wore it the day I gave it to him and on the last day of school. He paid for my cap and gown so I could walk. Then when I graduated he gave me a check for $75 and a copy of Randy Pausch's *The Last Lecture*

So five years has passed since then. Every Christmas and Father's Day I send him something. We keep in constant contact. Well, this year I really wanted to get him something special. 

Guy is a writer, right? He wrote this excellent book and finished it my senior year of high school. He revised it countless times and I'd reread it each time to check for errors and as a first reader type of thing. It eventually landed him a agent but unfortunately no publisher wanted to pick it up.  However, in my mind, the book meant a lot to all of us. I know I felt very close to it after being involved with it to the extent that I was. 

He created this fictional town that essentially started in that book and carried on to his other works. He called it Warrenville, after his late father, Warren. At one point in that book the main character (who is a teacher) wears a ""Warrenville Wildcats"" shirt. 

[So I made him that shirt for Father's Day.](http://imgur.com/a/j5XPU)

He loved it. Also, those are shovels behind the ""estimated date"". It's related to a major plot point in the book. The ""estimated date"" is the year he finished the first draft. Attached is also his response.  

For those confused: A year after I graduated I had asked him if he'd mind being my pseudo-father (I said ""father figure"" but that's the term he ended up using). He agreed and said he'd love to be there for me. I'm 24 now but he's still my hero. Thus, he'll refer to himself as ""Papa D"" when things get sentimental (i.e. when he signs my Christmas cards, birthday cards, etc). 

I'm so happy he likes it. Seriously--it's the kind of happiness I can't feel with my mother and the kind I *know* I never felt with my real father. There's a disconnect with them. But with him I feel like a little kid sometimes. Once I described it to my therapist like this: hanging out in his classroom all the time was awesome. It was like wearing your parents' clothes when they're gone. Just being near his desk and such made me feel safe. Something I rarely felt with my parents. 

I'm so lucky to have him in my life. I've learned so much from him. I wouldn't be who I am today if it wasn't for him. Hell, I may not even be here--I had originally planned to kill myself before graduation prior to us meeting. He changed all of that and made me realize my true potential as a scholar as well as a person.

Life is pretty great.

Also, please excuse any grammar errors and such. I'm wicked tired, hah."
3ad8ae,4,2015-06-19,What to do from CCNA/CCNP?,[deleted],ccna,https://www.reddit.com/r/ccna/comments/3ad8ae/what_to_do_from_ccnaccnp/,"Hello everyone! I never actually knew that this subreddit existed - but now that I am about 1/2 way through studying for the CCNA, it has become a wealth of knowledge!

I am currently going to a community college to finish some prerequisites and plan on pursuing a degree in either Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering. In the mean time, I am looking to work my way up the IT ladder to help offset the god-awful costs of college.

Basically - I am hitting a bit of a wall when it comes to what to do from where I am now. I already have my A+, Net+, and Security+ certifications, but would also like to get the MCSA Server 2012 certification by the end of the year.

---

I work for a computer recycling company and have easy access to 'old' equipment. Because of this, I set up quite the cool home Cisco lab to practice with.

It consists of:

* Cisco 3845 router
* 2x Cisco 2821 routers
* 4x Cisco 2960G switches
* Cisco 891-W wireless router

For starters, I want to confirm - I know this setup is a bit overkill for practice, but I had fun setting it up and it didn't cost me a dime. I was curious if it would be enough to get me by for both the CCNA and CCNP.

---

Moving on - I don't quite know what I should do from here. I am moving to a new area to begin my sophomore year of college in the fall, and will also be transitioning jobs in the process. With the certifications I have now (including the CCNA, which I should have in about two months max), I am not quite sure where to go.

I had an internship through my school district from the beginning of my sophomore year in high school, right up until I began community college. I then transitioned to my current job. In total, I have three years of experience as a ""Network Technician Intern"" in a large school district and almost one year of being a ""Senior IT/Computer Technician"" for my current company. A few months ago, the position for ""Online Sales Manager"" opened up in my company and I haphazardly went for it. The pay (about $16/hour) was nearly 30% higher than my previous position ($12/hour), and as a poor college student, I couldn't pass it down. I also feel that the word ""Manager"" in my resume will prove to be quite helpful. However, I do not think there is any more room for expansion here, so I have started looking elsewhere.

---

I work on servers during my work, study, and free time, and have been keeping a portfolio/photographs/videos of all the personal projects I have 'embarked on' over the past year. It consists mainly of the following, but there is a *lot* more to it:
&gt;Firewall setup with:

* PFsense
* Sophos
* Barracuda

&gt;Linux home/server use:

* Debian
* Ubuntu
* XenProject

&gt;Virtualization using:

* QEMU-KVM
* VMware ESXI
* Hyper-V 2012

&gt;Home Automation using:
* Insteon
* Homeseer
* MisterHouse

---

The problem is, I am 19. At my age, most people suggest something along the lines of a help desk position or an internship, but I honestly think I have the experience/certifications/ability to handle a lot more than that now. I don't know where to go from here.

I honestly love working with virtualization, but I don't know what sorts of certifications would be the right direction and - furthermore - I don't even know if there would be much in terms of jobs in my new location.

---

I don't mean to ask y'all for a direction to steer my life in, but I think that is basically what I am doing!

TL;DR:
I don't know what to do with my experience/certifications/skills. What sorts of job titles should I be looking for? What would be a good starting salary to keep in mind for the upcoming job hunt? What certifications should I go for after CCNA, CCNP, and MCSA 2012? Would it be a better idea to put the IT work aside and just focus on my degree?

If anybody has **any** tips, suggestions, pieces of advice, kind words, etc. to calm my worried mind - I would be so appreciative. "
3adcf9,2,2015-06-19,How to get started in the construction industry?,DuckyDuckDucky,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/3adcf9/how_to_get_started_in_the_construction_industry/,"Hello Everyone,

I'm looking for some advice on how to get started in the construction industry. Some background about me, I graduated in structural engineering from UCSD a year ago in 2014. Since then, I've looked for jobs in the design industry as I thought that was what I wanted to do, but haven't particularly had any luck in finding a good job in the area. A lot of my friends from school have found jobs in the construction industry and seem to be happy with it, so I'd like to give that a try as well.

I have done volunteer work for Caltrans, worked part-time for a small design company, and had an internship for one summer in Brazil for a large structural engineering company.

So far, I haven't had any response from only sending my resume online. Is looking straight up for a field engineer position too much for someone with no experience in the construction industry? Should I apply for some other kind of position? People have said to meet someone in person, but to be honest I wouldn't know where to start.

I appreciate any insight or advice you guys can give.

Before we met, she was attempting to cope with the death of her close friend, who took his own life during her senior year of high school. When I was getting to know her, the suicide obviously still was having a big impact on her. However, as time went on, her mental state seemed to improve dramatically, and we both seemed to be taking positive steps to become the people we wanted to be. 

However, this last year has been brutal. Last summer, she had an internship in a foreign country. We were barely able to communicate, as she didn't have phone service, and I didn't have regular internet access. It became clear to me that her depression was getting worse. She was thinking of her diseased friend often, and her happiness seemed to be draining away from her. Being barely able to talk to her, I felt incredibly powerless. She then confessed that she had cheated on me, while away in another country, with a man that I knew and trusted. 

I was devastated. However, immediately after I learned of her infidelity, the situation got much worse for her: she was sexually assaulted. Although she had hurt me deeply, I still loved her and wanted to help her. She wanted me to stay, so I stayed, and in time, I really felt like I had forgiven her. 

The following semester, the weight of her depression fell down hard upon her. Due to the combined weight of the suicide and the dreadful summer, she was struggling severely with most aspects of her life. She was seeing mental health experts, and decided to leave school temporarily the following semester to manage her depression. Knowing what had happened last time we were divided, I was apprehensive, but I knew she needed to get better.

She continued to see therapists, and she is currently taking antidepressants. However, I would be lying if I said she has beat her depression. And honestly, I am getting frustrated. Not because she isn't better, I mean come on, defeating depression can take a while. What bothers me is that she doesn't seem to be committed to getting better. It doesn't seem like she wants to change. She treats her therapy begrudgingly, as if she only goes because someone told her to. She continues to deny that she could handle stress or emotions better, claiming that she is just emotional and that is the way it is. 

This came to a point tonight. While talking on the phone, she said something that I found offensive and hurtful. A ""shut up"" slipped out of my lips before I could catch it. I apologized, but I was then chewed out for ten minutes. After a while, I was tired of hearing it, and asked her why she took it so personally. In case you haven't noticed, I am not so great at filtering my thoughts. Regardless, she immediately hung up, and I haven't heard from her in hours.

It has now been 6 months since we have last been together, as she returned home, 1500 miles from our college, for her time away from her studies. There is no guarantee that we will be back next semester, and neither of us have the financial means to visit one another. Meaning I have no idea when I will see her again. And as much as I love her and care for her, I really am feeling like this might be too much for me to handle. I really don't want to leave her, but I am feeling pretty miserable. I am tired of these random fights where I am always doing things wrong. I am tired of shelving my issues to help her, without her doing the same for me. I want to help her, but I also want a healthy relationship. I want us both to be happy, both now and going forward. But I am at a loss on what to do. 



   
**tl;dr**: My girlfriend is struggling with depression, and we haven't been physically together in 6 months. Both are taking a toll on our relationship. "

So, there is a lot going on here so I'll try to keep it neat.

I've been with my fiancee for about 3 years this July and we've been engaged since last Christmas. We live in Indianapolis but a turn of events has caused my fiancee to move to Cooperstown NY for graduate school (She's going into museum studies and that is THE BEST school for her field - no joke), unfortunately my job field is a little more complicated. I graduated with a degree in Media Studies and although I have looked and applied everywhere I possibly could and after a year of working odd jobs, the ONLY opportunity given to me in my field is at a local news station in Indianapolis; forcing me to stay for at least a year (I start this job on Monday).

What I guess makes this more difficult for me is that my fiancee and I have lived together for 2 years now (not including practically living together while still living in dorms in college). We are inseparable, she is my best friend and my life (and I mean that in the best way). I have ZERO experience with long distance with the exception of a few months one summer when I took an internship in Denver while my fiancee was in Indy--and even that was difficult.

I felt like I needed to take the job opportunity in Indy because it was the first real offer in my field and I graduated from college 13 months ago. I knew that if I didn't get a jumpstart on my career soon, I never will. Here's one of the catches though... the job is part time and wont fully pay for my rent, bills, loans, etc, so I need a second job (NBD, I know) and I'm fortunate enough to stay with my current job BUT it is forcing to have a 7-Day work week with one day in the week going from 5am-5pm.

Though I'm looking for a different second job I hate to admit it but the one I do have pays pretty well. I feel like I'm living one of my big fears because not only am I not being able to see my fiancee, I am unable to be able to visit her; let alone able sit down for five minutes. For some reason just the idea of being able to have a single day where I can wake up and say to myself ""I don't need to be anywhere today"" really matters to me. I may have to spend my day off doing chores or running errands but at least I don't need to be somewhere.

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do to keep our relationship strong and make sure that I'm doing well enough to not smother her, annoy her, or get constantly upset about not being able to see her. She doesn't leave for another 2 months but I'm already feeling like she left or everything is the ""Last This or Last That"" and I'm constantly breaking down at least once a day (which, as a 23 yo male, beforehand that NEVER happened).

There are a lot of other things going on which have made things worse. Within a month I have a big wedding to attend in Chicago, move into a new apartment, my parents have been divorced for a year but through complications have to still live in the same house up in Chicago--which is messing up my younger siblings, my father has been diagnosed with several types of cancer (I'm not making this up), all while starting a new job and plan a wedding in Wisconsin.

All-in-all, I feel like my fiancee is the only good thing in my life and now she's moving away and I can't go with her. There isn't an issue about trust or anything (which is good), we've started doing this texting thing where we're making up our own story through the texts in a sort of RPG theme, and there will be some breaks; so why am I still a wreck?

I think it's safe to say that I'm terrified of such a drastic change, especially for not being able to wake up next to my fiancee. I'm afraid to be alone (though I have a cat), because I can't be by myself to deal with my nearly explosive anxiety now. I have friends here but they like to party, live without problems and stay out late (which I just can't do much anymore). 

I guess I should state a big elephant in the room: I haven't been on my anti-depressant meds for a while. I was on them for about 3 years and when things in my life were going pretty well I felt like I didn't need them anymore. But things started getting tense and I went to go refill my prescription but it was expired. I got my prescription from a psychologist from my college and I can't get it from her anymore. I'm trying to look around for a doctor I can go to that will accept my health insurance and be good enough for me to be a regular patient but money so EXTREMELY tight right now (I just had a week where I had LITERALLY 12.38 in my account) but I know I probably need to just bite the bullet and spend the co-pay.

On top of everything going on at my parents house in Chicago, staying in Indianapolis while my fiancee is in Cooperstown, and having a 7-day work week, I just keep trying to tell myself ""It's only temporary, it's only a year"" but I sometimes fear that I will have a serious mental breakdown. Sometimes I don't know if I can make it. My heart feels like it's going to jump out of my chest--CONSTANTLY.

Sorry about the novel, and I can say that I'm telling the 100% truth on everything. No exaggerations or dramatizations. Please, just tell me something that will keep me going... 

tl;dr: Have to do a long-distance relationship while my life is being turned upside down, I'm a nervous wreck / How do I go about it and stay happy?"
3aepa4,2,2015-06-19,Question about whether I should see if I could be bisexual or not,mtlgaycurious,AskGayMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGayMen/comments/3aepa4/question_about_whether_i_should_see_if_i_could_be/,"Hi,

I am from Montreal and I have been, until very recently, in a relationship with my wife of almost 20 years. I am 40.

**First, the background:**

Over the last few years, our couple had been rocking the boat, with me notably having a short-lived girlfriend 2 years ago during a bit of separation during a few consecutive months of separation.

My wife and I have been on and off for the last 4 years or so, never close enough to have weeks of good time in a row, but never moving apart. The problem is that I want the relationship to continue, and she wants to be alone.

But here is the problem: during the bits that I try to get into a new relationship, all I find is women who are totally unwilling to compromise or adjust anything in their lives.

They want a man to share their own life, but don't really want to share the live of that man.

My short-term girlfriend was a little better but between you and I, she was a back to school student who decided to return to become a doctor in her mid-thirties and between her workload, her debts, her isolation (she was in a far away hospital to finish her training), she had to compromise with a man to just have one in her life. We broke up when she failed her internship and suddenly became demanding, needy and controlling.

My friends all say the same thing and many have decided to remain single. If appears that there is something in the education of Quebec women which does that.

Until today, I thought we were alone, but right now, the debate is even in the Journal de Montréal, our biggest newspaper.

To make things worse, I was raised in a very homophobic family (my mother went to many anti-gay wedding events) and I was raised with the understanding that if I was gay, I was worse than anything else.

I was also bullied by kids and called a faggot just for being a nerd...

**Experiences**

About 15 years ago, my wife and I were swingers. We went to a few swinger's club and even to bisexual evenings, since back then, my wife was bisexual (now, she is zerosexual).

I had very small experiences with men, and what I disliked is the too abrubt approach. A man decided to start a hand job and he almost tore off my penis.

Granted, these are NOT Gay man, but rather married men who want to do stuff with other men, while their wives have sex with other women.

But I definitely wasn't turned off by them, and exchanged a few kiss and one french kiss.

My wife however, didn't want these to go further. I wasn't allowed to experience more, like blow-jobs (I somehow was interested in giving a blow job back then) and sodomy (I was really, really interested in feeling a man inside of me, and I actually preferred sodomy with my wife than vaginal sex).

**My problem**

My specific problem is that I think I am both a demi-sexual (I only really feel sexual attraction within a couple, as a result, I only had sex with 2 women during our swinger years, while my wife had sex with over 30 men and 20 women and yet, I am not sure I was demi-sexual with men, from my small bisexual sample. I seemed to feel more inclined to go further with a man than with a woman). and need to be in a couple to feel healthy emotionally (I know, cliché).

When we did threesomes, I had no problems being naked with the man, and I really liked how simple it is with guys. All of the guys seemed ready to do anything and to adjust to our needs, while the few women had long lists of requirements (including those from my wife).

In short, I have grown to love the flexibility and simplicity of guys versus the complexity and requirements of women.

**Furthermore**

I have developed multiple desires and fantasies over the year, which require a certain open-mindness and flexibility.

I really enjoy nudity and went to naturist events. I am often (if not always) naked at home since our separation (even if we still officially live together as roommates) and nudity is a taboo for most women.

Even my short-term girlfriend, she appreciated spending a morning watching tv in bed with me still naked from the previous night, but I barely saw her naked for the whole relationship, having sex only in the dark under the covers.

I also enjoy BDSM, on both sides, including chastity play. I know I would enjoy being sodomized by a man while wearing my chastity cage, and would enjoy sodomizing him while he is wearing it...

It's weird, in vanilla sex, I am apparently mostly heterosexual, but in BDSM, I think I am mostly gay... I sometimes masturbate to the idea of sucking the cock of my master while chaste, and then, a few days later, having him suck mine.

and at the same time , I'd love to share passion with my SO, like doing Arduino circuits, watching Jason Statham movies, and reading Sci-fi books in tandem, something that is very important to me and which my wife (and most women) don't share.

My short-term girlfriend, for example, the thing that appealed to me the most was her love for Dune books, but in the end, it was only because of the honore matrones sexual manipulations over men, she only read them because of an ex who pushed her to read them.

**So, do I pursue this?**

Should I try to see if perhaps, I would be bisexual and happier in a couple with a man that might share similar interests or is my situation insulting to them, a little like if I was saying: I am only into guys because girls are too close minded.

Considering I mostly masturbate to women, would that be a problem or is that again a repressed gay feeling? That perhaps I couldn't visualize guys because it might be a repressed emotion?

There is a gay naturist center in the Montreal area, with a sexual section and I was wondering if perhaps, I should investigate my emotions regarding this.

If so, is there a protocol I should know? Is it as simple as more people say?

I am so confused...


**EDIT: I just found /r/gaykink and it seems rather interesting...**

What remains of the buildings there are are losing a fight against nature with mutated plants growing at an exponential rate and feral animals running wild in the streets.

We were able to gather some supplies and equipment from Vault 5 to the north of the city, but Vault 4, located under the ruins of Grand Central Station, is a bust. The door is sealed tight and I don't think they'll be opening it anytime soon.

While exiting the city we encountered a party of well-armed soldiers claiming to be scouting for supplies from a settlement in the Pittsburgh area. They were accompanied by several ragged looking survivors who seemed to be in some distress.

Due to their heavily armaments and well-trained appearance we disengaged and will be returning to Great Lanta shortly.

Blinking her eyes as she lifted her hand to cover them Scarlett stepped up the staircase into the largest room she'd ever seen. Across the hall the sun glared mightily thought the large windows as she peered around at the unfamiliar surroundings. Everywhere she looked there seemed to be rubble, but she was undeterred, this was the first time in generations anyone had left the Vault, and she felt honoured to have been chosen.

Slowly she began to make her way over to the window, climbing up the pile of rubble before looking out over the city. To anyone else the overgrown vista may have been depressing, but to Scarlett it was a new horizon filled with possibilities. As she looked out over the crumbling buildings only one thought passed through her mind.

'I wonder if there's anyone out there, and I wonder if they wanna get laid...'

Liam Hawke Ex Brotherhood Of Steel Knight Height: 6""2"" Weight: 96 kgs. Muscular body type. Eye: Bright Blue Hair: Black Gender: Male Sexuality: Straight Age: 26

Liam was with the California chapter of The Brotherhood Of Steel for a fair few years and he thought he would be with them for more. But after a load of changes by new leaders and rules that were being conservative and stupid Liam had enough. He had asked two of his best mates if they wanted to leave this place with him but they said no. So that left Liam on his lonesome out in the wasteland.

Liam was a a lot luckier than most people in the wasteland, having power armour and the best range of weapons and explosives. So he didn't really have any problems with any humans he encountered they would usually stray away from him when he had his armor on. Though he did have to kill a a lot of mutated creatures.

Liam spent all his time traveling across the U.S, going to the East Coast he decided. But after awhile he stopped and thought why the hell is he going there? He didn't really know. He stopped in abandoned buildings, remote settlements and semi destroyed cities when he needed rest or wanted a break.

After months of the same process he saw signs that he was approaching the state of New York. Liam smiled, he had always wanted to see New York.

Hello there people! This was the start of a story that I had going with someone else but due to personal reasons they had to leave but now I am looking for someone to revive it. I would play the role of Liam so I am looking for someone to be Scarlett. I want this to be a long term role play. Don't worry so much about the large wall of text if that worries you as i do want long detailed rps but normally do a paragraph or two/three per posting. This is obviously set in a post apocalyptic/ post nuclear world of the video game series Fallout. I would prefer to role play over platforms such as kik, yahoo msger, skype, google docs and google chat/hangouts. I can send the rest of the story or we can make our own start from after these two posts. If your interested send me a detailed message.

3af0ou,1,2015-06-19,The one and only school list plea.,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/3af0ou/the_one_and_only_school_list_plea/,"Hey guys, I have a list of schools I'm interested in. I looked through all of the MD schools and tried to find fits based on the OOS rates and MCAT/GPAs. I've submitted my primary, but I can always add. Just hoping to get some input on my list and chances! (I know my MCAT and volunteer experience are likely going to keep me out of the higher-tier schools.)

Overview of me –

Florida Resident

White Male

Graduated in May 2014 from a mid-tier liberal arts college in Tennessee. Have moved back to Florida since and am working and taking a few classes (1 pre-req). 

GPA: cumulative: 3.90, science: 3.90

MCAT: 33 (10/ 11 / 12); 91st percentile.

Research: Selected for a fellowship where I worked a little over a year and 1000 hours at a top tier institution (research was clinically relevant, but is primarily animal based). I presented at a national meeting and will be coauthor on a manuscript in preparation (and hopefully out by interview time).


Volunteering (Total: ~100 hours. I know I am lacking in depth and continuity and am continuing to build on my gap year) –

Clinical: 25 hours total throughout the schools year of volunteering as the assistant to an MRI Tech.

Non-clinical: I worked as a healthcare liaison at tax sites for disadvantaged individuals; I briefly volunteered at a bike co-op during my time in college and am continuing to do this where I now live at a similar outfit; distributed public health information at an event in New Zealand (Sadly could not get clinical experience in NZ, but it turned out this was a meaningful experience as it pointed me towards access to care and Navigating). 

Extracurricular Activities: Was on the club fencing team for 2 years and an assistant captain my senior spring. 

Shadowing: Selected for an internship at a children's hospital that included rotating through various clinical specialties and shadowing doctors and medical students for a semester (100 hours).

Work experience –

Clinical: I worked briefly as a part-time medical scribe for a private surgery practice (60 hours), but they were bought by a big-box hospital and could not bring me with.

Non Clinical: I was Navigator for the Affordable Care Act during my gap year (400-500 hours) and will continue to do this through the next Open Enrollment period that ends January 31st. This included working one-on-one with disadvantaged populations and helping people understanding their healthcare options. (Will be stressing this throughout my application as it was a very important experience for me and has helped really develop many skills that will be critical to being a physician. Plus, it is unique.) Early in my college career, I was also a primary camp counselor for two summers (800 hours). I think stresses more important qualities and was a significant activity to me.

Miscellaneous things:

1.) Immediate family in medicine: Mother, Father, Grandmother, Grandfather (x2) are all physicians. 

2.) Nothing really sticks out, but I'm leaning towards a sub-specialty within pediatrics. Maybe hem-onc, surgery, or cardiology? I really don't know at this point. 

3.) 2 Letters of rec are great, 2 are good, and 1 is okay. 

4.) I'm planning to take a month long solo bike tour throughout parts of the US after my job as a navigator ends. 


Schools I have in mind –

4 Huge Reaches:
Baylor, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Case Western.

4 Reach Schools that are a little better stat fits (still big reaches):
Emory, Tufts, Brown, Dartmouth.

10 Reasonable Fits: 
VTC, UVM, SLU, Miami, USF, UCF, UF, FSU, FIU, FAU.



Let me know what you guys think of the list! All suggestions, criticisms, and comments are welcome! I appreciate the help. "

I moved here from a different foreign country, not in Europe. It's a transitional time in my life and I am currently sorting out my visa status and then I can focus on local business (i am a web designer)

She is a university student who is struggling to finish school and is currently doing a paid internship which is ultra stressful. Her English is great so we can communicate on practically a near-native level. But she is also in a transitional period in her life at 22 she is feeling the pressure of responsibility and adult life. Yes I am aware its a 12 year age difference.

It gets more complex. She ~~is~~ was a nymphomaniac when she was away for college. She has calmed down but sex is still **VERY** important to her.
I have a medical condition that has slowed my production of sperm and subsequently testosterone and has lowered my sexdrive a lot.

And to make it even more complicated, she lives with her mom (who just recently divorced which I had to deal with partially being her love) AND I live with family also. So we are both dependent and limited in our assets financially.

She is getting really frustrated and is often disappointed when I do not show her the attention (emotionally or sexually) that she wants.

I must also say that I told her I wasnt really looking for a serious relationship when we started which she agreed to but has since ""changed her mind""

We love eachother but its a struggle.
I am looking for advice on how I can push myself to be more intimate or make this work. I can give more background about my and her past relationships if it would help.

TL;DR
An expat american (with less testosterone than needed) in a relationship with a local Greek girl is struggling to keep his young GF happy in bed. Hoping to find a way to make it work.

How is this legal?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3afrgi/im_being_paid_a_small_stipend_for_a_fulltime/,"I'm working 30-40 hours a week for a small IT non-profit, who is giving me a stipend of $700 until August 19 (8 weeks from now).

The management intern is being paid less since she has a less technical/demanding job.

My gross income from this will probably be about $400 (3 gallons of gas per round trip) or less due to commuting expenses. The reason I have to put up with this is because it's valuable experience.

I haven't felt this way about a girl in a long time.

What's holding me back is a couple of things, that I wanted to see what you all thought about: 

1. I'm her boss, and even though we're an office of less than 10 people, including the interns and we have no policy against it, it just seems wrong.  I can't help but think that some of this might just be making excuses in my mind to stop me from doing this.

2. I have some severe self-esteem issues, and while I do a good job of outwardly masking that, in situations like this it makes me question whether or not she is even flirting with me or I'm just completely misreading her.  I have noticed she acts differently with me than with the other guys in the office, though, which makes me think maybe I'm right.  I still can't allow myself to believe that anyone would actually like me, even though I know that's bullshit. TL/DR: I have unresolved mental issues.

3ah4wf,35,2015-06-19,Tonal Dissonance in Nightcrawler,s_connoisseur,TrueFilm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/3ah4wf/tonal_dissonance_in_nightcrawler/,"Hey /r/TrueFilm,

I know Nightcrawler gets a lot of talk in this sub, so I think I'd better use it as a starting point for a more general discussion.

It really got me thinking about the use of score - I think James Newton Howard's score is actually a very good one, and I enjoy the sound, but I don't believe it matches up with the tone of the film. The quiet but somewhat soaring guitar of the title track is nearly ambient - as one viewer on YouTube puts it, ""though the score is set to a sociopath's journey, the guitar score makes me yearn to fulfill my dreams."" That's exactly what I felt throughout the film - this uplifting, ambitious music superimposing itself onto Lou Bloom's disturbing acts. 

An obvious answer for why this is done is to enhance the psychopathic perspective of the protagonist. It makes sense to further engross us in his world by turning this death and destruction into ambition and profit, but as I watched the film I felt that the score doesn't feel jarring enough to carry with it some creepy irony. Serial killers singing lullabies and career criminals singing top-40 pop hits are more than explicit enough, perhaps excessively so, in their disconnect. Scoring a murderous rampage with the tinkering of a child's music box is clearly a move that enhances atmosphere. Though I can see the intent in Nightcrawler's score, I don't really feel it worked as well as intended.

I would put the severity of this disconnect down to the clash between cinematography and score. I don't think you can deviate so greatly between the two without invoking a sense of irony, and I don't think we reached that point throughout the film. It didn't feel enough like commentary; it wasn't utilised well enough to make a point in it's own right. I don't know how they could have utilised this discord any better, and so I don't think I would have utilised it at all. It was just... off.

Certain sections of it seem misplaced and poorly timed. That's not to say that James Newton Howard isn't a fantastic composer - his work on films like King Kong (2005) and Treasure Planet (2002) is beautiful. Take, for instance, the track 'Making the News.' 'Making the News' feels like it would be better accustomed to an intellectual drama such as Good Will Hunting or A Dangerous Method. It feels too melodic for the subject matter at hand. This may be a part of Lou's disconnect from others, and it may represent his clarity of mind and the peace with which he does his job - even if this is so, I did expect something darker and more menacing. It may have even suited the tone better. Certainly, there are times when the score delves to this level.

I felt the darker parts of the score were bookended by two moments in the film - the moment Lou enters the house following the shooting and the moment the car chase ends. Here we get a bit more pulsing bass and a little less treble, reflecting Lou's descent further into complete depravity. But then, we get to the epilogue scene where Lou hires his interns for Video Production News and the treble returns with all its ambition - though Lou has undoubtedly won, and this is his triumph, it's almost too much. I want to be worried that Lou's still out there, and I am, but the music greatly defuses this menace.

All this having been said, I am a huge fan of David Fincher and, by extension, Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor. I might have gone into the film expecting a darker tone, based on the [trailer music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC95NXEQruQ), and maybe this made me see the score as unnecessarily light in certain places.

&gt;Do you agree? Disagree? Are there any other films that you can think of where there's been some kind of tonal disconnect between elements?

PS: So I found both [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/2l4zor/nightcrawler_and_the_importance_of_score/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/2p9dcr/does_a_films_soundtrack_have_to_tell_the_truth/) after I was done writing, but I think I'll post regardless because it seems like it hasn't been discussed *too* recently and I spent a while on this (granted, I should have used the search function)."

Failing every assignment and test and having no one to relate to or a friends to even talk to...

Today, while in Indiana for my internship, I got it seized at a bar in a college town. 

I tried to argue with the bouncer (i have gotten fakes back this way in the past), but the police were right behind me and I did not want to risk getting arrested, so I did not push it.

He took one glance at the ID and immediately said ""fake, out of line."" Did he just look at me and assume I was underage? I really don't look underage, and I was wearing similar clothing to other people at the bar. Was it the fake or just me?

I took an Uber home, and on the ride the driver told me that most of the bouncers in Broad Ripple (where I got it taken away) were excise police who were specifially hired to do this. Is this true? Is this common practice in college towns?

In any case, I'm pretty upset (have not had this problem before) but based on quality from other vendors, I will probably be buying from /u/MisterReplicator again sometime this week. His IDs are honestly great, this is the first (and hopefully last) time they have not worked."

3ahwvj,7,2015-06-20,"My [25 M] girlfriend [25 F] got drunk and asked me if I liked girls. How should I react, and why did she ask me this?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ahwvj/my_25_m_girlfriend_25_f_got_drunk_and_asked_me_if/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years. She's the most genuine person in this world, and I love her to death. Our relationship has always been great.


We are both still finishing up school and living with rents, but planning to move out and do everything right with our personal lives once we get our professional lives together.


Plus, we're broke-as-fuck college students. I bartend and she has an internship alongside school.


Anyways, we don't see each other much, right? Always communicating though. I understand how important that is to a relationship. Also, when the fucking stars and planets align, and we do get the chance; we seem to fuck like we're the only survivors of some nuclear holocaust or some shit.


Which makes this part so weird. I worked 80 hours one week about a month ago, and my company gave me the next Saturday off for it (those of you who have never worked in the service industry: that's like not having to come in on a Monday for people that have real jobs. Never happens.)

So we really haven't seen each other in about a week. We go out, get drunk have fun etc. The night was a complete success, ya know? No nit-picking or passive-aggressive jabs back and forth over cocktails as you get more in you.

Since we haven't been out in a while, she went a little overboard. I mean, she was pretty damn drunk, but whatever I was driving, and I kept it cool. I do not drive intoxicated. 

She gives me road head on the way home, right? We're so ready to tear into each other that we have sex right there in the car in front of her house. 

We jam some music afterwards, smoke a cig, etc. when she turns to me pretty seriously, and asks if I like girls. I was confused.

""Wait... Do you think I'm gay? What the fuck?""

She looked at me with such a glazed, blank look. I've never seen her look at me this way. This took her some mustered up courage. 

Im a really laid back guy. Im very trusting, and understanding now. I used to be sort of a control freak, and couldn't figure out why I chased away all the ones that I love. I used to get angry. I turned that around before her, and decided that I need to let my significant others lead their own lives, and I should feel privileged to be included, and vice-versa, of course. I grew up a little from 18-25, I guess.

I was really upset. I didn't know whether to scream or cry. I finally found a girl that made me think, ""wow, so this is why people get married. I could really get used to having her around all the time,"" and she thinks I'm gay. Great.

""Amanda, Do you think I'm gay?""

She dodged the question, and kinda stammered out something about hearing people think that I was gay. My friends. This made me even angrier. I started interrogating her; just confused and desperate as fuck to figure out what the fuck was going on.

Finally, without discovering any other information, I told her to go to bed, and that we would talk about it that next day.

The next day, I'm hungover more so from the work than the beer, but I drag myself over to her place. She's all sobby, whiney, and crying saying how sorry she was, and hoe much she fucked up, and doesnt know what the fuck she was thinking etc. etc. 

I basically forgave her and told her that I just wanted to forget about it. Mostly just to shut her the fuck up, and stop her from telling me that she was sorry for the 1000th time. 

That was the last we talked about it. It kind of eats me up inside now though. I know that alcohol is almost kin to truth serum, and that question didn't just spring on her that night.

In high school, I played baseball, football, basketball, golf, ran track, and jumped triple jump. I was also the only straight dude in the LGBT club. I'll never forget the look those queers gave me when they saw me walk in the first day :)

I wanted to be a politician. I wanted to fight for single mothers, and the LGBT community. I felt like single mothers were some of the most neglected; and that gays deserve the same rights as every other human being.

So, I started going to meetings and really getting to know these people. I've even gone out and shook some hands during Pride. I was quite the tolerant jock, if you will. Pretty rare.

She didnt know me then, but she knows about it.
I could see how this could be turned around by others, and people could probably think I'm gay without knowing me, but it is especially weird for the woman who has been penetrated by me more than once to ponder this.

Regardless, I dont like dudes, and she was asking it in a tone as if maybe I didnt even know that I was gay. Why does she think this way, guys? I dont want to lose her, but I don't think I look at her the same anymore. 

Sorry for the long story. Im not very eloquent,  so I appreciate you sticking through to the end.

**tl;dr**: my girlfriend got drunk and asked if I was gay. I am not. What do."

The first time I started dating her (let's call her Jane)  was in the 7th grade, right after we first met each other. Ever since then we have been intertwined. We dated for a period of at least several months four or five times throughout high school. Half way through our senior year, I had just broken up with a another girl after a year, because of my feelings for Jane. We hadn't been close during that relationship, but it was a very rocky one (like most high school relationships), so we eventually started talking even before I ended it with the other girl. (Nothing inappropriate, but I know my girlfriend at the time still wouldn't be happy). A week after I got out of that relationship, I took Jane on a date. We had fun, but she didn't have feelings for me like i did at the time. But I kept trying and trying to woo her, until there was a about a month left in our senior year. After a while I decided I had to give up, my feelings for Jane were very strong and I felt they'd never be returned. So I started seeing this foreign exchange student from Columbia. We really fell into that infatuation period and things started moving quickly, even though she was leaving in just a month. As soon as I took my attention off Jane, hers was on me.  Things ended with the Colombian quite badly, and Jane and I started dating just after a couple weeks. 


From there it moved quite quickly. We both already knew each other well, and our flame didn't hesitate to come back. But it was an interesting dynamic, because we had both already picked the colleges we would be attending. There were both about 8 hours away, in exact opposite directions. We only had summer together (three months) and we didn't know what we would do. But after about a month of dating we decided we didn't want it to end there, neither of us could let that happen. That was very emotional for Jane, and it led to her kissing one of my best friends. (He is known among our friend group for not respecting the boundaries of our guy friend's girlfriends). I understood it was an emotionally difficult time for us, and we decided to stay together. We recovered and the summer went really well for us. But that was the easy part. 

Come August and we are moving out to our schools. I am an introvert and she is an extrovert and this was reflected on our initial experience in college. I became close with my roommates but was still very lonely. She was having a lot of fun making new friends. The shock of being apart was hard and i pushed really hard for attention from Jane. Within a week of being at school we broke up. But we only stopped talking for about a day and we were back at it like normal again. Talking every day. Telling each other we love each other. It was like we were dating, but we technically weren't. After about three weeks of that, and failed attempts to get her back, I said something I shouldn't have. I made a comment about how it was her fault we weren't together, and she took it very harsh. It was right before I was leaving for the weekend and wouldn't have cell phone service. When I returned, I got a text saying how we would never work again, only a friendship was possible. She also told me she saw someone else over the weekend. After that, contact stopped. I was completely devastated. But after about two weeks I texted her. We were really into just being outside and observing nature so one day I texted her saying I saw her favorite bird (a bald eagle). She only responded with ""no."" From there I figured we really were done. But an hour later I received an ""I miss you"" from Jane. She had been drinking a little bit that night and I don't know if that just made her be more honest with her self or what, but from there our flame was rekindled immediately. We both came to our hometown about two weeks later, and got back with each other within an hour. 

From then on things went really well for a good while. I ended my time at school after just one semester and moved back to my hometown. This distance was too much for me so I was more than willing to be eight hours closer to her. I worked for a semester with the plan of returning to school at the university in my home time In the fall. We struggled a little during this time because I had a problem with weed and lied about it. During the summer she came home, but we faced more trouble because I got arrested for weed possession. Nothing major, I got my record cleared and all my fines were dropped, but she took it very hard. After about a month we recovered from that and we were very much enjoying our summer. She would still bring up the arrest from time to time, but we seemed mostly recovered.


Come fall, Jane really wanted to get into letter writing when we went to back to school. I never been very needy in relationships, and I think this makes me forget about the needs of others sometimes. She sent me a letter every day for about two weeks, and I lazily only responded once or twice with letters. She was sad, but it was nothing major at the time. We had gotten into the habit of talking on the phone everyday, so communication wasn't an issue. She was always busier than I, so she always ended up being the one who called since it was much more convenient that way. After a while though she expressed she wanted me to call more often. I didn't see why it mattered too much since we talked everyday anyway, but I obliged her request. After a while though, my calls kept coming and hers waned. She had put in a lot of effort before but now that I had been returning it, she withdrew. We still maintained a good amount of communication but we weren't as close as we once were. We made it through that school year, and we were doing pretty good most of the time. 

When summer came, she didn't move back home, but to the city just three hours away, for an internship. We saw each other most weekends and had a really great summer together. When school started back up, we kept up our communication really well for a while and were doing great. After that one semester, she had found a work program through school where she would work for a semester, so she moved back to same city three hours away this last January. It was a very hard semester for me so taking all the time became especially difficult. We got see each other most weekends, but our phones calls had reached an all time low. I stayed busy with school and was happy with our weekends. It was very different for her though, she had almost no friends in her city, and was not nearly as mentally busy as I. Over the past couple months she expressed she was unhappy, and lonely. But everytime we got together for a weekend, we didn't fight. Things were perfect. A minor spat here and there but there were no major problems when we were physically together. But as soon as we would split up, she would immediately tell me how down she is. There were times too when she would tell me how horrible life seemed. That she struggled to get out of bed, and she felt completely foreign from her family. (She has the closest family of everyone I know). Out of concern, I asked her is she thought she might have depression, or possibly bipolar disorder. (Some days her sadness seemed to disappear only to return a couple days later). Right away she didn't think the bipolar thing was impossible. She admitted that she had problem and said her parents wouldn't believe her even if she tried. But this conversation quickly turned into a very very bitter point for Jane. She no longer recognized any grounds for my suggestions, and she thought I said it to emotionally control her. She felt I said it to blame our problems on her.


This was really hard to deal with. I never meant to hurt her. But said I called her crazy. And couldn't get over it. Our phones all turned into fights but whenever we were together we were just fine. I didn't really understand what was going on. I would come to visit, and the day after I left she would call me and we would fight about everything. I mean everything. Every problem we had, we would list systematically, dating all the way back to the beginning. I didn't understand why we had to talk about every problem we ever had every time we fought. It felt like she was trying to destroy me. She would shine new light on the problems we had very clearly talked about and resolved a very long time ago. Any attempt to try to get her to admit to any mistakes (like kissing my best friend, only led to her being more resentful). Another stressor during this time was our living situation for the summer. She would still be working three hours away then and wanted me to move in with her. We were texting about it one day and I said all I would need is a job. Her immediate response was negative because she thought I was using that as a reason to not move in. I thought it was pretty clear and I just meant it as a prerequisite. I really did want to live with her, but I certainly had my concerns too. She lives in an expensive area, and her apartment is rather small. We never got tired of each other when I came to visit but I knew this would be different. Eventually I decided it would be okay for us to live together. Towards the end of this last month, days before I was supposed to move in, we got in a fight and she said she didn't know if we should live with each other. I figured that was a clear sign to not move in the next day, so I agreed with my current roommates to sign another month where I was living. My plan was to live there long enough to get ready to move in with Jane, and that I would move in midway through the month. But during this time communication was the best between us and what was happening didn't really get put out there. First day of June comes and she asks what going on. I tell her we signed another month to buy sometime, and she becomes furious. She never took any initiative after our fight to tell me she stilled wanted to come, so I was giving her space. My thought was i would just make it worse but my moving in when we weren't ready. But apparently I failed by not taking the imitative to make sure we lived together for all of June. 

So now I've pretty much finished the backstory. The not living together thing had us fighting constantly. She was mad that i didn't tell her I signed another month. Which I understand, certainly, that was a mistake on my part. She didn't take any sort of step either. Nothing. Yet it was all my fault. I told her I still wanted to live together but she said it was too late. Now she claims I never expressed any desire to live with her, at all. But I told her I was excited. I told her I was looking at jobs, I remember specifically talking about it. But these last months I haven't gotten her to admit any sort of wrong doing. She is an amazing girl, but no one is perfect. Last week she calls me and says she can't do it anymore, and she's too lonely and unhappy. I get her to agree to let me come with to her family lake cabin for the weekend. But she already had made up her mind to be angry. We still had fun, but she would analyze every little detail possible with an attempt to find something negative. By the end of Sunday she was ignoring me (for not trying her salad her sister made after a I had a very big meal). We went back to our homes that night and broke up over the phone. That was this last Sunday. But all week, we didn't stop texting. We even called a couple times. We didn't about anything but our issues, it was clear she was still searching for answers to our problems, and it seemed some part of her still wanted us to work out. We talk and she agrees to let me take her out on Friday (yesterday). 


Now comes the confusion. First our conversation was very angry. There was a lot of bitterness about our breakup. She listed off all the ways I've hurt her, and I defended my self best I could. Things got less angry and she started to say she knew it was completely my fault. I asked why and started to talk about the depression with her. She immediately shut down. We had been walking around downtown just talking, and she wouldn't say anything about it. Wouldn't even look at me. She simply refused to accept any sort of depression but in her eyes I could tell she knew it. She asked me to her home. I couldn't make any ground there, so I changed the subject and got her to calm down. I managed to make her laugh a bit, and we quickly became comfortable again. I went through and listed everything I've ever messed up, and why I thought it happened. I told her how I would make things better if we were together right now, and she really perked up. Had a couple joyful tears even. There was still certainly plenty of anger about the past though. We calm down and go in for drinks. We talked like we would normally, almost like we were on another first date or something. I liked it. We left after a bit and started taking and walking some more. Some more bitter topics came up, but it was getting much better, it seemed like we were finding some sort of resolution. Being able to talk without being together seemed to help open up the conversation  and we hit some topics we hadn't before. We went to another bar and returned to what was like normal conversation for a while. Talked about her job, and she opened up a lot about her best friend who betrayed in high school. (Had been an untouchable topic before). We realized we could be very mature about this and resumed our relationship talk. We both agreed that the best course of action was to stop communication for a while, except by letter. I had already started this week, and she liked the idea. I told her I would send one everyday. She talked about how she needed time apart to see if this is what she really wanted. She made it very clear that I shouldn't have absolute hope is us getting back together, but I know she was just being courteous and realistic. She tells me she loves me. And that I'm her best friend. But that she needs to see what it's like without me. Now comes most of the confusion. We bought tickets to a music festival a while ago, and when we first broke up we said we'd just sell them. But now she tells me she doesn't think that we should sell them. That she knows we can go. I agreed to it. I don't get how she can want that with the place we're in. After that, I take her to her parents house where she was staying for the weekend. As we sit in the drive way we had a very emotional moment. She was crying, and grabbed her hand and just looked at her. That lasted about 20 seconds. She leaned in, kissed me on the cheek, then for about 5 seconds on the lips, said I love you, I left my car. When got home I texted her saying I knew I was already breaking the rule, but that I wanted to rap up the night. I apologized again, told her some sweet things, and reminded her about how I can be better. We exchanged texts for another hour and she told me she was sorry. That she it was her fault too that we weren't together. Because she was difficult and tough to deal with. I pressed her to explain what she meant, like I had done very much for her, but she said it was too late (it was 2 am). I acknowledge  that most of our problems were my fault but to hear her give a little bit felt so groundbreaking to me. She hadn't taken any blame for anything in months and it felt good to hear for once that not everything was because of me. This was the last we talked. 


I apologize it is such a long story. It probably seems like we have had shitty relationship overall, and it's maybe not worth it to chase her anyway. But it's hard to describe how well we were when we were together. We've had amazing chemistry for 8 years and I don't think we would've tried at all if we didn't think we could make it through college to be together afterwards. I'm in a very strange state of mind. We aren't technically together. But it's very clear we're trying to find a way to make it work, and that we wouldn't decide to pursue others without telling each other first. So to me, it feels like a break. I know there's a chance she'll never come back, but I am more hopeful than not. So for now, my only way of winning Jane back is through the letters I write. I'm not really sure what I should keep the topic too. If she wants me to try to woo her with romance, or if I should keep it more to a friend level. The reason she liked letters originally was because of the romance. So I don't know. What do you guys think?

3ajykh,3,2015-06-20,"My [20F] roommate [20F] not doing her share of the cleaning, running out of ideas",plzclean,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3ajykh/my_20f_roommate_20f_not_doing_her_share_of_the/,"I'll put the tl;dr at the top since this is so long:

**tl;dr: My roommate won't do her share of the cleaning in our apartment; we have a couch drenched in cat pee, kitty litter on the ground, dishes that aren't being done, and trash that is overfilled and I can't do it all. What do I do?**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Background:**


I've been living with my roommate (we don't share a room, just an apartment) for two summers and since the beginning of the school year. We've been friends for about 3 years, since the start of college, so we decided to live together. She's what I would consider one of my better friends and in the group of people that I hang out with regularly. So I'm trying to not mess with that.


Before this year, during the summers, I'd have issues with how she was cleaning but since it was summer and I was only working I'd compensate for it. Each summer either I or her was barely home too so I guess the mess didn't bother me as much as it has this year.

We've been living at this apartment since September 2014 and our lease is up mid August, after which point I'll be living alone at a different location. During the year I've done my best to keep everything clean but I had a moderate courseload and was spending 20-30 hours a week working and on extracurricular activities. This summer I'm studying for the MCAT and taking summer term classes so I'm busy studying most of the time. She  is working 40 hours a week at an internship less than 15 minutes from our apartment this summer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Problem(s):**


The apartment has gotten bad enough this summer to the point that I don't leave my room except to get food. It's not usually not a large amount of things making a mess that's the problem, just that she leaves in really unhygenic states. The apartment we signed a lease on together this year allows cats and she brought hers with her, which has made the cleaning problem exponentially worse.



The cat pees on everything. If you leave it and it lays on it, it will end up smelling like cat piss. The couch is to the point that if you sit on it for too long you should probably change whatever clothes touched the couch because the smell seeps in. Of course, you can smell it when you sit on it too. Her room (which I don't frequent) also smells of cat pee, but since we don't share that's less of a problem.



She tried to deal with this problem by putting in two litter boxes for the cat, but this has just lead to two parts of the floor of our apartment (the entry and in front of the bathroom door) to always have kitty litter that the cat kicks up there. Its not really possible to avoid it, so I end up walking through it multiple times a day.



She doesn't take the time to clean out the litter boxes, or change out the cats water regularly (its often yellow), which I'm sure isn't helping with either of these problems.
 


Aside from all the problems with the cat, she also doesn't do her dishes regularly. This has lead to three fruit fly infestations and an ongoing ant problem that I've dealt/am dealing with. She leaves food out too, at one point there was a kettle with coffee still in the bottom sitting out for 2 weeks growing visible amounts of mold in the kitchen.



Finally, she just doesn't take the trash or recycling out, but instead chooses to overfill it. She considers this both of our responsibility (which it is), so if she took it out last time she'll overfill it until I see it (I'm not always home) and have to reach into the trash to put some into a new bag. She also doesn't wash up in the tub after shaving or pull her hair of the drain, so I have to do that before I shower unless I don't want it to drain or to step in what I assume are pubes.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**What I've tried**


During second semester I tried to do my best to her dishes/tidy up the apartment for her too. She wouldn't come home except at night, so I just assumed she was busy, even though she had a lighter credit load, wasn't working, and wasn't involved in any extra curriculars. This ended up a lot of time onto the housework I already did, and she never acknowledged that I was even doing things for her. The 3-4 times that she actually did my dishes, I made sure to let her know that I appreciated it... but the 30+ times that I did hers she's thanked me once.



I've tried talking to her about this situation multiple times. Usually when I tell her to do a specific chore (ie, you haven't been doing your dishes! They need to be done today!) she'll do them, but then will revert right back to what it was before. Even though this works, I don't have time to try to chase her down every day and tell her what she needs to do. It's almost more tiring to nag her to do it than to do it myself.



I also tried talking two weeks ago about exactly what she should be doing and how often. At that time she promised that she'd wash the couch when she got paid on Friday (three days later, we have paid laundry in our building), and that she'd start sweeping up the kitty litter regularly, claimed that she rarely left dishes in the sink, and said that she forgets that she leaves hair in the shower. She ended up not doing any of these things (except sweeping up the litter once), and got angry at me when I brought up the fact that she still hadn't washed the couch, that there was still kitty litter on the ground (she actually claimed she'd been sweeping. I didn't know what to say, there was obviously litter still on the floor), and that there were dishes in the sink.



What do I do? Am I doomed to do her chores until  I move out? Or should I just deal with it and not leave my room? All I want to do is be able to relax on my own couch, use my kitchen, and be able to walk through my apartment without stepping in litter. She's one of my friends, so I'm trying to not have her get permanently angry with me for this (like taking her dishes, and putting them in her room)."

Maybe this only applies to me, but allow me to rant anyway.

I moved away from Atlanta for college in 2006, and moved back in 2013 to undergo chemo around friends and family (I'm all clear so far).  Now that I'm up and aware it seems like the ATL has gone through some changes.  What really made write this was picking up the Creative Loafing this week about the music scene and how it's adjusting to the sudden influx of money and expensive development.

Around my teenage/young adult years, 99X was the station to listen to (mainly for Toucher, Rich and the Duplex of Retro Pleasure).  Adult Swim seemed to be the coolest thing coming out of here, and the only movies shot around the city was something with Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton, and the prequel to Dumb &amp; Dumber.  Atlantic Station and IKEA just arrived shortly before my move (at least as far as I knew).

99X, well, most if not all rock radio is gone.  The biggest change might be the huge influx of what's filmed here.  Two Marvel movies, Anchorman 2, the sequel to Dumb &amp; Dumber, Zombieland, Archer, The Walking Dead, The Internship, I know I'm leaving countless stuff out on top of that.  Creative Loafing is still plugging along in print, and Adult Swim is just as relevant and maybe even bigger.

Traffic and public transport is still a headache.

But something seems different to me.  It's like I left home to study abroad and I came back to my little brother finishing his doctorate.  I lived in New York for a year, and I think I'm having a similar reaction to when I met up with a woman in her late thirties in Bushwick, and she marveled at how all the empty warehouses and abandoned buildings were now lofts and gastropubs.

Has Atlanta become like Seattle in the 90s or Portland and Austin now?  Is it a destination city?  What all happened when I went away?"

At this point, I don't know what I was thinking. I think I was looking for love any way I could find it. I was sexually/verbally/emotionally abused by my father from birth to 12, so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.

I do think P is extremely interesting, he is an academic (in fact, he teaches at the university I graduated from). I also think he's incredibly attractive, and I love being intimate with him. But I've realized there is literally nothing of true value for this relationship and I'd like to be with someone in the future that is able to be what I want and would be more conducive long-term.

I just feel extremely down on myself knowing I'm this man's girlfriend. And that I live with him and I am completely financially dependent on him. At this point it is almost impossible to move out because I have an internship that doesn't make any money, so I have no source of income and I do not talk to any family (due to all of the fuck-upedness). 

I just feel so uneasy that he would let things get this far with me at my age. I've just had so many revelations in the last couple of weeks because he has been gone across the country doing research. 

I do not know what to do. He's not at all abusive, he treats me like an equal. So I don't feel in danger of being harmed. I just don't have any money, and I don't have any family. I really don't have any friends to help either, seeing as to how my close friends are 1500 miles away.

I guess I'm just looking for any kind of advice to get out of this situation.


   
**tl;dr**: I've been dating a guy that's almost 40 years older than me and I didn't realize it was fucked until I live with him and am financially dependent on him."

Me and my boyfriend are both juniors in college, and we started dating right after winter break last semester. We started off real strong -- we get along really well, our friends like each other, etc. etc. I really feel like I have something special with him. 

This summer I went home because I have an internship in my hometown. He stayed in our college town because he has summer classes and work to do. This has made him very busy -- he is working maybe 30+ hours a week in addition to two intensive courses. Basically, he works, does homework, and sleeps. 

Recently I have noticed that he has gotten a bit distant. He doesn't say ""I love you"" as much. He doesn't initiate conversations very often, or say good morning or good night. He doesn't seem to really care when I tell him about my day or my thoughts -- he will ask, but it feels like he isn't listening. We communicate almost exclusively through text and snapchat, and he often doesn't reply even after he has seen a text. Like, consistently. He replies to maybe a third of my messages. I don't send a bunch -- but I do enjoy talking to him. It seems like he doesn't enjoy talking to me anymore, though. We Skype maybe once a week, and he always acts like he has something that he'd much rather be doing during the conversation. 

I... I really love him. I know it hasn't been a super long time, but I really feel a connection with this boy. I have tried talking to him about how I feel, but he says that I am basically too needy. Things like, ""I'm sorry I can't give you what you need,"" or ""I feel like you always need me. I'm at my wit's end."" All I want is for him to talk to me! There are some days when things are almost normal, and some days where I feel like he's giving me the cold shoulder. It's stressing me out, and I don't know why!  

I'm going up there this weekend to move into my new apartment, and we were planning on hanging out on Friday. I feel like if I get there and he acts the same way in person, then I'm going to have to end things, and I really, really don't want to. I'm scared. I love him so much, but I deserve to have someone who actively cares about making me feel loved. Thoughts? Am I being too much, or asking too much? 



   
TL;DR - I am worried that my boyfriend has lost affection for me. "

I have two accounts at a local credit union, but there rates are less than stellar. I have setup a Dream account at Barclays, and plan on switching to ally once the school year starts. I have an internship currently, and I plan on taking another job once I return to uni. I repair computers on the side. I hope to make more from that in the future; that's not more than $1000 extra per year. By the spring of 2015 I plan to have a solid setup of some type of IRA and investment portfolio.

IRA: Roth or Traditional
                
I am young, I plan on contributing at least 2k a year then 5k a year after employment in my field, IT. I have read plenty, but I still think I am missing a key concept to understanding the difference. Is an IRA a 401(k)? What about converting one to another later on in life?

Investments

Should I setup a Vanguard account? Where do I go from there? Mutual funs, ETFs, stocks? What's the answer? From what I understand Vanguard is more of a ""they do all the work"" sort of thing. What if I want to manage individual stocks, E-Trade, Scottrade, Fidelity, etc?

I have read some other posts about IRAs and such; maybe I missed one that more aptly applies to my situation. Anyways thank you to the PF subreddit for any and all help."

As of now only a handful of my close friends know that I'm gay. I've been going through a lot of depression and I've been in some pretty abnormally negative situations in the past year. I've been falling behind in school and my relationship with my family is deteriorating (they're really conservative and I have a hard time connecting with them for obvious reasons). 

Anyway, I just moved to Washington D.C. for the summer via a school internship program that I'm participating in. I decided to start being more open with my sexuality now that I'm so far from home and there is a lot less fear of being outed. Tonight I met up with a guy and we went for a walk in the rain, and I told him I wasn't comfortable doing anything because it was our first time meeting. He turned out to be really nice and I decided I wanted to kiss him. So we made out. 

I'm 20 years old and it was my first time kissing anyone (as I said, very conservative). It was sort of a dull affair, considering I didn't know what I was doing and he kind of just stood there. But I'm glad I have the experience and I'm starting to be a bit more comfortable with myself. We're meeting tomorrow for a movie, and while he is looking for casual sex and I'm looking for something a little more serious I think this is going to really help me get out of my shell and start living my life. 

This community has been great in terms of helping me better understand myself. And I really appreciate the support everyone here provides, I wanted to tell someone about this and gaybros just seemed to be the most natural place to go. Hope everyone has a good rest of their weekend!"

But in reality, I'm a hypocrite, a loser, a waste of space, oxygen, and resources. I excel in nothing and am mediocre at few things. I have wasted the so-called ""best years"" of my life in front of a tv and videogames. I've accomplished naught to be proud of and ruminate on every missed opportunity and ""no"" I have ever said. Every invitation I have passed up, every ""maybe next time"" that has been uttered in self-disdain, every ""I think I'll pass this time, but hit me up next time"", and I never did go, has brought me to this point in my life. Mid-twenties with no friends, a hermit in his own house but is still living off family because of lack of monetary funds. Yet here I get jealous when I see other twenty-somethings driving around in nice and new cars and I think ""must be nice too have well off mommys and daddys"". Where some may have it that way, their is nothing saying that they didn't work their asses off, unlike I, and have achieved some sense of accomplishment and success. 

I am the reason I haven't achieved anything so far in life. I'll be graduating with a bachelors this last semester with Cum Laude and a GPA around a B+, there's no reason it isn't an A except I'm a lazy pile of trash. I have an internship and also a job that is less stressful and pays a couple dollars more than my last job, there's no reason that I don't have graduate program already lined up or a salaried job somewhere where I can help my family and pay the bills. Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, I AM better, I should be BETTER, yet I'm just trash trying to make myself feel better in this brief space of time that we call life. I could blame this anger, self loathing, inability to trust, melancholy, asocial, lonely personality I have developed on the last 11 years of depression, the multiple divorces and fights I had to sit through and watch yet never initiated, the pressure of feeling semi-responsible for the upbringing of my four younger siblings (being a father, brother, and role model), yet still not being fully matured myself. But that irresponsible of me to my family and myself.

My inability to act, to care long enough to scope out a better path and/or decision, my flagrant disregard for the ones closest to me, and their thoughts and feelings while I only think about myself, just so I can to return to the normalcy and familiarity that is loneliness and my room just so I can continue to disregard... well everything.

This is my manifesto, my promise to myself and a promise to the poor people who sat here and wasted their precious time on my ramblings. I will do better, I must do better. I will lose this extra weight and gain and maintain a healthy BMI. I will work on and improve myself until I can look into a mirror one day and feel pride for the waste of space peering back at me. I will stop regarding myself as something less than human. I will try my best to practice what I preach. I will spend more time with family and less on wasteful activities like videogames (that E3 Fallout 4 reveal though ;_;). I will not lose my sense of purpose, my morals, or treat anyone less than myself. The other day when I was talking to my mother she told me that I don't have any self-confidence. I thought to myself ""that that's just not true"", I believe myself to be able to accomplish many things. I do, however, lack self-worth. So I vow to place some value on myself and my life as an individual and not just another meaningless cog in the machine. Thank you for reading. 

And if I'm successful maybe I will post to r/progresspics in a years time. Here's hoping I finally act and change everything I need to, to be able to look back on life as a decrepit old man and say it wasn't a waste. "
3al2rd,13,2015-06-21,Why should I vote for Sanders?,ahistoryofnothing,SandersForPresident,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/3al2rd/why_should_i_vote_for_sanders/,"First and foremost, this is not a post to ""troll"" or anything else like that at all. It's a genuine post in which I am completely serious and I want to have a serious thread on. That being said, I don't think Sanders is serious in the least bit, so why should I vote for Sanders? 

Let me explain. 

I have done numerous political internships and I have met various politicians, including Hillary Clinton. I am politically independent and I would say I have voted Republican a third of the time and Democratic two thirds of the time. I have always liked Sanders via interviews I have seen with him it (there's a good one in which he is with Rand Paul on a committee in which he kind of mocks Paul a little, it's pretty good if you haven't seen it). However, only since he has introduced himself into the race that I have started to look what he actually done while in Congress and Senate. 

Honestly, there are two fundamental things stopping me from supporting him: 

1. **You can't actually do the vast majority of things Sanders wants to do as president - that comes from Congress and Senate.** I completely agree with a lot of his stances, but you can't do almost anything he claims to want to do from the presidency. The president cannot introduce a bill. He can only sign it into law or reject it. Given this, I am completely sure that Sanders will veto anything he disagrees with. However, nothing else can really be done except to lobby your fellow party members to sway one way or another. This is one of the most frustrating things I hate hearing from friends who support him. We aren't going to have the kind of socialism everyone is begging for (which I think would be great for the country). It is literally not going to happen. 

2. **Compromise is INCREDIBLY important.** Given the limited things you can do as president, what concerns me isn't the TPP (mostly because I don't think anyone has actually read it; I don't support it because I want it to be read first, then I may support it), what concerns me is that when the budget gets on his desk then he is going to veto it because, guess what - Republicans actually have to be compromised with - and possibly allow a long, drawn out battle like what has sadly become the norm. 

As of now, I have read ""Hard Choices"", ""Living History"", and ""HRC"" and I fully support Clinton. No matter what happens, I want everyone to keep it civil and remember that Clinton isn't actually the devil that everyone makes her out to be. That kind of talk just makes me even more distant from the Sanders team. I am more interested to see what happens during the debates. "

My class is graduating medical school this summer and moving on to intern year. I wanted to give everyone a graduation gift but I own a negative amount of money. I thought I would make them something useful - a laminated intern pocket card. The idea is a pocket sized card with all the information you constantly quickly look up before you take action. Converting opioids, dosages of common painkillers, antimicrobials etc.

Could interns/PGY1-2 give input as to what they would like to see on such a card?

EDIT: Thank you for all the suggestions! Some really great ideas. I'm hoping to keep this a pocket sized, double sided single page of laminated paper. While a basic approach to EKG and indication for radiologic studies would be awesome I don't think it would fit. 

1. ACLS/BLS algorithms. /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt
2. A graphic showing an algorithm for metabolic/respiratory acidosis/alkalosis and differential diagnosis. /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt
3. Common antibiotic indications and dosages, e.g. CAP: Azithromycin 500 mg POx1, then 250 mg PO 4 d or 
Clarithromycin 500 mg PO bid or Doxycycline 100 mg PO bid. /u/hashtag_ThisIsIt
4. Love the idea of the basic things you need to work through for common inpatient problems /u/Wohowudothat . Sidenote: is there any checklist that I can work off of?
5. Opioid conversion chart. 
6. Common pain management protocols, nothing fancy. 

Any more suggestions?"

   * Stylus is missing. No clue where it is, I'd be willing to go buy another one for your convenience but it will have an effect on the price.

   * Box for Alpha Sapphire is missing. Think it got tossed out in the house fire I had a couple of months back.

Ultimatum was given in Feburary due to her weight, causing her major health problems.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3am2bs/me_24_m_with_my_fiance_26_f_of_almost_8_years_i/,"Edit : I'm SINGLE

Hello everybody, almost eight years ago my fiance and I started dating during high school. We've had maybe 3 large arguments since then, all of which have led to us trying to split but we always recovered.


I believe she has been emotionally abusive and physically abusive but I have tough skin and the abuse never got to me. At the time was also depressed, with anxiety over change, and desperate because an attractive girl was giving ME, a socially awkward and morbidly obese WoW nerd attention and sex.


Starting at year 2 my fiance gained close to 100 pounds, I didn't care due to being fat myself but while I was fat, I did not have health problems caused by weight like she did, for example a bad back, bad knee, and being extremely lazy.


To really start, I'd like to talk about my percieved abuse, I'm sorry it is do detailed... I wanted to be as through as possible.
Emotional - at the start of our relationship she had a guy trying to date her who was always calling her and texting her. It was causing us major problems, so she agreed to talk to him and get it to stop. She never did and I had to take matters into my own hands and talk to the guy. He stopped eventually but she always used it as a weapon to get what she wanted since I had only female friends.


A year later my best friend said "" lol, I love you"" on a facebook post. I was informed that I could no longer talk to her because I had asked her to stop talking to that guy, I complied because sex! This started a downward spiral of losing all of my female friends, I was left with my girlfriend and my sisters boyfriend as the only people to talk to. I began to have issues communicating and was petrified of talking to any female.


06/11/08 - we graduate high school. As a graduation gift I am given a brand new car. My girlfriend absolutely loses her shit, leaves dinner, and doesn't come back for hours. When she comes back she complains how it isn't fair that I get the car and how I am so spoiled because I got a car and her parents had made poor choices in life and couldn't afford to even care for her... my dad had bought her a used Honda civic five months earlier, made her pay 1k out of the 4k that was owed and gave it to her as a graduation gift. Sure it wasn't new or shiny but he had no obligation as she had been living here rent free since October. At this point in time I am still in a puppy love phase of the relationship.


8/25/08- we start college at a local community college, she tries to talk me out of going and instead going to work at walmart full time so we can move out, because she wants kids. I go for two semesters, skip two semesters because I thought walmart was a good choice. During this time she refuses to use condoms or birth control, luckily one of us is broken sexually and no pregnancys occur.


Thanksgiving 2011- I buy an engagement ring. I accidently leave the reciept in my glove box and she finds it. Gets upset due to not spending more money, I did the three month ""rule"" but at a Wal-Mart wage. She then proceeds to ask me to give her the ring... every hour for days, I finally cave and at that point I am so mad I just throw the box at her, that is how we got engaged.


11/20/11+2/25/12 - Uncle and Grandmother die.
My fiance calls to tell me while I am working that my grandmother is doing bad in the hospital, I didn't know she was in a hospital. She tries to guilt me into getting a quick marriage so my grandmother could see it, I flip out and have the biggest emotional breakdown of my life... a week later my grandmother dies. I am absolutely devastated by my grandmother's death, she was my favorite adult and I was her favorite / only male grand child. I repeated inform my girlfriend that I cope best being alone, she ignores my requests.


08/25/12- I have graduated with an A.S in sciences, I now must drive 45 miles each way to attend school. She gets super upset that I have to go that far and tries to talk me into finding a job and starting a family. She is currently working at a small retail store making 26k/gross a year with benefits and retirement options. I continue with school but the arguments increase due to being at school 12+ hours a day with bad cell reception. She gets pregnant sometime in here due to refusal for condoms and I'm still a horny piece of shit with no self respect, luckily for me it miscarried and shortly after my penis stops being in control.


April/2014 - I have finished my first two years of my B.S with a GPA of 2.00~. I have been hounded relentlessly to spend time playing video games with her while I should study. Or spend time watching movies, I know for a relationship ship to work that this must happen, but I had gained close to 60 extra pounds since the start of this relationship, when I had already been morbidly obese. I had no energy, I couldn't concentrate in school, and I could barely drive without passing out. I question leaving her to try to go out with my former best friend whom I was not allowed too talk to, this causes a huge argument where she was going too move out, but I was a little bitch and begged for her to stay.


June/2014 - I start a research internship. I am informed that I must pass a physical within a month to be accepted into the field research part of the job, so I hit the gym and diet. Within a month I have lost 35 pounds due to excessive cardio and a rigid diet. I get paired with an older woman for field work, my fiance is not happy that I am working with as woman, but has no say and I ignore her.
August/2014- internship complete, I have lost 60 pounds, I am more confident than ever, more social than ever due to being forced to communicate for work. For my birthday I request she makes me a belt, she gladly accepts but I have to pay for the materials because she is giving her labor, I accept. She informs me that it will be done by November, so I can wear it during my research presentation, while not a big deal it does hurt to not get a present from the one you love, especially after spending countless hours finding their present, and spending three weeks of pay($210... yes 70 per week at the time). As I type this now on June 21st, over 10 months later, I have not got my birthday present, I am salty.


The first week of my senior year, I talk to the first person I've ever talked to at the school which I had already attended for 2 years, Serena is her name and she is in everyone of my classes. Serena is following the typical marriage path of waiting until marriage for sex with her long term/ long distance fiance. My fiance gets jealous that I am talking to another, demands I stop because I might cheat on her. I dont stop talking to Serena, instead I give my phone to my fiance to allow her to read all of my messages daily. She begins to trust Serena and my chain is loosened. Fast forward to the end of the semester... Serena, Matt (only important because of being a male, otherwise there woukd have been more female drama), and I have written a grant to perform field research as a group. The three of us are spending roughly 16 hours a day in constant communication due to insane deadlines and studying for finals. My fiance gets jealous and starts requesting me to spend more time with her... I refuse because I am attempting to get straight A's, because I had an amazing oppertunity at Kansas State for grad school, if my senior grades were good, again she repeatedly tells me that she cannot wait any longer for kids, which I understand, she had urges and need but I had made it known that I do not want kids until I can support a family, argument ensues, we agree to have after baby after two years in a PhD program, luckily I do not get accepted


February/2015 - My fiance I'd starting to have major health problems due to her weight (5'5, 225lbs) I give her an ultimatum that she lose weight or we cannot be together because I need to know my wife will be able to have enough energy to help with chores, with kids, and at the end of the day not whine that she constantly tired, I know it is an asshole move but I handled it as carefully as possible offer to be her workout buddy AND offer to teach her how to cook healthy, on my dime. I am informed that she loved me while I was fat, so I must love her while she is fat... I agree to this but inform her that I was not having health problems while I was fat. I get threatened with her leaving me, and God damn I didn't accept... she informs me that no one will ever tell her what/when/ how much she can eat... but she will start a diet. This diet consists of sweat tea for every drink, and then maybe skipping a large bag of popcorn every night.


At school, I make friends with five more females, they are all very physically attractive but I am a committed man and I would never cheat nor try to cheat. I become very close with one of these ladies, we both have dark senses of humor, humor in which I haven't been able to use due to my fiance not liking it. Me and this girl joke constantly, making fun of each others ineptitude, calling each other whores, generally trying to be assholes each other but there is no chemistry. At this point in time I am very confident in myself as I have lost 90lbs, gained a large amount of muscle, and started to be able to concentrate. My GPA is resting comfortably at a 3.88 for my senior year and I have friends!


May/June/2015- No weight has been lost from fiance, she is talking about marriage still, and doesn't acknowledge our ultimatum. I start pushing towards my final cut from 180-165lbs. During this cut my fiance is getting more jealous, requesting I spend time with her and not work out as often. This would be easily accepted except spending time with her involves Teen mom 2 or Reba (tv shows). She has stopped helping with cleaning chores, which I don't mind because I am an expert cleaner and unemployed, however the problem is that she has lived with my parents and myself for SEVEN years, rent free. My parents kind of expect her to pull her weight... shocking I know. I pick up the slack late at night/ when parents are at work and give her the credit...


Physical/money abuse -

Physical abuse is rare, at least for what I can recall,  I've never been bruised or made to bleed. It tends to always come from her over reacting if s tickle her or poke her. I have been slapped, primarily in the arm, for poking her. She had attempted to slap me in the face but luckily I am quicker than her. I have been kicked for tickling her, and not as I was tickling when she was jerking around, afterwards. 

She also has anger problems, no one is sure why it started. Her anger and constant complaining has stopped me from playing video games as she now plays with me and the nerd rage is strong with her. I am unable to play games such as WoW because she refuses to let me have alone time to play and will ask me to do stuff, such as get her a water

October 2007 - my puppy dog love+ chance at sex costs me roughly 2400$ in dinners, dates, and dresses in a one month relarionship.... yes I had fucked up.

December 2007 / valentine's 2008 - requests a promise ring for Christmas.... and I fucking do it. Valentines day is earrings. I stop bowling in a league because of her insisting that she takes our 4th place on the team. She is verbally abusive calling me an asshole I try to assist her in improving,  I am told I don't care when I try to let her learn on her own.


July 2008 - I start a job at Wal-Mart with good hours and decent pay for being s full time student. Dates resume constantly, I am broke constantly with 700$ of credit card bills monthly that I can barely pay. She is now trying to find a brand new car, because I got one... her car is in perfect shape but is a 94.

November 2008 - requests we move into an apartment because my parents have a rule that she must be in school to live here for free, we can't find one. At this time she is making close to 24000 a year and spending all of her money on stuff, I assume fast food as she is gaining weight but never has new clothes or accessories. What money I do not spend on my paying my credit card, somehow ends up being used on her for makeup or fun.

June/2009 - admits she has a sending problem, denies it shortly after but does start saving money.
December/2009 - spends her $4000 on Christmas / stuff??? I end up paying for a majority of Christmas gifts
December 09 - May 2013- randomly buys 200$ shitty smart phones... her 94 civic has been neglected, as I knew nothing of car repair and she just wanted to abuse it to have reason to sell. She is adamant to sell the car instead of repairing... she sells the car, cashes part of her retirement($2000) and buys a 2012 ford Fiesta for that had 30000 miles on a one year old car.... over pays because she tells the dealership ""she needs a car today and loves fords!"" She drives the car for two months, but doesn't like the transmission. I tell her I am okay with her eating the costs of a trade in, because she is making 32k and had just been offered a large promotion.  My one condition that she buys something used, like an 05 camry or civic... she comes home with a brand new Chevy Cruze, with an ungodly interest rate(bad credit) plus she ate the cost of the Fiesta.  She was upside down $10,000.00 after the trade in and had a monthly payment of close to $400.00.


2014 - starts paying her over due bills off, at the minimum payment of a couple dollars a month.  She loses her cushy job but keeps the car.  Gets a job at Wal-Mart making ~16,000 a year.  She is now paying close to 50% of her income for the car, insurance, and gas. She is living rent free with free food.


2015- after the previous pregnancy scare, I'm afraid to have sex, she refuses to use Condoms or the pill, I do not trust her to use the pill. She is requesting that I spend time with her next week at her friends, whom she is house sitting for, for sexy times. I have already refused adamantly!

I am now being pressured for sex but as I have other goals, like grad school, and I am not ready for kids. As you might have guessed, I now notice these issues.

I have grown tired of her constant bullshit, this compounded by the hospital visit a week prior due to straining a back muscle, due to her weight, and me constantly having to baby sit her for the last week as she was unable to walk.


The question:
Am I being unreasonable? I assume I am not but I know I'm not perfect and I know I have caused a few issues myself.

To those of you who have read it all, I'm sorry my grammar is terrible. I am unable to sleep properly due to the stress of this decision and the stress of applying for jobs.  This was also typed on a phone.

What I wish to hear from you guys - opinions on how to end a toxic relationship when you feel badly due to them depending on you and loving someone for so long. She has no family, can't afford rent and food. I know this isn't my problem but I do have a heart, I don't need people to inform me to grow a pair of balls, trust me I've known for years of my inadequacies.


Tl;dr- OP has a soft spot for charity cases, needs advice other than grow a pair of balls. An 8 year relationship with perceived mental, physical, and monitory abuse.  OP is unsure if over thinkin or over analyzing. Advice needed on whole ordeal, specifically if I am justified in my ultimatum.  Also, how to go about ending in when she has no place to go and I am not leaving my parents house to get away from her."
3am69z,3,2015-06-21,Creating a for loop on a button click in Access Forms?,hobbitqueen,MSAccess,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSAccess/comments/3am69z/creating_a_for_loop_on_a_button_click_in_access/,"I have spent days trying to figure this out at work, so hopefully someone can help me...

I took a class the first semester of my masters on databases, and we used Access and Visual Studio to create databases and forms used to access those databases. Now I'm doing a summer internship and they want me to create a simple inventory system for their sample lab, which creates a lot of samples and often gives them away for promotional purposes. Awesome, pretty sure I can do that. Well they don't have visual studio on their computers so my professor from that database class suggested using the Access Forms which I am slowly learning how to do. They definitely make connecting to the database easy (something I always struggled with doing correctly in VS) and I have almost the whole system set up, except for one thing...

My form looks like 3 combo boxes, a button, a text box, and another 2 buttons. The three combo boxes allow you to select the specifications of the sample (size, type, and color) and the first button runs a query to let you know the current inventory:

    SELECT COUNT(itemID) 
    FROM tblItems 
    WHERE colorID=Forms!inventoryform!cboColor 
    AND typeID=Forms!inventoryform!cboType 
    AND sizeID=Forms!inventoryform!cbcoSize 
    AND dtRemoved is Null

I have a date entered and date removed to allow the user to run a query on how many items have been created this month/year in addition to seeing how many are currently on hand. This code works perfectly, except I would love to figure out in the future how to paste the result into a label or a text box instead of popping up with a new table, but that's not really my issue right now.

Then there is a text box and two buttons. The text box is for the user to input the number of items they have created or given away. Then there is an 'add' and 'remove' button. The add button runs a insert into query...

    INSERT INTO tblItems (colorID, typeID, sockID) 
    VALUES (Forms!inventoryform!cboColor, Forms!inventoryform!cboType, Forms!inventoryform!cboSize)

My database dtAdded column has the date autogenerated to current date (date()). This works great, I can add an item to the inventory from my form.

The remove button runs an update query...

    UPDATE tblItems 
    SET dtremoved=(date())
    WHERE itemID=(SELECT min(itemID) FROM tblItems 
    WHERE colorID=Forms!inventoryform!cboColor 
    AND typeID=Forms!inventoryform!cboType 
    AND sizeID=Forms!inventoryform!cbcoSize
    AND dtremoved is null)

This grabs the relevant item with the correct specifications with the lowest itemID and no removal date. If my code is slightly off, that's because I'm typing it from memory but I assure you that this also works. It updates one of the entries in the database to have a removal date, which removes it from my 'current inventory' count query. 

So. This is where I am, and everything is working. Now I need to get the form to run the add and subtract queries the same number of times for the value in the text box. I know if I was in VS, I would simply use a for loop, counting down from the number entered into the text box to zero, and re-running the insert into and update queries every time. But I can not figure out how to run a for loop in Access forms! I can access the little code section of addbutton.click, etc, but anything I type there does nothing. I think I might need a separate event, but I'm not sure the correct way to go about that.

Oh, and PS, my work runs Access 2003 because we're stuck in the stone ages, and I have to turn ""buffer overflow protection"" off in the antivirus software when I'm creating forms or else it crashes Access. I have to do this after any time my computer falls asleep. It's super fun. 

**TL/DR: Is there a way for me to run a for loop in Access Forms in order to repeat my insert into/update queries a number of times as specified by the form user in a text box?**"
3am90i,4,2015-06-21,I'm 19 and I've been smoking consistently for 2 and a half years and practically daily for about a year. Am I insidiously ruining my psyche?,ThePentaMahn,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3am90i/im_19_and_ive_been_smoking_consistently_for_2_and/,"Hi all. I am relatively busy and not in the mood to completely go all out on this post, so forgive me for the grammar and any ambiguity. I'm starting to get concerned with my weed habits. I first smoked when I was 15, but I didn't truly get into smoking until I was 17 (junior year of highschool). Until senior spring of high school, I smoked on average twice a week for practically every week. When senior spring hit, I started smoking 4-5 times a week. When summer hit and i got to college I then started smoking practically daily. The longest T break I've had in the last year is 10 days, and besides that I've had maybe five 3 or 4 day t breaks. Considering the last year, on average (so averaging out all the seasons, obviously my smoking patterns deviate between summer and school) i smoked throughout the day probably once or twice (so 4 or 5 times a day), then two or three days i smoked 2 or 3 times a day (so 5 pm till i fall asleep), and then the remaining days i would smoke once or twice (so at night). 

While writing that down, I obviously feel a little shitty about it. However, I am happy/ content where I am at in life. I have a 3.8 after my first year of college (I should have gotten a 3.9 or 4.0 however) and I have a lab internship in place that will last me for the next 4 years. This internship is in field i want to study and I'm very happy with where it will potentially take me. I have a great group of friends (like 10 or so friends that i would call ride or die) and I have a good social life. I've been in a long relationship and I've hooked up with a decent amount of girls in the last two years. I also am in shape and I have cared for my appearance through fashion and lifting. So I guess what I'm saying is that despite my weed use, I feel like I am in a good position in life and have not completely succumbed to the negative effects of weed use. 

I used the word completely because i obviously feel its effects. There definitely is a haze, there definitely is a loss of motivation, there definitely is addiction and fiending, and it definitely exacerbates pre-existing self-esteem and anxiety issues. Some of these issues are masked by my adderall script, which significantly helps me with motivation and escaping the haze. I got this script in December. I ""used"" adderall probably 2-3 times a week without a script during first semester of college and practically daily for the last semester. I am still using it daily despite it being summer. Furthermore, i used it 3 times a month during senior year, prior to stopping after college applications. I ""love"" adderall, but i dont know if I actually had ADHD (definitely do now due to weed use i think) or if its just masking the effects of my weed addiction. Also, not so much anymore, but there have definitely times of ""deep"" depression when on adderall (nothing suicidal but just a complete and utter lack of energy and emotion when i'm coming down). Furthermore, it hurts my eating habits, which isn't too bad, but I should be eating more considering that I'm lifting and my frame is still relatively skinny (5'7 140). I'm concerned now that i'm mutually addicted both adderall and weed. Coming down from adderall fucking sucks without weed, so whenever i take it I always want to smoke at least at the end of the night. Furthermore, I can't really be truly productive without taking adderall, so I'm stuck in this addictive cycle where I have to do both to function and feel right.

Anyway, enough about adderall. The addiction to weed sucks at times. When i have nothing to do, it's very hard to control myself and not vape or bong and just play a game of league or make a beat. I have money, so I always have weed and I also have a $350 bong and a $250 vape, so i'm getting very zooted very efficiently. I have realized that smoking during the day is bad (ruins any productivity, makes you tired, forces you to nap at absurd hours and ruins your sleep schedule) so these moments have become less rare, but they are definitely still there. I also just can't imagine myself being in a social circumstance where I don't smoke, besides with family or with a girl i'm on a date with. That is kind of bleak to me and I don't know if i like it. Smoking also exacerbates my anxiety and self-esteem issues. Last semester I had an anxiety attack in one of the dining commons because I was really high and I thought that 400 people were commenting and ridiculing me for how high i was. I also get very critical of my looks when I'm high and often times think I'm fucking alien or ugly as shit. Since then I've been seeing a therapist, and she told me that I've had preexisting anxiety issues and that they came out this year due to these attacks. She's helped me get my anxiety and self-esteem under control, but it still sucks that weed subliminally makes these two things worse. Lastly, I can't really underestimate the haze, but i really do not know how bad it is at this point. I have smoked daily so often that the haze is just a fact of life, and I do not know what feeling sober for an extended period of time even feels like, so i cant really compare it to anything else. 

Looking at this post, it seems obvious that i should just quit, but weed has transformed my life and has given me so much happiness. Prior to smoking, I had no stable group of friends, i had no social life, and i believe i was a less interesting, less ""cool"", and a more narrow minded person. Weed has played a part in so many happy moments, and has played a large role in why the last 3 years have been the best years of my life. Furthermore, I am still on a fruitful path and I still have the drive to succeed. I can't imagine quitting: I am so addicted to weed, every single one of my friends smokes practically daily, it is so ingrained into my social scene, the comedown from adderall, generally addictive personality, etc etc. I guess what I'm asking is do i have to? Will my IQ drop so significantly if i continue that I will be a shell of my former self? Will i lose all of my drive? Will i be an emotional wreck? How sustainable is what I'm doing? Thanks for any and all comments and advice. Sorry for the grammar, I'm not great at writing and i just woke up. "
3am9e6,1,2015-06-21,Have you ever wanted to play in a CS:GO league? TEST POST,[deleted],CompeteLeague,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/comments/3am9e6/have_you_ever_wanted_to_play_in_a_csgo_league/,"Hi, I’m Noble, the founder of [CompeteLeague](http://competeleague.com/) and we’ve been around the League of Legends scene for almost two years now, completing several tournaments and giving a professional experience to a wide variety of players. Today, I’m proud to announce that we are expanding to Counter Strike: Global Offensive officially. 

**tl;dr**

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted CS:GO league, we’re hosting 2 month leagues for Silver 1-Silver Elite Master and Gold Nova 1-Master Guardian 2 that are open to all. More info below. Launch date should be around Late Summer, leave your email at [competeleague.com](http://competeleague.com/#page5) to get more info when it’s available, and if you’re interested in helping out you can apply for a role on our staff here: [http://competeleague.com/#page6.](http://competeleague.com/#page6)


**About CompeteLeague** 

First and foremost, we promise not to use your computer to mine for bitcoins. CompeteLeague launched 2 years ago as a small venture for League of Legends competition. We had only 1 league featuring 8 teams. We had 4 casters and only about 10 people on staff. Needless to say, it was very hard to run, and quickly we learned to be more prepared and to plan out our structure. Following our first successful season we had a chance to broaden our staff and host 3 leagues at the same time, featuring a total of 24 teams. Our staff had grown to over 30 people for North American League of Legends. We tracked player’s stats, helped them on game day, and answered many, many questions. It required long hours of work, and it paid off. It was a very fun and successful season. Recently we’ve taken some time off to improve our service across the board and create a much improved environment for the players, we’re now expanding from only featuring League of Legends in North America to European LoL, NA LoL, and now NA CS:GO. 


**What We Need**

Our CS:GO expansion is just beginning so we need people who are willing to volunteer their time to help create an awesome competitive environment for lower bracket CS:GO players. We have needs for casters, admins, moderators, game day managers and more. If you’d like to help but you’re unsure about what you can do or would like to do, feel free to message me on here, ask in the comments, etc. Please note that all staff positions are not paid and completely volunteer based, if you would like to help please visit [http://competeleague.com/#page6.](http://competeleague.com/#page6) More information on the staff positions can be found below.


**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for CS:GO will be as follows:

Silver 1 - Silver Elite Master | Gold Nova 1 - Master Guardian 2 | TBA
-------------|----------------|----------
Thursdays | Fridays | TBA
5-10 PM Central | 5-10 PM Central | TBA

Leagues are being developed and are scheduled to start late this Summer.


**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for nine weeks, and will be streamed and casted. Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | CT | T | Map | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 |de_cache| Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 |de_cache| No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6| de_cache| No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |de_mirage |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 |de_mirage |No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 |de_mirage |No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 |de_dust2 |Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 |de_dust2| No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8| de_train| Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| de_train|No (1)


Our Open Leagues also run for 9 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in -1 point. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners happen over the space of 4 weeks. 


**Pricing**

Unfortunately, for Counter Strike, we will have to charge for our services due to the costs of dedicated servers and anti-cheat software that is exclusive to CS:GO. It’s against our business model and desires to charge our players, but due to the costs of operating in the CS amateur scene it’s necessary here. All the money from teams will be invested back into competeleague to cover those costs with any extra going towards prizing, upkeep of the site, and improvement of services.

Our first estimates have it at $37.50 per team to participate ($7.50 each for a team of 5, or less if spread out with substitutes), which covers a full season’s worth of playing, including playoffs (a total of 13 gameplay weeks from when you sign up). No matter when you join, the cost will cover the same amount of time for playing. Even if you join halfway through the season into the Open bracket, your team pays the fee and you’re ready to go. You’ll enjoy playing the rest of the season, and playoffs (if you qualify), and it will cover the first weeks of the next season, until the join point of the previous season. 


**Qualifying**

For teams signing up for the first season, there will be a qualifier tournament for each Premier League, the top 10 teams will move onto the Premier League, while all other teams will participate in the Open League. This tournament will not count towards the 13 weeks of gameplay paid for, and will just be to seed the Premier League teams for the first season. After this tournament all new sign up teams will be entered into the Open Leagues and have to qualify for Premier Leagues through promotion.


**Smurfing policy**

We have two years of experience with similarly formatted leagues for League of Legends and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly, to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be very effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion.



**Cheating policy**

Cheating has been a notorious problem for every league and tournament hosted in Counter Strike. We will be using the best anti cheats that we can find and every game in our premier leagues will be monitored by a CompeteLeague moderator. When games are reported for cheating in premier and open leagues they will be reviewed and judged by multiple moderators. In the event of a player cheating the player will be permanently banned from CompeteLeague competitions, and teammates will be banned for two seasons. There are a few exceptions to the two season rule, such as if the teammates of the cheater report him to CompeteLeague staff and we have enough evidence to make a ruling, they will NOT be punished, however all wins from the time the convicted cheater played on the team will be defaulted to losses regardless.


**Transparency policy**

Unfortunately, there are always conflicts with competitions of any sort, and there will almost certainly be cause to restrict services or ban players from our site. Every single punishment will be documented publically with reasoning and evidence. We will never ban a player without reason, and without giving information on the punishment. 


**Prizes**

Each tournament will be prized, and will include prizes such as Steam cash, rare skins, cases and keys. For CS:GO we don’t have the specifics about our prizes yet, but we will NOT have cash prizes, all of our prizes will be based around Steam or the game itself. 
 

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be doing a case opening giveaway. Throughout the stream, you’ll be able to enter the raffle (opening at random times during the games) and we will open a case, and whatever is opened is given to the winner of the raffle. Whether it is a Karambit Fade or a Glock Bunsen Burner. In addition we have plans to give away moderately priced skins to the MVPs of each week.


**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run the first season. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being Dominic ‘Sata’ Roemer who now casts for Riot in the Chinese LPL) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. You can apply [HERE](http://competeleague.com/#page6). The different positions we have for volunteers are:

- Admin

A position as administrative staff behind the scenes of leagues, organising casting schedules, managing team disputes, handling staff and ensuring broadcasts go smoothly, and more.

- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails casting at least 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so it’s likely that we’ll hold tryouts for casters depending on how many applications we receive. 

- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred, but past experience is helpful but not necessary, we have graphic work for many different levels of skill.

- Video Editor

A position producing video content for our social medias and our site. This is a creative position, and can range from highlight montages, to informational videos, to promotional videos, to any other content. Video editing software required, past experience/somewhat of a video portfolio preferred.

- Web Developer

A position helping expand and develop features for our website. We have a small dedicated team of developers working on our site, this position would entail becoming part of that group and helping share out the workload. Some experience/developing education preferred. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, or PHP required. Knowledge of AngularJS and/or NodeJS will stand you in very good stead. 

- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase. 

- Writer (currently not-listed)

CompeteLeague is also going to be expanding into hosting articles covering our leagues, eSports, and further topics. The article submission system that we’re looking to build and set up is still a while away from being completed however, so this position is not currently listed. However - Soon^tm.

**What Makes us Different?**

Experience. We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always try to reach out to orgs, offer to help (with advice and cross promotions, as far as I’m aware we’ve never shared casters?)and share casters, things of the such, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We’ve had a long time to prepare our site and our staff for this upcoming season. Hopefully you can be a part of either helping the site, or playing in one of our featured leagues!


**FAQ**

*What is the difference between the Open Leagues and the Premier Leagues?*

Well, our Premier Leagues are the more exclusive league of the two. Games from this league will be streamed and casted, and teams are set from the first week (barring removal from the league). The Open League, (any number of) teams can join at any point in the system (and be playing within a week), and the top teams will have a chance to move up to Premier the following season, depending on their rank and status in the league. If a Premier League team is removed for any reason, the top Open League team will be promoted and participate in the Premier League. 

*What if my team needs to reschedule?*

There will be a feature on the site, if you’re in a league you will be able to request a reschedule, however, the request must be 48 hours before the match is scheduled AND the other team MUST accept the reschedule request. Your team is responsible for showing up to the games on time, however we know that emergencies happen, and we advise including substitutes on your team’s roster. (we should have a discussion on how to handle rescheduling at the next manager meeting, just to figure out the best system for it.)

*What if I don’t have a team and I want to play?*

There will be a free agents feature on the site, where you will be able to sign up and include yourself. Teams will be able to see you and add you on steam from the site and send invites to their team. (also teams can meet there and team up to join)

*What happens if I rank up during the season?*

We have always celebrated improvement and will continue to do so. You may continue to compete in the league you are in, however, if you’re dropped from the active roster you CANNOT rejoin that specific league. You are encouraged and welcome to join the league that is fitting of your new rank.

*Can I play on more than one team?*

For one game? No. There are no exceptions to this rule, however if you would like you can participate in leagues for multiple games with CompeteLeague.

3am9xo,0,2015-06-21,Microsoft do not want feature suggestions and bug reports for their products?,[deleted],microsoft,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/comments/3am9xo/microsoft_do_not_want_feature_suggestions_and_bug/,"This is not the first time that I've spent far too much time trying to find the appropriate place to make a feature suggestion or bug report to Microsoft. Surely there should be a website for customers to do this? Its a blatant example of the disconnect between their developers and their users. How do they actually know what users want when there is no way to tell them.

My current issue is exporting some data from an excel spreadsheet. The application I'm exporting for expects string values to be surrounded by double quotes. Exporting as csv just gives the strings. So I added quotes to them manually, and now when it exports it replaces the quotes with three quotes. ""hello"" becomes """"""hello"""""". An alternative solution to this would be to export it as json, a pretty common data format these days, something an intern at microsoft could probably put together in an afternoon, but still excel does not support exporting this format.

So once again, I'm finding myself in a position where I have to look for a product that does what I want it to do. Or as a developer myself, a product that is open source that I can contribute the features I need to. While I'm at it, why is visual basic still the only macro language for office?

We both have a year left of school. 

She took a break from school in September 2014 to study abroad and then take an internship from January-August but will be going back after that. I am taking a summer internship close to my home. Our respective homes are a couple of towns over. 

At one point a couple of months ago, she started thinking she was a burden on me. I don't truly know why but I suspect it's because she doesn't have many friends in her area so she relies on me for someone to talk to. However I am not always available so I can't always talk. I do pick up and ask if I can talk to her when I'm done though. 

I love talking to her and we talk almost every night (Skype 0-2 times a week depending in the week. She's not a burden on me at all and no matter how many times I tell her she brings it up again within a few weeks. 

Yesterday though she said she was feeling really upset and didn't really want to talk for a few days. She didn't want to say why though. Later in the day she said she felt like a burden.

We didn't talk at all today but I sent her a couple of text messages. I don't want to bother her too much because she doesn't really want to talk.

She's flying over to me next weekend and I'm flying over to her for the July 4 weekend. After that we don't have anything planned until mid-august. We wanted to, but she's busy almost every weekend until then and she said it would be exhausting. 

My question is, how can I convince her that she's not a burden on me? Just saying it doesn't work and I'm really not sure what I can do from a plane ride away. 

TL;DR: Long Distance Gf is persistent in thinking she's a burden on me because I can't always drop what I'm doing to talk to her (I think that's why anyway). How do I show her she's not?"

FB msg a lot and texting too. During the winter semester at school, he finally landed his dream internship with one of the Big 4's (software development field). The internship is about **3 months** long. I'm on the East coast, he's on the West coast.

&amp;nbsp;

We had talked about how to cope and how to keep in touch and keep the flame going. I had a few breakdowns since and due to my past online relationship with a cheating guy, I have trust issues and I still do now. I find it very difficult to cope with when my bf is out and about town with his new friends (women and men) almost until midnight on the weekends. I know he is def not the kind of person to do cheating but I always end in doubt after pushing away those thoughts. 

&amp;nbsp;

We did try Skype 'dating' and Skype calls daily and some messaging, yet it doesn't seem to satisfy me. I had a small scuffle recently over Skype and talked about it. We only talked in the morning and decided to leave each other some alone time to recuperate from the upsetting talk / anger. He doesn't want it to become a responsibility to talk to me, he wants to enjoy talking to me but I can't help to feel that I'm a low priority on his list. 

He recently moved and because we talked about me visiting him after his official moving in to a studio, I was supposed to get his new address and figure something out together so I can visit. That didn't happen yet, he told me that he would link the proper address soon as possible and that was forgotten when he decided to go chat and hang out with people there. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want some **serious** advice, from those who have made it work. I want this to work and he does as well. I feel like I'm going insane, I guess being jobless at the moment and not having many friends doesn't help. 

**tl;dr**: Bf is away for 3 months, I feel low priority - wanting to visit but have no info as of his whereabouts and no plans yet. He says to link me the details soon and forgets when he hangs out with his new friends. TIPS NEEDED."

Here's my rather unusual situation...  

We are a training company and we have about 350 iMacs. Once or twice a weekall of them get wiped and set up fresh for a new class. Usually these are OS X classes, but occasionally we teach software that requires Windows.  

I am in charge of making new Windows images, and I want to know how to do it legally. We certainly can't afford 350 licenses, if only 6 or 8 of them will ever have Windows on them at any one time. And many weeks, none at all. I believe there's an enterprise program but I think its more money than we can spend. The MS Store told me to just buy 8 licenses, and activate/deactivate them when necessary. But problem 1 is, I don't trust my interns in distant offices to do this correctly and keep track of which codes are in use, and 2. MS couldn't actually tell me how to deactivate.  

So, Reddit braintrust, what's my best strategy here?  "

I'm currently graduating from High School and will start an internship in a tech company this summer. At first my plan was to at least get something done about my anxiety &amp; mood issues but yeah I somehow ended up with this. 

I've got the job and they wanted me to introduce myself so I wrote everything (I wrote crap) and sent it together with a photo of mine that doesn't look too good but was probably the best I had made of me. Somehow I feel a bit weird about the people there looking at this. Furthemore I'm really worried about the first day, I have terrible social anxiety and I'm pretty certain that the first day is going to kill me while the other days might but don't have to be equally stressful. I was at the company already once and was very shortly introduced to some there and yeah I was really awkward... When I left I was stuck with my ""I'll kill myself"" mantra which I don't mean literally but gives me short time relief from the stress.

Now I was wondering what I have to expect like in general? Is it usual to have a meeting in a smaller company to introduce someone or will I just be introduced to two, three people there and then somehow get to know the others? Is there any way I can prepare myself so I don't black out or something?

I know I should see a therapist/psychiatrist to get help with my mental health issues but I just really don't have the time for that right now -_-

3an5ja,5,2015-06-21,I'm [30/M] trying to deal with elderly parents and a grandparent.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3an5ja/im_30m_trying_to_deal_with_elderly_parents_and_a/,"
I don't know where else to ask this.  I read /r/askreddit 's rules, and it seems like it's for jokes and other silly things, so I hope this counts as relationship advice.


I'm about 30, the youngest in my family with two older sisters whom I never speak to.  One is a severe alcoholic that simply cannot be trusted or counted on for anything.  I mostly just pretend I don't know who she is.  The other is married with three children of her own,  I won't go into the details of her life, but needless to say, she is busy with her own things, and possibly in denial of our present situation.


Introduce the parents;  My mother (mid 60's) has dealt with a rare form of cancer, in fact several forms, for the majority of her adult life.  She has suffered from seizures making her afraid of leaving the house.  She will not leave the house for any reason other than absolute necessity (ER visits, and so on).  She has been this way for 20 years.  She has limited mobility, and to me is suffering from severe depression, anxiety, and so on.  My father is in his early 70's.  Around 40 he had a heart attack and several bypasses.  He's had several heart attacks since then, in addition to diabetes, neuropathy, and a yet unknown neurological condition that I would say is something akin to dementia.  It's like he has the mentality of a 6 year old, including the ""I know better"" attitude, attention seeking tendencies and all that comes with it.


I joined the military immediately after 9/11, mostly to escape I guess, but also to maybe escape poverty by earning a college degree since the military was essnetially the only way for me to pay for it.  After being discharged I worked for a short time but lost my job due to the economy at that time.  I thought it would be a great opportunity to attend graduate school.  I did the preparation and got into the school I wanted, but before starting my father had another severe heart attack, limiting his ability to function.  Mainly drive.  With my mother unable to leave the house, and my father's terrible health, I unwillingly decided to start a different program at a school near them.  Hey, I can save money on rent and whatnot, good idea right?  Wrong.


More recently my grandmother (my only living grandparent) became unable to live on her own.  She was living by herself for many years prior, which I don't think was a good idea at all.  She is worse than my mother.  She now has severe dementia, is afraid of new people, leaving the house, she has panic attacks, no bladder control, basically no rational thought aside from the occasional memory or funny story.  She requires 24 hours supervision.  For a few years I would visit her every other day, bringing groceries, handling anything she needs, and that sort of thing.  But since her dementia has worsened (it was like it happened over night..) Myself and my mother decided she needed to come stay with us much to my fathers resistance.


Now I just don't know what to do.  I really don't.  I am a student that barely earns enough money to eat.  I've put my graduate studies on hold for about 3 years now, only taking the occasional class because I am busy dealing with the elderly.  When my grandmother was moved in, I decided I need to seek a real job, but with a big gap in employment, my particular field, that has proven difficult.  I also feel like quitting now will mean I never return to finish my graduate degree.  I have been getting by with just the little bit of money that the government grants me while I am a student, and I have taken out a small student loan.


The past 6 months have been even more hectic, and I have not been able to take any classes at all, so I essentially have no money.  My mother, father, and grandmother are both legally disabled and on medicare.  Their home is payed for, so fortunately it's enough to get by on.  The cost of medical equipment and supplies, things like diapers and diabetic supplies, as well as food electricity and all of that consume their income.  I make 3-4 trips to the doctors each week, pick up all their medication, grocery shop, clean, do minor cooking, and anything else I can do which takes up almost all of my time.


I guess lately I have been depressed myself and didn't really think much about the sitaution.  I think my father will pass away any month now, he makes no effort to do what the doctors tell him, and gets angry when I basically force him to ""eat something healthy"" or ""take medicine"".  It's like he feels as though it's an attack against his masculinity or role as a parent when someone suggests or forces him to do something.  His last heart attack required surgery, afterwards the doctors suggested he go to an assited living facility for a few weeks so he could get physical therapy (he can't walk anymore), and whatever else he required.  But he simply refused, and instead came home.  He literally does nothing.  He just sits around in the same position all day, requesting my mother to shovel food directly into his mouth.  It's absolutely pathetic.  With this, his child-like attitude, I have just lost all respect for him.


My mother does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to my grandmother's daily requirements.  My mother has no business doing this with her legitimate disability, and honestly, I have come to realize that my grandmother has no business being here.  She needs more care than we can provide her, but a care facility is too expensive and she has just enough mental capacity left that she would be really upset over it anyway, and besides, I don't think my mother would ever send her to such a place.


I am left to manage these three people as best I can, without actually having any actual control.  But at the same time, I cannot leave.  If I leave what happens?  I've been kind of compliant with anything that anyone asks of me for the past few years.  Putting school and work on hold, and just dealing with this, and I want to just run away.  It didn't really occur to me until recently.  A girl I have been studying with asked me on a date and I wasn't sure how to react, I've been too busy to think about dating anyone.  But as much as I wanted to, I just couldn't go.  I can't afford it, and I wanted to tell her so bad, but I don't think anyone will understand.  She left for an internship in another state for a few months and we still talk every day.  I guess we both expect to date when she returns, but I am just afraid of that day coming.


I don't know why I'm really writing this now.  Looking up at the last several paragraphs, it just looks like a lot of whining, and I'm eating, I have a roof over my head, so I shouldn't be complaining to anyone.  But I just can't get over this terrible feeling.  All I have ever wanted to do was get an education and not be poor.  But I can't even do that now.  I've kept some money away to move away when I graduated, when it seemed like that was a possibility, but I've since spent it on living expenses.  I have a student loan payment due next week since I have no time to be in school, (time to stary paying), and while it's only a 1500 loan, I can't even make the 50 dollar payment that will be due now.  Yesterday I went to one of those places where laborers go to find work, waited in line at 4am until 2pm and there was no ""daily"" work.  I can home and my grandmother had pooped herself, didn't tell anyone and tried to handle it herself, making a huge mess.  My mom almost lost it because of all this, and was trying to handle the situation, and my dad, well, he just lays around criticizing other people, so that's what he was doing.  Needless to say that whole day was wasted.  I tried it again today, and earned 45 bucks but that + coming home to this is too much.  Fortunately I found someone looking for some programming help on reddit, and that will earn me a hundred bucks provided they actually pay me the second half when I am finished.


I just want to leave.  I just want to do whatever it takes and just move anywhere.  But I can't.   What can I do?  I don't know what my options are.  I can't get any sort of in home care, there is nobody I can turn to for help, I simply don't know what to do anymore.  I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this, I guess to just get it off my chest and hear what everyone else thinks.  Am I a terrible person for feeling this way?  I feel like I am pretty aweful, and that I should love my family (which I do), and do what it takes to take care of everyone, but this is ruining my life.

3anets,6,2015-06-21,Me [M/19] and my ex [F/19]. Where should I go from here?,clbgrdnr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3anets/me_m19_and_my_ex_f19_where_should_i_go_from_here/,"This past year has been the best time of my life; largely due to me getting a girlfriend. I started talking to this girl at highschool as a friend and slowly started developing feelings for her. She was with someone for over a year before me, but it was more so a friendship than an actual relationship. She went with this other guy to prom and it really hurt me, because I liked her so much and I knew she liked me at that time too. Long-story short: she dumped the guy and told me about it, then me and her seriously started talking. A week later and we were dating.

The problem with not being together until senior year summer was that I was going to a school 5 hours away in a big city, while she was staying home and going to community college. I was scared to be in a relationship and then leave to go to school, but me and her felt like we wanted to try to date until the end of the summer. 

Last summer was such a beautiful time for me. Her and I went to Florida with my family. We walked on the beach and I fell even more in love with her. Everything felt perfect and like it was going to last forever. We had sex for the first time in Florida. It was her first time and I am grateful that she shared something so special with me. I really wish she was my first, because she is my first true love. I've never felt this way about anyone before her. 

That entire summer we spent almost everyday together. Made love. Talked about how much we loved eachother. I always had made fun of the idea of a ""true love"", and I feel like I am a fool for not believing in it before her. Then August was in full swing and I was gearing up to go to college. We were supposed to break up then, because neither one of us wanted to hurt any more than we had to. We decided against breaking up though, because both of us felt like we had found our other half (I know we are young, but sometimes you feel like you know).

School was tough for me this past year. I tacked on 18 credit hours of nothing but high-level math and science (engineering discipline) both semesters. I was really starting to struggle at this time. My grades were going down slightly, I would do homework for 5 hours, and would have difficulty getting up to make my early class because I had been up to 2am doing homework. I was averaging 4-5 hours of sleep. The only thing that sometimes kept me going through the homework was that I rewarded myself after completing my homework by skyping her. It made me so happy.

My girlfriend wasn't really the social type though. Very much a homebody. She really didn't have anyone besides me and her mother, so the entire time I would be doing homework she would be worrying about what I was doing and waiting staring at the phone for text messages that would be scattered throughout the day. I felt so guilty, because she wasn't going to college and didn't get the college experience of being in a dorm with friends. Luckily, I was blessed with having access to a train in my city so I could come home to see her and my family. The train ride was 6-9 hours long sometimes, but I would take the journey alot so I could be with her. It costed $260 for a 10 pack, and financially I couldn't keep coming home after the first semester even though really tried to. 

I guess the distance must have changed something in her, because she was so happy when I would come back from school on the weekends. So when I finally came back it was just ""Oh... /u/clbgrdnr is back"". She said that she kind of lost the feelings of longing for me. During Finals week I couldn't really talk to her either, so she started talking to a coworker [M/19]. I guess because I wasn't giving her the attention she needed, but the finals were 35% of the grade for my classes and I was struggling in Calculus II and Physics. It was the difference between passing or failing. I don't think she understood what I was going through and how close I was to fucking up my classes, because I never really wanted her to worry so much about me. I wasn't putting her first, because I was so worried about school and knew I had to make good grades if I want to provide for the family I wanted to make with her.

I performed to the best of my abilities and got away with grades I couldn't have pulled off if I wouldn't have focused so hard. I was offered an internship too for $11 dollars an hour, but I turned that down because it costed too much to live in the city by myself and I really wanted to come home to be with her and see my family. This summer was supposed to be perfect. Everything was set up perfectly. We were to attend summer school together taking the same courses, and she got into my school! I was so excited that we were going to be together in the city, and I had plans for finding an apartment together close to school and finally living together. 

Her father then got cancer, and she was told that she'd no longer be able to attend the same school as me since it's so expensive. I was devestated more than her I think. Around this time I think she was just scared of me leaving her again. 

This is when stuff started really going to shit for me. She started to really talk to this coworker of hers alot and also became friends with a female coworker [F/20]. I knew something was wrong because we'd be kissing and she'd push me off of her to text this guy. I was so confused and knew something was wrong. I kept begging her to stop texting him so much, and to focus on me, but she just wouldn't do it. Around this time she started bugging me about giving her space and how she needed to hang out with these new friends of hers. Of course she can, but that doesn't mean I didn't  want to text her, or that I'm worried about this guy you say is just a friend. Maybe i was keeping too close of tabs, i dont know. I was so confused about what was happening. I can't explain how I had been acting, I was acting defensive. 

It was like this for two weeks until she started talking about how I don't make her happy anymore and that she just needs space from me. I read her phone and she told this guy that she liked him after he admitted he liked her. I didn't understand why. Was it something I did? Is it me? What's wrong with me? A week after that she and I took a ""break"". I still wanted to be with her though, because it just felt so strange. This was my soul mate. I love her more than I love myself. I went over to her house during the break to talk to her, she'd been hanging out with her new friends and swimming at this guy's pool. She had been alone with him. She told me that she still loved me and wanted to be with me still. The next day she hung out with this guy at his house. She told him that she had to stop talking to him, and how she needed to get back with me. She and him then kissed. She called it a kiss goodbye, but it didn't feel like a kiss between me and her. I was so upset when she told me this. A kiss was something between me and her. I didn't know what to feel. I never looked at other girls, I stayed faithful. I was so in love with my girlfriend that a woman could walk by and the thought that she was attractive never crossed my mind. She was so scared that I was cheating on her in chicago, and I did whatever I could to make it known that I wasn't doing anything like that. And she kissed this guy. We were on a break, but that didn't mean that we were broken up and I wanted her to see other guys. This was supposed to be for her to be by herself.

The next day though she apologized to me and said that she wanted to get back together. I was so hurt, but I know relationships are work. She said it was wrong. I forgave her and wanted to move on with our lives. We had make up sex, we kissed that night and it felt like it used to. Then the next day she was back to doubting our relationship. She later told me that she couldn't stop thinking of this guy the entire time, and how she didn't want to go back to being unhappy with me. I still don't know what I do to make her unhappy. She says that her friends and her job are what make her happy, and I don't really fit into that equation anymore. I just don't think she knows what she wants, and all I'm wishing for is that she wants to be with me. Two days after we had gotten back together she broke up with me again. At this point I have been betrayed by the only person I have ever truly loved and I have also lost her as my best friend and confidant. She went 180 on me and changed as a person. She still tells me she loves me and hopes to get back together in the future. I just don't know what to think. I don't know how to act. I'm making myself sick. I haven't eaten and I haven't told my family but I have been having chest pains, headaches, and I haven't been sleeping. I force myself to eat til I puke. I count sheep. I take sleeping pills to try to help me relax. 

I'm a logical person, but all my logic went out the window it seems. I know what I'm doing to myself is wrong. I need to work on myself, but how can I not be upset when she's talking to someone else? How do I let my first love leave me? 

I'm a proud person, but all my pride left with the thought that someone else is better than me. I think I'm intelligent, I treat her like gold, I've never purposefully hurt her, and I got a wonderful future lined up. I think I'm an awesome person, but Why is this guy better than me? What does he have that I don't have?

I'm acting like an idiot. I'm scared this guy is using her and I don't want her to fall in love with someone else. All in think about is her night and day. I'm crying for hours on end. I know it's wrong. I'm trying to fight this mind over matter, but my body feels like it's in flight or fight mode. I text her mom and friends asking if she's okay. I just am making myself out to be crazy to everyone else. I'm scared of being alone in a world without her. I wanted to marry this girl. She was the one I felt. I know we're young, but I feel like I know what I want. She fit perfectly into my life before this happened. I was and am willing to forgive her still. My thing was that you don't buy a new car if there is only one thing wrong with it. You can try to fix that one thing. If our relationship is done, it's done but I feel like there is still something unfinished here. It ended wrong. I think she feels sort of the same way.

I know what I want out of someone romantically. I want them to return the same amount of love that I give them. I put my entire being into this relationship, and for a time she did too. It was perfect. 

I want someone I can trust, I want someone who loves me and knows in their heart that I'm the only one for them. I think this is where the relationship would be a little sour for me if we got back together right now. She's too random with her feelings. she's unstable right now, and I'm the stable one. She doesn't know what she wants from life, she constantly changes her mind. I guess it's sort of like trying to build a house on the sand with her... but the beach is so beautiful to me. I know it's safer to have two stable people and build your house upon the rock, but I'm just scared and worried for her because I love her so much. I don't want her to go through life, and regret me. I don't want to regret her. I just want her to see what I see. I want to be her rock in tough times coming up with her dad and life. I want to be involved in her life.

I know she's not right for me right now. This hurts so fucking much to say, because of everything. 

So my questions reddit are: Where do I go from here? Should I try to set up dates with other girls? Should I be single for a while? Should I hold out hope that she changes her mind and wants to be with me? How should I stay busy? How do I get my mind off her? Should I be angry at her? If this is it, how do I get over her? How can you open your heart up to trust someone again? Do I avoid her? Do I try to be her friend? 

I have no clue what to do right now, but I know if this continues I'll have wasted a summer hoping for something that never comes and being upset. I know that ill end up in the hospital if I continue this. I just don't know what to do, because I've never had this happen before.

I'm sorry if this is written crapily, I jump around and lot in thoughts and I'm typing on my phone so formatting is bad and spelling errors. Please don't bad mouth her either in the comments, I don't want to see that. 

TL;DR Girlfriend broke up with me after a year. I'm heartbroken. Where do I go from here? 

Thanks reddit."
3anz5x,7,2015-06-21,Skullface identity Theory: What if Ocelot isn't The Boss' son?,TadeusPadron,metalgearsolid,https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/3anz5x/skullface_identity_theory_what_if_ocelot_isnt_the/,"Hi, greetings from Venezuela. Like the title says: What if Ocelot is not boss's son? 
We assume he is because of the short dialog with EVA and the statement of The Boss to BB in MGS3.  

EVA explains that Ocelot is the commander of the Ocelot Unit as a type of ""special treatment"" for the legacy of his parents, one of whom was a Legendary Hero during World War II. Snake proceeds to ask which one was the Legendary Hero and EVA responds that she doesn't know since Colonel Volgin never gave her all the details... but apparently during the war Ocelot's mother is shot in the gut and she gives birth to him as bullets are flying past her and her unit and when she was stitched up the scar formed into the shape of a snake.

The Boss' speech before her and Snake's final battle explains how on June 6th, 1944, D-Day her and the rest of the Cobra Unit were sent to destroy key enemy rocket installations and during the mission she was injured and gave birth right then and there and when she was stitched up the scar formed into the shape of a snake.
2+2 = Ocelot is boss's son. Right? Well, i have my doubts.

Let's check the dialog between EVA and BB after the battle with Ocelot.

*Snake: ""EVA, I wanted to ask you about Ocelot...""

EVA: ""Yeah, I know. He's pretty infatuated with you, isn't he?""

: ""That's not what I meant. Aren't the Ocelots an elite unit?""

EVA: ""Yeah.""

Snake: ""Then how'd he get to be their commander? He can't be any older than 18 or 19. I can't believe he's already a major...""

EVA: ""I heard from the Colonel that he's been given...special treatment.""

Snake: ""Special treatment?""

EVA: ""Yeah. He's the son of some legendary hero or something.""

Snake: ""No wonder he seems to have the right stuff... So who is this legendary hero, anyway?""

EVA: ""Beats me.""

Snake: ""...""

EVA: ""The Colonel never told me. All I heard was that his mother was supposedly
shot in the gut during battle and that he was born right there, bullets
whizzing past them.""

Snake: ""A pregnant women in the middle of a battle?""

EVA: ""That's what I heard. They say that when the stitched her up, the scar was shaped like a snake.""*

Ok, so Volgin said to EVA that the soviets were giving a special treatment to Ocelot because he is the son of a legendary hero. Also according to what EVA heard, Ocelot's mother was shot in the gut, so the birth came early, and when they stitched her up, the scar had the shape of a snake.
Perfect. (Or not?)

Now let's check again what Boss said to BB (sorry for repeating it)
The Boss explains how on June 6th, 1944, D-Day (DD sounds familiar:) ) her and the rest of the Cobra Unit were sent to destroy key enemy rocket installations and during the mission she was injured and gave birth right then and there and when she was stitched up the scar formed into the shape of a snake.

Of course, we also know that this kid, the son of the boss, was later kidnapped by the philosophers to control The Boss. (See also EVA's tapes from PW) not even The Boss knew where is son was. So let's assume that her son was somewhere safe where the philosophers could have a constant eye on the kid. 

As the title says, I'm trying to uncover the Skullface identity (At this point you should know where im going) so we need to remember the backstory of this big motherfucker. 

Skull Face lived in a village that secretly repaired weapons in a local fabric. Some ""spy"" leaked the info and that fabric was bombed by their enemies while Skullface, his family and friend were in. BOOM, FIRE, DEATH, and Skullface suffred the serious burns that hide his face. Afterwards, he became prisoner and blabla they tortured him blabla forced him to forget is language blabla new languages, etc. 


Now that I have stated the ground zero for my theory, I will (again) ask you the question: What if Ocelot isn't the Boss's son? 

The soviets thought that Ocelot was Boss' son and thats why they received and put him as the leader of a spetnaz special unit despite the fact of being so young. Maybe the confussion was provoked by the philosophers, while the real Boss' son was kept hidden in some place safe and isolated (SF village). After some folks bombed the fabric, the village is taken, and the son of The Boss kidnapped. The people that captured him also tortured him trying to get information. (About the fabric? (if they recognize the kid) About the philosophers?) As we know, at this date, after the death of the wisemen's comitte and the loss of the philosophers's legacy, the philosphers lost the control of the intern tension and teared the group and the world into three superpowers; America, Russia, and China. They don't have fun for each other. So, wich group took little Skullface? I would say the chinese (EVA worked for them, but its not related.) or the Soviets. Why? Keep reading. They put him in some small village, in a territory controled by them, and he grew there. Skullface mentions in his backstory that his people repaired the weapons so they could have a chance to win the war. The problem with this, is, wich war is SF talking about? There are not a lot of important wars after the end of WWII... ¿Vietnam, maybe? (Under east block influence)The vietnam war started in 1955. Boss' son would be 11 years old. He also, of course, got to be white, so he would stand out from the asian poblation. Now, at this point, we need to remember the past of Big Boss as green beret. Maybe the people who bombed the fabric, were USA. Maybe Skullface child meet with Big Boss then, when the green berets invaded the Village. As I say, Skullface would stand out from the asian poblation, even with the burned skin. There is no doubt that skullface suffred horrible tortures after the events, as we can hear in the GZ tapes. Maybe somehow the American Philosophers identified him as the kidnapped Boss' son, and took him away. After a while, the CIA trained him. He later would found out who is himself, who was his mother, and who is Big Boss: The man who killed his real mom. ""V has come to"" ""Vengance has come to""¿?. Maybe BB, at some point of TPP, will have the chance to explain everything to Skull Face. And Skull Face, feeling that Big Boss is like a kind of older brother, will ally with him with the objective of destroying cypher (founded with the philosophers legacy, one of the main causes of Bosses dead) and the remainings of the philosophers. (From Boss two phantoms were born?sorrow &amp; sf)

Of course, I know this is not the best theory you can find around, but I wanted to share it with the people around here. Cheers!"
3aogoz,2,2015-06-22,"Walked down the wrong relationship path, now I feel like I'm about to blow.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3aogoz/walked_down_the_wrong_relationship_path_now_i/,"I [M25] dated another guy [M30] for 1.5 years. He helped me get on my feet: we moved out together, he helped me get into grad school, he was helping me get my life in order. 

About halfway into the relationship we started to find that our personalities were clashing. I found him controlling and unpleasant, I'm sure he'd have some choice words about me too. We broke up, which I was OK with, but things took a turn for the worst when I just couldn't seem to get him out of my life. 

After we broke he started treating me like someone he had no respect for. He dragged his feet moving his belongings out of my place, he talked about having sex with new people in front of me, and bragged about how much better his life was now that he was single.  

If these were all tactics to make me feel jealous and low, they worked like a charm. I went crazy upon hearing these things. I became mad with jealousy, and I never felt lower in my life. I admit, I was young and had low-self esteem. It was a recipe for disaster. 

After seeing me breakdown, he happily went along to his new apartment and life, and I was left sobbing in the dust. The harshest fact was that I was now studying the same profession as him, and I ended up working at the same company as him later that year as an intern (luckily, we worked in different departments/buildings).

Altogether, I feel deeply embarrassed at how the whole situation unfolded. He was an asshole post-breakup, yes, but I am more upset at how I responded to his actions.  I wish I could have controlled my emotions and not make it worse, but I am also certain that I did not deserve to be treated how he was treating me. 

EDIT: Here a couple specific behaviours of his that made me lose my mind:

- he passively aggressively broke up with me over the course of two months. This took the shape of emotionally withdrawing from the relationship, not inviting me out to evenings with friends and lying to me about what he was doing. This is a slow cooked hell for anyone who experiences it. 
- he barely helped moving our stuff out of our apartment to my parents' place. I took care of nearly all of and paid for the rental van myself. 
- he took 1.5 months to move his stuff out of my parents place. I was trying to use all my patience to remain sympathetic and help him out while he looked for another place, but instead of moving his stuff out of my parents' place to a storage locker he took his sweet ass time looking for another apartment, but for some reason kept me on the hook. 
- he would come over every weekend and take ONE load of stuff from my parents' place to a friend's house. ONE load, not like, everything. And, every time I would make sure I helped him. 
- I finally lost my patience and told him to get everything out of the house. I did this in the nicest way possible: I said I would help him move everything out over the next couple days. He then proceeded to absolutely loose his shit and berate me over text, including saying he 'wanted to punch me in the face'. 
- He came over that night, took everything from the house, didn't thank me for anything, and left me absolutely bewildered at what just happened. In hind sight, this was a crazy tantrum on his part that really worked effectively: I was terrified of him again. He made me feel intensely insecure, scared and unsure of myself. 
- two weeks after that event, he contacted me to go for coffee. I was expecting an apology, but instead, he shrugged off that event like it wasn't a big deal and asked me to help him build a shelf in his new apartment. I was speechless and walked out. "

Well, I'm actually doing it. And here is how it's going so far...

Since posting the reply, I’ve been receiving emails from all over the world with people asking for help building the HACKberry for their own friends and family.

Realising I'm one guy with limited resources who can't possibly build a HACKberry for everyone, I've been in touch with (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)[https://www.ornl.gov/] (home to several of the world’s top supercomputers and the world’s largest 3D printer) to see if they can print HACKberry’s for as many of the amputees who have contacted me as possible, including (Rosa Moreno)[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/11/lost-hands-making-flatscreens-no-help] who lost both her arms in a manufacturing accident and was only awarded a $14,400 settlement and can't afford the prosthesis she needs to get back to work. It was an awesome Redditor named Michael who emailed me to put me in touch with Rosa.

Also, just to give you a bit more background, Oak Ridge 3D printed a (Shelby Cobra)[http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/videos/a25659/watch-the-government-3d-print-a-shelby-cobra-replica/] for the Detroit Auto Show in 2014, so the HACKberry should be a piece of cake. 

After a brief email exchange, my contact at the lab (who is a great guy and also a Redditor) has requested a Skype call with me tomorrow to discuss the project further. 

Oak Ridge has also recently launched a summer internship program, so the plan is to task a team of interns with performing structural tests on 3D printed HACKberry components in various exotic materials as a part of their education. This way we'll be able to check the performance of everything from aluminum to carbon fiber.

The plan is then to provide /u/DrSpaceMann's brother with a prosthesis built from the material that proves to be the most effective.

I have also been contacted by a wonderful hand surgeon from Melbourne, Australia who is acting as a medical consultant for the project.

Make wrote a little (article)[http://makezine.com/2015/06/16/open-source-prosthetic-hands-focus-function-personality/] which was cool too.

I will post again tomorrow to let everyone know how the meeting with Oak Ridge goes.

3apxgy,4,2015-06-22,"Not long distance, but we still talk daily/share feelings: Do I wait for him to come back?",climbevrymtn,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3apxgy/not_long_distance_but_we_still_talk_dailyshare/,"A few months ago, I (24F) started dating one of my coworkers (21M).  He was at my firm for a 4 month internship and we developed a friendship during long hours at the office, business trips, etc. Nothing romantic escalated until the week before he left, when we got a little tipsy at a going away party and told each other how we felt. 

We went out to dinner, hiking, etc. for that week before he left. Although it was technically only a week, remember that we'd been talking, eating lunch together daily, and traveling several times together for the prior 4 months. So I felt we knew each other as friends fairly well.

When his assignment ended, the company offered him a full time position, which he accepted. The catch is, he has 1 year of grad school to finish before he starts working. His school is 1,000 miles away, so he only comes back to my city twice a year or so to visit family.

When he left, we agreed we would both be open to new relationships (ie weren't going to go long distance etc). We're both conservative Christians and share the opinion that dating is for discerning marriage. Neither of us wanted to pursue a relationship that intentional over long distance.

The problem is we still text every day and talk/video chat every couple of weeks. It's obvious we still care about each other (he's told me straight up that he still has feelings for me, to the point where it's difficult to go out with other women). Neither of us have been with anyone else in the 3 months since he moved away. 

I really do want to give him a shot, but I can't truly be open to other relationships because I can't go out with other guys without thinking about him. So now I feel like even if I'm not long distance with him, I'm still ""waiting.""

Has anyone ever been in this situation? Is there benefit to cutting him off and picking it up when he comes back? Is there benefit to being in this ""limbo"" of waiting?

EDIT: I asked him last week if he wants to do an LDR and he said no, so it's clear he does not want to try long distance.

TL/DR: Do I wait for someone if we're not long distance but still talk daily and have feelings for each other?"

**My current job**
I'm in a job that can lead down many paths. One of those paths is a career that I've been training for since I was 15 - I studied it in high school and university. I have been in this job for three years now, starting off in the ""grunt"" position, and now I'm the lead of my team. I do not enjoy my job that much, but I have a lot of respect for the sector and that leads me to wanting to make us all better at our jobs. I have put time and effort into researching how to be better and I'm slowly getting there, however this can only be successful if the management and higher ups in the office actually pull their fingers out and help me. Unfortunately, they're either afraid of change or are so stuck in their ways that they think change will make their lives harder. I don't know what to do anymore. My team don't care because this job is seen as a stepping stone to other careers - they're right, that's what I'm trying to do, but the difference is I still actually care about the outcome of us doing our job.
I'm also underpaid. I've been hiring people to join my team because of people leaving (promotions, internships coming to an end), and I know full well that one of the new recruits will be earning more than me, despite me being the leader of the team.

**My career path**
As I stated above, I am trying to get a job in the career I have chosen. Unfortunately one of three things could be holding me back:
	1. I'm doing so badly at my current job that they're keeping me here until I get better at it (managing a team)
	2. I'm doing so well at my job that they're keeping me here
	3. I'm not good enough at what I really want to be doing, so I'm being kept here
What makes me say this is that since I've been in my ""management"" role, two people have been promoted to the career I want. One deserves it, I'll admit. The other has not proven to be better than me at all - I've done far more than him and to a good standard. (Don't get me wrong, I really like the guy.) So why them and not me? To me, it has to be one of the above statements.
I also keep getting told I'm going to have cool new things to work on that will help with the career I want, only to find they're given to other people to do, such as the two who got promoted instead of me, because they needed something to do.

**My ""talent""**
Apparently I'm a pretty good writer. I can write well enough to be complimented by someone who doesn't often give out compliments. I enjoy writing when I actually do it, but that's the hard part - actually doing it. I am so fed up at work that I'm finding myself with no motivation whatsoever when I get home. All I do is play games and avoid real life.

I suppose I'm looking for advice, but the one piece of advice I would like to avoid hearing is ""get another job"", as that's not a realistic prospect right now. Thanks in advance.

*TL;DR - People keep getting promoted before me and I'm losing motivation in work and my personal life.*"

Okay, so this is going to be a long one. I’ve been holding off on making a big wordy post until I’ve gotten to this point, so I’m going to be as verbose as I please. If all you want is progress pics [here is a face progression from 2007 to now (up and then back down again)](http://imgur.com/a/T85LC), [and a bit of body comparison, from around my heaviest to June 14](http://imgur.com/a/vawSG), and you can go on your merry way without having to scroll all the way down.

**Part I: What the hell happened?**

Well, an abusive childhood happened. A whole lot of trauma happened. But I guess what *really* happened was I lost control over my life, if I ever had it. My abusive mom had (has) a ton of food issues after being raised by her abusive parents (they ain’t lying when they call abuse a cycle, it completely is), but she kind of failed in passing them on to me. We were very, **very** poor for a long time, and there was a kind of feast/famine dynamic there. We would go hungry for a while, and then we’d get a little money, and it would be immediately blown on luxury. Part (not all) of that luxury would be food, and she would binge, enormously, and I would get dragged in, because she would accuse me of having an eating disorder and tell me that she’d take me to the mental hospital where they’d never let me out if I didn’t eat. When we were really poor, she’d try to buy away the guilt from physical/psychological/emotional abuse by bringing me home **boxes** of dollar store baked goods, because she knew I liked baked goods. I felt like I had to eat it then, because it came out of money that we genuinely did not have. 

There was little to no cooking in our household, ever, because cooking requires having the gas, the electricity, and the water on all at the same time (stove, fridge, dishes/need water for recipes respectively), and that didn’t really happen. When she was employed, she’d be too tired to cook anyways, which isn’t really her fault. I don’t know if I had non-potato vegetables more than once or twice a year, my whole childhood, because 1. They need to be refrigerated and 2. By the time we could afford them at all, I was already firmly a ‘picky eater’. I take the blame for that second one, even if it isn’t really my ‘fault’, because it’s not really anyone’s ‘fault’ and it was my choice to be a dick about food that wasn’t processed to hell, no matter my age.

So despite all this (and there was certainly more to it, but I don’t really want to dwell any longer than I have to for context), I stayed mostly at a ‘reasonable’ level of fat, maybe around 150-170 for a good long time. I was ‘chubby’, and still at that point where if I called myself fat people would correct me just to be polite, partially because we still had the ‘famine’ periods, partially because I was **very** active. I was on the basketball team, then volleyball, then swim team. I was actually a very competitive swimmer, the best on my team, the 2nd best in my whole school district (varsity, as a freshman), and on my way to states.. and then I misjudged a backstroke flipturn (looonnng story, but the flags were different from what I practiced/raced with in my district and nobody warned me for you swimmers out there) and fucked my left knee up GOOD. I finished that race still in 6th overall (against 50+), but I couldn’t get out of the pool or walk. My old coach from the YMCA had to carry me to the car. After that, I took a break from sports and just never went back. I had a lot of shit going on in my life, and I just… stopped going to school, almost entirely. I just barely passed high school and graduated (with honors and as an AP scholar with honors, because those are both based on test scores and not actual class grades), and I graduated at my all time high of 270, which I stayed at for the next 2 years. 


So where am I going with this? I **hated** myself. I didn’t have disordered eating per se (I didn’t, still don’t, and probably never will like eating large portions, I just had no concept of how high calorie the garbage I was putting in my body was or even how calories worked), but I hated my body, I was heavily suicidal, and I just felt weak, fat, and worthless.



**Part II: What the hell changed?**

I was the first of my generation in my family to graduate from high school. I hated myself so completely by senior year, that I didn’t even bother to apply to a single college. I had been conditioned my whole life to believe that college was meant for a whole different class of people than myself… small example: when I was double accelerated in math all through school, my grandmother told me that it would be a really good skill to be able to add numbers quickly (lol not what post middle school math is at all), and that maybe I should consider being a waitress, or a cashier. That’s one of the most sincere compliments she ever gave me. 

However, I always admired my older brother, even though we were never close, because he was a car mechanic (Making him the highest achiever of my 6 siblings). He had something he was good at and he did it, and most importantly, he had almost completely severed ties with our whole family. That was my **dream life**. So I applied to my local community college, which had a program for automotive repair. It was then that I realized that the automotive repair classes required several thousand dollars worth of equipment in total, bought by the students… and that dream died quickly. But I enrolled in other classes, because what else was I doing with my life exactly? Working a bunch of shitty, under the table jobs? Not exactly great prospects, they can’t even go on a resume. I wanted to be better than my siblings and my family. No drugs, no alcoholism, a good, *taxable* job. Really attainable goals. My thoroughly underwhelming (academically) inner city school had given up teaching me math at trigonometry. They taught no further math classes whatsoever, and I had taken trig as either a freshman or a sophomore (honestly can’t remember), so it had been a long time since I had seen math. But something possessed me to enroll in Calculus I, that first semester. I met a professor in that class who actually **believed** in me. He encouraged me to transfer to a 4 year college when I had the funds together to afford it, and I spent almost every day in his office, even in semesters when I didn’t have a class with him, talking about video games, and math, and *very* occasionally how shitty life is. 2 years later, I graduated with the first college degree I had ever seen… an associates in Mathematics. 

I transferred to a good 4 year university, out of town, where I now have 2 majors and 2 minors (yes, one of those majors is math), and I just finished my first year with a 4.0 GPA. I started living on my own, only supporting myself, nobody else. Not having to dread going home, not having to deal with anyone except for the people I chose to include in my personal life.

And that’s what changed. I lost 40 lbs, down to about 230, without dieting or even paying attention to my weight at all after moving away. It just came off, and suddenly my clothes didn’t really fit anymore, and I had a general inclination to keep the whole thing going, but didn’t know how, since I wasn’t about to join sports teams with how unfit I was. One day I found /r/fatlogic, then /r/loseit, downloaded MFP, and have logged every single day since then. My life is better now than I could even fantasize about as a kid. I get up every day and appreciate a hot shower, appreciate fresh food, APPRECIATE the enormous opportunity I have, spending 4 years of my life just being here and learning. I’m already so close to so many faculty members, I’m doing crazy awesome math research as an **undergrad**! I got an internship offer from the frickin’ CIA! People talk about me like I’m a big deal!!! It’s beautiful, and terrifying, and *surreal*.


**Part 3: Yeah, yeah, just get to the weight loss tips!**

Okay, so here’s what I can tell you, in descending order of importance.

1 Count calories. If you can’t count calories because it makes you too obsessive, I recommend pre-planning your meals. Spend a whole day making your lunches ahead of time, leave them in the fridge in little rubbermaids and nuke ‘em. Come up with a few breakfasts that are low calorie that you **enjoy**. I cannot stress the enjoy part enough. Have a general idea of what a reasonable dinner is. Calculate the calories out strictly on these things when you make them the first few times, but you don’t have to log. Make it so if you eat according to your plan, you’ll be in the right ballpark.
	
However, I do warn you that this will give you so much less freedom than counting does - because I count, I can have pizza when a friend orders one for us as a group. I can eat on campus and at restaurants if I have to. I can have unplanned snacks. If you’re doing the meal plan thing, do not allow yourself to snack if you don’t have that factored in. Everything counts.

2 Don’t get stuck in the binary of good food vs. bad food. Yeah, there are foods that are gonna make you feel a hell of a lot better in the long run than others. Don’t force it, though. When I first started, I was eating 1800 calories a day of.. spaghettios, buffalo chicken wraps, frozen meals, chocolate bars, etc. Not exactly nutritious, satiating food, but like I said I never had a huge appetite when left to my own devices, so it worked. Whatever you want to eat, if it doesn’t put you over goals, it’s FINE, especially at the beginning. 

Perhaps more importantly than that, you might surprise yourself with your tastes… when I used to hear friends talking about how they eat fruits/vegetables as a snack, or that they love apples, or cauliflower, or whatever, I assumed they were completely full of shit and that they just hated those things slightly less than other ‘health food’. Well.. now I’m one of those people, and you couldn’t get me in the same room with anything other than a potato less than a year ago. I started being curious about all this stuff I’d never had. I started off small… started cooking my own junk food. Then I maybe added some chopped onion (!! plant matter!!) to a recipe that called for it, and kind of dreaded that maybe I ruined all these expensive (to me, haha) ingredients with vegetables. But it tasted good! Got my standard buffalo chicken wrap on campus, and they accidentally put lettuce on it instead of no lettuce like I ordered. Was too polite/nervous to say anything other than ‘it’s fine’... but I wasn’t about to waste the money. Hey, it actually added some pretty nice texture to a pretty bland wrap! Fast forward a few months.. I honestly made some cauliflower in a little bit of butter the other day, put on some hot sauce, added feta cheese, and it was HEAVENLY. Not “ugh I hate this but moral superiority of eating vegetables” heavenly, genuinely as good or better tasting as whatever else I would have eaten. When I make stir fry, I now have way more vegetables than noodles or chicken in there by choice… because they taste good and bright and diverse. I find myself eating nearly ‘clean’ just by choice now that I mostly cook my own meals and eat what I want! So don’t force yourself. There are definitely things I still hate, but if I try things cooked in a way I’ll probably like, especially in soup or something similar, usually I actually really like them. It’ll come, so just count your calories and occasionally be brave. I guarantee that you’ll eventually start making some choices based on calorie ‘cost’ on your own and stumble your way towards what is generally considered health food without trying to. You don’t need to cut anything out as long as you treat your calorie limit as a hard limit, not as a suggestion (it should go unsaid that you should choose something reasonable! Don’t go right down to 1200/day just because a lot of people do!). Of course, this might not work if you have a food addiction/binge eating.. I understand there are some people who genuinely cannot handle a lot of the stuff that sets them off.
(Side note: as I have less and less bizarrely sweet/processed food, the better veggies taste to me, for some reason. I still hate almost all fruit.)


3 Exercise is really pretty cool, when you’re ready for it. When I was 270, I was very not ready. When I was 230, I was still not really ready. I don’t know if it had to do with the physical weight of my body or whatever else, but I wasn’t enjoying it. I distantly remembered how great I felt being ‘in shape’ (comparatively!) back when I did a ton of sports, but there was no way anyone was getting me near a pool, and running, bodyweight, kickboxing, everything just felt like fucking HELL. I would tough it out, get out my old ‘just one more’ mentality, do genuinely a decent amount of exercise.. but not feel good. I just felt tired, and defeated, and weak, even though I had just done a great job. So I stopped for a while.

Somewhere along the line, and I really do think it was ultimately weight related, I kind of had an exercise epiphany. My body suddenly wasn’t so fat that it was getting in its own way. I could run without my chest feeling tight, or my old knee injury throbbing. I still couldn’t go very far or very fast, but it was more like a hill to climb to get through it, and less like the Mt. Everest of willpower. I remembered what it was like to feel strong again, and I hopped right back into it. I run a ton now, I do bodyweight, I signed up for the weightlifting class on campus in the fall… I relish the soreness again, just like I used to. It feels like a reward to work out now, not some kind of tax I have to pay for being flabby. Not to say everyone should wait until they magically love exercise, but… exercise isn’t supposed to be hell. It’s supposed to be challenging, but achievable. You should feel good at the end. Maybe not nirvana good, but if you dread working out, switch up what you’re doing. You’ll lose weight either way at a calorie deficit. Don’t force yourself and give yourself something to rebel against and resent in your lifestyle.

4 Mirror time. This is gonna be a weird one, and honestly one I’ve never seen posted around before, but it’s something I started doing and I think it really helped me. I didn’t have a really good picture of what I looked like in my head. My weight ballooned up, and I still thought I was fat but reasonable, when I wasn’t. I would be shocked and discouraged by pictures, and the mirror, and clothes, and anything else that tried to touch that delusion. I started giving a lot of power to that stuff, even though I barely care about my looks at all. I just couldn’t accept how big I had gotten.

Somewhere around 220, I started spending time in my apartment just looking carefully at myself in the mirror, usually at night when everyone else was in bed and I could just chill out in my underwear and look. It started out uncomfortable, and I would try to suck in or pose in such a way that I looked less big. Doesn’t really work that way. But pretty quickly, I started to get kind of logical about it. I accepted the way I looked. Not accepted as in HAES body acceptance whatever, but I looked long enough at my (near) naked body that instead of attaching a ton of bullshit to it mentally, I just went ‘okay, this is what I look like’. I carefully inspected. I grabbed fat rolls, moved them around, let them drop back into place. I checked out old scars, watched my fingers wiggle, watched my own gestures and whatnot. I watched the way I look when I tuck my hair behind my ears, when I smile, when I shrug.  I didn’t learn to love my body per se, I more learned that my body isn’t something that is separate from me that I have to learn to love. It is me, and that’s what I look like right now. Even though I still was (and still am) fat, pictures, mirrors, clothing sizes, etc didn’t bother me anymore. They accurately depicted me, and if I don’t like what that depiction looks like, I just have to change a little bit at a time until I am what I want. Now when I do my nightly look in the mirror, it’s more like a maintenance check than some kind of self-therapy. I might notice the beginning of prominent collarbone, and feel happy, because I personally like the way collarbones look, and now I get to see them when I see myself. I might notice that my femurs are disproportionately long compared to my shins, and wonder absently if that’s something that anyone else notices. I might notice my stomach looking a little bloated, and play around feeling the difference between fat and bloat, not really caring about it, because I’m used to those little changes. It’s a completely neutral to positive experience no matter what I notice, because I don’t have this awkward self/body dissonance anymore. I’m not some beautiful soul trapped in a substandard body, I’m a pretty fucking cool carbon based organism with some pretty fucking cool processes going on in me, and my body *is me*.

So yeah, that’s about it. Sorry for the novel, but I hope someone gets something out of my experiences. Thank you /r/loseit, this is such a great community and I would not have made it without the faq and the awesome posts here.

3aq7vo,12,2015-06-22,"[Advice] LC with Nmom, she doesn't seem to get it.",kastacrona,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3aq7vo/advice_lc_with_nmom_she_doesnt_seem_to_get_it/,"I have been low contact with my mom for basically most of this year, up until recently its been pretty much a non-issue. Life just carried on like normal. Lately however, it seems like she might be testing the waters and I want to be ready and maybe get some ideas on what to say to her when it is time, or how to handle this with as little blow-back as possible. 

For some background, I was keeping distance already, but then there was the incident with my Gpas heart surgery(have posted this story a couple times), and later with her smear campaigning her friends to let me know ahead of time, ""So, if they are nice to you...THAT is the only reason why"". (The story she wanted to tell at grandpas surgery, she just forced it on me later at my little brothers football game when it was just the two of us). 

 Here is the short version of the present story : After weeks of NC I made arrangements to take my 13 year old sibling camping. Nmom let it happen, but was short and snotty to me on the phone about it, as though it would in some way be an inconvenience to her, and then tried to steer the convo into how poor she is and how sick of SG brothers shit she is, before making her parting jab of ""welcome to LIFE"" (as though I've experienced nothing of significance) when her guilting and complaining failed to get the response she wanted. Anyway, when I went to get my brother, she was nice to me, but instead picked on my brother in front of me. Nothing that couldnt be dismissed as ""just joking"", of course. The camping trip went great, we had a blast and I took him home when we were done. 

Fast forward a few more days, I get a call from my Uncle inviting me to a fathers day potluck. I told him i was working and he says ""Oh, well your mom was saying you were gonna be her ride out because her car is running shitty"". Interesting, I hadnt even talked to Nmom since taking brother camping. Her car only runs shitty to family events (never has a problem getting to work or to bars), like she wants to force me to go together so it looks like everything is cool between us to the family. She did this on Mothers day too, and Im almost certain she will try it for the reunion at the end of summer. Two days go by, she finally texts me, 

Nmom: Can (brother) and I ride with you again if you are going tomorrow? I also have some info and contact info for internship with (very relevant opportunity in my field) if your interested. :)

me: Im working tomorrow so I cant go

Nmom: Shit my car is over heating worse than ever and didnt want to risk it. 

I didnt reply after that, i thought sweetening the deal with relevant information she didnt just share was a nice touch. Basically, I dont want to have to keep having excuses as to why I cant take her(I did actually work, but I dont want her trying to control me and force me into doing things for her without the basic respect of *asking first* ). I did drive her on mothers day, but she cant just volunteer me to do things for her without even asking me or giving me notice. She made it out there on her own just fine. Going completely NC is not an option for me right now, but I am unsure how to explain my boundaries to her without starting what I've been avoiding. 

Also , for what it is worth, I have had that talk with her where you explain basic courtesy in asking and giving notice for what your are asking about. Back when she was calling me drunk to scream-explain how horrible her bf and friends were being and getting mad at me for not hopping up out of bed to go get her, or coming to my house unannounced at night to climb over my fence and in my window to crash on my couch because *she was mad at her ride and her other friends dont like it when she does that*. She still didnt stop until my boyfriend said something, and then moved in with me. She has absolutely no respect for me at all. Im pretty sure she only texted to ask because she talked to my uncle, who probably realized I was confused since I didnt know she decided I was her ride. 

I hope this makes sense. Its not a big dramatic deal yet, but I have ""that feeling""."
3aqezv,245,2015-06-22,"I (21M) am being harassed by my girlfriends (22F) gay uncle (37M) who is also my boss, what the hell do I do?",throwawaywtfcoworker,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3aqezv/i_21m_am_being_harassed_by_my_girlfriends_22f_gay/,"Alright I've been dating the gf for 3 years, and working at the company I've been at for 2 years. Her uncle worked in another department entirely in another town. He recently got transferred over as the head of accounting where I work. (Accounting) He's gay. I am not. I have zero issues with gay people, however I feel really uncomfortable with this guy because he constantly tries to flirt/send inappropriate messages on Whatsapp etc. He has my number due to work issues, there's about 17 people in this particular department.



I've told my girlfriend and she was really uncomfortable about it. Yet at the same time tried to just brush it off due to the fact she has an extremely massive amount of stuff work related plus her best friends upcoming wedding so she's a busy gal, I'm in the bachelor (group/party) too so that's cool.




Not ten minutes ago, I was in the washroom at work and her uncle was there, no biggie, I was busy wondering what to get for dinner, Mondays gf and I usually go grab dinner and just laze around her place or mine chatting etc etc


I was wearing a hoodie because work is basically in the artic circle, anyway boss asks me something about a cheque made out for some other company then proceeds to grab my dick through my work pants and rub it and says I've been waiting so long to do this, at this point I freak out like what the fuck, go back to my desk, sit and now here I am, freaking out internally and not trying to make a scene.


I should also add I haven't said anything to anyone but the gf due to uncles flirtations stopping for a few weeks till today.



What do I do, I love this job, I'm good with numbers and figures and enjoy working here but I'm feeling so fucking uncomfortable now.



EDIT:- Not a big update so I'll leave it here, leaving work now, 1:45pm to grab lunch going to a nearby police station and filing a report, I should be back at work by 3 where I'll talk to HR. Thanks for the advice everyone especially /u/kallisti_gold for pointing it out that it would be pragmatic to go to the police first. Will make an update later in the afternoon, maybe.  





**TL;DR Gfs gay uncle has flirted with me, I've been ignoring, he grabbed my dick while in the male bathroom at work, what do I do? I feel violated, literally**





Update reposted here:- 


Alright, I know this would be really hard to believe, I went to the station this afternoon. There were a few people around, I went to make my report etc, I had to speak to one of the officers in charge, now I'm a tall guy, a bit beefy and when I informed him of what happened at my place of work. He literally burst out laughing, now bare in mind the officers here are pretty much a bunch of rednecks and called over a partner and told him about what happened. Something along the lines of this guy got touched up by his fag boss etc it took every ounce of willpower not to punch this guy in the face. The report was made though.




After this I took the advice of a couple of pms and got in touch with a lawyer, it was late, there was some trouble, but I got in touch with one through a friend I had to call really last minute, we went into my work HR around 5 this evening, work closes up around half 6, HR and administration specifically, everyone else heads home at 4.30/5ish. I filed a complaint with HR along with friends lawyer buddy there, HR basically took my complaint but let me plus lawyer know that unless there was concrete proof of harassment nothing would likely happen, the lady there was somewhat sympathetic or maybe she was just tired and wanted to go home, I'm not sure. Lawyer knows boss whatsapp'd me a few times, but I deleted him from my contacts as well as on whatsapp so those are most likely lost. However he has told me if anything comes up to call him as soon as possible and has let me know that without concrete proof it's possible that nothing will come out of this.


So there it is everyone. That was basically my evening, I went home after grabbing a pizza, I had dinner with my gf just now where I told her about the situation and she was pissed about it, I managed to get her not to call her uncle and bitch him out. She's fuming though but fell asleep watching World War Z. Now I'm here.


EDIT:- Someone asked how I know a person who could put me in touch with a lawyer and I'm only 21. Working for the past two years I've met a good amount of people that I'm friendly enough with plus I study part time and know some people who are interns at law firms etc Not a whole lot, but enough



TL;DR filed a complaint at the police officer about my boss sexually harassing me, they laughed at me, got a lawyer, went into HR, was told without proof nothing might come out of this so don't hold my breath, had pizza with gf, told her about her uncle, she's pissed at him, my evening in a nutshell everyone"
3aqn94,1,2015-06-22,"I wound up as ""the other woman"" and lost my best friend.",[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/3aqn94/i_wound_up_as_the_other_woman_and_lost_my_best/,"[Remorse]: If you feel bad 

This is my first post and it might be a bit long to tell the story. I just want to get this off of my chest. This is a story about how I lost a best friend and hurt his family, all without clear intentions and through blurred lines. I want to begin with a quick description of myself. 

I’m 24/f and Type A, and people would describe me to be a generally good person. I feel very strong emotions, which allows me to relate to people, but can also send me into crippling anxiety and sadness. I have aspirations in the health field, and am working on my second degree to fulfill that. I have experienced family troubles since I was young, and have an overbearing father and a broken home. According to my father, my mother was promiscuous and that’s why our family has fallen apart. A few years ago, my brother cheated on his fiancée and began dating someone new. At the time, I was very black and white and voiced very open opinions about how disgusted I was about this arrangement. As you can already imagine, coming to terms with what I have done has been very difficult. 

About a year ago, I met 26/m Jacob through mutual coworkers. He was here in the city for just a summer internship, and lives across the country, where he goes to school. The first night we all went out for a drink, we both got really drunk and had a one night stand. The next morning, I found out that he was married. He wasn’t wearing a ring.

I remember feeling utterly disgusted (with myself, and him), as I went home in the morning. We came up with a cover story and didn’t tell any of our mutual friends. He made a mistake and we wanted to move past it. However, not bumping into each other would be hard, given our close social circle. But really, I didn’t think I would hear from him but within the week, he emailed me and asked me for a coffee to chat. I agreed. 

On that Saturday afternoon, we talked for three hours at a local Starbucks. We had similar aspirations, and he had agreed to help me with some school applications. He was a sensitive, quiet kind of guy. A nice guy. Everything from the night before was a mistake. He admitted that he was clinically depressed and was trying new things to “feel.” He was also a bit awkward maybe, probably doesn’t speak his mind a lot. Jacob was an orphan, and had a pretty interesting life story. We decided to be friends. 

Over time, I could feel Jacob developing feelings for me. I did not ever reciprocate though, I was curious. In late August, he left for home. We stayed in contact through text often (he was helping me with school applications) and in October, he confessed his feelings to me. Immediately, I told him that we probably shouldn’t stay in contact/talk so often anymore. Now that he’s acknowledged his feelings, it would be inappropriate for us to develop it further. He disagreed. He had become quite attached to me (a symptom of his later diagnosis of borderline personality disorder) and I, unfortunately, succumbed.  

A few of my friends raised red flags about our friendship, and even I, logically knew that this wasn’t a good idea. I used the excuse that “he needed me,” which was mostly true, as he had become a friend who had suicidal tendencies and whom you would worry and ask about. In retrospect, I think I needed him just as much as he needed me. I was fighting my own demons and he helped me through my depression as well. 

Fast forward a few months of daily texting, chatting, and mild flirting, to February. I didn’t think very much of our friendship/relationship whatever, because he was physically so far away. I was not successful in my school applications or work at the time, so I was in a rough patch. He helped me through a lot of it. But Jacob had his own problems too. He had problems with his wife, and career direction, and we clicked well because we became somewhat like a pair of tired souls, who drifted together and searched for brief comfort in each other’s presence. Over time, he had become my best friend, and I was not afraid to be uninhibited in front of him. 

Somehow, in our damaged state of mind, we got our hands on molly and decided that we would try it when he came to visit. It was Easter weekend, and we spent entire days indoors lying on the ground, feeling the effects that liberated us from our real lives. Before he left that weekend, we had shared a kiss and some rubbing in the pants. Despite the m, we were both very conscious and knew what we were doing. I felt very ashamed of myself. We didn’t talk about it very much the next day. Our “relationship” continued on the way it was after he left. He remained a friend whom I always had in my pocket. 

Last weekend, he came to visit again. Once again, we spent an entire weekend indoors, high on m, trying to get a break from life. We were very close, in a mental and physical sense. We cuddled and lay together and he brushed my hair behind my ear and told me nice things. I want to say that we were genuine. Many instances and moments passed by where he showed an interest to have sex with me. I amused myself about it for a bit and we finally committed to it the next day. We had dirty, slamming sex. 

I know that so far this may all sound very typical. I somehow became “the other woman” without really deciding to. For me, this was beyond romance. Jacob and I connected on a level that was beyond what I shared with my other friends. I was not in it for the hand holding, or the cuddling, or the touching. When we were together (and with help from the effects of m), we existed as one. In companionship and friends, I always seek people who could understand me on a deeper level. Jacob possessed this, almost, sad sensitivity that only somebody who had gone through enough trouble and family struggles would have. 

We had breakfast the next day and he left for his plane home. At the time I realized that… I was not sorry for what I’ve done. Maybe I was still coming down, maybe I was still in my afterglow… I just didn’t feel sorry.  I told him that. But this changed over the next week. 
On one of his connecting flights, he got a call from his brother in law. His wife had found our recent gmail conversation about the m. She was 100% against it, and was very upset. He became very anxious. He said he’ll message me sometime later. 

For a whole week, I suffered the side effects of a rolling three consecutive times. I self loathed, broke down in crippling guilt, and was anxious for everytime my phone buzzed. I chronicled most of this in my blog.  I tried to write down as much as I could remember from the weekend. On one of the days I wrote him a long apology, because I felt that he was deserving of a much better friend than I. 

Finally, he texted me 7 days later asking if I had a few minutes to talk. He then began to paste a pre-written letter to me, which basically said that he had told his wife everything because what we were doing was wrong and that it had hurt his family. Now, he needed to focus inwards and try to fix his own psych problems, and we need to go on our own journeys separately. There was a paragraph in there about making our own choices, and then one about despite it all he thought that I was a good person and that one day I will find somebody who loves me. And that I’ll achieve something great in my future. It had a tone of finality to it, a “good luck and good bye” sort of thing. And as you can guess, he had then blocked me off of every social media outlet. 

I was so pissed off that I answered him in a babble of ungraceful curse words and emotions… though I knew I had no privilege to be ungraceful. I was the other woman, afterall. It took me awhile to think through it. I was very upset because after all that we had shared, he came to “end things” with me abruptly and I did not think I deserved the lecture on “making choices.” In fact, I felt that if he had only asked me, perhaps, for what I thought we should do next, I would’ve wound up at the same conclusion. Instead, he wrote me a long letter about how he had to do what was “right” for him.  Silly Jacob, don’t you know that all I ever wanted for you was what was right? I just wish he gave me the chance, before painting me as the bad guy, the whore who was too stupid to know she wasn’t wanted and is now in the way of his true affairs.

Most of all, I’m hurt because I’ve now lost a friend. Someone I wholly connected with. Such that sex or romance wasn’t even a part of it. We shared our spirits, troubles, and souls, everything that was beyond what a kiss and some sex could’ve given me. 

I also know that I am not deserving of a platform to voice how “hurt” I am when our irresponsible actions had permanently scarred someone else. How could I have my safety at the cost of someone else’s? I did not have the foresight to think about the impact that our actions would have on the rest of his family and friends. I misled myself to think that this whole affair was OK because he seemed to think it was. If I were her, I would be utterly destroyed. I would hate me, him, and the other woman. For what my actions had done to her, I am forever remorseful. 

It’s all over now. I miss him a lot. How do  I get over this sadness, and fill this void?

3aqrps,1,2015-06-22,"Looking to buy a car and get a credit card, looking for advice!",ANewEnding,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3aqrps/looking_to_buy_a_car_and_get_a_credit_card/,"Hello wonderful people of PF!

I’ve been a long time lurker here and I’ve learned so much in such a short time from being in this sub. This is my first post here so please be gentle!

 

A few details about me: Currently a college student that will be entering my 3rd year in January. Have an internship that will end late November, paying $19/hr. Rent is $400/month. The only outstanding debt I have is federal student loans, which I don’t have to start paying until I graduate in two years – or three if I decide to pursue a masters (my school has a blended program where you can take graduate classes earlier and finish your masters in 5 years). I currently have $4K in savings.

 

So I have a few questions for you all! First, I am looking at buying a used car. I’ve gotten pre-approved for a $6K loan at 5.2% interest, and my parents have agreed to help me with $5K. I’m currently borrowing their van for work (it has terrible gas mileage), and I would like to get a smaller car that has much better gas mileage (any car could beat it by 2x or 3x really…). I’m thinking of purchasing a car around $10K. Is this a financially sound decision? Also, would it be better to spend a little more for a newer car (I’m thinking $15K for a 2013-2014 model car) so I don’t have to worry about maintenance issues as much? Insurance will be split half and half between me and my parents. I intend to do this before mid-July.

 

Secondly, I’m also considering getting a credit card. I’m very responsible financially, I don’t spend very much at all aside from necessities, and I know to pay my balances in full. I’m currently using a debit card to purchase everything (yes I know this is a terrible idea, hence I’m trying to change). However, I don’t know if this is a good idea given I’m currently trying to finance a car. Would this be advisable? From financing the car I know my credit score is just below 700 if that helps (which was a surprise to me because I haven’t had any credit). What card could/should I get?

 
Third, should I pursue my masters? I'm working towards a degree in computer science and was wondering if the masters is worth the extra year and debt to get. Benefits would be not having to pay off the loan an extra year and the degree itself, cons are that it's one less year working and whether or not it will be worth it.


Thanks PF for all your help! I’ll be editing my post / answering in the comments if I’m missing anything!"
3aquls,3,2015-06-22,Salary Help,KittenQueefs,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/3aquls/salary_help/,"Hey guys,

I suck at salaries and definitely low-balled myself at the last job I accepted. I wondered if you guys could give some advice.

I have a BS in Graphic Design. 1 year internship experience.

Located near Cleveland, OH. So relatively low cost of living.

2 year professional graphic design (print) experience. I left that company making $35k/yr.

1 year professional email design/coding experience. I am currently making $38,500 a year. The original mention for this job was $45k a year. I was an idiot and desperate to get out of the other job, so I accepted $38,500. I was also afraid to sell myself higher due to not having a lot of web experience. Now I could code emails in my sleep.

I have an interview Wednesday for a web design job, mainly design oriented. I wondered what range I should go for? Currently due to bills, cost of living, debt, I can't even afford student loan payments, so it'd be nice to get my pay up and not struggle and defer so much. Any suggestions would be great.

So basically I have three years of professional experience, plus intern experience and 5 years of freelancing in spare time. Thanks in advance for your help! :)"
3ar1zi,8,2015-06-22,[Discussion] College Advice?,ash-left,CrohnsDisease,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/3ar1zi/discussion_college_advice/,"Hi, everyone! I'm so excited to have found a Crohn's community as I have been recently diagnosed (less than a year ago) and the majority of the online forums I've seen are ghost towns. Here's a little background on me:
The summer before my junior year of high school I started developing my first notable symptoms. From there things got worse, and for whatever reason I didn't tell my family. After I developed my first fistula I realized that something was seriously wrong and tried talking to my dad about it. I was so embarrassed that I didn't really know what to say and he shrugged it off. By the time I went to college my symptoms were pretty much my entire life. I could hardly eat, socialize, pay attention, you name it. I lost ~35 lbs, developed another fistula, and didn't know what to do. Some family came to visit, realized how sick I was, and my medical help started from there. I was soon officially diagnosed with Crohn's (which I expected) and things got a little worse before they got better. Anyway, I left campus to live with family, got on a bunch of meds, modified my diet, and recently had a procedure to aid my fistulas (which the doctors finally recognized for what they really were, thank goodness). Although it has been a stressful ordeal I am worlds better now. I'm even being taken off of one of my meds, my moon face has gone down, I'm exercising more, I'm sleeping less, I'm eating more, and I'm not so unhappy!

Next semester I will be going back to taking classes on campus (as opposed to the online classes I had last semester). I will have my own off-campus apartment, will be a tutor after completing an online internship, and want to get a part-time job. I am also considering getting a dog (to give companionship, to get me to exercise more, to give some structure to my life, and to protect me). I know this sounds like a lot when compiled in one paragraph, but I'll be easing into it. I would appreciate any advice :)"

I do not have a job other than being in the Army Reserves. I am living off of my savings and money I make from my drill pay.

My savings is sitting a 1300 now. So I don't have an emergency fund. I make about 233 a month from the military. I will be going on a 14 day training event that will pay a little over 1000. I am an intern for the football team her. It is a very valuable and respected internship and will be key in giving me experience for once I have graduated. 

I would like to get a summer job but its very hard to get a job because most employers don't want me to start and then leave for 14 days in July, and leave one weekend per month. School starts in August where I get paid from my GI bill each month. The GI bill pays me about 600 a month and my Army pay 233 a month allows me to pay bills. Not much spending money. Im either with the football team, in class or at home. Its not great I'm not going to lie. I would like to make enough money to at least save a little bit. I really would like to be a little more financially stable. But Im afraid it means giving up the internship. I really don't want to do that. I really believe this internship will help my career. Not sure what to do. My go bill pays 50% of my tuition. I am responsible for the other half. I am 10k in debt from my first semester. I plan on paying all my debt off as fast as possible, in my first year or two in my career. I have thought of taking out a private student loan. But I don't want to barry my self in debt. Not really sure how to go about my next move.

3ar3sa,1,2015-06-22,"[Campus network] Very regular ping spikes (every ~29 seconds), help needed to identify the problem",Linkinito,HomeNetworking,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/3ar3sa/campus_network_very_regular_ping_spikes_every_29/,"Hi /r/homenetworking,

I'm currently living in a campus residence for an internship in Paris. It provides its own network for internet connection. I post this problem here because I think /r/networking is more designed for professional use, and this is a problem I really want to know what it's all about.

So first of all, I'm connected via Ethernet with my own router, a D-Link DIR-600, which worked perfectly fine on another network. I use it to share my connection throughout multiple devices as there's only one Ethernet plug. My Ethernet cables are in perfect condition. As with many university networks, it is heavily censored with basically every non-necessary port blocked, and a lot of websites are blocked too. So like everyone who has to deal with that kind of restrained network and wants to do some other stuff like playing online, I use a VPN. 

The main problem is the residence network seems to be completely fucked up. When I was using my VPN, I could barely browse the internet. So I decided to go a bit further away and check all the pings to the first hop. And when my VPN is active, the ping simply goes haywire being most of the time over 2000ms, when the ping comes back. Because I have to deal with roughly 50% packet loss.

So without the VPN, I decided to check again and I realized something quite strange: my connection looks fine, but every 29 seconds or so (give or take 1 second), there is a spike that goes over 150 ms and slowly goes down to 2 ms. Then, at t+29, another ping spike, that slowly goes down, and rinse and repeat forever. It happens at every hour of the day, but it's much worse at peak hours (7-11 PM) with much more jitter. I basically have 15% packet loss, going up to 30% in peak hours.

I've tried to contact the ISP (RENATER - french provider for university networks), by giving them the ping plots to the first hop, and they basically told me to contact the network administrator of my residence (so basically ""fuck off we are not responsible it's not our fault""). But that's kinda surprising as it's the first hop when I do a traceroute. There might be a hidden router or two in the university to handle all the connections (because I'm definitely not alone in that residence - there's like 1,000 rooms), but I can't find them in any way possible.

When I do some connection tests on SpeedTest, it looks fine, ping &lt;10 ms and solid 10 Mb/s down &amp; up. But on PingPlotter, it just jumps every 29 seconds, and when I use a VPN, it simply goes all over the place. Therefore I can't browse websites online correctly, and don't tell about playing online due to the impossible lag.

I've read multiple posts trying to identify what this problem could be. I suspect it could be bufferbloat, but something's sure, it's definitely a problem due to the residence routers. The ping spikes can't be that regular if it was faulty cables or stuff. Those spikes happen way too regularly for it to be a random problem. It must be something with the main residence router that delays all the packets after a certain time, hence my bufferbloat theory.

Here's a [perfect example of the ping plot.](http://imgur.com/atFLSNC)

Btw my router (192.168.0.1) has always &lt;1 ms ping when I do ping plots, so it's definitely not my router. And when I plug in my PC directly to the Ethernet plug, I hae the same ping plots with spikes every 29 seconds or so.

Being a simple resident, I can't act on this directly, the only way for me to solve this problem would be to contact the network admin and tell him the problem in detail. That's why I ask you for help, to be sure about what the problem is so I could bring it to him, and possibly solve this problem not only for me but for everyone who uses the connection here.

**EDIT:** Apparently, my VPN falls under traffic shaping as I could understand from /u/squirrelpotpie (it uses port 443). However it's not a very-known VPN (it's called Unshade) and worked flawlessly on another residence in Grenoble which was also supplied by RENATER. However, it's not ""plug &amp; connect"", you have to get a login and password to access the network (usually provided by the university and/or the residence - depends of the networking system used).

Actually, we have a choice about our internet: either we use the university network for free, either we can use the telephonic line (there is one in every room) and get ADSL (that's the main thing in France). However, to get my own ADSL line, I'd need to spend a lot of money, and the rent fee is already huge for me. And basically, the residence's stance on this is ""if you want your own internet connection so you can do whatever you want with it, you have to pay for it fully, we won't pay any charge for you"".

Internet is cheap in France (€20/month) but reopening the line would cost me €70. However I only stay in this residence up to August 31, so paying €110 for 2 months would be kinda too much. Hence my try to find the existing problem in the university network which is clearly flawed even in low-traffic hours. If this can be fixed for me it can be for everyone. However, I'm aware that the available bandwidth is not unlimited and even with good networking, with 1,000 rooms using internet, it can't be easy to serve everyone.

Also  these 1,000 rooms will always be full because they are the cheapest you can find in the vicinity (as they are state-owned and usually they are prioritizing foreign students and students from low-income families). And they offer you a choice for the internet connection which is not always the case but won't spend a single cent if you make the choice of getting your own internet connection. It might be their telephone line, the cost is all up to you.

So based on what you've said to me, I'm gonna contact the network admin of the residence and tell him what the problems currently are. But chances are he's gonna tell me ""we can't do anything about it"" or ""it's always been like this"" or ""if you want your own internet you can"". I'll still try to be convincing."

Hi, I’m Noble, the founder of [CompeteLeague](http://competeleague.com/). We’ve been around the League of Legends scene for almost two years now, completing several tournaments and giving a professional experience to a wide variety of players. Today, I’m proud to announce that we are expanding to Counter Strike: Global Offensive.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm off to bed for tonight, I will answer all other questions when I wake up tomorrow! Thank you guys for the support!

&amp;nbsp;


**tl;dr**

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted CS:GO league, we’re hosting 2 month leagues for Silver 1-Silver Elite Master and Gold Nova 1-Master Guardian 2 that are open to all. More info below. Launch date should be around Late Summer, leave your email at [competeleague.com](http://competeleague.com/#page5) to get more info when it’s available, and if you’re interested in helping out you can apply for a role on our staff here: [http://competeleague.com/#page6.](http://competeleague.com/#page6). We are also considering a higher ranked tournament if there is enough demand for it!

&amp;nbsp;

**About CompeteLeague** 

First and foremost, we promise not to use your computer to mine for bitcoins. CompeteLeague launched 2 years ago as a small venture for League of Legends competition with the goal of bringing a competitive scene to gamers of every level. We had only 1 league featuring 8 teams. We had 4 casters and only about 10 people on staff. Needless to say, it was very hard to run, and quickly we learned to be more prepared and to plan out our structure. Following our first successful season we had a chance to broaden our staff and host 3 leagues at the same time, featuring a total of 24 teams. Our staff had grown to over 30 people for North American League of Legends. We tracked player’s stats, helped them on game day, and answered many, many questions. It required long hours of work, and it paid off. It was a very fun and successful season. Recently we’ve taken some time off to improve our service across the board and create a much improved environment for the players, we’re now expanding from only featuring League of Legends in North America to European LoL, NA LoL, and now NA CS:GO. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What We Need**

Our CS:GO expansion is just beginning so we need people who are willing to volunteer their time to help create an awesome competitive environment for lower bracket CS:GO players. We have needs for casters, admins, moderators, game day managers and more. If you’d like to help but you’re unsure about what you can do or would like to do, feel free to message me on here, ask in the comments, etc. Please note that all staff positions are not paid and completely volunteer, if you would like to help please visit [http://competeleague.com/#page6.](http://competeleague.com/#page6) More information on the staff positions can be found below.

&amp;nbsp;

**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for CS:GO will be as follows:

Silver 1 - Silver Elite Master | Gold Nova 1 - Master Guardian 2 | TBA
-------------|----------------|----------
Thursdays | Fridays | TBA
5-10 PM Central | 5-10 PM Central | TBA

Leagues are being developed and are scheduled to start late this Summer.

&amp;nbsp;

**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for nine weeks, and will be streamed and casted. Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | CT | T | Map | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 |de_cache| Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 |de_cache| No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6| de_cache| No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |de_mirage |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 |de_mirage |No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 |de_mirage |No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 |de_dust2 |Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 |de_dust2| No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8| de_train| Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| de_train|No (1)

Our Open Leagues also run for 9 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in -1 point. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners happen over the space of 4 weeks. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Pricing**

Unfortunately, for Counter Strike, we will have to charge for our services due to the costs of dedicated servers and anti-cheat software that is exclusive to CS:GO. It’s against our business model and desires to charge our players, but due to the costs of operating in the CS amateur scene it’s necessary here. All the money from teams will be invested back into competeleague to cover those costs with any extra going towards prizing, upkeep of the site, and improvement of services.

Our first estimates have it at $37.50 per team to participate ($7.50 each for a team of 5, or less if spread out with substitutes), which covers a full season’s worth of playing, including playoffs (a total of 13 gameplay weeks from when you sign up). No matter when you join, the cost will cover the same amount of time for playing. Even if you join halfway through the season into the Open bracket, your team pays the fee and you’re ready to go. You’ll enjoy playing the rest of the season, and playoffs (if you qualify), and it will cover the first weeks of the next season, until the join point of the previous season. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Qualifying**

For teams signing up for the first season, there will be a qualifier tournament for each Premier League, the top 10 teams will move onto the Premier League, while all other teams will participate in the Open League. This tournament will not count towards the 13 weeks of gameplay paid for, and will just be to seed the Premier League teams for the first season. After this tournament all new sign up teams will be entered into the Open Leagues and have to qualify for Premier Leagues through promotion.

&amp;nbsp;

**Smurfing**

We have two years of experience with similarly formatted leagues for League of Legends and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly, to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be very effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion.

&amp;nbsp;

**Cheating**

Cheating has been a notorious problem for every league and tournament hosted in Counter Strike. We will be using the best anti cheats that we can find and every game in our premier leagues will be monitored by a CompeteLeague moderator. When games are reported for cheating in premier and open leagues they will be reviewed and judged by multiple moderators. In the event of a player cheating the player will be permanently banned from CompeteLeague competitions, and teammates will be banned for two seasons. There are a few exceptions to the two season rule, such as if the teammates of the cheater report him to CompeteLeague staff and we have enough evidence to make a ruling, they will NOT be punished, however all wins from the time the convicted cheater played on the team will be defaulted to losses regardless.

&amp;nbsp;

**Transparency**

Unfortunately, there are always conflicts with competitions of any sort, and there will almost certainly be cause to restrict services or ban players from our site. Every single punishment will be documented publically with reasoning and evidence. We will never ban a player without reason, and without giving information on the punishment. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Prizes**

Each tournament will be prized, and will include prizes such as Steam cash, rare skins, cases and keys. For CS:GO we don’t have the specifics about our prizes yet, but we will NOT have cash prizes, all of our prizes will be based around Steam or the game itself. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be doing a case opening giveaway. Throughout the stream, you’ll be able to enter the raffle (opening at random times during the games) and we will open a case, and whatever is opened is given to the winner of the raffle. Whether it is a Karambit Fade or a Glock Bunsen Burner. In addition we have plans to give away moderately priced skins to the MVPs of each week.

&amp;nbsp;

**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run the first season. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being Dominic ‘Sata’ Roemer who now casts for Riot in the Chinese LPL) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. You can apply [HERE](http://competeleague.com/#page6). The different positions we have for volunteers are:

- Admin

A position as administrative staff behind the scenes of leagues, organizing casting schedules, managing team disputes, handling staff and ensuring broadcasts go smoothly, and more.

- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails casting at least 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so it’s likely that we’ll hold tryouts for casters depending on how many applications we receive. 

- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred, but past experience is helpful but not necessary, we have graphic work for many different levels of skill.

- Video Editor

A position producing video content for our social medias and our site. This is a creative position, and can range from highlight montages, to informational videos, to promotional videos, to any other content. Video editing software required, past experience/somewhat of a video portfolio preferred.

- Web Developer

A position helping expand and develop features for our website. We have a small dedicated team of developers working on our site, this position would entail becoming part of that group and helping share out the workload. Some experience/developing education preferred. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, or PHP required. Knowledge of AngularJS and/or NodeJS will stand you in very good stead. 

- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What Makes us Different?**

Experience. We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always reach out to orgs, offer to help with advice, cross promotions, and share casters, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We’ve had a long time to prepare our site and our staff for this upcoming season. Hopefully you can be a part of either helping the site, or playing in one of our leagues!

I took a job as an administrative assistant right out of college. I would help with front desk and AP. Our company was acquired by a larger company. 

There was no full-time staff accountant and there still isn't. This is a private corporation. So, I received on the job training for everything. They even had to teach me debits and credits. Now, I do bit of everything: AP, AR, costing, financial reporting, monthly closings, etc. They even gave me an intern this summer. I'm 26 now and I will complete my MSA in August and I am CPA eligible. 

Unfortunately, I now have all these student loans and need a larger pay increase. They don't really pay their employees what they are worth. My annual review is in January 2016, but our recruiting fair is this fall. Should I go through recruiting and begin salary negotiations if I get offers (fingers crossed)? Or should I leave anyway for the public experience?

So I'm feeling a bit down and hopeless.  I have been working tirelessly for almost a year now to try to make it in LA as a sound designer and post production audio editor.  

I have done 4 internships...A post house, a voiveover studio, a podcast host, and for UCLA.  I have worked for free on several indie films, podcasts, ect.

I have actually landed a couple paying jobs.  My biggest was for a major video game release for Xbox 1 and PS4.  I have been told that my work is good, so I don't think I am laking in creativity or skill.

My lease is coming up, and I'm not sure if I should continue paying the extremely high cost of living here in LA.

Everyday, all day, I browse craigslist, mandy, entertainmentcareers, elance, upwork, indeed, monster.... you name it!  I still continue to look for internships, although I am tired of being taken advantage of for free labor, and feel my previous internships and education are worth minimum wage, at least.

I even made a website to try to promote myself.  taymdep.wix.com/fixitinpost

I have great letters of recommendation, a ""no task too small"" attitude and a good ear.  What do I do to try to make a living in LA?

I would love to hear any advice, suggestions, or personal stories of those who have succeeded in this field!  How long did it take?  What steps did you take?

Thanks so much!"
3arhqe,7,2015-06-22,Me [27M] with my girlfriend [26F] of 6 months - I'm struggling with self-confidence and letting paranoia set in,ughanotherthrowaway3,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3arhqe/me_27m_with_my_girlfriend_26f_of_6_months_im/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months now, and let me just say that she is a wonderful person.  There’s so much that I like about her and I can feel myself falling for her.  The first five months of the relationship were amazing; however this this past month has been a difficult one for us.  There are multiple external factors that have applied pressure to our relationship – her busy work schedule, me working an internship in a different state for the summer, and several other stressors.  Essentially, everything caught up to us all at once, and she shut down emotionally and started pushing me away in order to get some space and recharge.  We have had two discussions about this in the past month.  What it boils down to is that she was so used to being single for so long that she is still trying to figure out having another person (me) in her life.  She said that she cares about me and wants me in her life, but she’s still figuring this whole relationship thing out.  All in all, things have not been the same, but I’m doing my best to remain patient and not pressure her – but it is hard at times.


This recent speed bump has left me feeling insecure and paranoid.  I generally am an extremely confident guy, but I’ve been having trouble finding that confidence as of late.  Her inability to commit to the simplest of plans in advance gets me anxiety – plans make her anxious haha.  I find myself constantly checking her Facebook page and her Instagram activity.  I misinterpret one word text message responses has her being angry with me and I selfishly get mad when she doesn’t respond to me for hours at time.  This is a terrible, terrible mindset to have, but it’s hard sometimes.  Maybe it’s the distance between us this summer?


The thing that increased my paranoia the most though was a recent discovery.  We were out on a date a week and a half ago and she opened up Snapchat later in the evening when we were grabbing drinks.  I noticed that she had a “snap streak” of 11 days with a guy that I had never heard of before.  It’s a silly thing to be upset about, I know, but with things being difficult for us over the last month, for me to see that it just reduced my confidence even more and increased my paranoia.  I should also mention that I was emotionally cheated on in the past and this is a constant fear of mine – people acting disloyal towards me.


My question to you reddit is what can I do to manage my stress/paranoia/confidence issues?  What should I do about seeing this “snap streak?”  I care so much about this woman and I don’t want to stress her out, but I have to look out for my feelings too.  I was so tempted to snoop through her phone that night I saw the Snapchat thing, but ultimately, I didn’t.  I’m afraid of bringing it up to her because I don’t want to sound like I’ve lost my confidence.  Am I being overly sensitive here?  Regardless, I hate feeling paranoid and I just want to find my confidence again.  I really care about her and the relationship and I want this to succeed, so I don’t want to bring anything up that would ruin what we have.


TL;DR – My self-confidence has decreased in the past month and my paranoia in the relationship has me emotionally exhausted.  I saw that my girlfriend had a “Snapchat streak” of 11 days with a guy I had not heard of before and it’s been stressing me out.  Unsure of how to proceed based on the difficult month we have just had."

I'll attempt to make this somewhat understandable.

There's this girl at my school, we'll call her J, who I like. We're both about to be juniors in the coming fall. I really like her, she's cute, is a very sweet person, and has a very fun vibe to her. I had a class with her second semester freshman year and we've texted/fb chatted each other a couple times since then, had some in person chats here and there in the hallways and quite a few snapchats between each other (well, mostly from me). Her snapchats to me were pretty 'exclusive', as in they did not appear in her story but she didn't send me snaps that did appear in her story. I was also on her top list last week but as of this morning I'm not on there anymore (there was the smirking emoji next to her name, but now it's gone). Our conversations through chat/text were pretty generic things, nothing much honestly... though I do feel like I should've at least asked her to hang out one weekend.

Here's where the issues arise: she's from the area where the school is and I'm from the opposite coast. I'm not going to be back in the area until late August because I'm working here, so there's no chance for me to see her until the start of school. I guess I could keep snapchatting her and maybe spin up a fb chat with her, but honestly I think it'll be just a dead end there without in-person interaction (also I really suck at IM'ing girls I like). I don't think Skype's an option here, I'm pretty awkward with phone conversations as it is and I think it'll be awkward for both of us with video attached to it. I'm also pretty potato with in-person conversations, but that depends on how sleepy I am (I sometimes can't even formulate proper sentences or thoughts when talking... it's shitty).

The second issue (or maybe a very great addition, I honestly really don't know...) is that she's now best friends with this other girl we'll call S. I'm pretty good friends with S and we've been chatting and snapchatting each other quite a bit and have been bf's on snapchat for a while now. The thing is, S and I had sex last year and we agreed to never bring it up with anyone and keep that between each other. Basically, when we talk to each other we know what happened but it doesn't affect our friendship much, plus she's now dating some other guy at our school. Anyways, a good chunk of her snapchats to me were when she was hanging out with J, which included pics and videos of places and selfies of them doing things. From what I can tell, J is mostly working in some office and then hangs out with her female friends afterwards, but mostly with S and her boyfriend at the moment. I'm sure they gossip about me when J and S are alone, though obviously I can't be too sure, and I don't know if S told J about our one time interaction.

Some extra info: a friend of mine tried helping me out/wingman'ing and asked her what kind of guys she liked racially (I'm white, she's Asian), and she said she preferred white guys. Of course this doesn't say much at all, but considering the majority of our school is South Asian, it could be a plus. And as I mentioned above, it doesn't seem like she hangs around guys unless it's some larger event hosted by the school or someone's birthday party, etc.

What should I do? What should I say when I decide to chat her up? There's no possibility of going out on a date with her until school starts up again and I don't want to lose out on by being slow and/or late. I really want to at least date her and I feel like she's someone who will be worth my time (and hopefully vice versa!). It's been a while since I've had a proper relationship with feelings attached (over three years now, wow), and since then it's either been some cuffing season BS or one night stands. I've really got feelings for her and I want to try to get us dating. In the meantime, I've got my friends here, hobbies, and an internship for the summer so it's not like I'm stressing too much over her that I'm not being productive with my time.

What do y'all suggest?"

Tossup between Dodge Charger and Mazda 6,Big-Bad-Woulfe,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/3arx7k/buying_a_car_for_my_son_tossup_between_dodge/,"He is currently driving my old restored 240z. But he just finished his PhD so I wanted to reward him by paying off some student debt and buying him a new car of his own.

I'm gave him a total budget and told him that he could decide how much went to loans, and how much goes to a car.

He decided between 30-35k for the car.

We've gone around test driving lots of stuff, and what he's really narrowed it down to is the Mazda 6 and the Dodge Charger.

It'll be a daily driver for him, not so sure on his daily commute since he's now hunting for a more career-relevant position that isn't a glorified internship.

He told me yesterday that he wants me to make the final decision because he just can't pick between the two. So I figured I'd try you guys out and see what your opinions are.

He's 26, has been driving since he was 16, and has driven everything from a Subaru Forester to my RC F. So I'm confident he can handle either vehicle.

-----------

He wants the most bang for his buck in terms of both performance and amenities/convenience options.

What I'd like to know from you all is what your personal opinions of each/either vehicle is, what experiences you've had with them, and, and some pros/cons for each. Also which options are worth buying at the dealer, and what we can get added in aftermarket for a better value/quality.

We know they aren't in the same class - so it's a lot of apples/oranges but he liked them both equally enough that he asked me to choose for him. He hasn't asked me to pick anything for him since he was probably 10 and it was between a Nintendo or a Playstation.

If you need more info please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to provide you with what I can.

Thank you.

-----------

Edit: After speaking with him some in regards to his options he's let me know that he went to test drive a Subaru BRZ today and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Not enough for it to be the definitive answer, but enough to add it to the running. As if I didn't already have a difficult decision in front of me."

3aseyl,9,2015-06-22,"Recently given the opportunity to learn and do some PowerShell at work at my internship, any advice to learn PS fast?",THINNINGnotBald,PowerShell,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/3aseyl/recently_given_the_opportunity_to_learn_and_do/,"Hey r/PowerShell! I need your advice.

I just discovered this sub and am super excited to find it. I am a non-traditional student with some experience in QA, but now given an opportunity to intern as a desktop support tier 2, with flexibility to switch to other projects as needed by business. Right now, I enjoy learning about PowerShell and there is a immediate need to do a small script at the workplace.

I am being given some guidance by another IT manager. He is super busy and I am mostly learning doing this on my own.

I am following small course on lynda.com (I have access through univ.) and then found some on MVA (Microsoft Virtual Academy) as well YouTube (forgot the name).

My issue is not about grasping the concepts, but it is about learning what is needed on the job fast enough to make a somewhat working script that will essentially pull a list of data, compare that with another list, and then report the unique values (similar to Conditional-Formatting in Excel - but we want PowerShell to do the heavy lifting and eliminate manual work).

ANY ways I can just get a kickstart into writing small scripts and testing them against dummy csv data?

Also, the eventual goal is to go into some servers through vCenter using its own PowerCLI commands using PowerShell, pull some lists of server names out, and compare that with the backup list available through other means (which I don't know yet, or will be provided) and then compare the two to see if they match. The idea is for the script to work independently, but be configurable through XML so that anyone can somehow tweak the script to their hearts' content through XML and not have to deal with the actual script in PowerShell.

I would really appreciate any feedback on this as I have super cool managers who are really open minded and flexible in letting me pursue this direction, while I started as Tier 2 Desktop support, picked up on the basics rather quickly and now wanting to do this because it gets me 1 step closer to programming, which is what my eventual goal will be after graduation.

Thank you for your time and advice!"

I've been unemployed a long time and unable to get my foot into the door, but am very competent with JavaScript, including the Node.js API. I'm also competent with PHP, SQL and Git- and though I develop with Windows, I do like to stay in Git Bash and multiplex it with ConEmu along with common Unix tool use.

And although it's hardly worth mentioning, I have some familiarity with C# .NET

As for frameworks, I'm fairly familiar with React/Flux and Angular on the browser side, while I'm familiar with Slim and Kohana on the PHP side. (As for server JS, I've only ever briefly used express in Node.js, but it's simple enough, and I've been thinking about using it when I try developing/porting to an Isomorphic application with MartyJs)

I want to work and make money- and it may take some time to be in a position to do so- but I *really* want to soak up knowledge from senior developers if possible.

I watch a lot of talks and hang out in the JavaScript related IRC channels (with thousands of users and lots of discussion across them), but nothing beats direct exposure to someone else's experience and skill set.

3asib9,2,2015-06-22,"Advice for job applications regarding ""work"" experiences",upupandbelow,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/3asib9/advice_for_job_applications_regarding_work/,"I'm a recent graduate out of school and have been looking for work in the field. It's recently struck me that when I apply to job postings, the application will ask for my employment history and I give it to them. 

The problem is, however, that I don't have any any actual work experience at the moment. My work experience is purely part-time work I had on the side while I was attending school. My school did teach us to include a section in our resume for ""technical project experience"" as we had many of these projects throughout the course of our undergraduate degree. I understand that these experiences are not the same as actual work experiences, but I feel like there's still some aspects of doing the projects that gave me some kind of experience in doing technical work.

With this in mind, I'm just wondering if there's any way I can let employers know this on my applications? I feel like when I only put down my part-time employment, it's kind of detrimental to my application just because they might not immediately see my full resume and may think that I don't have ANY type of experience at all.

Is this something I should be concerned about? Is there a better way I can display that I do have some sort of experience in working on a technical project for a client? I also know it might not help that I had no internships while I was in school but that's not a point I'd like to discuss at the moment.

Many thanks for any advice or comments you can send my way."

Like a lot of people on this thread who had an Nparent, and as a result later educated themselves extensively on the topic of emotional manipulation, I can recognize and detest psychological manipulation from a mile away. 

Enter my boss. This isn't just ""any"" job for me, either. This is my ""articling position"", which is the 10 month internship I have to complete in order to get called the bar, i.e become a lawyer in Ontario, Canada. To date I have sunk approximately 9 years of my life and $100,000+ into my education, and like many leaving an average law school with average grades, I had to fight like Hell to get that first job. 

But get a job I did, in a small family law firm in the same geographical area as my SO. I was elated. Doing piecemeal work from home quickly progressed into ""full time"" work, meaning all of a sudden I was being asked to come into the office 3 to 5 days a week. My Nboss appreciated my work, gave me endless positive feedback, and eventually back in April, offered me the coveted articling position. It was a verbal agreement the two of us came to while in my car coming back from the courthouse, so nobody else witnessed it. But he asked me to be his articling student, in no uncertain terms.

I went home and cried tears of joy to my SO. It felt like all my hard work, and outlay of tuition, and years of anxieties had paid off. My SO cried. It was a beautiful moment. Until it wasn't. 

Approx. ten days later, on a Sunday, I get a text from my boss. I knew something was wrong because he wanted me to call him and it was a Sunday. I also knew he'd been a total jerk to me over the previous Thursday/Friday for some vague reason I did not totally understand. So I called him. He said to me, ""I like having you come into the office to do contract (piecemeal) work, but I don't want you to get your hopes up that I can give you an articling position"". Then he tried to reframe our verbal offer and acceptance of an articling position (something the Law Society takes VERY seriously; there are strict rules re: offers of employment for articling students) as him just basically talking about maybe, perhaps, there's a possibility, if i'm a superdupergoodgirl he'll give me the articling position. I KNOW WHAT HE SAID TO ME AND HE OFFERED ME THE JOB. I KNOW WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND THE EXCHANGE WE HAD. But his response was basically ""at any rate, I haven't submitted the paperwork to the law society yet, so tough luck"". So what can I say, right? I've struggled so much and worked so hard to get my foot in the door ANYWHERE that I need to take any experience I could get, so I simply dried my tears, went back into work the following day, and continued to work my @$$ off, like whoa.

A month later, I'm back in his good books somehow, and he offers me the job again. This time I waste no time getting the papers signed and submitted to the law society ;))) So I am ""officially"" articling now, working towards becoming a lawyer for realz. Things are good for approx. 3 weeks. 

The way I was getting paid until 2 weeks ago was just sending him an invoice for my billable hours. In a typical 10hr--12hr work day, I bill maybe 6 to 10 hours. So for 50/hr to 60/hr work weeks I was making less than minimum wage. 

So last week my Nboss hands me a piece of paper that has a salaried wage outlined on it: $500/week, or $1,000/pay period. Not much, only a few $1,000/annually above minimum wage here in Ontario but whatever. It made me feel like my long hours and hard work meant something to him and that we were finally getting off to a good start. We had a brief conversation about the pay stub, he mentioned how it will be nice to not have to calculate the tax deduction because it would be the same every time he did my pay cheque now, he asked me if what he was paying me was ""enough"" compared to articling students in other firms (it was not, most make $45k annually, but I lied and said it was really generous), he said I'm doing a really good job and he would like to pay me more in the future but he'd have to see. 

Today, I came in after the weekend to a slew of emails sent at all odd hours of the day. I did this wrong, I did that wrong, he's deleting my billed entry for this work, for that work, drilling me on the most idiosyncratic details of my work. Half way through the day, he rings me up on the phone and barks at me for my invoice, I explain I did not think I required one because he had indicated I was on salary, and BACK PEDDLES. HE DOES THE SAME THING AGAIN, and this time he tells me that he ""can't believe I have the gall to tell him what he's paying me"". 

I confronted him again at the end of the day, handing him my invoice and stating simply that I was happy to work for billable hours, and I was really more here for the learning experience and to become the best lawyer I can be, but I did not back down from the position that he had offered me a salaried wage and redacted that offer. He had a reasoning for everything: he explained away the paystub, the conversations we had after he gave me the stub, everything. Talked himself in circles and even made the comment ""the more I look at it, the more I know I am right."" He would not stop arguing with me and engaging in this revisionist history even though I was not pressing him to pay me more, I accepted the fact that I was in a vulnerable position and will take what I could get pay-wise. I left the conversation by saying simply ""I am not interested in arguing with you about this any longer, as I said, I gave you my invoice and I accept that is my pay for the week"". 

I am sooooooo triggered by this behaviour. I want to jump out of my skin and claw my own face off. That kind of antsy, can't sleep, angry-but-helpless feeling I used to get all the time as a small child. Unfortunately, due to aforementioned reasons, quitting is not an option for me.

i initially applied to columbia because i was very, very unhappy with my situation at amherst. the town is incredibly rural (think 40k population comprised mostly of college students + basically one street downtown), and growing up in a city surrounded by cornfields and cows, i kind of wanted to broaden my horizons, cliched as that sounds. moreover, i was pretty displeased with the huge athletic presence on campus and i wasn't very happy with my circle of friends. second semester, however, went much better overall, and i found myself with some friends who are absolutely lovely. i'm not sure that the social impetus for transferring is still there, although the athletic presence/tiny town are still factors. however, nyc hasn't lost its allure--the thought of being in a place where i can see concerts/museums/what have you is very captivating. getting an internship in the city would also be pretty cool. and the thought of being around more people interested in art rather than athletics is also nice.

academically, i'm a little worried about transferring. although my gpa at amherst is okay, it's not the best, and i'm not sure if classes at columbia will be harder to get good grades in. i've also heard rumors that it's a pretty stressful environment/it's not as collaborative (although both of these concerns are very minor at best). all of my classes seem to be transferring at least, but i'm not sure what that means in terms of the core. the credit breakdown goes like this, if it matters: visual arts - 4, chemistry - 8, humanities - 4, math - 4, music - 8, anthropology - 4, psychology - 4. i'm not sure if there are core classes that most transfers get out of or if there are any i can attempt to get out of with my credits. basically, how many core classes would i have to take a semester vs. classes that i can pick? the thought of the core scares me a bit, especially since amherst's open curriculum means i can take literally any class i want to take. the core is also a bit problematic because i'm unsure as of now what i want to major in, so i'm not sure that i'll have a lot of room for experimentation. an additional part of the academic thing is the quintessential liberal arts college vs. research university debate--teachers here are very helpful/accessible and care a lot, whereas i remember once how one of my friends at columbia couldn't get help with a physics question because there were too many other people in the room. i'm not sure if the difference here is really big enough to mean anything though. moreover, if i decide to pursue neuroscience, the laboratories at columbia are definitely much, much better than amherst's. 

finally, i'm pretty worried about leaving my friends behind/making new friends at columbia, especially as an incoming sophomore. amherst is ~4 hours away from nyc, so i could visit my friends (and will do so if i transfer), but it's not going to be the same. i do have a couple friends at columbia, so i won't be going in completely friendless, but i'm also scared that i won't manage to carve out my own friend niche. idk i guess i'm hesitant for a repeat of my first semester of college where i was pretty miserable with my social prospects. this is probably the biggest thing holding me back from transferring, but i also feel like it's kind of a stupid reason? one of my friends actually told me the other day that if it was the only thing holding me here, that i should definitely go to columbia. like i'm sure i'll be able to make friends at columbia. AHHH i dunno i'm so indecisive. and my friends here are such great people.

ultimately, i guess the three most important factors for me are a) location (nyc  &gt; amherst), b) core curriculum vs. open curriculum (open &gt; core), and c) friends (eh.....). lately it's been boiling down to a nyc vs. friends here debate with the curriculum thing being tangential, so i guess i came largely to get some of my academics concerns cleared up. any advice about any of this would be greatly appreciated, however, especially from any columbia transfer students that came from small liberal arts colleges in the middle of nowhere."
3aszvd,1,2015-06-23,"I have to write this feeling down, if nothing else just to document it for future reference",BinghamL,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/3aszvd/i_have_to_write_this_feeling_down_if_nothing_else/,"I'm 25, male. Today was my first day of my first internship. Long story short, this material is super complex compared to anything I've learned in school. I'm in my last year for computer science, not that it's very relevant.

I barely slept the night before due to both nerves and a much earlier start than I'm used to. Figured it would all get better after the first day.

Well, it's now midnight here, and I have to wake up at 5. I'm wide awake, my heart is beating hard, and slightly fast. I'm exhausted, but when I lay and think of nothing to try to sleep I start to freak out about.. nothing. I can't pinpoint it. I even cried for an hour tonight. I'm a 25 year old, 6'8 man crying for no reason. It's ridiculous and I get so frustrated when this happens, which only perpetuates everything that's already negative about this situation.

This happens about every few weeks to a month, but this instance is the worst it's been yet. Every negative feeling I have in my life, relevant or not, is magnified and suddenly becomes an issue whether I can do anything about it or not. I feel like a massive pity party and it's embarrassing even for me to write this.

I'm a pretty fortunate person. Decently successful, nothing that makes me physically unattractive in general, good friends, family. Yet tonight, I'm missing my mother and dog terribly, haven't seen them in almost 2 years (lives in different state), I feel sorry for my dad because of the disease he's lived with his whole life and it's starting to catch up to him. The next time he goes to the hospital for it he's not likely to make it I feel completely overwhelmed with the next 9 weeks of my life in this internship, and I don't have enough money or time to change majors, so it's do or die. I even don't feel safe from myself with my gun in my room. I'm getting rid of it first thing tomorrow, and it's disabled for now. I'm not trying to hint at anything, I just don't want a gun around when I'm feeling this way. I don't want to make any decisions I can't reverse, and this situation seems to be getting more intense lately. I don't like the mixture of unpredictability and weapons.

I've tried many techniques to avoid this situation and to make falling asleep as easy as possible for myself. I exercise regularly, watch what I eat, I turn off all blue light 30 minutes before bed, and leave at least an hour to unwind at the end of the day. I've tried different temperatures in my room, too.

I'm making mountains out of mole hills. I know that when I calm down and read this I'm going to cringe so hard. When people reply to this I'm going to feel so awkward. I've always had a hard time accepting help or gifts, or generosity of any kind. This is really hard for me to talk about because when I'm finally able to take a step back it's like I'm just being a big baby about everything. But this time is so much worse than any before, I have to at least get it out there. Maybe someone knows a way to confront this that I don't. Or maybe the embarrassment of posting this will show the calm version of me how truly disruptive this is, and force me to find a solution instead of putting it off.

I'm just rambling on now because I'm nervous to hit submit. I don't know what the goal of my posting this is, but for some reason at this moment I feel like I need to do it. So, sorry if it's random and what not. You don't have to respond, I won't be offended and I'll still be able to read it later when I calm down.

3atoi6,2,2015-06-23,My [25 M] girlfriend [25 F] of 1.5 years nearly cheated on me. Help me process the feels?,thx_intrnt_strangers,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3atoi6/my_25_m_girlfriend_25_f_of_15_years_nearly/,"I didn't think I would need to rely on the kindness of you wonderful internet strangers at /r/relationships, but here I am. My girlfriend and I go to the same small-town medical school, and have been dating for 1.5 years. We are doing long-distance only for the summer - she stayed back near school and I moved 1,000 miles away to a major city to pursue an unbeatable research internship. I moved away three weeks ago. There has been some uncertainty in our relationship since I left town, which makes me feel partially to blame for what happens next. She's been asking me if our relationship is going to last forever, and I am very honest and tell her that we need to live together first and date for longer before we decide to be together forever (i.e. get married). She has a hard time dealing with my uncertainty.

Fast forward to this (June 20) Saturday night. My girlfriend tells me she's going downtown to go out and drink with a very close group of school friends who I trust immensely. Now, meet Guy #1 and Guy #2  - they are not in this close group of friends but rather acquaintances that we both know from school. We both say ""hi"" to, and are cordial with Guys #1 and #2 at school. She is taking the 1-hour train to downtown with Guy #1. Her and I have always trusted each other to hang out with friends of the opposite sex, with no issue thus far. 

Her and Guy #1 drink a lot on the train to downtown. Her and Guy #1 then meet up with my group of close friends and go to bars together. Guy #2 shows up to hang out with Guy #1. I know Guy #2 better than Guy #1. He recently reached out via Facebook to ask for school advice. My girlfriend starts getting flirty with Guy's #1 and #2 (in front of my group of close friends). Apparently she's dancing with one or both of them, sitting on lap (s) and holding hand(s). Guy #2 tries to kiss her at some point and she gives him her cheek. My close friends drive everyone home from downtown (Guys #1 and #2 included) and she falls asleep on Guy #1's shoulder, holding his hand.

She was very unreachable via phone Saturday night so I was extremely worried about her and barely slept. Sunday morning she calls me crying and admits to all of the above. She is extremely apologetic for disrespecting me and we discuss ending the relationship. Eventually we decide that we're good for each other, and this was just a temporary lapse of judgement - perhaps brought on by my uncertainty about our future. We decide to stay together and let this eventually strengthen our relationship. 

Now I have these feelings to deal with. Since Sunday morning I've had this knot in my stomach that won't go away. It feels like I've been stabbed in the stomach, and it just hurts so bad.  There's also this tinge of uncertainty about events of that night - I only got her side of the story and she was near blacked-out drunk. I want to ask my close friends about what they saw happening with Guy #1 and Guy #2, but this feels like a breach of trust with her, and I don't know if I really want to know what happened. How do I deal with the hurt and the uncertainty? The only thing I've found that helps is meditating, and going to the gym. It's especially difficult because I'm so far away. Do I ask my friends what they saw? How long will it take to heal? When I talk to her about the events of the weekend it hurts even worse, so I don't really know how she can help me sort out this pain. I told her I'm hurting because of what she did and I just need to heal on my own. 
   
**tl;dr: Girlfriend drunkenly flirts with acquaintances from school while I'm not around. We work through it together but now I'm left with all this hurt. How do I deal with the pain and uncertainty about what transpired?**



**Edit: Update. Found out she made out with the dude, multiple times. Broke up with her yesterday.**"

My project description is that I have a folder with about 150 files in it. The number of files in the folder can change. My vba program needs to open the first file in this folder and find the last line that has a specific phrase (let's say ""chicken"" is the word it's looking for. The last row it's mentioned in is not necessarily the last row in the text file nor is it in the same row number in all the files.  Once it finds the word it needs to take specific data from that line and put it in a new row in a new worksheet. Once it's done that it needs to close the file and move (not copy or save as) it to a separate folder. The code must then open the next file in the folder until this is done with all the files and the folder is empty.  My question is is this even possible? And if so does anyone have any help/tips/pointers for how to do it. I'm totally lost here. Thanks!"

3autjk,1,2015-06-23,The Plight of the Intern,[deleted],funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3autjk/the_plight_of_the_intern/,"Someone whose name you don’t know comes up to your desk. 

He or she starts saying a name that is not yours, but catches his or her self mid way. Kind of like “Ryyyyyya, Oh sorry your name is Mike. Michael. I am Fred” 

You are one of the interns right? Yeah, Bob told me about you, as he answers his own question.  (You think to yourself. Who the fuck is bob? I have been here two years and there are only 5 people in this office and apparently now there is a Bob and a Fred)

After a little bit of mental problem solving and a few awkward seconds, Fred looks you in the eyes and asks you the two questions that every single intern has learned to fear. 

1)	“Hey are you busy?”

And 

2)	“Can you do me a favor?”

Every alarm is going off in your body. You literally cringe in your chair but you can show Fred how you really feel so you pretend like it is a back crap. What could this man want? I didn’t even know he existed 2 minutes ago let alone know what on earth Fred does. 
Is it accounting based? Fuck I haven’t done accounting since freshman year. All I learned in that class was how to play cube runner and look like I was struggling in class every time I crashed so the teacher would pity me and give me a better grade as the end of the semester. 

Wait, I am in the marketing program. Maybe he will ask me to look at some logos or something.  I can do that. People love the color red. If he asks me what color I think looks good. I am just going to say red. That will drive sales and everyone will be happy.  We sell oranges though. Red oranges?? Fuck it, I will say that we can have Marc Eco to sponsor them. People love his shit for some reason.
 
Holy crap he is holding a tablet! I hate tablets. My fingers are too fat to type on the touch screen. It will take me a year to write a page. Little does Fred know that is pretty much holding the equivalent of the nuclear football in in his sweaty hand. If he punches in the go codes and tries to hand that bomb to me, I am putting in my two-second notice and PTFOing. By the grace of god, Fred opens his satchel and safely stows away and football. My life has been spared. I live to work another day.

After all of these thoughts raced around in my head for what in reality was only and awkward three-second pause, I look Fred right in the eyes as if I was peering into this man’s blacked corporate soul and said, “No I am not busy. What do you need?” At this point I felt like I sold my soul to the devil. He digested my words for what seemed like an eternity as a sole bead of sweat appeared on my forehead. His mouth started to move and the utterance of first word made my heart skip a beat. 

“Change” Change what??? Seats? My socks? Do they smell? My lifestyle? How much does Fred know about me? WHO IS FRED!! This man cracked me with out even trying. “Change the” Fred you better fucking tell me right now what has to be changed or I literally may die. “Change the Coffee Filter”. The coffee filter…?

 I let my mind process this unexpected request.  What I say next will make or break my relations with Fred for the rest of my internment. I took a hot second to compose myself and said “ Yeah, sure it’s no problem.”

Did he take the bait? Does he now think that I am so confident in changing the coffee filter that I could do it with my eyes closed? Like Moses waiting to find the holy hand, I waited for Fred to acknowledge what I said as coolly as possible. He smiled and walked away. By the grace of god I made it through my first encounter with him.

Just as Fred rounded the corner to his office and closed the door, a first year intern came back from the bathroom. I looked him with a smirk that screamed, “I own your soul” and simply said, “Fred told me to tell you to change the coffee filter as soon as possible. He wants his coffee. Now.”

I am currently working as an SAP Consultant for Deloitte and I don't really think I want to go this way. So I am considering the switch to Auditing. I thought about talking to a current employe in that area as a networking idea. Anybody done this before or know if it is possible?

* Indirect approach through the internal message system (link/Internal skype)?

* What type of questions can I ask that do not hurt my current position but give me the information to get closer or even achieve the switch?

* Do I have to consider the relationship between my actual boss and the person I am approaching?

* May a “simple conversation” backfire me eventhough I am just an intern?

* Do this outside my current firm (other big 4s, MS, Evai,etc.)if yes, do I mention the company I am interested in leaving if they are interested in me?

&gt;**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* The smaller the case the better with low noise levels. No LED's, since I don't like fancy things. I would like to keep it as simple as possible, only the intern hardware matters for me.

&gt;**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

* No, I already own an OS(64bit).

I know the ""I have nothing to hide"" camp will probably keep going forward in the same fashion and, although I have nothing illegal to hide, I still don't like the idea of CSIS interns going through my data, or being an object in a security database because I googled Kali Linux (c'mon, I work in IT.)

Personally, I made a bootable USB drive with a copy of TAILS linux on it for emergency purposes on the off chance I have to communicate with someone, or research something morally or legally questionable. It wasn't hard and took only a few minutes. The longest part was actually downloading TAILS OS itself.

I know there have been a flurry of posts about a smite app recently. I made a comment in the post with the UI designs about a week or two ago. So I figured I would come here and talk about what things look like at the moment from my projects standpoint. I am sorry if this turns out to be a little bit technical!

So first off all data that we are allowed to pull is from the HiRez's REST API. This and all of the legal information binding to it can be found on http://www.hirezstudios.com/hi-rez/legal/. The documents that are included in that page talk about the limits that are put on developers in terms of sessions, call limits and publishing information. Feel free to peruse as you wish, and if anyone else is working on an app you basically have to read it.

So time to get to what I am working on.

I was originally going to create basically a smite guru style app, but people kept talking about an SPL app so I decided to focus more on that style. HOWEVER, everything that I have coded so far can be used for either app style.

The first step was to create a system that controls the sessions you use to talk to hirez so that you don't go over your limit and get throttled. Which, for those who care, I wrote in PhP. After which I then started to pull from the API. This is when I found a bug in the SPL data call the API to not be able to pull data from SPL matches that happened in the same day. This was problematic because it caused me to not be able to pull as close to ""live"" data as I could. Thanks to Hirez APC we were able to get that sorted out in about a week. 

As of two days ago my web backend now pulls and stores all SPL data, this means that I never go near the request and session limit because I only pull from hirez when new data is available. 

This is where the fun part happens. At this point any app that uses my API wrapper either ios/windows/android can pull from the data I have stored and it makes it a little bit more simple to get the exact data that they want without worrying about sessions, tokens, and limits.

So at this point, the only thing left to do is design the UI for the apps then implement the backends of each local phone type. I have started the IOS backend already. I have a lightweight networking library that I wrote for a previous job that I have implemented with my wrapper. I am trying to make it so that you can customize what kind of SPL data that you see and how you see it. I think it should be pretty awesome.

Now here is the catch. I currently work a shitty retail job, a programming internship, and I have some summer classes. I basically code this at night when I can't sleep. There are a few people that have mentioned that they would either start working on one or have already started working on one. To them I say I would be more than willing to make a git repo of the code that I have made for both the php and iOS and have us all start working together. I have already private messaged the creator of the UI post and the other guy who posted today offering to work together. 

I hope that one way or another either if it myself or someone else that we can get something out to the community.

TLDR: Making a smite app, and do not have that much time to work on it. Would love to team up with people.


Thanks guys!

3avdnd,11,2015-06-23,I don't trust myself anymore.,MauPow,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/3avdnd/i_dont_trust_myself_anymore/,"(Caution: This is going to get rambly)

I know that I'm a good person. I like myself in general. I think I'm interesting, have some good hobbies, and I'm pretty outgoing. I've never had drug addictions, never hurt anybody, never tried to hurt myself. But it seems like nothing that I do ever pans out, and I'm afraid to even try anymore. The feeling of success is a foreign thing to me.

 I followed the regular path in life, got decent grades, and even felt like I was going places in college where I was on the student government and was invited for special projects in my school (Journalism). But even those failed. I wasn't able to complete my duties to the government, and my part in the projects always failed no matter how hard I tried, it just wasn't good enough.

 After school I went abroad to live in Europe for a few years under the guise of broadening my horizons and a fun time, but really I was just running from my depression in shame, hoping it would be better once I was in a different place. Well, it wasn't.

Everyone around me thinks I'm doing fine, but I feel like I'm that person that no one notices until they do something seriously self destructive.

I've been living at my mom's for almost 2 years now. I tried a few internships in the journalism field, but nothing came of those, and I didn't even get any decent connections. Not like it's a lucrative field anyways. Now I'm working at a food delivery company as a self employed driver, which totally sucks because I have to use my car, which is constantly breaking down. 

I bought a ticket back to Europe a couple weeks ago on a manic whim. I then came to a revelation that I shouldn't run from my problems anymore, and decided not to go. Turns out I forgot to buy cancellation insurance so I'm basically out another $700 and might not be able to fix my car, which isn't really drivable right now, and which I need for my job. I also have $11,000 in student loan debt that is killing my credit, which is in the low 500s. I didn't have anything to do with college tuition, and I'm trying to get my dad to figure it out, but he's busy with his own stuff and never has time to look at it. Meanwhile I get collections notices and my bank account is about to be garnished. 

I'm 27 years old and I have to run to my parents every few weeks for help. I don't know how I could ever move out. I don't even pay rent. Every decision I ever make seems like the wrong one. I look at my track record while trying to make the next decision and I lose all hope. I'm hopeless. Everyone else my age I know has a decent to good job, they're saving money for retirement, investing, going out, having fun, while I struggle at this shitty job and fall further into depression. As I write this I'm waiting for my mom to get home so I can use her car for my job. All I do now is play video games, surf reddit, and make half hearted attempts at job searching until I give up when there's nothing I could conceivably see myself doing. 

I have no idea what I want to do from life, or what I want from it. I've never had a real romantic relationship, just a lot of fairly meaningless sex and month long flings. The world feels empty and like there's no place in it for me. I went to a therapist for a few weeks and all she could tell me is that I seem great and things will look up for me soon. But I've been like this for pretty much all of my teenage and adult life. I don't feel like a part of anything. I have friends but they hardly ever call me to hang out, no matter how many times I call them and we have a great time together. Whenever I feel like I've just had a great time with people and was totally in the moment, I go and look at the pictures and think how ugly and awkward I looked and feel terrible about myself again. I wonder why anyone would want anything to do with me and how I don't look like a normal upstanding 27 year old guy who would have a good job, girlfriend, and his shit together. Everyone always tells me I'm good looking, I'm tall, not fat, but I never get any real attention from girls. I try to dress well but when I see myself I think I look stupid. 

Fuck, I dunno. Anyone able to glean anything from this pile of whining? "
3aw1j4,23,2015-06-23,Improving my JavaScript skills.,Hayaboza,javascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3aw1j4/improving_my_javascript_skills/,"(Excuse my bad English please.)

Hi, The title says it all, I want to improve my JS skills.
I've been employed for about 2 Years now, As a full time programmer, (Been testing mostly), Now, I think I've been loyal more than necessary, Meaning, I haven't been studying/trying to improve my knowledge withing core working hour.

Now, I have a lot of free time (no tasks assigned to me since a week so far), So, I wanted to improve my js skills to get better tasks in the future ( I don't want to spend the rest of my life testing.).

The problem I am facing is "" I don't know what I don't know"", So, picked ""Beginning JavaScript 4th edition"" (based upon javascriptissexy.com's advice) and I noticed that I know quite a lot of theory already, And I studied computer engineering, so, I believe I am full of theory, and many resources/blogs recommend getting involved in Open-source project to get better at what you do. well, That turned out to be much difficult than I anticipated. 

I am trying really hard to find a JS projects to get involved with (If that is the best way to get better skills, If not, Feel free to correct/advice me) with no luck, Many projects needs people to write documentation/tests, but that is not what I am after..

I am a passionate programmer, and I really want PURE programming, not testing or documentation.

I tried finding internships as well, No luck so far...

Cum ii dau jet?",[deleted],Romania,https://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/3aw75v/roddit_o_minora_ilegal_de_buna_se_da_la_mine_cum/,"De 2 zile si ceva, traiesc un conflict intern cum n-am mai trait pana acum. Parintii unei prietene de-a sorei mele au plecat o saptamana in concediu, asta chipurile nu voia sa stea singura, si sora-mea a invitat-o la noi. Tipa are 16 ani. Eu am acceptat, crezand ca e vreo veverita de-a ei cu care oricum nu voi avea prea multe interactiuni. Aparent m-am inselat...

In primul rand e buna, aka futabila aka nu as ezita sa o urc pe tester daca ar avea cu 2 ani mai mult. In al doilea rand se da la mine, la modul grav.

Totul a inceput duminica, cand a venit. Initial nu am observat nimic suspect, in afara de faptul ca era buna. Spre seara insa, cand s-a schimbat in pijama, si-a tras o pijama din aia sexy gen rochita, care nu acopera mare lucru, si nici macar nu avea chiloti. La modul ca daca s-ar fi aplecat, i-as fi vazut floricica in toata splendoarea ei. Nu as fi avut o mare problema cu asta, daca nu s-ar fi plimbat excesiv prin casa, de fiecare data trecand prin fata mea, eu stand pe /r/romania si incercand sa-l calmez pe mini me. 

Luni dupa-amiaza am fost impreuna cu ea si sora-mea sa-si ia niste lucruri de acasa. A insistat sa stea in fata, langa mine. Pe drum, a avut niste conversatii cu sora-mea, chestii de adolescente, nu am prea bagat de seama, pana am observat ca au inceput sa discute ceva despre sani, iar apoi, din senin, ma intreaba ce fel de sani ma excita la o femeie. I-am dat un raspuns evaziv, sa ma scot din situatie, ea a inceput sa rada, in acelasi timp atingandu-mi mana de pe schimbator intr-un mod foarte pervers.

Luni seara, m-am pus sa ma uit la un film, sora-mea se culcase deja, asta a venit la mine in pijamaua ei perversa si m-a intrebat daca poate sa se uite si ea cu mine la film. Ca sa nu fiu nesimtit, i-am zis ca poate, desi stiam ca s-a dus pe pula tot filmul, pentru ca nu aveam cum sa fiu atent la el, cu asta practic in pizda goala, langa mine. La inceput, s-a plasat la o distanta rezonabila fata de spatiul meu personal, insa putin cate putin a inceput sa mi-l invadeze, pana m-am trezit ca isi pune capul pe umarul meu. In acel moment stiam ca am doar doua variante, ori o fut, ori ii dau eject in camera sora-mii. Am ales a doua varianta.

Astazi a fost punctul culminant, cand a trebuit sa fac eforturi supra-omenesti ca sa ma abtin s-o fut. Dupa ce am venit de la lucru, nu am observat nimic suspect si pret de cateva ore chiar am crezut ca renuntat la idee. Evident, m-am inselat. Pe la 7 seara, sora-mea a iesit in oras cu prietenu-sau, au invitat-o si pe asta, insa a refuzat spunand ca ea vrea sa-si faca un dus si sa se uite la nu stiu ce serial. 

Eu m-am pus linistit sa ma uit la un documentar. Tipa, s-a plimbat putin prin casa, si-a lasat telefonul in sufragerie, adica unde eram eu si s-a bagat la dus. Dupa vreo 20 de minute, a iesit numai in prosop, a venit si si-a luat telefonul. S-a pus ea sa-si usuce parul si sa se schimbe, dupa care vine din nou langa mine, chipurile curioasa de documentarul pe care il priveam. Am inchis rapid documentarul si m-am bagat in Xcode, sperand ca o voi plictisi si determina sa plece. Ea insa a inceput sa-mi puna tot felul de intrebari despre viata mea, invadandu-mi, in acelasi timp, spatiul personal. 

Pentru ca nu eram in stare sa scriu nici un rand de cod in starea in care eram, ca sa nu par penibil ca nu fac nimic decat sa belesc ochii in monitor, am inchis laptopul si m-am lasat pe spate, continuand discutia cu minora. Imediat ce m-am lasat pe spate, tipa a inceput sa-mi bage mana prin par, iar in acel moment rational croco a pierdut batalia. M-am intors cu fata spre ea, am sarutat-o, am luat-o in brate, fierbea de ziceai ca are febra tifoida si totul s-a transformat intr-un makeout session in toata regula. Norocul meu a fost ca dupa vreo 3 minute, inainte ca lucrurile sa escaleze prea tare, a venit si telefonul salvator. Un amic (culmea, curvar notoriu), m-a sunat sa-mi spuna ca si-a pierdut toti banii la pacanele si nu mai are bani de taxi sa ajunga acasa. In mod normal l-as fi trimis in pizda ma-sii, insa a fost oportunitatea perfecta sa ma scot din cacat. 

Dupa ce m-am intors, venise si sora-mea, situatia se mai calmase, insa trebuie sa mai rezist pana duminica cu posibilul dosar penal in casa. Asadar roddit, ce masuri credeti ca ar trebui sa iau?

TL;DR Sora-mea si-a adus o prietena sa stea o saptamana la mine, e buna in draci si se da la mine, insa are 16 ani si prefer sa nu. "

Advice?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3awfvs/firm_wants_me_to_stay_on_longer_as_intern_before/,"I interned at a firm during busy season, was given a full time offer with a start date in late fall. They later contacted me after a few weeks asking if I could come back to help them for the summer as an intern. I had been planning on doing my best to pass all four parts of the CPA exam before my start date and had scheduled all the exams before they approached me. They were kind of hazy on when the end date would be, but said July so I figured why not. As crazy as it sounded, a part of me missed the work and I figured it might kick start my studying a bit. I accepted and moved the exam dates around to make things work. 


About a month and a half back for the summer, I was approached again about the possibility of me staying on until my start date. Essentially helping them out for the 9/15 deadline. I politely refused, stating I planned on taking time before my start date to study for the exam. Especially since every single person you meet always tells you to try to do it before you start since trying to do it while working is a pain in the ass. In all honesty, I was struggling with studying and working at the same time. They said that was fine.


I received a phone call a few weeks later proposing another possibility where I stay till September and move my start date later down, giving me time to study for the exam during that time. It seemed as if they had lost a preparer for a chunk of clients and needed someone to fill in. 


I'm not sure how I want to answer. If I do accept I'd somehow have to figure out how to pass the exams I've schedule for this exam period while working. If I try to take them after September I'd have to pay for all the exam costs again (I believe my firm only covers the cost the first time you take them), which makes me reluctant to do. I would continue to be paid as just an intern which I guess has it's up and downsides with hourly pay and overtime. I wouldn't receive any of the benefits of a FT employee and won't until later.  


What should I do? Refuse? I feel like they wouldn’t ask me to come back for the summer, and two more times to stay longer unless they really need people and are having trouble filling the spots. Man up, say yes and kill myself to pass the CPA exams during this exam period? Float the idea to them to cover the exam costs if they really want me to push my studying/exams to post-September? I doubt that’d work. Say no…? What would you do in this situation? Any advice is appreciated. "

Only the IT interns have to do this because they feel it's necessary. Why is it necessary? Because apparently every intern fits the computer nerd stereotype of being socially inept. gay gay gay gay gay.

So they gave us a group project where we will meet up with other interns and are given 2 hours to come up with an idea to improve the company that isn't already occurring/in place/been thought of. whatever.

I need to mend my heart, he needs to figure his shit out and mend.**

OP: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3amf1s/me_26f_and_my_bf_25m_having_a_rocky_shortterm/

**Info/BG:** We've been together for 3 years now, we'd spend a lot of time together, with friends or not with friends. FB msg a lot and texting too. During the winter semester at school, he finally landed his dream internship with one of the Big 4's (software development field). The internship is about 3 months long. I'm on the East coast, he's on the West coast.
 

We had talked about how to cope and how to keep in touch and keep the flame going. I had a few breakdowns since and due to my past online relationship with a cheating guy, I have trust issues and I still do now. I find it very difficult to cope with when my bf is out and about town with his new friends (women and men) almost until midnight on the weekends. I know he is def not the kind of person to do cheating but I always end in doubt after pushing away those thoughts.
 

We did try Skype 'dating' and Skype calls daily and some messaging, yet it doesn't seem to satisfy me. I had a small scuffle recently over Skype and talked about it. We only talked in the morning and decided to leave each other some alone time to recuperate from the upsetting talk / anger. He doesn't want it to become a responsibility to talk to me, he wants to enjoy talking to me. 


He recently moved and because we talked about me visiting him after his official moving in to a studio, I was supposed to get his new address and figure something out together so I can visit. That didn't happen yet, he told me that he would link the proper address soon as possible and that was forgotten when he decided to go chat and hang out with people there.

&amp;nbsp;

So that's when the emotional explosion happened onto him. I know I screwed up badly. He's upset and wanted some space for a few days. I decided to go fix my shit, get busy and change the things I do and how I act. Its a long road but I gotta start seriously. The same day in the evening he calls on Skype. He finally opens up to talk slowly and im patient. During the afternoon he apparently talked about our situation to a woman who is also an intern and emotionally got involved and kissed. He tells me there is nothing between them and they both regret it. I told him I'm willing to forgive him because I hurt him as well and I want to fix things. He then says he doesn't want to get hurt anymore but he wanted me to know and still loves me very much and did say he wants to be with me. He is just scared of a reoccurrence because everything was positive until I snapped. 


Some of you may say I'm desperate but after the first year, he is the one for me. He said that he doesn't know how to improve things on his end even it wasn't his fault. He keeps saying he disappointed me. After some time trying to say that I don't want to give up and also want to make things right he said that he doesn't know what he needs to have him trust me again. So I gave him my reasons why and how to trust me again because I'm actively trying to solve my issues. 


He thought about it. We got off Skype because he wanted some time to himself before he can get back to me with an appropriate answer/more opening up.  I'm not sure if it's 100% over. 

&amp;nbsp;

   
**tl:dr**: I screwed up got insecure and exploded on him. He's upset. Asked for space and went kissing a girl. I forgave him because I want to work on the relationship issue. Is this salvageable?

I'm around a year into a 10mg/day addiction and dose twice a day just to starve off the withdrawals.

I went to one out-patient doctor who was a complete idiot that only took a urine test to check that benzo's were in my system. He didn't believe I was taking home-pressed bars and said that he had never heard of that in his 30 years of experience?!

The doctor proceeded to prescribe me 40mg Valium to take a four 10mg pills over the course of a day. He also prescribed me a low dose of some anti-seizure medication I can't recall.

After three days, I began hallucinating from no sleep and had a small seizure, luckily in my bed. At that point, I was scared shitless and went back on alp., because I just couldn't take that torture any longer.

My conclusion to this is, are there decent doctors out there that understand (not naive) that people take home pressed bars and pure alp. powder because psychiatrists will obviously not prescribe 10mg Xanax/day. 

I truly want to quit this more than anything, but I have a very busy life, which will be ruined if I'm in a rehab facility for 2 months. I know how to reduce my dosage and wouldn't relapse, like doctors always assume. Is 10mg/day just too high for out-patient? That's what I'm beginning to think and I will lose scholarships, my job, an amazing internship if they find out and I'm gone for months..."

I am in a program where all interns work part-time during the school year and full time during the summer. There were three other interns on my team when I joined, but one I didn't see for a 5 week period because our work schedules never matched up, but we finally met at the start of the new quarter about 12 weeks ago. We both started full time work last week and have really started to get to know each other better. I now accept that I've developed a crush for my coworker.

We talk, joke, and get along well, have been friends on Facebook for a few weeks already, and have started carpooling to work together as of today. There hasn't been any flirting, and all our conversations have really been friendly, but the amount that I think about this person has lead to me believe that I have a serious crush for them. There haven't been any signs of reciprocation (though I am awful at observation), and I know that I am probably reading into things too much (Things like sitting next to each other at lunch, us looking to the other to decide if we want to go to break at the same time, casually chatting over our office instant messaging system). 

I enjoy our relationship, we enjoy similar things and can make each other laugh, and I don't want to ruin it. I also know its a workplace crush, which adds a level of complexity to things. We report to different managers, though we are on the same team. I need to refer to my workplace's guidelines on this type of relationship, which I can only read at work. It's also worth to note that the nature of our employment also carries through beyond this summer (unlike typical programs), so it's safe to assume that both of us will be working together to at least next summer. 

I really like this person, but I need advice on this situation. I am not very experienced with relationships, and I honestly feel that she's ""out of my league."" I believe I could convince myself to put these feelings to rest with time and necessity, but I also think that developing a relationship with this girl might be something special. I also don't know if I would be willing to transfer to another team if it came to that, and I don't want to jeopardize the positive relationship we have here.

What's some advice on an office crush, with a peer? What's good advice to see if another person might be interested in me? How would I even go to a ""next step,"" from beyond a crush? What if I just want to be a friend in the end? What do I need to do if I need to convince myself to put these feelings to rest?

**tl;dr** I have a crush on a co-intern, don't know if it's possibly reciprocated. Don't know what to do because it's in a workplace, wouldn't know how to get to know this person better if I even wanted to, and if nothing else, I want at least want to be friends with this person."

http://www.publico.es/politica/artur-mas-inicia-carrera-solitario.html

L'advertiment de l'hereu de Jordi Pujol contra els del ""Sí se puede"" no és el fruit d'una irritació momentània, és part d'una estrategia calculada molt vinculada a la defensa dels interessos dels que manen a Catalunya.

1.- CDC, ERC i UDC fa temps que saben que un discurs que trenqui el maniqueisme ""unionistes versus sobiranistes"", ""obediència catalana versus obediència espanyola"", ""Catalunya contra Espanya"", etc. tenia la possibilitat de connectar amb amplis sectors socials d'exclosos a Catalunya , sectors als que han procurat mantenir fora de la política. Durant tres anys llargs, aquest fet ha estat convenientmente silenciat, i qualsevol que qüestionava el maniqueisme era ridiculitzat i insultat des d'aquestes posicions polítiques.

2.- La victoria d'Ada Colau ha encés les senyals d'alarma. Un increment de la participació amenaça el sistema de ""sufragi censitari"" de facto que va impulsant el projecte neoliberal. L'amenaça es concreta perillosament.

3.- L'advertiment d'Artur Mas té una lectura en clau interna. Avisa que el profitós joc d'escenificacions entre nacionalistes catalans i espanyols, està en perill. Als seus partidaris (i de pas, als altres) els informa d'un nou ""enemic intern"" que trenca les regles del joc i al que cal combatre. És una crida a ""l'unitat nacional"".

4.- En clau externa és una versió actualitzada del costum nacionalista d'atorgar patents de pertinença. Està qualificant als del ""Sí se puede"" como enemics de Catalunya (de la seva, és clar). Una adaptació local del discurs de Rajoy pel que Podemos era una amenaça per a la ""Marca España"".

5.- Interesa molt el recurs de Mas de plantejar ara les dues ""agendes"", la nacional i la social. Mas fa servir parcialment el discurs engegat per la CUP. El fet de que durant quatre anys no s'hagi fet ni una sola menció als conflictes socials a Catalunya, i que ara, de cop, faci aparèixer una ""agenda social"" de la que ningú no tenia notícies. És una altra mostra de que el perill que representem pels que manen no s'ha infravalorat.

6.- També interessa molt destacar que Mas ha evitat identificar a los del ""Sí se puede"" amb Espanya, Madrid, o els tópics nacionalistes habituals. Mas sap que el potencial d'una interpretació ampla del ""dret a decidir"" no es pot conjurar amb els simplismes de sempre. Sap que aquest perill ha de ser anulat per una combinació de confrontació i superació. Un altre punt en comú amb el discurs de Rajoy contra Podemos.

7.- Això marca un terreny a on disputar la hegemonia als nacionalismes,  i uns grups socials amb els que vertebrar-la. Invertint la lògica de la declaració de Mas, es percep que els del ""Sí se puede"" hem d'estar units, respectant els sentiments nacionalistes, però per sobre d'ells. Tota realitat política és una construcció, i Mas posa en evidencia la necessitat de mantenir, reforçar i ampliar els ponts amb les persones que, arreu d'Espanya, treballen contra les polítiques neoliberals. 

Les declaracions de Mas van ser contestades per Ada Colau

3axx33,10,2015-06-24,Birthday is coming up...but I'm sad :(,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3axx33/birthday_is_coming_upbut_im_sad/,"So, first let's get the basics down. I am a 19 year old guy (well, I will be tomorrow).

I didn't know where to post this, but I just feel really bad about myself and reddit always seems kind and supportive to people when they need it. I just came here for the support, even though it's from strangers that don't know me and I probably won't meet, but it'll feel like someone cares enough to show it.

I finished the first year of uni and had plans for an internship right after the finals. However, the guy who ""hired"" me, changed his mind and decided not to tell me, so I just had to find out after dozens of calls and attempts to reach him. So now I have no internship this summer. Which mean I won't have an attractive transfer application (I want to study abroad the final 2 years).

I've been in a sort of depression mood the past few months, but it's a different one because I don't want to waste my time with it. So it's more of an active depression, I still do thing and interact with people. But if you know me, you'd realize I am not okay. As I said that was several months ago, and still non of my family members noticed a thing, At the beginning they probably thought it was just the exam stress, but after that they just assumed it was the norm and that I must be going through a phase (That's the best explanation I could come up with that wouldn't hurt my feeling that much).
A few weeks ago, my sister went into a full depression mode, she's not been out the bed since and barely eats. I'm the only person she still talks to normally. I try to get her out of the mood, but she doesn't want to. But my parents see me as the solution and keep pressuring me and scolding me everyday she's still not okay. And honestly it's hard fighting this depression I have when nobody seems to notice that I have it and demand me to ""fix"" someone else's depression.

Oh, and my GF (my first serious relationship and I do love her) dumped me right after the finals were over. My friends blame me, and because we are in the same friends group she's one of the guys, and they all took her side. She couldn't handle me in this strange form of depression added with the exam stress.

The past 5 years I've been living in my room that was turned into a storage room, I only got a small fraction of the room, just enough for the bed, closet and a path to the door. Every time I try to re-box and clean the room to give myself more space my mom get's sick (she has something with her that affects her health according to her mood, not sure what it's called in English) and I have to get everything back into my room. We're moving soon, so I started doing that again with the excuse of helping the move. But instead of taking the things outside I keep them in the room and work with the small free space I have. I sleep on the floor in the living room now, it's been like a couple of weeks now.

The whole 18 years I've been living on this planet, I've never had anyone make me a party (for any reason) except my family for my birthday.. and not all birthdays. my 12th birthday I didn't even get a birthday wish nor did my siblings come in with a candle singing ""Happy Birthday"". I never told that to anyone, except a guy who I thought was my best friend (until I found out his role in the break up, he tried to fix it by telling my GF .. ex-gf, that it is probably just a phase because of the exams. But he knew something was up and didn't bother telling me, but actually started blaming me when I went to him right after I was dumped) well he probably still is my best friend. Anyway back to the point, while organizing this perfect party for my ex's birthday (turned out the opposite if what I planned, but she was still ecstatic...I still am not happy with the way it turned out) so during the organization I accidentally opened up and told him about my situation with birthdays. Ever since then he'd ask me almost every time he'd see me when my birthday is. So, I knew he was planning something, and he told me that he got reservations in this place in the old town and it'll be me, him, our 3rd friend and my ex (that's our group.. she has to be there). That's it. He didn't invite anyone of my other friends (Like I did with the parties I organized for the 2 other members of our group) nor did he make it sound special. I mean it might be a rouse he's pulling and surprise me with everyone there, but I don't want to have my hopes up.

My ex, every time the group goes out she doesn't even look at me, and I have to be the one starting any interaction. But even then she starts closing and ignoring me after she had slightly started to open up again. The evening ends up with me sitting alone and she talking to my friends. Usually (before the breakup) she'd be talking to me and only a few times we'd include the guys into our conversation. (we didn't ignore them or anything, we talked to them and all, but most the time we'd be talking to each other).

I was trying to give you a picture of how horrible my birthday would be if it actually turned out to be just the 4 of us. Oh and that 3rd friend he's been busy all summer with this internship he got and we haven't seen him since the finals. When my friend told me he convinced him he made sure I'd feel that he tried hard to convince him, he said that he even went through and called both his parents to force him to come. He's trying to show that he cares, but all I got was that my friend is only coming because he was forced to.

I did terribly in the finals (I have a habit of self sabotage when I work hard for something) I knew everything on the exam, they were simple, but I just couldn't answer. I am expected to get the highest scores, but honestly I doubt I'll pass... bye bye transferring.

I decided to group up with some guys I don't know and cosplay payday 2 for an event coming up, I thought the work would get my mind off it. But anytime I'm alone and not busy with something I remember how bad I feel from the inside.

I know all my problems are small and don't come close to what people have been going through, but I feel bad, really bad. But again, I feel like a brat when I say them out loud. People are going through way worse and I'm feeling like hell because of some stupid social problems.

I think I should include this; I only had 2 best friends my whole life, the first traveled to another country and we lost contact, the second was killed while we were in a fight and weren't speaking to each other. So I blame my trust and friend issues on that.

If you made it to this paragraph, then thank you, just the thought that you took time out of your day to read my ranting feels nice.

Edit: I forgot this. Because of my sister being depressed, my family don't realize my birthday is tomorrow. It's like my 12th birthday, but worse.

TL;DR First birthday party is tomorrow and only 3 people are coming. My ex is one of the 3 and she dumped me a few weeks ago. Oh, and I am on the doorsteps of depression."

I have no experience with either one and I'm just learning as I go. There are multiple subsites on the teams Wiki - all with numerous pages being updated daily. So far, I have been manually migrating files and building sites/pages on the fly.

As you can imagine, this is incredibly slow and monotonous work.

I know that there are tools from metalogix.com and tzumani.com but there is no way for me to get these tools.

I guess my question for all you Sharepoint experts and enthusiasts is: is there an easier way to do this? There are plenty of static pages that can be moved over as-is, but I feel like there has to be a way to move them faster than just build page-download files from wiki-copy/paste info from wiki-upload files.

3ayctp,3,2015-06-24,How to apply for internship at the big guys? And how to approach them.,Elixipixie,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/3ayctp/how_to_apply_for_internship_at_the_big_guys_and/,"Hi!

I need some advice from you all.

Im currently at my last year in my graphic design bachelor. But right now I have so much thoughts I dont really know where to start or who to talk to. The reason for this is because in November I have to find a place where I can work as intern for six months. After the last semester with the internship Im finally a bachelor student. 

Now here is my thoughts and what annoys me to the end of the earth:
I have been researching design agencies I want to give it a try on but some of them are quite high class and hard to get into as an example Snøhetta. My additional plan is to make such a good job during the internship that they might offer me a job after the internship. With this I also have to consider where I apply, will there be room for me after the internship/school? Sure I could work with the big guys, but then it would suck if I would have to leave them for a smaller company after school.

As seeing this is something required from school (the internship) Im not allowed to ask for payment during my internship unless they offer it to me. Which means I will have a quite heavy 6 months economically. This makes it even harder for me to handle, Im going to be 21 in November and Id honestly like to live closer to the workplace and move out from home. My workplace will be without doubt will be 1+ hour away at least and the travel expenses will be a fortune. 

Now sure, this is all about money so thats not my biggest issue. The worst part for me is how to make contact with the agencies without sounding like a 4 year old applying to a kindergarten for the summertime. How on earth do I call someone/mail someone and ask for a internship when they probably dont even need my help? I really want to learn from the internship so I should be working with an agency and not some graphic designer for a cookiebrand.

How do I present myself? Meet up personally? Call? Email? 
What should I do with my portfolio, how do I make one convincing when Im probably not the first student asking for this? Should I have it printed? Online? Online and print? Should I tell them about achievements or let the design speak for itself?

With other words, how do I convince the big people that Im going to rock their world?

Thanks in advance from a frustrated student."

3az3xf,3,2015-06-24,"Reddit, I need some help, advice, encouragement or really anything helps.",__theDude,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3az3xf/reddit_i_need_some_help_advice_encouragement_or/,"Years ago I would have never thought I would be in this position as I have always felt that I am decently smart and capable person. 

I graduated last year from the University of Houston with a degree in Finance (GPA 3.15). After a small job search and coming up short I decided to take a chance on myself and move to Los Angeles as that is where I have wanted to live/work for a very long time now. None of the industries in Houston peaked any of my interest and LA is full of everything I have ever wanted to be involved in; plus the weather, people and vast things to do 24/7.

I knew finding a job in LA, at least a decent job would be semi-difficult but I was fully prepared financially and mentally for that to happen. However, it has been nine months and I am still searching and starting to get incredibly discouraged. For those wondering what I have been doing up to this point I will lay it out in detail.

1.) I actually had a semi-job set up through a friend before I moved out here with his start-up business, however, he got started a lot slower than he anticipated and was unable to hire me right away and even though his business has picked up he is still not in a position to hire anyone yet.

2.) Almost immediately after I arrived I went to recruiting agencies such as Robert Half and filled out profiles to start finding work. The day I showed up to the office they offered me to interview for 1-2 positions that were basic data entry jobs for $10-12 an hour. Most of my classmates were making 45-50k a year minimum and I made more than 10$ an hour when I was 17 years old and a junior in high school. I decided that taking a 6 month commitment at $10 an hour was going probably not in my best interest because if I plugged away  I would be able to find something a little more stable, more responsibilities and reasonable pay. Since then, I have tried working with RobertHalf and other recruiting agencies, I apply to positions on their site, email my contacts and call. I never EVER get a response anymore. Not even for the $10 an hour data entry jobs.

3.) I have gone to job fairs to meet face to face with hiring companies and network. I felt like these went well and met a lot of interesting people and companies but nothing has ever panned out to even an interview.

4.) I have applied online to every job you can possibly imagine. ZipRecruiter, WorkPop, Monster, CareerBuilder, Indeed, Company Websites and every other one has become a home where I apply to jobs non-stop. Literally. I think my count for jobs applications is 200+  I was actually going to start an excel spreadsheet listing jobs I apply to with contact information and what happened. I have gotten some first interviews (not many) and never to a second interview.

5.) I have networked with friends, friends of friends and gotten involved in communities of people to help get a lead on a job, it has helped but never amounted to anything. I even got noticed online by a guy who worked at a major company in LA, he invited me to the offices, bought me lunch, gave me a tour and we had a very long and good informal interview. He really seemed to like me and my drive but I never got past HR to get an interview. He stayed in contact with me every week and seemed upset I couldn't get an interview.

6.) Just as a side note, I have applied to everything in the world that I can think of. Everything from working at SpaceX to being a barista at Starbucks and can't seem to get anything. I will now explain why I think these things are happening but I am running out of time, I DO NOT want to leave Los Angeles. I am not a quitter, I want to succeed here and have a drive to do so, but I am reallllly tired of not working.

1.) My resume is a scattered mess and definitely presents me as a jack of all trades and a master of none, however, I don't know how to fix that because my experience is my experience. When I was growing up I always have an infinite amounts of interests. I played video games, baseball, raced motocross, made films, played card games and graphic design. I learned everything I could but never really stuck to one thing and perfected it. This shows in my resume too.

I have started a handful of companies. One was web startup for an eBay like system for a niche product. The other was a film company in Houston where we shot mostly music videos and did some short films and documentaries etc... I also did a lot of freelance work like Desktop support help for people. 

I had a super strong background in tech when I was younger, missed the CCNA exam by one point when I was 16 and worked as a network administrator at a company for a short while.

I have had retail jobs etc... as well but never really lasted at them as I always had higher hopes for myself and didn't want to end up being the manager of the Gap or something like that, forty and hating myself.

Even when I decided I wanted to finish school I started as a computer science major, went into MIS then decided to finish as a finance major. The reason I chose finance was because I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I figured that understanding money and how it works in a business is going to be useful knowledge no matter what industry I work in. Money is universal.

One other thing that I truly believe is holding me back a bit is I am a little heavy at the moment. I used to be super thin, however, a thyroid disorder and being stressed 24/7 at the moment has made me the opposite and people in general, especially in Los Angeles want sharp looking people. I actually felt really really good about a few interviews I had out here but believe that my belly might have been a major factor in not getting the job over another.

-------

The longer this has gone on the more discouraged and confused I have been. I have applied to finance jobs such as junior analyst, entry level book keeper, entry level accounts payable/receivable and even bank teller and personal banker jobs at branches (no interviews).

I have always wanted to work in the film industry, especially out here and have a little experience in it from my work in Houston and have applied to assistant roles, intern roles, finance roles, and everything under the sun out here and have only gotten one interview for an internship at an actually prominent producers desk but I didn't get the job.

I have also dabbled in getting into web development since I have done things like HTML, CSS, etc.. before and worked with my start-up a little bit in web dev, however, deciding to take that path would be a serious commitment and would 99% mean going back to school such as a coding bootcamp and spending another large sum of money on education. There are a lot of jobs here for web dev and coders in general but sometimes I feel like it's just another avenue and another thing on my resume that makes me even more diverse and not directed at a specific goal, puts me in more debt, and no guarantee i'll be great at it or get a job.

I have no idea what I'm supposed to do, what I want to do, or what I will be good at doing anything. I received so much rejection and still trying to keep my head up high. I don't want to move back to Texas (ever) and I don't want to give up. I came here to succeed and make it, be successful and finally get stable.

Any help, advice, encouragement or anything would be useful... I need inspiration to get motivated again... I want to make it"

3az9tc,32,2015-06-24,Brother came back for a week before leaving for a year. My parents spoiled him and treated me like Cinderella. [rant] [Npathy] [triggers],fyrenwater,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3az9tc/brother_came_back_for_a_week_before_leaving_for_a/,"Backstory, short version: Older sister, younger brother. I'm the leftover child. I get second-hand everything, including love, respect, and treatment. I even had to drop out of college because my parents stopped paying for me so they could pay for my brother.

This year, my brother's doing an internship hundreds of miles away, so he only had a week back in town before leaving for a year. The whole week, my parents have been making his favorite food, taking him to places he wants to go, etc. Basically spoiling the everloving crap out of him. I'm left with the chores and the work needed to pick up the slack because they're too busy focusing on their golden child.

Despite all this, I'm actually on good terms with my brother. Growing up together, we were good friends and even though age and distance has caused us to drift apart, we still get along pretty well. So I tolerate this special treatment most times he's back in town.

This time, though... This time, it's been really rough on me. My anxiety got even worse than usual and I went from daily panic attacks to panic attacks once every ~6 hours. The day that everyone left for a daytrip without telling me, my depression took over. I sat around wondering what I was doing with my life and what went so wrong to lead to this point in my life. Was it my fault that I'm stuck in this shitty place in life? It was a rough day to get through.

Finally, the end of the week approached. I got up this morning, planning to talk with him before he left for a year, then let him get back to packing. I walk over and his room was empty. He had already left, hours earlier than he had told me.

My parents saw me and said, ""Oh, you just missed him. He left 10 minutes ago. We didn't think you were awake.""

What the fuck. They didn't even bother checking. Didn't think to come wake me up so I could join in on sending him off. Didn't think that I fucking mattered enough to be allowed to talk to him before they sent off their precious golden baby. Didn't consider I had any goddamn feelings or opinions or anything worth anything to contribute. And he didn't think so, either.

I'm upset. I'm furious. I feel betrayed.

But mostly I'm just depressed that I'm still trapped in this fucking household where I'm an afterthought for everything.

[edit] They made a farewell meal for him. They made food for my mother, my father, and my brother. They didn't make food for me. ***I live here.*** I'm not a person in this house."
3azgt4,7,2015-06-24,Graduate degree,NW_Ecophilosopher,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/3azgt4/graduate_degree/,"So I'm currently going into senior year as a chemical engineer with a 4.0, about two years of research work, and one internship at a large company in a energetic chemistry focused role.

So I've never really been a fan of chemical engineering undergraduate opportunities or even the major, but that's on me for not recognising it earlier and getting a better understanding of what it entails. However, I've always planned on going for a doctorate.

Thus, the question: should I continue on in chemical engineering with the understanding that i can focus in on energetic materials and chemistry as part of the research without going for a chemistry or materials science phd (depends on the program and the professor, but might be doable). Or should i attempt to go for a chemistry or materials science phd perhaps for a better fit (problems with going for a non-chemical engineering degree)? Confounding this is that the company i currently intern at is definitely a great company to be at that seems to offer a lot of learning opportunities that may end up being more relevant than my degree anyways. And maybe i would enjoy going the engineer to manager route, but that is something i probably have to figure out myself. 

Anyways, i just want to know what thoughts you have and any suggestions or personal experiences that might help."

I did an internship at a software startup in the past and have worked in the largest robotics lab in Europe for my third year thesis. 

You might think given those credential it shouldn't be hard to get a job ? especially since I am just 21. 

I went to an interview with an prospective company and they were really excited, everything went fine. However when I told them that I was bangladeshi they were taken aback. 

They told me that its difficult for them to hire a foreigner. 

I looked at the laws and It sort of made sense, 

Basically if you are a company and want to hire an foreigner. 

# You need to pay an extra licencing fee. 

# You cannot pay the person lower salary than the market rate ( means they cannot compensate for the additional cost , lawyers are not cheap) 

# You need to prove that there are no other native eligible candidate. ( I am sure there are many since the job market is fairly saturated but maybe I seemed like the best fit ? who the fuck knows) 

Anyway I have been upset for a few days over this, not because of any other reason but because I was unable to get a job due to a reason that was out of my control ( place of birth ) . Ofcourse there are valid reasons for such treatment. The British govt belongs to the British people. 

But emotionally I am really upset. 

My friend in canada told me how great is it there. 

And have been thinking of applying to Canadian universities for masters. 

I am still young and I might have to do some courses I already did but I am concerned about my future prospect. 

What path do you take after you do a masters in canada to get permanent residence ?

3azq4f,2,2015-06-24,Best way to start career and repay $24k student loans?,moldy912,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3azq4f/best_way_to_start_career_and_repay_24k_student/,"This August I will be starting a new job that pays quite well, so I am considering tackling my debt quickly. I have a few questions such as prioritizing student loans and retirement investments, is it best to pay it off fast, and general advice. I do not have a lot of details on my expenditures because my parents still pay for most of it until I move out in August. I am 22 years old and male.

Income:

 * $64,000 as Software Developer starting in August
 * $4,000+ bonus at end of year
 * $2,000+$1,000 signing and relocation bonus
 * $6,300 in savings (1% I think) + checking accounts

Expected Monthly Expenses:

 * $700 rent, includes utilities, internet, tv, etc.
 * $200 food
 * ~$100 eating out
 * $60 Cell Phone
 * $60? gas, live close to work, so it shouldn't be much
 * no idea about anything else, including insurance, health, gym, etc.

Debts:

 * Perkins Loan $6,600 5.000%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $3,500.00 3.400%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $4,500.00 3.400%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $4,500.00 3.860%
 * Direct Subsidized Stafford $5,298.41 4.660%
 * Grace period ends in November this year
 * I have $50 autopay for Stafford on 10th of each month just for the summer

Other:

 * I have a car that is worth ~$18k. Parents are planning on giving payment responsibility to me, so I'm thinking of trading for a far cheaper car
 * I have no idea how much of the car is paid off
 * Employer offers 4% 401k match graduated, fully vested after 5 years.
 * Personal retirement account as well, which I don't really understand
 * Otherwise decent employment benefits
 * Current girlfriend and I are considering moving in together once she graduates and gets employed so I can pay off loans instead of rent. She has absolutely no debt, $7k in savings, summer internship, but moving out to low rent apartment soon.
 * Long term, I'm definitely thinking of marriage and getting a home, so I am thinking getting rid of debt soon is key, right?

With about $4k post tax monthly income, I was thinking anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 monthly loan payments, which should get me out of debt in a year and a half (ignoring car). Is this the right way to go about it? I know it is best to put money towards highest interest rates, so Perkins will be first. Is it better to pay off Perkins completely and minimum on Stafford? Would it be better to pay less in total and put difference toward retirement? 

My benefits package for the 401k says ""The Company provides a contribution to match your eligible before-tax and/or after-tax contributions of up to 4% of eligible pay."" Does that mean they give me 4% of 18,000 or 64,000?

Also, can someone explain the point of an emergency fund when I just got hired? I don't see the point when I am in a 20 week training program at my employer's brand new location with over 1000 new hires. I just don't really see myself needing it until after at least a year.

Thanks, and I hope it's not too many questions!"
3azryv,2,2015-06-24,I'm not to sure who I am without alcohol,Throwaway1122345678,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3azryv/im_not_to_sure_who_i_am_without_alcohol/,"So I haven't had a drink in what feels like a long time, it's the summer, its no longer a daily battle for me and in all honesty I haven't thought about drinking in a month or more. 

The problem is I'm becoming so restless. I don't think I fully realised how much of my life revolved around drinking and now that I don't do that any more I kinda feel like my life is pretty empty. 

I'm exercising more, I read more, I landed a great internship for the summer but thats it. That is the extent of my life, that is all I do. I go to work (I'm the youngest there by about 15 years), I exercise, I read, I draw sometimes, I watch TV. Thats my whole life. 

All my friends were drinking buddies, we socialised by getting messily drunk, drinking in bars, drinking in clubs, barbecues, getting drunk in the cinema, going for brunch and cocktails literally everything we did revolved around getting drunk. The difference was they weren't doing it to the level I was or with anything like the same frequency.

When I stopped drinking I kind of realised I no longer had anything in common with the people I counted as friends, and to be honest they didnt really want me around. I don't blame them, I wouldn't have wanted a sober person there either when I was drinking. 

I feel like I'm completely alone. I'm also incredibly socially anxious and find it difficult to talk to people. I've pretty much spent my whole adult life drunk. I dont know if Ive ever kissed a guy when I was sober, certainly I've never been on a date. I feel a bit like I have the social development of a young teenager but I'm in my mid 20s. I don't know how to make friends, I don't know how to have a relationship, I can barely talk to a guy without feeling my face flush and panicking, where as three months ago I'd approach anyone with a bottle of wine in my hand. I had new friends every night, I had no problem talking to men, I'd go home with pretty much whoever I wanted provided they were drunk enough. 

I just feel so lost and so ashamed that I've made it to this point of my life with no friends and no outlets. Its like I've lost 6 years of my life and I dunno how to catch up or get them back. My anxiety and shyness is paralyzing me.

I just don't know where to go from here, I'm happier than I was when I was drinking but I dont feel like I have a life any more. I just exist. I just count the days. Has anyone else been through this? How do you rebuild something like a normal life?

I recently had a phone screening with CompanyA and passed it. Also an online Test and passed that as well. I have an upcoming interview with CompanyA next week. On the phone screening they mentioned how much salary am I expecting. I stated $47000 - $49000. They offered me $40000 as starting for an entry level.  

I have an interview with SAP for an intern position. I am not sure if they will ask how much I am expecting for salary, but I would most likely range $44000 - $46000 because the position is an intern. Also because it is an intern position they might offer closer to $40000 as well.

If both company offer me the same salary similar benefit how can i mention to the interviewer that i will have to take some time to decide?"

I've only been sticking people there for about 4 days now and I feel like I'm getting the hang of it but I always feels just awful when I'm coming home. I hate being the worst at something, I hate being the weak leak in our ""team."" I'm definitely the type of person to be really hard on myself if I'm not one of the best so this is really starting to get to me. 

To make things worse the hospital is extremely understaffed which means most of the time now it's just me in the room alone with the patient (normally not bad if they are relatively healthy but most patients we see are very sickly and have small or used up veins) and that I feel like they are expecting me to preform as well as the other employees since we keep getting backed up and they desperately need help keeping the wait time down. I was told this was supposed to be a learning experience and this was the time to learn and improve my technique, but I feel like I'm not getting enough feedback and instruction on my actual sticking, but maybe that's just a normal feeling. 

Is it normal to feel this way? How long did it take yall to get comfortable sticking most patients? I really want to do a great job and make my bosses proud but I feel like I'm just letting people down (I know they same I'm doing well or fine and a lot of the time I get compliments from patients but when they are a hard stick I just feel defeated.) I'm getting most of my sticks but if they are very very old or sick I probably have a 50_75% chance at getting blood and that just kills me. Also any advice that you have would be more than appreciated."

So, there is this guy in my masters program, we're both assigned to a field research and end up working together and that went on well.
When the research was done we went our separate ways (no friends in common), some days later he texted me just asking how I was doing and from that point forward we started exchanging lots of texts.
One day he invites me to this party with a bunch of his friends that I never talked to, so I declined (I'm very shy and always think that everyone will just dislike me) but invited him for a coffee some other day. 
We went for the coffee and hangout a few other times (movies and lunches together). And he always texted a lot. But each time we went out it was never actually a date neither he ever made a move, which got me thinking he just wants to be friends. 
Eventually I had to go do my internship in another state, 10+ hours away, but we kept in touch, he would send me texts and photos of the city asking if I missed it and when I would visit, and I always gave friendly answers because I thought that's all he wanted.
Anyways this situation goes on for a while and I mentioned I wanted to go to this music festival and he asked when was it, I answered and asked if he would like to go with me (I kinda was thinking he would say no because we have a completely different taste in music and the festival was in another state) and surprisingly he said yes, that he would love to go.
And so we went and spent a really good time, but still no moves and I'm really shy so I couldn't make any move on him either.
Later on we had both to leave for our states and at this point I am really sad because I really like him and am well aware that we won't be seeing each other any time soon.
And so he texted saying he really enjoyed seeing me again and that the festival wasn't as bad as he thought it would. And I answered that his company was great and I was happy to know he liked it.
Now, after a few more texts it all just kinda fade away and I don't know what to think. Was he ever interested? If yes, why has he faded away now? Should I invest in him knowing that I still have two more months of internship and so we won't be able to see each other during this period? Or am I just imagining things and he only sees me as a friend? Should I let things stay as they are and lose touch? 
I really like him."

Intern being a loose term as I was the only qualified db admin/sys admin/system architect in my division. It was quite bad to the point where I had two people working for me, as an intern. 

The job was rough,  the pay was shit,  the hours long and the management was hellish. I was making about 44k/yr working 60 hour weeks while working on an engineering degree full time. This went on for two years,  at which point I graduated and was set to convert to full time. 

Except,  as I found out,  I wouldn't be converted to full time. My manager made me the following offer. 40k/yr as an intern for one more year. And they'd be so kind to settle all of the paperwork to make this happen(against the company by laws. Interns had to be active college students) . 

So,  I took another offer at a different company and told them that I would be leaving. 

And this is where my petty revenge begins. See,  as I found out,  my manager was not in power to make me that offer. Moreover,  the department was not in a position where they could afford to loose me. So,  once they realized what has been done they freaked out and started making me new,  better offers. 

Anything I asked, I would have approved in two hours. By my manager,  director of engineering and recruiting. 5k sign on? Sure. 75k/yr?sure. Better benefits coverage? Great..  5 year tenure? You got it. Two extra weeks of pto for the first five years? Yes sir. 

I made the department head,  the manager,  the director of engineering and the vp of engineering spend roughly 40 hours on the phone discussing and approving all of my demand. 
And when they had crafted a deal so great I'd be crazy to turn down... I turned it down. It was the best deal offered to an intern in the 90 year history of the company,  and I turned it down. At which point a new round of calls began by HR trying to figure out why it was turned out,  what the problem was and who the culprits were at failing to keep me at work. From what I understand,  it was hell for all involved but me. 

Oh and to add the cherry on top,  I wore the shirt of my new employer to my exit interview,  revealing it mid interview. Just to achieve the maximum pettiness.

3b0h0j,1,2015-06-24,At a Crossroad,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3b0h0j/at_a_crossroad/,"As the title says, I have come to a crossroad.  

First some background on me.  I am a 36 year with a wife and a child and 1 on the way.  I just recently got into the accounting profession and only have 4 years of experience.  I decided that it was time that I took my career to a new level so I recently started studying for my CPA.  If all goes well, I should be CPA certified by December.  

My current pay is 55k and I work at a not for profit.  Due to the nature of the business, I don't see many opportunities for promotions or raises in the future and at my age I don't want to wait around. I believe that in December, after I finish my CPA and we introduce the new member to our family, it is time for me to start looking for a new job with a higher salary.

My questions are as follows:

Are there going to be positions available for me in Public accounting firms that won't require intense busy seasons?  I have heard stories of CPAs working 55 hours max during busy season and I don't want to spend all my time at work when I have 2 young children at home.  Also, can I land a job for about 65k a year in a Public Accounting Firm, I'm in New York, with my 4 years experience and a CPA license?

Secondly, if I decide to stay away from Public Accounting, how much weight will my CPA certification hold when I have no Public Accounting experience other than a 6 month internship?  

Thanks in advance!

3b0ilr,1,2015-06-24,"How do I [23 F] deal with my verbally abusive mother [44 F], it's getting absolutely unbearable?",smxckmybxtchup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3b0ilr/how_do_i_23_f_deal_with_my_verbally_abusive/,"Ever since I can remember, my mother has been extremely aggressive and verbally abusive. She wants to control everything and everyone around her, even when it comes to the smallest, pettiest things. But it's always been bearable. Sort of. I often doubt myself and am a chronic pessimist thanks to her. And now you ask me ""Why do you let it get to you?"". Just keep reading, you'll find out.


Anyway... recently, a series of negative events in my education (not my fault, I ripped myself a new asshole studying and the professor is an extremely immature 40 years old man, so he fucks us all over on purpose) have been accumulating and have placed an even bigger strain on our relationship. 


Whenever money is involved, my mother gets very, very serious. To the point of pettiness. 


I'm an immigrant in a very shitty southern European country (my parents and I are from an equally shitty Eastern European country) and students here pay mad money for education. If you fail a class, you pay double. Fail it again, you pay triple. And so on and on... it can go up to a 1000 euros per class (and yes, this is a public university I'm talking about). This is where our problems come from.


The unemployment rate among young people here is ridiculously high. But I still keep trying to find a job because I believe that you can find anything if you look hard enough. I'm at a point where I need to look for an internship already... I get called for interviews, they hear my accent (which gets worse when I'm nervous but is still perfectly understandable) and never call me again even though they initially seemed very interested in my skills and languages, especially since people here do not tend to even learn English properly. But maybe they didn't like something else in me or my behaviour, those are just the observations I gathered. 


Why am I telling you this? Well, no job = no money. The government does not help students and universities (public or private) try their best to fuck their students over in order to obtain more income. I have been failed for absolutely no reason at all, even though my exam was impeccable. Just fml. But Eastern European parents are very similar to the stereotypical Asian parents. It's ALWAYS your fault, no matter what, never the professor's.


Again, I'm trailing off... So, it's come to a point in which I get daily verbal abuse and I can't do anything to prevent it. She would attack me a few times a day after work. I can't ignore her, pretend to listen or calmly agree with a smile on my face like my friends have suggested. I have tried it all. 


She would not leave me alone until she has me screaming back at her. She would follow me around the whole flat trying to antagonise me. She admitted to liking it; she likes making me feel like shit because she thinks I deserve it. I get insulted, blamed, attacked and from time to time, she would even hit me/slap me. 


I am trying my hardest to find a job to get out of this situation. But it's really hard. No kind of job without any experience can even pay rent here. And I can't go to another country where I know my skills would be better appreciated (I applied for internships and positions in northern countries and I even got the job in a few occasions, just to see if maybe I seemed like a really shitty person, thus my trouble finding employment here) because I have no money. I fully depend on my parents financially and they do not ever put more than a hundred euros in my account because they truly believe I will run away. 


The abuse is daily and now has turned nightly. If I go out all day and come home late at night in order to avoid it all, she will get out of bed specifically to attack me again for whatever the hell I did.


I got nowhere else to go (most people are just forced to live with their parents here as jobs don't pay much), I got two semesters left to graduate (which seems like a shit ton of time under all this pressure) and I feel like I'm going to die. What do I do? Help me. Help. I can't handle this. My mental health is strongly deteriorating. It's really bad. And I have really bad thoughts, like it's never going to get better for me because of the shit luck I've had in life so far.

And yes, I have tried sitting her down and reasoning with her. No, it does not work. I got attacked again.
   

**tl;dr**: Mother won't stop verbally and sometimes physically abusing me because of a class I failed no matter what technique I apply to avoid the confrontation. Won't stop until I'm crying or screaming."

I'm really fucking do it.,sofakingdone,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/3b0n4h/im_doing_it_im_really_fucking_do_it/,"September of 2013 I was starting my senior year at my third college and beginning to realize just how far behind the curve I was in planning my future.  Planning my future at the time meant stocking up the fridge with enough booze saturday because the liquor stores would be closed sunday and I didn't have the funds to afford drinking at a bar for a night.  I hadn't taken the advice that everyone was telling me to get an internship because thats the way to get a job.  I started to panic as I sat in my apartment realizing that come may I would have to move back home because I hadn't looked for a job at all and had no qualifications other than a diploma I wasn't so sure that I was going to receive.

A woman came into one of my night classes and talked to us seniors saying that her company was hiring and anyone with any interest should come speak with her after class.  I jotted down her name and company to find her email address later.  I was wasted and couldn't have my first impression be liquor breath and inability to form a complete sentence. I'd email her tomorrow. Totally. Definitely. Absolutely. I had no choice.

Three weeks later I mustered up the courage to send her a short email, and she immediately set up an interview for the next week. Awesome, here's some hope.  I missed the interview because it was at 9am and I had passed out around 4am and wasn't conscious until about 9.  Shit, guess thats over. Fuck it, it was a pipedream anyways.

Then a series of events transpired unrelated to this and I became sober. 

I still moved back home, but was taking any advice I could get to heart.  I made a rockstar resume.  I applied to roughly 100 positions a week.  I was networking with my friends' parents and getting business cards.  I wasn't drinking. I was focused and determined when everything seemed to be falling apart.

Then I got a fucking job. I got a legit, college-kid, job.  Full time, 8-5, benefits.  It took a year after graduating to finally nail it down but I fucking nailed it.

I started that job a month ago.  I moved to a place 400 miles away from home by myself where I knew nobody and had no connections.  I've been going to meetings regularly and have started to make some connections with individuals.  I'm eating healthy, kicking ass at work, and excited about my future.

September 2013 me didn't know what a future was.  I was terrified of everything and numbed myself every night hoping tomorrow wouldn't come.  Every morning I'd wake up and my first thought would be ""fuck, not this again"".  It seems like so long ago but I remember exactly how terrifying and hopeless life was.  Things didn't come easy. They didn't change quickly. I had to put in alot of work when I thought the work was hopeless and stay true to what I believed.  

I can say that I'm happy today.  Truly honestly happy and content with the person I've started to turn into.  I'm excited for my future.  Its fucking surreal at times, and I still have wicked lows but I know how to deal with them and they are always followed by some awesome highs from life.  I don't know what I'm doing.  But I'm fucking doing it the right way now."

   I had been friends with her since freshman year of high school and she was one of the first girls I could be open and say whatever I wanted to say with. Since day one of meeting her I thought she was very pretty (I don't think I look that attractive, not big or anything but I do do a college sport now), so I knew I couldn't really have a chance with her. I went throughout all of high school without having a girlfriend while she went through quite a few boyfriends. I was perfectly fine going without a high school relationship because to me they always seemed so dumb.

   The summer before our freshman year of college, her then boyfriend broke up with her. I only realized this because one day in July she texted me asking if I had a hot tub (I do and just got one) and wanted to hang out in my later that day in it. I was really shocked and thinking to myself ""wtf there is no way this is happening"" So then I asked her I our mutual friend should come too and she said no. So at this point I'm living an unreal day and I haven't even seen her. We had dinner and when we got back to my house she asked me if I had a girlfriend and I told her no so then she asked if I wanted to make out because she said she always thought I was hot and always wanted to. 

  The rest of the summer we hung out maybe like every other day or so and went on dates but I made it clear to her that I intended to stay single going into college. One day near the end of the summer, we were hanging out and she told me that one of her other guy friends asked her out and she told him she would think about it. Really she just told me that if I don't ask her out then she will take this other guy up on his offer. So then I thought of what the heck, I'll give it a shot and we started dating. We had sex a few times and it was really good, like insanely amazing.

   I went away to college, about an hour away from us, and she stayed home and went to a local university. The first week I wasn't really talking to her as much as I should have so she called me and told me she doesn't think it will work out and I told her that I'd talk to her more and this time I'd try to make it work. We agreed to stay together. That night while I was in bed I was trying to think if I really made the right decision. After literal hours of thinking about her I realized that she's perfect in every way for me and that's all I wanted. I started writing to her in the mail and she loved it. I didn't know how I got so lucky.

  She drove up almost every weekend to see me for my first two years of college. Her coming up with literally the best part of the week. For the first few months she didn't tell her parents we were dating because she wanted to sleep over at my place (she told them she was sleeping at a friends house). I didn't think that she did anything wrong for doing this but it still made me feel kinda bad. 
   The first time I ever was upset at her (freshman year October) was when her and her long time guy friend got tickets to a show that I really wanted to go to. I felt hurt that she didn't invite me but I didn't want to have a fight so I just brushed it aside.

  The next few months were really good until February. We were driving somewhere in the car and a band came on and she said ""Me and Dan are going to see them next month!"" She said that he bought the tickets and she was really excited. I was pretty upset but I thought that well hey it's just one night so I won't make it into an ordeal. Dan, fake name, was her boss who I think is two years older than us. I didn't like him from the first time I heard about him because our first summer together she told me how he would try scooting closer to her at dinner when they went out with friends or even putting his arm around her which she would brush him off. I had and still do have a hard time believing that Dan didn't want to get with her. I may be wrong but I'm not willing to drop $45 on a friend to go to a concert with me unless I wanted something. Also, on facebook this dude literally liked every single one of her posts and even the articles that she liked, if it popped up on her homepage he would hit the like button.
   
 Anyway, after the concert she knew something was up with me so I told her how uncomfortable I was with him and wanted to meet him. She agreed that it was fair for me to meet him and told me if he ever wanted to hang out she'd be sure to bring me. I was cool after knowing I would meet him soon.
  
   I spent six weeks of the summer away on an internship while she had an internship at home. We talked non stop and missed each other so bad. We decided that the next summer neither of us would apply to anything far away. 
   
  One night the next fall semester, she was sleeping with me in my bunk and I had to get up and go to the bathroom (the dorm I lived in had community bathrooms so I had to put sandals on before going in there.) I couldn't find my sandals and my phone with the flashlight app was up on top of my bunk. I grabbed her phone and used it. I was walking to the bathroom and noticed that Dan had texted her past midnight (it was on the unlock screen). This was messed up to me because before we went to sleep that night I asked if he said anything to her recently and she told me that she hasn't heard from him in weeks. Knowing this I went through the texts with him and almost every night he texted her goodnight. Also, the week before, she drove me to my roommates house where he then would drive me back. I told her to tell me when she got back home and she said she would. It turned out that she went out to dinner with Dan and when she got there she told me she was home. I confronted her as soon as I got back and neither of us could sleep the rest of the night.
    
 The next morning she asked if I still wanted her and I told her I did but she couldn't lie to me anymore and she agreed. I had to do something with my club the next day (she was going to drive me home) and when I saw her around noon she was yelling at me telling me I'm so insecure. She flipped it around on me so fast. I told her I never intended to go through her phone but that the text was on the lock screen, but I ended up agreeing with her and told her I wouldn't do that again.
     
 I even went to my schools free therapy to try to get better and not worry so much about things she does with guys like Dan. I told her I was going and she was very supportive of me.
     
Everything was then great again for a while but one night when cramming for a test I went on facebook and saw Dan was still liking all of her statuses. We Skyped the next day and I told her how weird I thought he was for still doing that. She kinda laughed and told me how she heard through Dan and her's mutual friend that Dan threw a New Year's party and everyone else wanted my girlfriend to go but Dan said ""no because she'll probably want to bring her boyfriend."" I blew a fuse at this because I still had not been introduced to him and she was letting this other guy, in my eyes, hit on her. I told her that she needed to tell him to back off or else maybe we shouldn't be together.
    
She was devastated that I gave her an ultimatum and within the next day or so, I felt terrible because I didn't want to ever lose her. I apologized and told her I would never do it again. She agreed to make sure that I actually meet him this time.
    
 At the end of our sophomore spring semester (this past April), I told her how I probably wouldn't be able to see her that much because I needed to study for my dental school exam. She understood and I made time for her every night all of May. I don't want to say that I felt something was off but I was feeling a little unsettled about our relationship because I knew I wasn't giving her 100%, but instead I was so focused and stressed about my upcoming test. I joked with her about how she was going to break up with me after I failed the test.
    
  I took the test on the last day of May and did great! She and her family were very excited for me. The very next day she told me that she didn't feel too good about the relationship because of our last fight and how I was acting the whole last month. I told her that I was still so sorry for the fight and would never give her an ultimatum again and that I was so stressed and didn't think so clearly during the last month so I was sure I wasn't all there after studying. 
    
 First week of June rolls around and I change to always want to see her and do things with her. She did hang out with me but would tell me while we were hanging out that she made plans later in the night (which she never used to do). I told her it was ok because I had been neglecting my high school friends for quite a while especially while studying. 
   
 She wanted me to come to her friends little sister's family party so I went and for about three hours I said five sentences to the group of her friends (5 girls). I would try to chime in where I could and ask her friends what they were doing for the summer but I only got like minimal responses from them and all they talked about was people that I didn't know from their old school. I didn't mind this because I usually already don't talk to them too much. They all had a sleepover that night so I left the party and went and hung out with my friends.
    
 The next morning she tells me we need to talk. Then she comes over and says ""I think we should break up, I don't know, maybe a break, I'm not sure."" She said she didn't love me like she used to. But to me that's only because of how stressed I have become. I was completely in shock and was feeling so sick in my stomach. I told her that I always wanted her to be happy and if she wanted to leave then she could. She left and we didn't work out if we were on a break or just done so I asked her the next day and she told me she didn't know. I asked if she wanted to go out to lunch or dinner in a few weeks and she said yes. I didn't talk to her for two weeks when last week I asked if she wanted to go out to dinner still and she told me she didn't think it was a good idea anymore. My heart dropped and I felt so bad for about the next hour, then she texts me and asks how my new job is. I tell her about it and she responds with a few pages of texts. She was on vacation with her family but was texting me for a large portion of it. We were talking about funny things that were happening and about things in our past. We still text every day but it is me that initiates the conversations.
   
  I have been reading this part of reddit a lot and everyone says no contact to get over her but trust me when I say that it won't work for me. My job entails a 8 to 4 job where I have to get up early and commute, ALL of my friends work jobs that they start around 5 and go all night (restaurants). Every day I am exhausted when I get home and none of my friends are open so it's not like I can do things to take my mind off her. I also work out every day but I don't feel better.
   
 Someone already gave me the advice to look at it from a third person's perspective and I did and I would want someone who truly loves another to not stop unless they were either given a second chance or told to not contact them again. She truly is the person I want to be with for the rest of my life. 

  I just want to get people's opinions on the whole relationship and if anyone has suggestions for me to do. We had a very loving relationship and always talked about getting married and going on vacations and spending time together. It was perfect.
 
  What makes things worse for me is that THREE of my friends have been through the same thing in the last few months and they all got back together with their girlfriends. Maybe it's something in the water here. Right now I'm taking it slow because I want to try to re-date her, and get a trial relationship in. I want to know that if I really don't make her happy then I'd stop and find someone else, but right now I can't.

**tl;dr**: After a few fights over the same guy I gave my ex an ultimatum and she told me she never quite recovered from it. I was withdrawn the last month of our relationship due to a test I had to take and she ended it with me because she said she didn't love me like she used to. "
3b1amp,6,2015-06-25,I was told my case was appropriate for this subreddit... May I present you... my controlling mother!,smxckmybxtchup,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/3b1amp/i_was_told_my_case_was_appropriate_for_this/,"Ever since I can remember, my mother has been extremely aggressive and verbally abusive. She wants to control everything and everyone around her, even when it comes to the smallest, pettiest things. But it's always been bearable. Sort of. I often doubt myself and am a chronic pessimist thanks to her. And now you ask me ""Why do you let it get to you?"". Just keep reading, you'll find out.


Anyway... recently, a series of negative events in my education (not my fault, I ripped myself a new asshole studying and the professor is an extremely immature 40 years old man, so he fucks us all over on purpose) have been accumulating and have placed an even bigger strain on our relationship.


Whenever money is involved, my mother gets very, very serious. To the point of pettiness.


I'm an immigrant in a very shitty southern European country (my parents and I are from an equally shitty Eastern European country) and students here pay mad money for education. If you fail a class, you pay double. Fail it again, you pay triple. And so on and on... it can go up to a 1000 euros per class (and yes, this is a public university I'm talking about). This is where our problems come from.


The unemployment rate among young people here is ridiculously high. But I still keep trying to find a job because I believe that you can find anything if you look hard enough. I'm at a point where I need to look for an internship already... I get called for interviews, they hear my accent (which gets worse when I'm nervous but is still perfectly understandable) and never call me again even though they initially seemed very interested in my skills and languages, especially since people here do not tend to even learn English properly. But maybe they didn't like something else in me or my behaviour, those are just the observations I gathered.


Why am I telling you this? Well, no job = no money. The government does not help students and universities (public or private) try their best to fuck their students over in order to obtain more income. I have been failed for absolutely no reason at all, even though my exam was impeccable. Just fml. But Eastern European parents are very similar to the stereotypical Asian parents. It's ALWAYS your fault, no matter what, never the professor's.


Again, I'm trailing off... So, it's come to a point in which I get daily verbal abuse and I can't do anything to prevent it. She would attack me a few times a day after work. I can't ignore her, pretend to listen or calmly agree with a smile on my face like my friends have suggested. I have tried it all.


She would not leave me alone until she has me screaming back at her. She would follow me around the whole flat trying to antagonise me. She admitted to liking it; she likes making me feel like shit because she thinks I deserve it. I get insulted, blamed, attacked and from time to time, she would even hit me/slap me.


I am trying my hardest to find a job to get out of this situation. But it's really hard. No kind of job without any experience can even pay rent here. And I can't go to another country where I know my skills would be better appreciated (I applied for internships and positions in northern countries and I even got the job in a few occasions, just to see if maybe I seemed like a really shitty person, thus my trouble finding employment here) because I have no money. I fully depend on my parents financially and they do not ever put more than a hundred euros in my account because they truly believe I will run away.


The abuse is daily and now has turned nightly. If I go out all day and come home late at night in order to avoid it all, she will get out of bed specifically to attack me again for whatever the hell I did.


I got nowhere else to go (most people are just forced to live with their parents here as jobs don't pay much), I got two semesters left to graduate (which seems like a shit ton of time under all this pressure) and I feel like I'm going to die. What do I do? Help me. Help. I can't handle this. My mental health is strongly deteriorating. It's really bad. And I have really bad thoughts, like it's never going to get better for me because of the shit luck I've had in life so far.


And yes, I have tried sitting her down and reasoning with her. No, it does not work. I got attacked again.


**tl;dr:** Mother won't stop verbally and sometimes physically abusing me because of a class I failed no matter what technique I apply to avoid the confrontation. Won't stop until I'm crying or screaming."

I have a one year old son and a wife, so safety is more important than anything else. We are looking to rent, probably maximum of $1400 per month for at least a 2 bed 1 bath, but preferably 3/2 if possible. I would also prefer a maximum of 30m commute, but will extend it if necessary.

Thanks for any help!

EDITS: If it helps, here is some extra info about my situation. Dog friendly is a must, as we have a Miniature German Shepherd we can not part with. Family friendly is #1 on my list. In a town with some parks or places to walk our dog would be welcome, but not essential to start off my life in MD. If you happen to know, Daycare friendly. My wife runs a daycare, so it would be awesome for her to start it in MD. Finally, Corvias sadly isn't an option as they told me they don't have openings for interns."

I'm at a homeless shelter for my practicum. My PI -- a QLCSW -- is nice and kind and caring but over-worked. He's got about 50 people under him so my day to day is spent answering to someone else. We shall call him the SwoleBeast, since he's often getting prison swole and juicing.  

Dude is a rough operator in recovery without even an AA. (How he runs a program at one of only two homeless shelters in the city, I don't know...) I guess he used to wash toilets at the shelter before being in charge of the lives of vulnerable people. Nothing wrong with any of those things, but worth mentioning for background. He's been in the position for about three years. The person before him was an MSW and left under odd circumstances. He was living with her while washing toilets at the shelter and suddenly a lot of her money went missing and she resigned. These are known facts all the staff at the shelter *I have spoken to about him* acknowledges. 

Now here is my quandary. About a month ago, a huge hideous painting in an office went missing for about five minutes. Turns out he got it from an ex-girlfriend and he views it as a symbol of his sobriety. 
It was moved by my PI who enjoys playing games. I guess his first degree in rec therapy predisposes him to hijinx. Anyway, the SwoleBeast thought it was me and he's been treating me
Like rubbish ever since. A week earlier in a meeting about a client I insisted that no matter what he wants, a client's responsible desires supersede his own. All the staff there agreed, including our boss, Loki, QLCSW. 
 I ignored the glares and disdain. I ignored him inviting everyone else out to lunch or calling people to offer to bring them something back. I chalk it up to my status as an intern, because the other people in the office are BSWs who got hired. 
And frankly, I don't mind much. Haters gonna hate. Except that my clients are suffering. I need to find them transitional housing or job training or whatever, and he doesn't cooperate. For example, phone messages won't be delivered; faxes will be thrown away; forms don't get filled out on time.
So now I can't do my job, and a client who should have been housed a month ago is only now leaving the shelter.
So, what do I do? "

I have posted here before on another account.


I am a hardcore gamer, as in I used to play way too much I still do play but not as much. In December 2013 at 04:00am in the morning I was playing Minecraft online and I met this girl. Now often you will meet really young girls on minecraft so it wasn’t like I was instantly flirting, plus I am not that kind of guy. I have always seen myself as a respectful person especially towards  females.

So This girl and I start talking over Minecraft and I enjoy her company, she then told me that she is a similar age to me. I am 18 she is 16 almost 17. She told me her real name and I find her on facebook and we started talking. Not a lot, only about once or twice a week. We had a lot in common so we got along very well. 

After a month or so we started talking more and more to the point that we would talk from the time she was awake to the point I had to go to sleep. Keep in mind that there is a 8 hour time difference. She lives somewhere in America and I live somewhere in Africa. So we could only really talk from 03:00pm to 12:00am, and that is what we did every day for about a month. 
I realised that I liked her, and I know she liked me. I was really uncomfortable with the idea of a long distance relationship. Keep in mind I was still in school at the time with no job and I wouldn’t ( still haven’t) have been able to go see her due to a lack of funds. I tried to avoid getting into a relationship with her   but we obviously liked each other too much. In May 2014 we realised that we both loved each other very much. We would spend upto 8 hours on skype playing minecraft together and just chatting about what ever.

She told me that I was the first guy that she had ever met that hadn’t asked her to send nude pics within the first 10 mins. Knowing this girl for 4 months I had never asked or hinted for nude pics (apparently that she found that attractive) well it seemed all was going to be perfect, I would arrange to see her the next year (2015) and we could be in a relationship. Stupid me thinking the world is so simple. 

One night we were talking over whatsapp and our conversations were getting pretty sexy, lets just say nude pics were shared. A month later her mom found them, took her phone and laptop away and I couldn’t speak to her again. Another month down the line (july 2014) She got her phone and laptop back. Obviously we continued talking, behind her parents backs. In November (2014) we’re caught exchanging nude pics again and her phone was taken away again. Her parents had the phone camera disabled, but she still wasn’t allowed to talk to me. Well... she continued talking to me in January this year. 

I often was scared that our relationship was only sexual, but I realised that I enjoyed talking to this girl even though I have not received a nude pic in 6 months. I know now that I really do love her and I love spending time with her. 

I had sent multiple letters to her parents but her parents just seem to think that if they ignore me that I will disappear from the face of the earth and stop talking to their daughter. I feel really bad for being so devious and going behind their backs like this. 

Now you’re probably wondering why I still haven’t gone to see her this year, as was the plan last year. Well since I have just finished high school I am not exactly rolling in cash, I couldn’t find a decent job in the small town I live in. I did however find a really cool internship opportunity at a school. Yes a school.(I enjoy working with children) This school is really small and emphasizes a small student to teacher ratio. I teach computers and coach various physical activities. Being an internship i don’t get paid much but I have gained lots of valuable experience. And with that experience I hope to land my self a job in an American summer camp next year. The ball is rolling and it seems I will have a job in the same state as my girlfriend. 

Today I wrote her parents an email explaining everything, apologizing and trying to arrange a meeting over skype to apologize face to face. I just hope they don’t ignore me again. 

Many times I thought I would never hear from her again, but I did. Often I thought about giving up because it felt like every force in the world was against me being with this girl that I love so much. 


I am sorry this is so long, I just thought I would share. In my opinion, if you really love someone, you won’t ever give up on them. 

Lastly I want anyone that happens to read this that is thinking of going into a LDR to know; it's not easy and there is a high level of trust required for it to work.

3b20cu,0,2015-06-25,Volunteer writers needed for a new type of men's magazine,RussRamster,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/3b20cu/volunteer_writers_needed_for_a_new_type_of_mens/,"Hello journalists and journalism enthusiasts. 

Roughly 6 months ago I had the idea to create a new type of magazine directed at men.


Lad magazines focus on tits and giggles, while men’s magazines focus on expensive watches, suits and cars. So basically what they provide is superficial filth or in the best case scenario, quasi-intellectualism. 


The world is fighting for equality on a lot of fronts, and I wish to fight for gender equality. My magazine will be directed towards young men, ages 15-30. The main focus will be gender-equality from a male’s perspective. Other subjects will be your usual light subjects that most men care about, such as technology or sports. The magazine will also have a fashion section. So that’s going to be a-ma-zing!


My struggle is finding some writers. You don’t have to be an experienced journalist. You can be a student in any field, or maybe you had a blog, or just a passion for reading and writing. I’d also like to find some people with an entrepreneurial mindset, so that maybe one day, this online magazine could become a proper publication. 


So, if you enjoy writing, tell me. If you are passionate about politics, psychology, medicine, science, social issues, music, sports or fashion, tell me. Male or female, everyone is welcome. The only thing you must have is an open mind. I am also looking for some photographers. You will have full creative power over your own work.


About myself: 23 year old marketing student, both parents are journalists at a small town newspaper, I had a small period when I wrote for a newspaper myself. I like sunshine, rainbows and fairness. High standards are a priority when it comes to journalism.


Feel free to ask questions. 


EDIT: I am not doing this for money. In fact, you might understand the concept better as a collective of bloggers. I don't expect many people to understand, but I believe in this cause and don't want to just write alone. I know I am a douche for even mentioning free writing, especially when I know how bad it was for myself to do it as a full-time intern, and how bad it was for my parents when the newspaper was struggling to pay employees.

Little backround, I am (22M) Living in kansas city, Been here 6 months. Since coming here to support my girlfriend, I have went into a super depressive state. I have gained 40lbs (after losing 100 over the past year from being overweight now im overweight again) and found i was getting anxiety just walking out the door again. I made strides to improve myself and not get in a rut by going to the library for a hour every other day. So i can learn and not feel as if I am having a hard time with living on my own. This month of June I was told by my parents who were lending a hand to our rent that they would be stopping at this month and I would be taking care of July rent. Which meant one thing JOB! Now I have been battling a work trigger/anxiety for 6 years now (which actually made me have good cry over it last night because i cant believe ive struggled this long without being able to support myself) The anxiety lies at the base when i was working a bussing shift at the age of 16 (working 35 hours plus highschool) I broke out in my first panic attack. Depersonalization, crying, thought loops the whole nine yards. The reason i found for that was, I had just gotten in for my shift, the previous person left two large parties I had to clean and i had a million other things on my mind. I forgot to mention i was fighting a possession charge over 2oz of Cannabis I had picked up for a friend because it was his birthday 
WRONG PLACE WRONG TIME SITUATION. (That i was sure i was going to jail, but luckily did not)  I ended up having a breakdown before work the next day, and having a noshow nocall because i was deathly afraid of the repercussion from this, I mean 8 months i was fine never experienced anything like this. And then a bomb went off and everything in me came down and ive been picking it up randomly ever since. I went to speak with my supervisor the next day, and to my best efforts to explain to her she fired me. Now this isnt some job i just randomly walked into and got, THIS is the job my father worked and was working still for 19years. A busser at this establishment for 19years. And because i had ONE panic attack that i left them hanging on this lady decided to fire me. Now my father of course had to keep working and said he was sorry that happened, and he couldnt do anything about it. From that day forward my life changed, Everytime i would look for a job or get a job I would seize up from the minute i got there. My head racing, wondering about all the things that could go wrong. I ended up leaving 9 jobs on the first week in my first 3 years of trying. Then i gave up because i just didnt know how to break this barrier. I was exhausted at trying to work at these stores then freaking out, and having a trigger in place then if i went back. It made me avoid things while driving in my home town to not even buying groceries because i had walked out of the job i had there. I get so embarrassed that my actions do this and i freak out with no clear way of helping it and leave. I have been to 8 therapists/psychologists before i was 21, They taught me CBT, and calming down techniques but never helped me get to the root of this thing. All made bad efforts at helping in the end. And with not having a income all these years I have not been able to afford anything for myself. I have not gotten any assistance other then my parents (who are both under 40K salaries) which makes them hurt even more because they cant support a 22 year old man anymore.  This year has been my one year ive bucked up and moved to a whole new city, cut back extensively on my pot use(Still a user 4-5times a week. I have been Addicted to that shit since i was 12) AND found myself 3 jobs all while here. I am making super progress on some of my anxieties! As per usual though i have left those jobs from day one to three. I reverted back to having panic about being physically drained, and not knowing anyone to being uncomfortable in a work environment. Now i am left with one week to come up with 500$, and no where to turn. I guess I come to you guys to rant that little thing off my chest because i just have been not able to deal with it. I have to take my girlfriend to her internship now (no paid) she works part time at a nursery 300$ a month maybe on a good month. So I must cut this short, And excuse me for being such a scatter brain! I ask for advice, help, anything you can throw at me to maybe help me see a better light! 

PS&gt;I have a consular that is really bad right now and i have not got the balls yet to say i need another person to guide me. But all in all I am learning DBT there and trying to apply those skills as well. "

Basically, almost all my job experience and contacts are related to my (previous) family business but I'd rather distance myself from that field for now so first things first, need to find a place to stay... probably a room share with some other peeps but not quite sure if I can find a place that'll be available like... tomorrow (visit-&gt;like the place-&gt;pay rent-&gt;move in).

Then need to find a job that pays okay in the mean time. Also, currently on indefinite leave from college (final year) since stuff happened, and this happened, and I've got no money to pay tuition... anyways, not too sure about things as I've NEVER held a job (just an internship) here in the Philippines so not sure so sure about requirements. Probably prefer something that will allow me to get some units for college at the same time (only a few more units till graduation, but yeah, need to earn money first). If I go get an NBI Clearance, SSS number, and a TIN number by myself (registering as a ""Professional""), will that speed up the hiring process? Or should I rely on the company for these things? As far as I know, a nightshift call center job would be ideal for my needs, but I'm not so sure... Advice? Requirement? Referrals?

I am currently a Sophomore going into my Junior year working on a BS in CS and I'm hoping to get more into security and penetration testing but I am currently at a loss for where to go to learn more.



I have gotten an internship at a fairly large retail company in their IT security team but this has not really helped me learn anything more about the field or how to prepare myself, I have simply been doing tickets and working on a project to teach end users more about security and the ""human firewall"". Outside of work, however, I have been doing my best to scour the internet to learn what I can. I have been doing work with webgoat, kali (and most of the top tools included in it), tweeter (sql injection), and a few other tools. I've spent some time learning python, ruby and objective-c in an attempt to gain some deeper knowledge. I've also watched quite a few videos from security conferences (shout out to irongeek.com for hosting all of these!) but this does not really give me any sort of hands on experience. I just found out about overthewire and I will be starting on some of the levels whenever time permits. I've done work with Vbox and setting up some labs and I have managed to break metasploitable and parts of DVL. Last but not least, I've tried to get into ctf365 but I just am not at the level where anything that I can do is good enough. Which brings me to my next part.



I guess from this point on I am a bit lost as to where to move to next. I have been looking into GPEN and the PWK course in an attempt to learn more as my university does not provide any good security courses. Are those beneficial for someone like me? I have tried to learn more about protocols but all the books that I have tried to read are just so damn dry. I have some connections into a large security company that I can talk to if that would be beneficial. 



What do you guys think? I'm really open to most anything as I am just at a loss on how to really learn more. I feel like right now I am at a point where everything that I am doing is just learning HOW to do these things, not really learning the WHY or gaining any useful knowledge.



Thanks!

o	Start an image
o	Login and copy a file from FTP
o	Logout 
o	Stop the image

I've been working away at this for a week now and whenever I try to write a script it fails, but getting help is like flinging my brain into a wall of text which looks very suspiciously like gibberish (but probably actually isn't because others seem to know what the hell is going on). I also need to mention that I JUST STARTED USING POWERSHELL. If any of you could help, that would be quite awesome, but please try to write it so I understand what you're writing about.

tl;dr I just started a job. They need me to use powershell. I've never used powershell. I very much don't want to get fired for my incompetence. Please help.

EDIT!
So as was mentioned in a reply, I didn't provide examples of my code. I've attempted to write the script many times, but my most recent try is just trying to put an image into a vm. I'm taking one step at a time...with very small baby steps...Anyway I'm putting the code I wrote below. If it sucks, please give me some tips...with minimal criticism...but feel free to criticize if it's necessary to my improvement.

	I am writing this for two purposes: one is to thank this sub and its great members, the other is to share my story of success from what I thought was the end. 

Background: I am a 19 year old boy from the United States who suffers from a rare heart disorder known as Congenital Heart Block or CHB. CHB occurs in one in every 22000 newborns and has a higher risk of affecting kids of mothers who suffer from Lupus. My disorder causes me to require a pacemaker, throughout my life this never caused me any issues.. until recently. 

Situation: On black Friday 2014 I began to feel not entirely healthy and my heart began to falter. I contacted the hospital and discovered my pacemaker had been in ERI (Electric Replacement Index) mode for a couple weeks. I was hospitalized within a week and was set to receive heart surgery to replace the generator and add a new lead to my heart. This was all going on while I was in my first semester of my freshman year and was working 10-25 hours a week at an internship (the people at my company were great at understanding my medical issues and gave me all the freedom I needed). Needless to say my surgery delayed my schooling, more importantly my finals, until the beginning of 2015 and the start of the spring semester. The notion that preparing for 5 finals, taking 6 classes while also juggling an internship and attempting to please my girlfriend of a year and half would tear me apart never occurred to me. I blindly went into my spring semester with a “I got this” mentality. I prepared for my finals adequately but neglected to pay attention to my spring semester classes and eventually got wrapped up in the pressure from all of my obligations and began to fall off the wagon. I became addicted to drugs and at one point sold my xbox one I got from my parents as a Christmas gift to help fuel my drug addiction. I would snake money into my pocket anyway I could, stealing, lying, selling belongings, making false promises. I have since estimated in a 5 month period I spent 1200$ dollars on drugs. I was a suicidal mess that couldn’t get up in the morning without getting high. I lied to my girlfriend through all of this and claimed I was fine in fear of her leaving me. It wasn’t until one morning when I had just came down from an acid trip that I realized my life was falling apart rapidly and I was going to lose everything if I didn’t act. I called my parents and came clean regarding my lying and drug habits. I told my girlfriend what I had done and explained how I let it get so bad. She was understanding but didn’t think us staying together was a great idea, to which I agreed for pretty good reasons. I was alone to fight my struggles and anxiety for the last month or so of schooling. I was put on a 30mg dosage of celexa that ultimately ended up making me more suicidal and depressed, eventually I stopped taking it. 

Post-realization: I managed to, with the help of this subreddit and close friends, pull together my life and pass all 6 classes! My GPA was not as good as I had hoped but it was enough to keep my financial aid. I have since fixed things with my girlfriend and have worked 40 hours a week throughout the summer so far. I have been seeing a therapist regularly and have started taking propranolol to help stop my anxiety and tremor problems that I developed during the course of the past 6 months or so. Oh, and I also bought a new xbox . 

I am here to say thank you to all the great people who contribute to this great subreddit and, in turn, have helped thousands upon thousands of people with their everyday lives! Live long and prosper my friends.

I am a pre-university (IB) student 17 years old) living in Paris. I would want to apply to UCL, LSE and/or Oxford and I would want to have some work experience. I already am doing a 3 week internship this summer, as well as read up on a lot of material. Just as John D. Rockefeller began almost two hundred years ago, finance and numbers is something that I appreciate and having some bookkeeper experience is something I will value greatly. I understand that I would only be of limited use, but I would love it if you could give me a chance.

Here are reasons why I may interest any of you:

I do not require any pay at all

I have free time

I consider myself very knowledgeable (albeit inexperienced) for my age*

I have a good grasp on Microsoft Excel, Access and other software

I have satisfactory grades: 
near perfect IGCSEs (including ICT HL, Business HL and maths HL)
40 in IB (according to latest report) (including Math SL and Economics HL)

I am willing and able to provide more information as well as evidence that I actually can/did these things.

I would want to participate in accounting, finance, etc. for any of your firms. PM me for further details if you wish so.
I hope I am not sounding too pretentious or arrogant, I am just excited at the prospect of working with entrepreneurs, craving to be one one day. 

PS. I will only work for an actual start-up and/or SME. It will have to be online as I am not able to move away from Paris.

*I have already began investing in the stock market after reading both the II and SA, as well as 'Titan: Rockefeller' and many other books; I have pursued small entrepreneurial ventures and have already worked in a couple of events organising several things. However, I overall lack the experience that you may require of me, and I am willing to compensate by working hard and learning fast, without pay."

Hello! In honor of the second premiere day, I thought I'd create a long form narrative post to provide an example of what the experience of becoming a Big Brother HG might be like, as well as provide some strategic discussion on how to have the 'perfect' first day in the house. Of course, after reading the long-form, if you have any opinions, corrections, suggestions, or any thoughts for that matter, I'd love to hear them either via PM or as a reply, as I'm always excited to hear new information on the process, or any sort of strategic insights that might provide some insights on Big Brother strategy. 

I hope you enjoy!


###**A Narrative of the Casting Process**

&gt; You’ve planned, filmed, and submitted your audition video on the CBS casting website, and for some strange reason a casting intern (who was paid to skim through hundreds of casting submissions) actually liked you!
You had an intense call-back via Skype or phone line service with some underling production person(s), and you didn’t make a complete idiot of yourself – that, or you *did* but they still liked you any ways! 

&gt; Wow, these past few weeks have been a whirlwind – you’ve flown in to sit through countless face-to-face interviews ranging in size and importance, sometimes just with a single producer, and sometimes with fifteen suit-wearing executives whom you assumed own half of California. Why the hell are you still here? America is huge, surely there’s better people to cast than yourself?

&gt; Holy !@#$, &lt;insert producer whom you now know on a first name basis&gt; just called and said you’ve made it! OMG. You can’t tell anyone that this is actually happening, but you still have to make vague arrangements with your school/work/life-partner/dentist to allow for a summer off – good luck with that. 

&gt; Alright, today was your last day of freedom. Production flew out to your hometown and told you to do a scripted packing scenario in your bedroom, then explained you after filming the scene to actually pack up as much clothing as possible (i.e. not just the little bit of clothing that is shown in your suitcase when you did your fake packing). They then drove you out to a location shot that recalls one of your personality/lifestyle gimmicks, whether that be your profession (hospital, police station, garbage truck driver), your hobby (horseback riding, rock climbing, chess player), your lifestyle (church, bar, family get together), or your schooling (chemistry lab, server room, auditorium), and asked you once again to say some scripted stuff. Wow those lines they wrote for you to say were cheesy.

&gt; At the end of a long day (or potentially the next morning), you were shuttled on to a flight alongside your personal wrangler and were flown all the way to the show’s designated sequester hotel. At that hotel, you were kept in a room essentially 24/7 for the next week and a half, with the only interruptions being the occasional meeting with a producer, psychological examinations, questionnaire fill-outs, one hour of gym access per day, press interviews, and a scheduled wrangler discussion time to keep you from complete isolation. When these special events weren’t happening, all you could do was repeatedly have showers at varying temperatures and watch DVDs of season 2, 5, 7, 12, 14, and 16 on the room’s TV, as those were the only seasons they made available. 

&gt; Wow, it’s the day. A producer came in to explain the day’s process, and you’ve said your goodbyes to your wrangler. They’ve given you your premiere wardrobe, and while it’s not exactly what you’d normally wear, you can get used to it. You’ve been placed all alone in a small white dressing room that has a mirror, table, and chair, with the only interruption for the next two hours being a snack drop off and the occasional washroom break. 

&gt; Alright, a wrangler has given you a blind fold, and you have been led to what you guess is side-stage. You bet that all the other blindfolded HGs are all sitting beside you. You are told to get up and are led to a standing location. A voice instructs that when your blindfolds are removed, you are not to walk together to the marked location in center-stage, stand evenly spaced with the tall people in the back and shorter people in the front, to wait for Julie to instruct your next steps, and to not speak until you’ve entered the interior of the house stage. Your blindfold is taken off, and you stand there in line with 6-15 other people (whom could only be the other HGs). After the last HG’s blindfold is removed and a producer gives the final word, someone instructs the group to walk into the stage area, and stop as a group at the marked location. 

&gt; Over the sound system Julie tells the group the usual Big Brother premiere speech, and then begins to call out the HGs names to enter the house.

###**Rules To Having the Perfect First Day in the Big Brother House**

##*Timespan: From entering the house to heading to the bedroom area:*

1.	***Scenario 1: You are called into the house in the first group.*** Try to be the second or third person through the doors, or if there’s no other option, last. Because of the “ladies first” tradition, if you are a woman, try and be 2nd in, and if you are a guy, try to be the first guy, and thus 3rd in (Girl, girl, guy, guy). Being the first person in is cool and all, but there’s a huge expectation for the first person to do a crazy scream jump, and to turn around and hug the second person. The second person in is usually the receiver of the first person’s hug, and is often the person (alongside the third person in) who leads the charge to the bedrooms. The fourth person is usually the person who follows wherever the first HGs go, or often is the person who comes in to replace the second person as the receiver of the overexcited first person. The reason why this ordering matters is because true game/strategist players will look to gather any means of judging opposing HGs aptitudes for the game and see how much people know about the game/show, and the best way to do this is by observing HGs first impressions in the house. If someone comes in and instantly runs in the direction of the beds (without any instruction from another HG), you know that they have watched enough of the show to memorize exactly what the house layout is. Most recruits and ‘show only’ fans surprisingly don’t know the house layout, and thus if the person runs towards the kitchen/washroom, you know they are either not a gameplay, or they are trying to meta-game you (use future knowledge to determine which is the case). Speaking of meta-gaming, this is why it’s best to come in 2nd or 3rd – if you are in that position, you are able to initially ‘lead the charge’ to the bedrooms, and thus if you are confident enough you can ‘fake’ not knowing where the rooms are by heading the wrong way and throw any strategics off your trail. Once you appropriately correct your ‘charge’ (either from another HG saying “I think it’s this other way”, or you pretending you saw that there were no beds that way), head to the bedrooms.

2.	***Scenario 2: You are called into the house in a later group, or a part of a full on ‘second HG phase’, a. l. a. BB16 and now BB17*** Enter the house at any position, making sure that when you enter the house you do not run past everyone in an attempt to get a good bed. Stop and hug the people already in the house (whom are probably waiting in the hallway), and make them aware that you care about them more than a bed, both to put your face forward as a ‘good person’, but also to suggest that you aren’t aware of the lack of quality bed situations, and thus that you might not be a super-fan (even though you are). The already-in HG who yells out unprovoked “Go get your beds, there’s not a lot left!” is probably not a strategist, but is someone who will be able to get a handle on the game soon, and thus a potential game threat. This insight is brought to light because a strategist would avoid associating themselves as a stressful voice in other HGs first experiences in the house, but that HG can be assessed as a potential ‘learn on the fly’ game threat because they were able to quickly understand the mechanic of ‘lack of beds = bad’. After a quick hug-fest in the halls, head to the bedrooms.

##*Timespan: From entering the bedroom area to all HGs have picked a bed.*

1.	***Scenario 1: You were in the first group*** Do not get a bed in the hallway bed space. It’s the worst location for sleep quality (sound proofing, light pollution, hallway activity), and it provides no privacy for potential gameplay talk. Ideally grab a bed in the doored square room, which was the ‘Fire room’ in BB16 for those who watched – for the same reasons stated prior. After grabbing one of those beds, head to the hallway to properly greeting the HGs whom entered with you, give some first greetings, then prepare for the second batch of HGs. Try and amp up the “First X”-ness of the situation, where X is the number of HGs who entered with you, as any additional alliance-like unity will help you in the early game. Don’t be the one to say “Let’s make a first X alliance.” If it happens, following along with it, and never say no to an alliance offer. Don’t be the one who yells out “Get your beds quick!” when the next group comes in.

2.	***Scenario 2: You were in a later group, either directly after the first group, or a part of a full on ‘second HG phase’, a. l. a. BB16 and now BB17*** Try and get a bed in the doored square room, but anything is fine. If you are not in the first group of HGs, then the bed selection is less about comfort and more about strategic blocking/placement. If there’s a room with a bed open that seems to be owned by all the ‘opposite’ gender from yourself, grab it quick. You want to avoid allowing a gender to own a room, which will eventually result in an early gender alliance. If you are a guy, then you’ll already be able to get in with the other guys, regardless of where you sleep, but if you can room with girls, then they’ll be forced to interact with you in a more personal setting, and thus will give you an ‘in’ for friendship/alliances. The inverse is true if you are a woman – avoid being an all-girl room, as you’ll be able to socialize with them anyways, but you’ll be able to get into an alliance with guys sooner when you room with them. If you are of a unique situation (i.e. you are LGBT, etc.) you’ll have to make a judgement call on first impressions and your personal comfort level. Quickly throw your stuff on the bed and instantly go back to the group and begin socializing, it is important to make yourself a part of the ‘whole’ as soon as possible to avoid the first group from feeling ‘separate’ from the rest of the house, and thus avoid any sort of BBCAN2 F5 alliances.

##*Timespan: Socializing and introductions.*

When the house is in that ‘pre-introduction’ cheering stage, be positive, smile, and introduce yourself to everyone. Make an attempt to move through every single person, and while you want to make everyone be aware of you, don’t be “too” out there, as you want to avoid singling yourself from the group (Watch the BB15 premiere to see some examples of how *not* to act at this stage of the day, especially Gina Marie). Probably telling people your name, getting their name, and saying some off the cuff comment about how exciting this all is should be enough. Do your best to memorize people’s names, but don’t be the person who instantly knows and says everyone’s names as much as possible, almost to an annoying point.

Don’t go out of your way to be the person to start the sit-down introductions, but definitely encourage the transition once the idea starts bubbling through the room. When someone else says to gather in the seating area for introduction, be quick to acknowledge the idea and get a seat. At this point everyone is itching to express themselves, and nobody likes the person who takes too long to sit down. Accept the offer of a drink, even if you don’t particularly like to drink alcohol, because you once again don’t want to single yourself out. It’s a good point to note that you should also be responsible on the first night, and not to over-drink, as you want to be in control of yourself as the night progresses. There’s no real rhyme or reason to what order you should give your introduction, however don’t fight to be first or last, but if you end up being first or last, play the role appropriately. This means that if you are first, make sure to act up the “Well forgive me if I say something wrong, because I’m first!” goofiness, and if you are last, make sure to end your introduction on a high note. Be honest in your introduction, and avoid lying about your life if at all possible. I guess there could be some reasons why it would be okay to lie about certain things, but you sure as hell need to make sure that you can sell that story for a whole season, otherwise it will eventually bite you in the ass. It is always better to drop a bomb early and suffer a little bit of consequences than to hold off with a lie, as the damage will always be far worse in the end. When listening to other introductions, don’t be the person who gives their two cents after every single person says a word (a.l.a. BB2’s Nicole, Gina Marie, etc.) because that is completely grating for everyone. That being said, it is okay to be an encouraging and supporting voice for others, as long as you remain passive and neutral. It is always good to follow up after the introductions and ask HGs to tell you more about their specific story, as it shows that you remembered their story, you are interested in them personally, and allows you an opportunity to double check their story to see if there might be holes, and thus see if anyone is lying. Continue to develop connections with as many people as possible over the next 20-30 minutes as the group waits for Julie to provide further instructions.

##*Timespan: Julie appears and introduces the season twists and HoH challenge.*

Get to the seats as soon as possible, but relax if other HGs take longer to get there – there’s no need to get angry/annoyed if someone isn’t respecting Julie’s time. Participate in the ‘Ooo-ing’ and ‘Aww-ing’ of the Julie experience, but don’t be the person to try and guess what she’s about to say when she’s talking – it’s annoying to listen to for both the audience as well as the other HGs, and it reveals to the other HGs that you know the game enough to be confident about your answer. It’s okay to act surprised when Julie reveals the twist, but don’t try to make a huge fuss about it and make yourself stand out. After this, Julie will tell the group to prepare for the HoH challenge. Sometimes, like in the case of BB17, Julie will tell the group that X number of people will need to sit out of the challenge. Never be the one to sit out of a challenge. This is the easiest way to single yourself out, and even the act of offer to sit out is equivalent to BB suicide. Don’t do it. Don’t even think about it. Let someone else offer, and let them suffer the consequences.
 
##*Timespan: HoH Challenge.*

It is okay (and almost preferred) to throw the challenge, however never make a thrown challenge obvious, and always wait until 4-5 HGs have already exited the challenge. You want to be perceived as an ‘average’ competitor – not too good to be a game threat, not too bad to be a perfect pawn, but just right to be a dependable potential alliance member. The other reason why you should wait until a handful of HGs have already dropped out of the challenge is because it allows you to avoid a situation where the eventual HoH attempts to “keep the blood off their hands” by nominating the first X number of HGs who dropped out of the challenge first (a.l.a. BBCAN3 Bobby’s nominations), and allows you to still be in the game in the case of some endurance ending agreements (a.l.a. BBCAN2’s Paul deal). When you drop out of the game, make an appropriate “I’m out!” comment, and then quickly get out of the game area. Say some encouraging words to those still in the challenge, but make sure to remain neutral and supportive in your commentary. Use this time to build your relationships with those already eliminated, as for the first few weeks it will be very hard to be alone with such a small group of HGs. Once the challenge is over, make sure to congratulate all the remaining players, including the losers, for a job well done and make sure to avoid being too ‘bro-y’ if you are a guy and the winner is the guy or to ‘girl-y’ if the winner is a woman and you are a woman, as the last thing you want is to perpetuate any notion of gender-based alliances. 

##*Timespan: Post-HoH socializing time to a first night’s sleep:*

1. ***Scenario 1: Post-HoH Twist stuff, such as instant nominations*** Simply act normal, and don’t avoid eye contact with the HoH in situations where they are nominating face-to-face. Nothing can be done at this point; all the work building connections throughout the day should be able to get you through this point – and if it doesn’t, don’t overreact and be respectful as the HG that overreacts is the one that goes home the first week (chill the rest of the day, and use the following week to build trust and respect with the other HGs, and you should be fine).

2. ***Scenario 2: No twists, just socializing time until sleep*** Continue to build relationships with the other HGs by getting to know them, talking openly about yourself, and finding any way to support other HGs with their transition into the game. Act calm and prepared, however join in on the experience, and share your excitement and feelings. Make sure to balance your time to talk and your time to listen, as you probably want to be listening at least three times as much as you want to be talking. Take in as much as you possibly can, so that once the second day rolls around, you will be able to instantly continue on in any discussions from the prior night, and allow for continued connection building. Don’t be the person who was all talkative and relatable on the first day, but then ignored half the house on the second day because you didn’t like those set of people. Everyone is your best friend, whether you liked them or not. When people are in the backyard, go into the backyard. When they are brushing their teeth, brush your teeth, when they are going to bed, go to bed. Most of all – don’t talk in or near the bedrooms at night, and if you are a snorer, you might as well keep your bags packed because you are getting evicted as soon as humanly possible. 

###**This is how you have the perfect first day in the Big Brother house.**

Once again, I look forward you any responses that you might have, and I hoped you enjoyed the long form! Thanks.

3b466o,34,2015-06-25,"RE: DeMarcus Cousins Trade Proposals - A Look at Expected Value in the NBA Lottery, 2001-2010",[deleted],nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3b466o/re_demarcus_cousins_trade_proposals_a_look_at/,"In light of the recent pre-draft [trade hubbub](http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--kings-talking-to-lakers-about-demarcus-cousins-trade--fielding-offers-from-other-teams-030157845.html) surrounding the Sacramento Kings' DeMarcus Cousins, I had the intern do some digging... 

  In this little post, we look at two things: 1) the likelihood of drafting an **all-star** in the lottery, and 2) the likelihood of drafting **superstar** in the lottery.

  This is not a statistically rigorous analysis. It also does not take into consideration numerous other factors, including, but not limited to: salary cap flexibility, a proposed increase in team salary cap, team chemistry, off-court drama, etc. 

  Below, we look at: 

  - Players drafted in high-to-mid lottery (picks 2-10) 
  - From 2001 to 2010 (10 years) 
  - How many of these players became ""all-stars"": self-explanatory; all-star at least once in career
  - How many of these players became ""superstars"" or ""franchise players"", i.e. equal or better players to Demarcus Cousins: arbitrary; we went with a combo of PER and PPG 

  [2001 - 2010: Lottery Drafted vs. All Stars](http://i.imgur.com/rJhp84M.png)

  [2001 - 2010: All Stars vs. Superstars](http://i.imgur.com/y6sm8F1.png) 

**Key Takeaways**

  - From 2001 to 2010, **~31%** (28 of 90) players drafted in the high- to mid-lottery (picks 2-10) became All-Stars  
  - Excluding Cousins, of the players that became All-Stars, only **~48%** (13 of 27), or **~1 in 2**, were identified as ""superstars"" or ""franchise players"" 
  - Excluding Cousins, 13 franchise players were drafted over a period of 10 years, i.e. ~1.3 franchise players are drafted, on average, every year, or a ~15% hit rate (~1 in 7) of drafting a franchise player. Or put another way, the **""expected value"" (EV) of a pick in this range is equal to ~0.15 superstars** or ~0.3 All-Stars or ""~X units of arbitrary production"".  
  - In the past 10 years, the only other lottery F/C picks that have panned out at Cousins' level are Amare Stoudemire and Chris Bosh. Or, in other words, **you can expect to be able to draft a superstar big man in the lottery roughly once every 5 years.** 

  -----------------------------------------------------

Which brings us to the meat-and-potatoes of the proposed Kings-Lakers trade... 

**Kings**
  
  - DeMarcus Cousins 

**Lakers**
  
  - \#2 pick
  
  - Julius Randle (#7 pick)
  
  - Jordan Clarkson 

  Ignoring Clarkson's value for now, we can look at the expected value and the likelihood of a range of scenarios in which the Kings or Lakers would profit from such a trade.

Consider: 
  
  - Combined EV of #2 pick and Randle (#7) is ~0.3 superstars, meaning trade, as-is, carries a premium of ~**3.3x**, i.e. on a purely arithmetic basis, the trade assumes #2 pick and Randle are 3.3x more-likely-than-expected to become superstars. Whether or not this optimism is warranted is another question. However, it is important to note the limitations of this statement - it does not properly assign value to the pick or Randle if they become valuable role players or even All-Stars. 
 
With simple binomial probabilities, we can also estimate:
 
  - The likelihood of BOTH the #2 pick AND Randle becoming superstars: **~2%**
  - The likelihood that AT LEAST one of them (#2 and/or Randle) will pan out as a superstar: **~25-30%**  

Take this for what you will. If anything, it simply emphasizes the difficulty of acquiring a superstar in the draft."

I lost my hearing completely at the age of 15 during high school and was implanted with a cochlear implant. I was bullied a lot when I first lost my hearing, but then people just started to ignore me and not include me in anything. This led me to not eating food and losing a lot of weight (5'11'' at 100 pounds). I was feeling ugly and incredibly insecure about myself.

Fast forward to first year of college, due to not eating, it somehow led me to getting Crohn's disease. As a result, I was not able to focus on my classes, due to constantly having to poop every 5 minutes. It sucked bad, couldn't do things that people in college do, and went home every weekend, because I couldn't handle the stress.

Junior year of college, a friend introduced me to weightlifting, and this helped me pack on some more muscle (after I started taking medication which put my Crohn's in place). I was feeling more confident in myself, and girls even said I was cute! I was feeling good about myself, and despite everything that happened previously, I felt I could finally stand up in this world.

Last summer, the summer before graduate school, I then developed a vicious stye in my left upper eyelid, which to this day, has not completely gone. Even after numerous trips to the doctor and 3 surgeries on my eye to reduce the swelling/pus, it never went away and has disfigured my eyelid, to the point where it is now droopy and uneven with my other eye. I have become incredibly self conscious about this, and coupled with the stress of graduate school and TA duties, I was and still am having a hard time coping. My doctor even said to not be vain and that girl's don't care about ""silly stuff"", and my parents tell me to stop complaining as well...

I know the stye doesn't really count as a disability, but all of this packaged together is making me upset. It is summer now, and when I am not in my internship, I just sleep the day away. I don't even go to the gym anymore, even tho I used to be incredibly diligent about lifting weights and making progress -- mostly because I don't see the point anymore.

I know people have it worse out there than me, and my parents constantly tell me this, but I'm having a really hard time handling all this...

Thanks for listening."

A lot of them seem like a stretch to consider unusual and might just be presented as suspicious to beef up the body count and conspiracy theory, but there are quite a few that were ruled suicides yet seem questionable to me.

For this post let’s look in detail at one case in particular: [The Starbucks Murders of 1997](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/08/us/three-workers-found-killed-in-coffee-shop-in-georgetown.html) and [Mary Caitrin Mahoney](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-07-09/news/1997190088_1_molly-mahoney-caity-caitrin-mahoney). Mahoney was a former White House intern during the Clinton administration who at the time of her death was working as a manager at a Starbucks in a low crime area of D.C., a Starbucks supposedly frequented by George Stephanopoulos, Chelsea Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. Mahoney, a lesbian and gay rights activist and founder of the group Baltimore Lesbian Avengers, had been by some reports something of a mother figure/confidant to other interns who might have complained to her about sexual harassment by the President (unconfirmed). In July 1997—a time when we know the scandal was in the air as Matt Drudge had leaked Michael Isikoff's report on Clinton’s sexcapades and Lewinsky was then already gossiping about her affair to Linda Tripp—Mary Caitrin Mahoney and 2 other co-workers were gunned down in the Starbucks after hours. While the other employees were shot once, Mahoney was shot numerous times, leading some to see her as a target of assassination. No shots were heard in the neighborhood, causing speculation that silencers might have been used.  Eventually, based on an anonymous tip to America’s Most Wanted, police focused on [Carl Derek Havord Cooper](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/march99/cooper18.htm), whom they eventually prosecuted and convicted. According to police, this was a robbery, but nothing was taken. Their scenario and Cooper’s confession explain this by stating that the robbery attempt was botched (Mahoney resisted, thus her numerous gunshot wounds) and Cooper fled after firing his weapon for fear that the shots had been heard. Believable enough, until you consider reports that the store was locked from the outside, meaning the murderer(s) must have taken the time to lock up behind them. Also sketchy is the fact that [police elicited Cooper’s confession after a 54-hour interrogation](http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/03/05/lawyers-assail-lengthy-interrogation/2b5b1e77-6a5f-409d-b0be-f9b50ffc5328/), and he afterward recanted.  

So what do you think… is Cooper guilty? Is it reasonable to connect this death to the Clintons? Are there any other deaths linked to the Clintons that you are unwilling to explain away as coincidental? Or do you think all presidential body count lists are examples of confirmation bias run amok? …Also, do you like Hillary for 2016? :)"

3b4x9x,0,2015-06-25,An anthropological reason why WWE isn't as good as it use to be,[deleted],WWE,https://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/3b4x9x/an_anthropological_reason_why_wwe_isnt_as_good_as/,"[Skip to site] (http://everythinggeekdom.blogspot.com/2015/06/wwe-is-not-in-21st-century-and-here-is.html)

We all have said it to ourselves, “Vince McMahon is out of touch” or “They need to bring back the Attitude Era”. It is obvious that wrestling or rasslin is not as good as it once was. As a child of the 90’s, one of my fondest memories was watching Monday Night Raw late at night watching Stone Cold defend his title against the Undertaker or watching The Rock trash talking The Corporation, or even witnessing Crash Holly hilariously defend his Hardcore Championship during the infamous 24/7 rule.  What can I say? Good times. It was awesome to be a 90’s kid. Now with that said, what is wrestling like today? Let me start off by saying that over the past year, I found myself getting back into wrestling. Now I don’t watch Raw or Smackdown but I do keep in touch on the roster and familiarize myself with what is going on in the story line. Although it is better than it was say 5 or 6 years ago, I still cannot honestly say wrestling is watchable. Not watchable in the sense that I want to change the channel the second it comes on, but in the sense that I cannot get invested in something that will not turn out the way I want it to. As a fan of the sport myself, it’s almost heart breaking to see what it has become. I mean for God’s sake, Kane is corporate! WHAT!? That dude used to scare the crap out of me when he spoke thorough his voice box. And not THIS?! Although Kane maybe long and gone, the talent is probably some of the best the company has ever had. Although nobody can cut a promo like The Rock or Stone Cold, they all have something to offer and have amazing in-ring ability. They each have their own personality and can create a legacy that could rival Macho Man, Flair, Hogan, Taker, Hart and so on. So what is going on and how did it go south?


Well to start things off, I do not necessary believe it is because it is PG. Hell, NXT is PG and it is amazing! As many problems as I have with WWE, I adore NXT. I watch every episode and pay-per-view every chance I get. To see stars like Kevin Owens get a push on the main pay-per-view and beat Cena, CLEAN, is awesome (although he lost the second time but we all saw that coming).  But the bigger question is, what does NXT have that the WWE doesn't? Well NXT is pure wrestling. Yes, the wrestlers are more colorful (physically and personality wise), but everything is to the point. The shows are only an hour long, matches are shorter, promos are MUCH shorter allowing the talent to get to the point and establish their narrative. The “divas” are treated as real wrestlers and do way more than the divas past and present. The arenas are smaller, the lighting and color scheme is more vibrant yet comforting, allowing a more intimate setting giving the audience a real polished indie atmosphere. The reason why NXT works the way it does is because it is smaller. It is developmental. Everyone is hungry and is willing to show off what they have in the ring. Everything else is secondary. You are here to watch the future establish themselves and move on up. You root for these athletes. You see the future and it looks promising, almost like seeing your friends and classmates during college graduation. Everyone is excited ready to embrace the challenges ahead. However, reality kicks in and you soon realize real life is like the WWE in 2015. A lot of promise but no real satisfaction.


Now here, in my humble, anthropological, opinion on why the WWE is not in touch with the 21st century. To understand why the WWE worked when it did we have to look through the company’s history. Back in the 80’s, when it began to grain popularity, you had wrestlers who resembled Saturday morning characters. Big Boss Man was a cop, Jake “The Snake” Roberts carried… a snake, Iron Sheik was the Iranian everyone loved to hate and Hulk Hogan was the all American boy fighting for the rights of everyman. Oh, how American. These wrestlers were a reflection of what would now be considered a simpler time, before internet, smartphones and 10 year olds navigating through electronics better than anyone over the age of 40. It was easier to buy into these characters and root for the personality you liked. In the case of Hulk Hogan, America and Russia were at each other’s throats for decades. Hulk Hogan represented the best in what America saw in itself. He was charismatic, entertaining and most of all unbeatable. We rooted for him because we rooted for America. We were damned if an American lost to a commie, in the ring or in the global political climate. When the USSR fell, and Cold War became a memory and society changed. No longer did we want to see these cut out characters have cartoony characteristics. We wanted ATTITUDE!


Ah, the Attitude era. Without a doubt, the most beloved era in wrestling (well at least for anyone under the age of 50 or so). Wrestlers cursed (“SUCK IT!”), threw tables and chairs at one another, Undertaker made human sacrifices and Triple H drugged Stephanie before her wedding to Test and took her to Vegas to have her become his wife…? Yeah, good luck doing that in today’s Rape Culture society. Point is wrestling was “trashy”. Truth is, the 90’s were “trashy”. Cable TV was pushing every boundary imaginable. Jerry Springer and his white trash, neo nazi, baby daddies were running amuck, South Park and the Simpsons were changing the rules for who can watch animation and the president of the United States telling everyone that he did not sleep with his intern. Our conservative Regan era had come to a close and America was number one. The economy was doing great, we all had jobs and technology was beginning to advance like never before. It was time to have fun, exploit, and see how far we can push our boundaries. There was no worry insight so why be cautious?


One of my most predominate memories of the 90’s was everyone having this “Fuck work” mentality. Having a job was modern day slavery. Everyone had this Utopian idea that we need to move beyond that and redefine happiness in our  post-Cold War capitalistic society. Now, as a 9 year old, I couldn't really comprehend any of that. I just assumed most people got a job they hated because they wanted to buy nice things. One superstar that rose above and connected with the audience was Stone Cold Steve Austin. Stone Cold was at his core a beer drink, loud mouth, crazy redneck son of a bitch who did not give a fuck about what his boss or anyone thought of him. Stone Cold was the physical embodiment of what people liked/ wanted to be in the 90’s. He was trashy and said what he wanted to say and was hated by his boss, not for being a bad employee, but for not wanting to give into his stupid demands. If Vince told Austin to do something, he would get the finger, get “stunned” and have beer poured all over him. Something all adults working their dead end jobs wanted to do at some point. Sure you had people like The Rock and Mankind make their way on up and get praise, but Stone Cold was different. While The Rock was entertaining to listen to, Stone Cold was an icon. Not only was he great in the ring, but we all wanted to be him in one way or another. To be a superstar, you gotta be the complete package. You need to be great on the mic, great in the ring and have a character that you can sell and a character people can cheer or boo for at a moment’s notice. You have to own that persona. You have to be that persona.


By 2003 Stone Cold’s time in the top came to an end. The Rock became bigger and bigger and was so charismatic, he reached the point where he was able to become the only wrestler with a real acting career. With Stone Cold and The Rock gone, who do we have? “You can’t see me”! Yeah, I know… John Cena is an interesting case. When he first popped onto the scene, I though “Who is this white boy trying to rap?” By this point I stopped watching wrestling all together. I actually stopped before ""The Invasion"" story line. I would watch some videos and promos here and there just to see who was going on. I noticed Cena and thought, “Well, rap is big right now, so I guess this makes sense?” Okay, I can see this character being in the roster but this is usually for someone who is a throw away mid-card who will eventually get a new persona. To my and I’m sure the many fans dismay, this Marky Mark wannabe would grow in popularity and be pushed like no one before him. Over time the character changed from Marky Mark to Nickelodeon. His fans grew younger and younger and soccer moms finally found someone acceptable for their kids to look up to. Sure he was upbeat and had a good message for the young ones, but he had no edge. Cena, for those who can remember, had his moments where he was threatening. He actually had some good heel moments (watch the championship match with him and Rob Van Dam). However, the company had by this point become PG. Vince’s wife was running for office and WWE would start focusing on merchandise. Cena was popular among the kids and needed to remain popular to hold onto their new business strategy, toys. Believe it or not, toy sales is what makes the company real money. Look at Marvel and Disney. Yes their movies make billions, but the toys buy them the platinum toilet seat with baby skin Dalmatian toilet paper. Just look it up.


2008 was a troubling time. The economy went south, America was in 2 wars that didn't seem to end anytime soon and everyone was just uncertain. We all wanted a job and wanted to work like never before. Nobody knew for sure if this was temporary or if it was the new norm for the country. Meanwhile, the WWE was going through an identity crisis of its own trying to appeal to a broad audience of fans and non-fans alike while being safe for the whole family to watch. Diehard fans saw through this and switched over to TNA or just gave up all together. Sure, the WWE dominated, hell they are wrestling at this point. Nobody can give them a run for their money. Yet people just didn't like or trust the product. A sport geared towards men, watched by boys with or without their parents’ permission, now had guest hosts like Pee Wee Herman and Grumpy Cat. Now I love Pee Wee, but come on! You come to the realization that the face, the number one guy is… a mid-card wrestler making Subway commercials and dressing like a 10 year old boy in a K Swiss commercial.


In 2015, things look ahead but we are far away from where we want to be. The dollar is growing strong, interest rates are down and there are foreseeable plans to end to wars. Now if you really believe this or not, it’s up to you. By now millennials are dictating what is cool and what is popular. What are millennials doing now a days? Well we binge watch TV shows on Netflix and go to every Marvel superhero movie that gets released. Why is this? Well we millennials had a great childhood. We grew up in a time when we thought he US was indestructible. Our understanding of tough economic conditions were testimonies we read in history class. We were promised so much and witnessed it all crashing down from 9/11 to the financial and housing crash in 08. We are a generation that loves nostalgia and escapism. We look to the past in hopes our future will resemble that. Now what does this have to do with the WWE? Well, let’s look at it like this; who are the three biggest superstars everyone wants to be pushed? The triple D’s. Dean Ambrose, Dolph Zigglar and Daniel Bryan.


Anyone who has seen the past two pay-per-views would know that JBL, now a promising commentator, is comparing Ambrose to Austin. He is a lunatic that seems to be against The Authority. Bryan is the ultimate underdog story and is the closest wrestler to resemble a cartoon or comic book hero. Zigglar is a throwback to the 80’s. Let’s break these down. Many in the US don’t care for authority. Now this is nothing new, but this is something that has been more apparent now and is growing among all groups of people. Conservatives hate big government more than ever, Liberals are protesting Wall Street and minorities and youth are calling out the police for their overaggressive use of force. Ambrose is hated by the Authority. Ambrose hates the Authority. They have broken up the foundation he stood for and are now out to get him.


Daniel Bryan on the other hand is the classic underdog story who is technically gifted in the ring. He is seen as a push over due to his size yet overcomes adversity. He is the Steve Rogers of the WWE Universe. However, unlike Steve, Bryan has had no outside assistance, He did it all himself. He is the bridge between the fictional heroes we see on the big screen to the real life heroes you read about in the paper. And of course a hell of an in-ring wrestler.


Finally there is Zigglar. Well, like I said, Zigglar is a throwback. He is a devilishly handsome ladies man, with slicked back bleach bond hair, wearing a sleeveless denim jacket, a neon pink shirt and happens to be an awesome wrestler to boot. Anyone who notices fashion trends will notice a comeback in these styles. Fashion is notorious for having trends go in and out of style. Music is sampling more 80’s beats, movies like Drive are embracing the color and noir feel to it, with denim and larger frame sunglasses coming back into style. Is much of this due to people remember what they though was cool when they were a kid and trying to bring it back when they are older? Yeah, most likely, especially in the case of Zigglar. As stated before, millennial s love nostalgia.


Now with all three guys having so much promise, is there a chance that one can get pushed and be THE FACE of the company? Sure. As a betting man, I would go with Dean Ambrose. He is younger, has more time to develop and has yet to have his best days arrive (sorry Bryan). Now is there a way to combine all 3 into one? Well, I think so. Which one is it? Well, how about… Finn Balor. Yeah the guy from NXT with the entrance we all love. Let’s think about it. Like Zigglar he is good looking and definitely has the charismatic persona (at least in the entrance), has the in-ring athleticism like Bryan and mad man persona like Ambrose. If built him correctly (maybe as a giant killer or career ending superstar) he could be the big push the company needs. Plus with the make-up and overall physical appearance, imagine how many toys he can sell!

3b5mcb,31,2015-06-26,Am I [23 M] a selfish a**hole for leaving my girlfriend [25 F] of three years for a two months vacation?,beachversusgf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3b5mcb/am_i_23_m_a_selfish_ahole_for_leaving_my/,"First post, so please forgive any mistakes. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible. 


I currently work part-time making just enough to pay the bills. I have a well-paying long-term job lined up that is set to begin in the fall. At that point I will make the transition from working part-time with flexibility to working a full-time corporate job.


My girlfriend works full-time and we have been living together since last fall.


I am blessed in that my family vacations at the beach, 6 hours from my hometown, for the whole summer. We've been going since I was a kid. 


The last three years I haven't gone as a result of school internships and being with my current gf. The first year I had a summer internship, the second year she didn't want me to leave, and the third year I stayed in my hometown partially thinking I would get a full-time job sooner than I did and partially to be with her.


This year, with my job not starting until the fall, I have decided to go to the beach with my family for the summer. I would work part-time down there and continue to pay my half of the rent/bills at home.


My reasoning is that it's the last time in the foreseeable future that I will be able to do this and I need to take advantage of this opportunity before grinding away for years in an office. It's something I really feel I need to do, and think I will heavily regret if I don't go. Even more, I worry that not going will cause me to resent my girlfriend for keeping me from something I truly love (the beach/ocean).


My girlfriend does not think it's acceptable for someone to leave their SO for that long of a time, 8 weeks. She says that if it were an internship, or something related to a job it would be different, or if we were in school, or more recently out of school. She was hurt that I didn't bring it up for her input until I had decided it was something I felt like I needed to do. She says that she has never lived alone, and has never wanted to, and that she didn't sign up for this, and that I have obligations to her both by living with her and by our relationship.


Normally, I would have brought up any major decision like this and discussed it with her, but a previous summer I had done that before I decided on going to the beach, and she told me I should have waited until I had decided because going back and forth strung her emotions/hopes along. She argues that the rules changed when we signed a lease together.


Is it wrong to want to spend my last free summer vacationing with my family, leaving my girlfriend at home (only because she can't get the time off)?


Is she right that this is not something normal people do, or should do while in a relationship?


It doesn't help that everyone she has talked to, her friends, coworkers, all side with her. Everyone I've talked to about it has said I should go.

   

**tl;dr**: Last free summer before job starts, want to spend the time vacationing at the beach with family, girlfriend is not happy

**EDIT: - I didn't tell her earlier because it was a relatively last minute decision. My job start date was changed from early summer to the fall, which is when I began thinking about it. 

- At her workplace, her yearly vacation is determined in the very beginning of the year for some reason. I expected to be working full-time during the summer and didn't expect to have time off so soon, so I told her to schedule her vacation without me.

- I will certainly try to visit her during the summer, and may even cut my vacation short if I feel it's the right thing for me. However, the logistics of me working at the beach and being able to make enough money make things difficult.

- I don't think she's being unreasonable for wanting me to stay, nor do I blame her. It doesn't help that I absolutely screwed up talking to her about it first. I care very much about her feelings. I would not be leaving if I did not feel like this was important for me to do. "
3b5pra,23,2015-06-26,On the lighter side of the latest tainted meat crisis - this time last year....,Smirth,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/3b5pra/on_the_lighter_side_of_the_latest_tainted_meat/,"So this year we have 40 year old frozen meat being served up in hotpot and chuanr, probably that cheap one you go to all the time.

Some of you are new here so many not remember that 12 months ago we had a similar crisis at KFC and McDonalds.  And those of you who are not new will almost certainly have drunk away all the horrible horrible memories - like that month [trigger warning] when McDonalds could only serve you a hot apple pie and orange juice.  

http://www.salon.com/2014/07/21/chinas_latest_fast_food_scandal_mcdonalds_kfc_and_pizza_hut_sold_expired_meat/

[ Not to mention in 2013 when 16,000 dead diseased pigs floated down the Huangpu river through Shanghai ]

To jog your memory and put 40 years of frozen meat into perspective, I got permission from this articles author, Roger Whiteface, to re-print his in-depth report from last year.

**KFC nuggets expire while customers are ordering**

In yet another food scandal rocking China, KFC (Haochiirrrr Foods) has released startling news that even more customers may have been exposed to expired food, due to the incredibly long time it takes Chinese consumers to order at the counter.

Manager Mai JiRou had this to say when interviewed by our unpaid intern who doesn't speak Chinese ""Foreign country customer order mashang. Customer is 2 minute order, 1 minute maidan, 1 minute give food, rest of day is regretting! Haha kaiwanxiao only hah. I give you joking. We also say laowai may have big order but quick to finish! Hahahaha. It is the joking.""

""But China culture very different. Customer is thirty minute queuing, using phone, talking loudly, maybe change lanes and push a few times. We make menu very big. But customer cannot read menu from queue.""

""So we print menu very big too, put in plastic, front of counter. We make taocan. You know taocan. Like phone plan. Taocan. Like buy shouji get screen protector, extra stuff all included. Taocan. Get shower, massage, fly aeroplane. Taocan. So we make taocan very big, just say yi er san si shenmede.""

""In Foreign customer just order taocan, pay, go. But China customer needs more question --- Give me nugget big one. This one got rice? Why not so much liangcai? No liangcai feel bushufu. Not so much tang. No zhou is not tang. Tang is tang. Can get jidan. Which one got jidan. Feel not so like jidan, huan yige. Why is different price? Give me this one. No change it I like that one. My wife wants this one. No she wants the other one. Bring two. Wait no bring one but I want the jidan now. Nugget already ready? Don't want big one, give small one. I don't care put old one back, you really need me tell you how to do your job?""

Mai JiRou paused for breath and continued ""So that is China customer ordering, first minute. You should hear when the find out no watermelon juice!"".

According to KFC Operations Manager Rou GuoQi, this is an industry wide concern, although KFC may suffer more than others ""Average time to use ATM in China is 34 minutes. Average time to order in Starbucks is 17 minutes, however, 28 in summer because the bingkafei is very confusing whether healthy or not, very delishurs but bing de."".

But average time to order in KFC is 44 minutes, which leads to health problems. Freshly prepared food can go stale and develop high bacteria loads during the waiting time sitting under a warmer. If the food is packed early the customer may change their mind and workers need to put it back, possibly doubling the time it waits.

Worse still, if a customer discovers they forgot to get money out of the ATM, and decides to pick up a frappacino on their way back from the ATM, the additional waiting time can mean rats have already eaten the food while it is waiting on the counter - leading to an additional queuing and re-order cycle, plus need to issue a refund, which may need the managers key, which may be with the manager who is on smoke break in the toilets, incurring additional waiting time depending on how many cigarettes the manager has.

""One time we had customer forget ATM card at home, also ask for fapiao and he was here for 2 days."" shared Mi XiangFen, staff member responsible for on floor cleanup, and putting fries into smaller and smaller containers as customers eat them.

But not all employees believe the waiting time causes health problems. Mi XangFen shared ""Food stay out no problem, eat that, nobody die. But western food, too many hamburg, make you get fat. Bad for your healthy. Make the heart attack and the cancer.""
But Ms Mi admitted that proper health inspections may have been thwarted. ""Our PR manager say if health inspector comes, nobody touch the blue bags. She will take care of the blue bags. She can empty the blue bags and afterwards inspector will finish inspection go home very tired.""

So I asked for an interview with this PR manager too, in order to get the official story. That evening, KFC PR manager and ex-ChongQing car model, Bi Liuxue shared more with me over a bucket of chicken in a private interview. ""No food problem handsurm, only 44 minutes ordering time very inauspicious. China people very traditinur, believe in fate. Do you know? Are you interested Chinese culture? Is this why come from foreign? Do you like the China girl?"", while extending a thigh to me said ""Maybe you can have a try?"".

After a careful inspection of both thigh and breast, Miss Bi taught me the Chinese art of delaying placing your order, supposedly good for maximum qi flow. Following a checkup from a medical professional, I am pleased to report that there appear to be no health issues.

3b65na,6,2015-06-26,Is there ever a good time for a baby?,wukola,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3b65na/is_there_ever_a_good_time_for_a_baby/,"I found out yesterday that I'm pregnant. My husband and I have been together for 2 years, and we planned to start trying for a baby when I was done with residency. I start my first year of a 3 year residency next week. So needless to say, the timing is terrible! 

He's in school and feels that he'd have to drop out to work so we could save money to prepare, then he would be a stay at home dad (him being the stay at home parent was our original plan for the kid we were planning several years from now). We have absolutely nothing saved and have lots of debt that needs to be paid off, which we had a plan for to get done in a time frame we felt was reasonable. I'll be making about $50,000 a year after taxes. We can reasonably live on about $30,000 (that was our plan to get debts paid down asap). I'm worried about how this will mess with my schedule for residency. I know I wouldn't be the first pregnant chick to show up intern year, but do I really want to be that girl? Technically either way I'd have to be, since the abortion is scheduled for mid July, as that was the earliest they had. But I digress...

I have an appointment today at Planned Parenthood for the info session, since he and I had decided long ago that an abortion was the best option for us if we got pregnant this early in my career and his education. Within a half hour of the positive test I was on the phone setting up appointments. I was determined to follow through with the plan. He will support any decision I make (he wants the abortion), but I'm terribly undecided now that it's actually happened. It was so easy to say I'd definitely get an abortion when I wasn't pregnant, but this is hitting me harder than I expected. 

Any others in here who have faced a similar situation? How do/did you decide if you should derail career/education/plans to travel the world together without a care, or get the abortion and go about life mostly according to the original plan? I fear I'll regret any decision. I don't think I'll ever want to have biological kids if I go through with the abortion, but I don't want to screw us financially forever because I just had to have a kid we couldn't afford.

Thanks for reading. I always lurk and never thought I'd come out of hiding for something like this, but I'm looking forward to the support I've learned to expect from here.

UPDATE: So we went to the info session at PP, and when we left I felt at peace with getting the abortion. I know it's the right thing to do. I don't want to, but I think it's best for everyone. Unfortunately I don't know if our marriage can survive this, since we got into a huge argument over it, since he feels like I'm not caring about his feelings in all this. I keep going back and forth. He knows I'd rather keep it, but I don't feel that's responsible. Neither of us are ready to raise a child right now. He's willing to do whatever it takes to keep me sane, keep me mentally and emotionally the woman he married, which he thinks is us keeping the baby. I feel like I'll go insane either way. I'll try to respond to everyone individually later. Thanks everyone, I really appreciate it."

Unde gasesc inchirieri auto Bucuresti ieftine fara garantie?

Cand calatorim in afara tarii sau chiar in orase mai indepartate din tara noastra, de multe ori suntem in dubii daca sa inchiriem sau nu o masina. Sunt foarte multi factori care trebuiesc luati in considerare cand luam aceasta decizie. Costuri, confort, destinatie, toate aceste aspecte trebuiesc luate in considerare, iar un plan bine pus la punct si putina cercetare te vor ajuta sa iei decizia corecta. In orasele mari este destul de usor sa calatoresti cu metroul, autobuzul sau chiar cu tramvaiul. Multe orase mari au linii speciale pentru autobuze astfel incat sa treaca pe la principalele atractii turistice, iar intr-o astfel de situatie, inchirierea unui autovehicul nu este cea mai buna solutie.

So we are reaching the end of my programming themed days.. But what better way to end it than jumping into the most important part of all! JOB! CAREER! QUESTIONS!

Computer science is a very famous field of work today. People get paid a lot, there is always demand, innovation everywhere.. Truly one of the flagships of today's information age. But this leaves people with lots of questions regarding jobs, cost of study, internship questions, culture questions and many many more.

I dont think any field is easy. If you do well, you will get to eat the fruit. But to get to the fruit a solid path is needed. r/cscareerquestions helps you solve atleast some part of that path. They have a lot of questions answered and I would really suggest everyone to use the search bar! (I know reddit search sucks but hey u could still use some keywords! :D) 



I always suggest to **do your homework and read the FAQ/wiki before asking**. It helps you get better answers and lets people know that you are asking a genuine question and they will be more enthusiastic to answer it! :)



Career building is a long process which takes tons of time and work. its not easy. But its not impossible either. Gather information from forums, talk to people, build the knowledge base and move on. 

Keep calm and raise the sails!

Here is a small interview with the mods! :)






&gt;#1. What motivates you to moderate this sub ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** I like being part of that community, helping other people and contributing to the sub. Since I'm here often I might as well help with modding.

&gt;#2. How would you suggest people getting into computer science to go forward ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** Only get in the field if you're passionate, going in for money is a pretty risky move. It's not a 9-5 career, you're strongly encouraged to learn in your free time as well to progress in your career. Easy comfy jobs exist too, but they put you at risk of becoming obsolete. Also, the first job out of school is hard to get, so make sure you have a top-notch profile at that point (do NOT avoid internships), once you're already in the field with some experience, it gets easier to find jobs.



&gt;#3. What would you say is the biggest mistake people do when researching questions ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** A lot of ""bad"" questions are due to the fact that people don't know what they don't know, which isn't always their fault. But generally, try to have a global understanding of the problem and project, if you're too close to the code (this line doesn't work), you'll be missing out on a lot of things that could help you elsewhere.

&gt;#4. Anything you would like to say to your present and future subscribers ? 

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** Try not to ask questions that have been answered 100 times already, use the search. Also, don't just post a question, read the answers and leave. Participate with the community and especially in a thread you've created. Don't post a question if you'll be AFK for the next 24h.





Have an awesome week everyone!

3b7h1i,0,2015-06-26,Help me (27/m) figure out how much house I can afford after business school,Khayembii,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3b7h1i/help_me_27m_figure_out_how_much_house_i_can/,"I'm starting a FT MBA program at a top school in August.  I'm going to be taking out ~$207,000 in student loans (two Direct Plus loans and two Direct Unsubsidized loans) for the entire program.  I'm expecting to make about $20,000 in a summer internship, and graduating with a starting all-in compensation of about $200,000.  I also am planning on doing fellowship work on campus for tuition remission but am not including that in here for the sake of conservatism.

I'm planning on taking the longest possible repayment terms for the loans (25 years) so that my required monthly minimum payments are the lowest, and then making a payment to have them paid off much faster (this set up just gives me some hedge against downside risk).  At the 25 year term, my total monthly payments would be $1,569.23.

A portion of my compensation will be bonus; I'm assuming about 1/4 of it or $50,000.  I'd like to put this towards a down payment on a house.

I'm hoping to buy a house within a couple years of graduating.  I'll likely be working in NYC and so would be looking for houses in New Jersey, upstate New York or Connecticut that are on a train line.  Obviously housing prices are pretty steep for a nice house with a yard that are close to the train stations and so I'm trying to figure out how much house I can reasonably expect to afford.

If I'm two years in, I'd have $100,000 in bonuses saved towards a down payment (gross).  My loan principal would be down to $221,000 at that point (assuming I make the minimum payments).

How are student loans factored into your debt load when mortgage lenders view your debt:income ratio?  Is it simply based on monthly payments or do they also look at outstanding principal balances?  If I'm making $200,000 and have $100,000 saved up for a down payment how much house can I afford?"

From September on a friend and I will be working Sydney for an internship for half a year.

There are many ways to find some suitable housing but my general conclusion so far is that it's more expensive than I thought. No problem of course, we did our fair bit planning ahead and are able to pay for it.

But I wouldn't be a cheap Dutch guy if I didn't try and look for the best ways to find cheap housing.

Does one of you have recommendations regarding looking for housing?

Some info on what we're looking for:




Key | What
---|---
Type of housing| 2 bedrooms apartment (probably not very feasible) or shared housing with 2 seperate bedrooms
Prefered location|Brookvale (My company), Manly, Seaforth, Mosman, The Rocks (Company location of friend)|
Budget|Not more than 400 AUD / week|

Should we consider options like Airbnb? What is the best way to arrange something from abroad?

Thanks in advance!

Yesh"
3b7yak,21,2015-06-26,Basically Figuring out my life,nomnombre1,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/3b7yak/basically_figuring_out_my_life/,"Alright Reddit, bear with me on this one. I’m 19 years old and have been scouring the internet for someone that shares my point of view for a good chunk of my recent life. It just occurred to me that it might be better to type out my thoughts, since every time I find someone saying something I agree with I feel like I learn more about myself, and it settles something inside of me that I didn’t even know was unsettled. So, you could say this is therapy for me (implying that I do probably need therapy).

I started doing drugs other than weed and alcohol about a year and a half ago. I started smoking and drinking 2 years ago. Before then, I was incredibly against any and all drugs, I was a huge nerd and a recluse. I only hung out with a friend one time my entire freshman year of high school. I was awkward as fuck and was unaware of my social anxiety, and also just in general unaware of how people perceived me. I used to be narcissistic as fuck, thought I was smarter than everybody and that people were retarded for doing drugs and destroying their precious brains. Now, I am ashamed/regret this part of my life, but not entirely. It led me to have some pretty severe social development problems (the anxiety), which I believe the root cause is that I just am so socially unexperienced that I dont know how to act normal or “cool”. This is much less true now than it was a couple years ago.

Being the obsessive person that I am, I decided I wanted friends, and I wanted fun. The deciding factor for me came during my Junior year of high school when I started feeling slightly depressed due to an unhealthy relationship and realizing that being socially unhealthy affects my wellbeing. I researched depression and I researched weed and alcohol, and determined that any damage to my brain I make from sparingly smoking and drinking would be quantitatively less than the damage I was doing to my brain by staying friendless and depressed. My lunch table acquaintances soon became my bros, and we would smoke on the weekends and drink if we were lucky enough to be invited to a party. This period of my life was the funnest and most exciting time in all my 19 years. I was loving it, especially because having been a reclusive nerd put me at number 3 in my graduating class and I was getting accepted to great colleges and getting lucrative scholarships. I felt like I had the most well-balanced life, and at the time that may have been true. Also, without a girlfriend, I started learning how to talk to girls I didn’t know, and started hooking up with girls I used to fantasize about. 

My senior year of high school was when I was cashing in on having been a nerd, and I started smoking weed nearly every day and thinking my shit was sweet. I thought I was so cool, but in reality I had such a one-track mind and was extremely complacent. I may have enjoyed this period of my life the most, but I definitely am not most proud of it.

Then it was summer before college, and I just thought I was the shit and smoked my entire summer job’s pay (around 3200 dollars) away by the time I was a week into my first semester of college. I was not ready for college.

Cue college, I joined a fraternity, went out literally every single night, and started doing poorly in classes. A couple weeks into school I thought I was about to take acid for the first time, and it turned out to be a research chemical. Cue the worst 4 hours of my life, where I realized how anxious I got in social situations in the worst way possible, in a room full of my new “brothers” that I barely knew. Only me and one of my other brothers were tripping (he had a shit time too, he’s one of my best friends now though and I love him to death). Anyway, this trip gave me full blown anxiety attacks. Thought people were always looking at me, became aware of my facial expressions like never before. It’s almost a year later and still sometimes I’ll revert to that scared mindset and if I feel like someone is looking at me (usually they are but that shouldn’t matter, people look at people all the time) I’ll lose control of my facial expression and just look really anxious. As a side note and not trying to brag just trying to be as real as possible with myself in this post, I’m pretty attractive so people will look/stare at me more than most and I fucking hate it. I enjoy being attractive but I fucking hate the feeling of being watched. One last note about the trip, afterwards I stopped going out every night and got my school shit together.

This last year at college has been crazy for my development. I started getting real acid and taking it, as well as molly (the molly was stupid, didn’t help me much and I should've saved it for a better occasion). I started learning a lot about myself from both the drugs and from just experiencing life in college. I could write a book about everything I learned. Anyway, I became very good socially, stemming from having awareness of myself, of others, of body language, and trying to be empathetic and less selfish.

The second semester though I began to abuse adderall, way too much. Every day for a couple weeks at some points, some days taking 100mg IR. My social anxiety heightened, and also a more generalized anxiety surfaced. I didn’t realize it till I became a huge hypochondriac. Last week I was convinced I have fucking aspergers or some shit. Which has always been a weird worry for me, but I always shrugged it off with confidence. When I first started having friends in high school my friends would make fun of me and say that I have the bergs because I just was socially retarded. I know that’s terrible of them and this issue probably has something to do with emotional scars but that’s irrelevant; the drugs sparked the flame. I probably spent 5 hours total researching aspergers in an attempt to self-diagnose, and it took till I found an article about how people with aspergers avoid social situations or something like that to convince myself that I’m normal and maybe just a little crazy.

Anyway, here I am with an anxiety issue, standing at the edge of a well with depression at the bottom. I got into drugs with the idea that they would help me, and now here I am. I am both helped and hurt. I will say, being socially capable is doing wonders for my life situation, even if I still feel like shit. Professors like me, friends like me, strangers like me, the only problem is that I don’t completely like myself. 

There’s also one aspect of my personality that I’m very aware of but have difficulty working on, and I don’t like it. I’m very in my head sometimes, and I will be unaware of my surroundings if I don’t concentrate on them. As a result, I will sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves like 4 times. Also, sometimes I say insensitive things just because I won’t be thinking at all, but I don’t do this too much anymore and mostly just cringe at past fuckups (which I know is pointless and doesn’t help me, but bleh).


From an outside perspective, I seem like the happiest and most worry-free individual. I have a very high GPA in a hard major at a hard school, I have what is now my third internship, I’m attractive and likeable, and just seem very well put together. Really, the only things holding me back from loving the fuck out of life are my addictions and anxiety.

Something recently happened that gave me a glimmer of hope. I went to a music festival, and while I was rolling I introspected hardcore. I’m not going to drink as much anymore, I’m not going to smoke as much, minimal adderall, I’m dropping xanax and blow is only on special occasions. I don't need to prove anything to anybody. The excitement of smoking a blunt is all but lost. I don't have any more good reason to keep destroying my body. Unlike during high school, I would be happier being sober. Which is crazy to realize, but I need to be receptive of my true feelings, or else my internal conflict would snowballed and I probably would become a huge drug addict. The ending to that story is very predictable.

Everybody should watch the video I watched yesterday: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRVOOwFNp5U. This really hit home. And now I want to change more than ever, and feel like there is somebody else out there that understands why I wouldn't wanna keep living the life I'm living. Luckily, some of my fraternity brothers have more depth to them than the people Hopsin flames in that video, so I don’t feel a need to completely drop the life I have. I just need to be a leader and put a stand against our addictions. I’m confident that if I change my ways, at least some of my brothers will follow. 

I used to be scared of this change. I had one candy flip that was weird at the beginning of May that wasn’t even enjoyable, because I looked around, saw all the frat bros, and realized that I definitely do not belong. It’s just not me to waste my life away. I came out of that candy flip telling myself that college is only four years and that I can deal with it till I graduate, but that it’ll probably cause depression because I’m so conflicted by that lifestyle.

I forgot to mention I abused xanax and cocaine all last year too. I also get pretty bad anxiety about the drugs I do, I constantly am googling information about the effects of different levels of drug use, especially as I started increasing use. However, while rolling at this festival, I realized that I need to be my own person and that changing my habits is definitely something I can do while still in college. So that’s what I’m going to do.

Now, I feel like I’ve gone on a wild ride this last year. I am such a different man. But I am a man, and I know exactly who I am and what my goals are. I feel like I finally found the last piece to my puzzle. I have a strong feeling that my life is about to drastically improve. Since the festival, it already has. Even though Ive been dealing with a pretty big built-up molly hangover recently, I’ve been feeling better about myself. 

All in all, I may have been narcissistic as fuck in the past but I wasn’t stupid for rejecting drugs. Now I know why people say drugs are bad. They’re also fun as fuck. But, I’ve lived both lives now. I have experience, and know exactly what in life I love. So I’m going to make smart decisions and love life. I'm going to have the future that I already put in so much work towards. Maybe if I didn't have anything at stake I wouldn't have this stance, but I'm too proud to allow the fruits of my labor to rot. I want to be the best person I can possibly be, to myself, to my friends, my family, strangers, animals, and the world.

If you read all of this, wow, congratulations, and a huge fucking thank you. It’s probably pretty disorganized but fuck it. Edit: Just cleaned it up so hopefully it makes more sense. I’m on adderall so this took me about 45 minutes to write. Hopefully some of you can relate to my story. Please let me know if you think my stance on anything is skewed or if there’s anything I haven’t considered that would change my perspective. I love thinking about things critically, so have at me.

Forgot to mention, but I’m a huge nerd about everything I do so I know a ridiculous amount about drugs from doing research. I tested all my drugs with a test kit (besides that first tab of acid).

Aside from all my problems, I actually have a lot of interests including guitar and music in general. I listen to music from when I wake up to when I go to sleep. I love listening to new artists and discovering stuff, and recently I decided to put together playlists and share them with friends and now it's all we listen to and it makes me so happy the people in my life enjoy my passion.

One love."

I already analysis statically the database to generated some graphics like Randal Olson and show relation between elo rating and numbers of plys, demonstrate first move advantage etc.

We will use a cluster with thousands of computers to get score &amp; evaluation's FEN with a uci engine (stockfish for now).

Then, we will have the score of all moves already played. 
We can calculate intrinsic rating depending on score average and not only result game.

Are you interested by our approach ? Do you have questions ?

Do you have some ideas what we can search in the database ?

Throwaway, because she reddits.

I'm out of state for work, and my girlfriend and I decided that it'd be a good idea for her to come with me. I rented a house cheap, and we figured that cohabitation for the 2 months or so I'd be working would be good for us. Currently, we're about 4 weeks into it. 

We fight about twice a week and it's driving me crazy. She gets agitated by the smallest things. I think part of it is that she's struggled in finding short-term employment, so she's stuck in a house alone for 11-13 hours a day while I'm working and maybe longer if I'm out with other interns, or staying late for OT. 

Despite this knowledge, I feel like I'm going mad. She gets on my case for insignificant things, like unplugging charging cords because it wastes electricity, even though she'll leave the air conditioning blasting in rooms she's not in. 

On days when we're super affectionate, or have sex, things are great. Otherwise we fluctuate wildly between ""normal"", ""tolerable"". Otherwise we're arguing. Furthermore, her emotions seem to be front and center in our interactions. I try to be empathetic, but honestly, I feel like some of the things that she gets hurt about are petty at best and her working herself into a mood at worst. 

Yesterday, before bed [NSFW incoming] I felt a bit horny. She'd been sick all day, so instead of asking for help from her, I went to the second bathroom downstairs, so she wouldn't have to hear my porn. I come upstairs afterwards, and she's waiting, asking why I was downstairs for so long. After I tell her, she immediately gets quiet and storms out, to sit on the stairs and cry. 

I get up to comfort her, (mind you it's already late) and ask her what's wrong. All she could say is that she's feeling ""something"" but doesn't know what. She starts to analyze why I went downstairs instead of asking her, and I tell her it's just because she was sick and I felt like going downstairs. No huge rhyme or reason to it. Thinking it's settled, I head to bed. 

Cue her waking me out of my bed several times, calling me an asshole, or saying how I should just go sleep on the couch if I want peace and quiet so I can sleep (mind you, I'm the only one paying rent atm). I ask groggily and nicely repeatedly, turning off the lights only to have them turned on again, until I snap out of my sleep for the 4th time and scream at her to leave me the fuck alone. 

She breaks down, and the last thought I have before drifting off is that I could care less at this point. Flash to today, I left her sleeping. She hasn't texted and I don't want to go home to her yet. I actually want overtime so I can avoid it. I hate that I screamed at her, but her grievances have gotten so petty and her emotions so sensitive, that I can't seem to care. 

I need help. I have 6 more weeks of this and I'm finding it harder to genuinely care about her concerns. Am I an asshole? What do we/I do?

I started my first job as an intern and I'm a little confused about how many allowances I should be claiming. I'm making $18.41 an hour for about 11 weeks, $2000 relocation, and $600 airfare. It adds up to around $11,000. I'm single and a dependent. No children. This will be my only income for the year. I forgot my W4 for my first paycheck and had $167 taken out from my paycheck I get every two weeks. I then used the IRS calculator and it told me 8 allowances, which sounds a bit high? I hear most people only filing for 1. When I got my second paycheck I had an even bigger withholding of $749, but that paycheck included my $2000 relocation + $949 tax assistance. I overall received $50 less that paycheck even though I had 8 allowances claimed vs not claiming and 8 hours more worked that period. The calculator now says to file for 13 allowances, which sounds aburdly high. I'm pretty sure I'm fucking something up. Any advice?

Also, do I need to file state W4s I'm working in Florida but a resident of California. Is there a calculator for it?

3b8k8p,1,2015-06-26,Had to deal with my first suicide. (Trigger Warning),SomeThingsICantStand,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3b8k8p/had_to_deal_with_my_first_suicide_trigger_warning/,"So I've been in school to become a funeral director for a while now. In the fall I will be starting my Junior year of a BA program for Funeral Services. This summer I am doing a clinical practicum. For those that may not know what that means, it's like an internship but more hands off because you haven't learned a lot of what your doing yet, but they want you to take a step into the waters to get a feel for it before you start doing the harder things in classes.

I live in a remote town, and really not a lot goes on. I've been doing my clinical for about six weeks now and 99% of the people I have seen come into the funeral home have been older people. People everyone expects to die because they are getting to the end of their lives.

Yesterday I got called to do a removal at about 7:30pm. The funeral director told me to get ready and meet him, like I normally do, to go do the removal. I figured it was just a normal go to a hospital or nursing home. While we were in the car he said it was a hunting accident. So I got prepared for that mentally.

On the way he got a phone call from the sheriff that was one site to let him know the coroner was already there, and that it was ruled as a suicide. I had no idea what to expect. I started telling myself it was okay if I needed to step away, it was alright if I felt faint. I just had to let Brian know if I couldn't do it.

We drove down into a little area in the woods, that lead to a sandpit. The officers were parked a little ways away, and the coroner was there as well. I was looking around through the car window to see the body and there wasn't one. Apparently he was around another corner and we had to pull around to the other side of the pit, behind a large mound that had been over grown with grass.

I could see the tail end of a green pickup truck. I was telling myself this was it, don't panic if you feel faint let someone know. I got out of the hearse and went around to the back to help unload the stretcher. When I turned around I could see the truck.

The windows of the back of that cab were washed with fluids, they had been there awhile so it was obvious they had mostly run off and down into the inside of the cab. This truck didn't have a back seat so there was some matter stuck behind the passenger seat between the window.

The officers and the coroner had walked down from their vehicles. The coroner had already laid a blue body bag out next to the truck. I stood next to the bag, at first all I could see was what was in the door mirror, it was just some of his eye brown and I couldn't make out the rest. So I knew for the moment I was fine.

The officers asked us to step around the front of the vehicle after the coroner opened the door. She threw a little bit of a skull fragment into the body bag. Before moving and the three of us stood at the front while the officers removed the gun from the mans hand. As they took the gun out and pointed it to the ground blood poured from the barrels. (This was a double barrel shotgun) and they opened it and removed the unused round.

The whole time they were doing this I could see through the front windshield. This man didn't have a face at all, there was nothing but an empty cavity where his face used to be.

This is the part that bothers me. It didn't bother me in the slightest. It was like it was nothing. There was no emotion at all, like it was just another removal, there was no sense of numbness, or anxiety. Hell not even a morbid curiosity to want to get closer. It was just like, ""Huh, okay."" And back to work I went.

We pulled what was left of his brains out of his lap tossed them into a baggy and the coroner and the funeral director lifted him out of the vehicle, and I grabbed his legs as they pulled him out so we wouldn't touch the ground. Like it was no big fucking deal.

The thing that sticks with me though was his set up. He had the forethought to plug in his phone, set it neatly on the seat, his keys his hat and other things arranged neatly on the passenger seat. A photo set of his wife and kids were sitting on the dash.

The only things that made me feel angry or sad was the coroner and how insensitive she was. ""Why do they have to do it in a car or in a house? They could at least do it in the woods and think about the people that have to clean it up!""

This burned me a bit, because I was almost where that man was a few years ago. I know what its like to be in that mind set and the last thing you think of it how messy its going to be. Your too preoccupied with controlling what you can, and trying to scratch your way to the surface but your constantly falling down. So you put a gun in your mouth because its the last possible option because in your mind you've exhausted everything else.

I don't like telling people that so I politely said, ""I think that's why he's here."" she said ""What?"" and I responded, ""Thinking. He wasn't thinking of that, that's why he's here."" And she gave a small head tilt as to say ""Yeah I can see that."" I would have gave her a whole speech about suicide and what its like from the inside but what good does it really do? I know it does do some good, but in the same token on the job and standing around talking about my own sob story instead of getting this poor guy all bagged wasn't worth the breath and time it would have taken to explain it all. Plus how would I have looked to my ""co-workers"" if I was like ""Yeah I tried to off myself a few years ago, no biggie."" It makes people look at you different, like they can't trust you alone, or like they don't want to be around you. You're immediately transformed into a person who is uncomfortable to be around. So I kept my mouth shut.

The officers were bagging all his belongings, and they kept looking at me. I must have been so stone faced, they kept having the same reaction of... how do you even explain it... because it's not disgust and its not fear, but more of a unease and here I was nearly half there age and already standing there (a blonde, short, girl) without losing my cookies in the tree line like I was a hardened vet. or something; while, them, grown men muddled around not wanting to touch the bloody evidence.

Through all of that, I finished up my night, brought the body to the funeral home for storage and went home. I got home and I still wasn't feeling anything. I looked and my SO and said can we go somewhere. I don't want to sit here and think. He looked back at me and I said ""I just went to a suicide call."" He immediately got dressed, and asked me where I wanted to go. I didn't know so we just drove for a while before making a pit stop to grab ice cream before Dairy Queen closed.

The whole time I kept telling him I don't feel anything. It bothers me that I don't feel anything. I feel like I should be feeling something.

He said they need people like me doing that kind of work, if the world was full of people like him they be closing their eyes and rolling the dead into a ditch some place so they wouldn't have to deal with it.

It still really bothers me. Like I'm broken. I mentioned it to the funeral director and he looked at me really surprised. He's been doing this for years and in that look I knew that it still bothered him; which didn't help.

I had posted about it on FB:

""Did a removal (technically yesterday) and I think what bothers me is that what I saw didn't bother me. I'm not allowed to talk about it for privacy of the family, but I think what I saw would make most people reel but for me there was nothing... it was like it was normal, liked I'd seen it a million times. No pit in my stomach, no nausea, no anxiety. Just normalcy. Like it was just another day.

Its eating at me, like I'm broken. Keep thinking my response isn't normal. Maybe my threshold is higher... I don't know.""

I couldn't tell anyone I went to go pick up a guy who blasted his face off so every probably figured it was just another case of an old person.

""Not broken sweetheart.... You finally found what you're good at.... Not everyone can do it!!!""

"" I agree...found your calling! Death is a part of life right? I would call your ability to be ok with it as the normal that everyone should have...it's all part of life.""

This doesn't feel normal to me. Maybe its because I tried to end my own life and I can see it clearly from his point of view as to why he did it. Maybe it is normal. Maybe I'm desensitized from all the nasty shit on the internet. I'm definitely talking to my therapist about it but that's a few weeks out so I needed some place to decompress.

Maybe even get some input on if it's normal or not. Not that I really want to hear that I'm not, but it might shed some light even if its a painful truth."

Sure it's easy for me to sit here and just spout off, but I'm generally curious if I'm alone in some of these. None of my friends are hardcore fans so I want to hear what you have to say. Feel free to add those I miss or disagree. That's what Reddit is for!
(I can't get the formatting right - Sorry desktop folks...)

Works:

* Anything involving the back office: Sure people have been bitching/moaning/conspiracy-theorizing about if people were fired, or not being included as much, etc. I feel like so much of the back office (Will and Jason come to mind immediately for me) is criminally under utilized. Not just Sal and Richard gay stunts, but everyone. When they are used, it's radio gold.

* Introduction of new ""Wack Packers"": When Eric died (RIP) there was a (Paris Hilton voice) huuuuuuuge vacuum left. I feel like Hanzi, Monotone Matt (or whatever his name is) and Mick the Nerd have been used well to help fill the void.

* Three words: Sour-motherfuckin'-Shoes. No explanation needed.

* Howard talking about 'Nam: Generally speaking this is probably one of the more outrageous things he still does. Sometimes slightly cringe-y, but always very funny.

* Benjy/Elisa drama or anything with Benjy: I'm POSITIVE I'm in the minority here, but I loved that whole thing. I know she's a star-fucker but there was just something about Benjy's steadfast loyalty and her song about Gonzo that just made it riveting. I just love the discord he brings to just the show in general.

* The Top 5: It was fine before, but bringing in Wack Packers to sing it was a funny twist.

Not working:
* Howard writing musicals - It's not fun or funny. It's never been fun or funny. It never will be fun or funny.

* Howard doing math: I could see it being an in the moment quick joke, but he keeps doing it over and over and over.

* The ""Celebrities"" that call in: Most of the time they are just plain not funny and go for the easy, lazy jokes. I know people are theorizing that some of them are tape and that would be eve more disappointing.

* Complaining about the Khaleesi not getting naked: Now, I love boobs as much as the next guy, but a conversation about GoT can't happen without Howard talking about that for 5 minutes. Yes, Howard, let's hear your theory about why she's not topless as much and what you would tell her if she gave a shit. There's much more nudity out there. Plus it's not like she hasn't been nude before! Frustrating.

* General lack of games: I'm not looking for Intern Beauty pageants or Lord of the Anal Rings, just something, anything, that makes listening a little more active. I miss Win Fred's Money.

* Big time interviews: OK, this one is complicated. I guess, I just don't see him as the amazing interviewer people think he is. Do you have to ask every person about ""orgying"" or all the ass someone got when they were younger. I guess, I just want to know more about them as a person and less about their sex life and their net worth (one thing Howard refuses to talk about ironically enough.) But stupid questions like, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" ""Did you get a boner?"" just rub me the wrong way. I dunno, maybe I'm just being too sensitive about it.

* His hatred of podcasts: Illogical. I know he is old but saying you want to do a radio show is like saying ""I want to write for a newspaper."" I know ""everyone"" has a podcast these days but I believe it comes from a place of jealousy. He had to work so hard to get to where he is and now these people can say whatever they want into a microphone and maybe get an audience. Radio stations are being closed, reformatted and using mostly syndicated content (something he is familiar with). Podcasts allow people to produce the exact content they want with little or no restrictions. For some people they can make a living on them. For others it's just a hobby, or just for fun, or just a creative outlet. They don't want to be a ""broadcaster."" It just comes off stodgy and bad.

* The general lack of communication: We know very little about a show thats on the air 4 hours at a time, not to mention 2 stations running 24 hours a day. It took me a while to find out HTV died, and that certain people were let go (Tracy, Lisa G, etc) Not that we need to know everything (people should be allowed to have a little privacy), but when people like that go, it'd be nice to at least put out something about it? I dunno, again, I might be tantruming.

I know I'm missing things for both lists. I still love the show and won't stop listening, but it felt good to write these out at least. "

Throwaway, because she reddits.


I'm out of state for work, and my girlfriend and I decided that it'd be a good idea for her to come with me. I rented a house cheap, and we figured that cohabitation for the 2 months or so I'd be working would be good for us. Currently, we're about 4 weeks into it.


We fight about twice a week and it's driving me crazy. She gets agitated by the smallest things. I think part of it is that she's struggled in finding short-term employment, so she's stuck in a house alone for 11-13 hours a day while I'm working and maybe longer if I'm out with other interns, or staying late for OT.
Despite this knowledge, I feel like I'm going mad. She gets on my case for insignificant things, like unplugging charging cords because it wastes electricity, even though she'll leave the air conditioning blasting in rooms she's not in.


On days when we're super affectionate, or have sex, things are great. Otherwise we fluctuate wildly between ""normal"", ""tolerable"". Otherwise we're arguing. Furthermore, her emotions seem to be front and center in our interactions. I try to be empathetic, but honestly, I feel like some of the things that she gets hurt about are petty at best and her working herself into a mood at worst.
Yesterday, before bed [NSFW incoming] I felt a bit horny. She'd been sick all day, so instead of asking for help from her, I went to the second bathroom downstairs, so she wouldn't have to hear my porn. I come upstairs afterwards, and she's waiting, asking why I was downstairs for so long. After I tell her, she immediately gets quiet and storms out, to sit on the stairs and cry.


I get up to comfort her, (mind you it's already late) and ask her what's wrong. All she could say is that she's feeling ""something"" but doesn't know what. She starts to analyze why I went downstairs instead of asking her, and I tell her it's just because she was sick and I felt like going downstairs. No huge rhyme or reason to it. Thinking it's settled, I head to bed.


Cue her waking me out of my bed several times, calling me an asshole, or saying how I should just go sleep on the couch if I want peace and quiet so I can sleep (mind you, I'm the only one paying rent atm). I ask groggily and nicely repeatedly, turning off the lights only to have them turned on again, until I snap out of my sleep for the 4th time and scream at her to leave me the fuck alone.


She breaks down, and the last thought I have before drifting off is that I could care less at this point. Flash to today, I left her sleeping. She hasn't texted and I don't want to go home to her yet. I actually want overtime so I can avoid it. I hate that I screamed at her, but her grievances have gotten so petty and her emotions so sensitive, that I can't seem to care.


I need help. I have 6 more weeks of this and I'm finding it harder to genuinely care about her concerns. I have empathy for her, because I love her, and yet the more we argue and the more her feelings get hurt, the less I seem to care. Am I an asshole? What should I do?

**tl;dr GF and I fought because I masturbated.**"

I'm a cash-strapped college kid who doesn't shop much because I can't afford it. I have a summer internship and not many professional clothes. My dad has taken pity on me and is taking me shopping to fix this. 

Only thing is, I'm planning on losing 10-15ish pounds starting on July 1st. Currently I am ~140-145ish depending on the day. 5'9, 36-29-38. After the weight loss I assume I will probably return to pre-weight gain measurements, 36-25-37.  

So obviously, the ideal solution would be to wait until after I've finished losing the weight to go shopping. However, I need clothes right now for my internship, and I'm also afraid that backing out of this particular shopping trip will result in no trip happening at all, especially with how ambiguous the ""end"" of weight loss is. My dad is well off and can afford to/is willing to buy me everything I'm currently lacking in my business dress, so I really don't wanna miss a golden opportunity. With the way our schedules match up, it's very realistic that we wouldn't be able to reschedule this trip until possibly next summer... and I do not want to spend another year without any professional clothes, it's always really stressful for me to try and cobble together a professional outfit from casual clothes.  

So what do I do? Is it realistic to hope that I can buy clothes that flatter me now and tailor them later? Is tailoring expensive? Will the clothes still look good if I tailor them? Should I buy clothes that I can grow into (or shrink into, I guess)? Is it possible to buy clothes at my current measurements that will still fit well at my new measurements? Should I take the risk and push the trip back? 

Also, before anyone suggests it, it's not an option for him to give me the money to go shopping by myself when I lose the weight either.  

Anyways, any advice on how to approach this would be much appreciated. I would hate to buy a bunch of beautiful clothes only to have them fit poorly a few months later, but I would hate even more to buy a bunch of beautiful, too-small clothes now that never fit because I maybe don't get around to losing weight after all. 

Thanks in advance for any help!  "
3b9ime,12,2015-06-26,Update on job situation,intowl,ACON_Support,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACON_Support/comments/3b9ime/update_on_job_situation/,"So I've been having a little trouble getting a job. I had a job interview today for an entry-level job in my field. I'd say it went pretty well. I did a lot better in the interview overall thanks to the advice you guys and my therapist gave me.

The manager said she's not sure if she wants to hire two part-timers (I want to work part-time because of school) or one full-timer, and that I'll hear back from her next week. Don't know if that excuse is bullshit or not. **(Do they ever just hire you on the spot? Why is it always a ""I'll let you know""??)**

If I don't get the job, I just look at it as job interview practice. I got an offer for an interview for another job (not in my field but that's okay) and I just have to call the manager and follow up on it.

On another note, I just cut ties with my (hopefully) last N (possibly flea-ed) friend/ex due to typical n-manipulation things that were going on. Honestly, I think I was just putting up with it for so long because I have no other friends at the moment, but yeah, that's basically been friendships my whole life: End up with friends with n-like behaviors such as, but not limited to, verbal abuse, violation of boundaries, no regard for my feelings about anything, and I just put up with it because I'm so fucking out of my mind from living at home that I just want an outlet or an escape. Not a really healthy way to have friendships or relationships.

And on top of finding a job, I have to get an internship for school secured in less than a month or else I can't even attend school in the fall! But I'm a little more confident that I can accomplish that now.

It just feels like a lot, but although I'm doing it alone, I have my cats who help me so much. I'm looking forward to just having a job and being able to have money to buy things. I have odd sleep patterns and bouts of time when I'm too depressed to get out of bed, so that makes me nervous about having a job with set hours, but I'm getting better at handling that, and it's becoming a rarer and rarer occurrence. I'm just going to take it as it comes.

Thanks for listening."

I just graduated in May, passed my boards, and have been scheduled to work my first shift ever as a solo pharmacist overnight (10pm-8am) at one of the big chain stores tomorrow night. I have been an intern at this chain for about 6 months while on rotations and there is no extra training because I was already an intern. I have also searched SDN and this subreddit for advice but have not found anything comprehensive enough to keep my nervousness at bay.

My question is what should I expect and be expected to accomplish in the overnight shift/first ever shift as a pharmacist? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks and Be Well.

EDIT: Thanks for the great advice, I'll be sure to update after my shift!

POST SHIFT EDIT: So things went fairly well last night although I'm unsure if I gave a bunch of people rhabdo or not. 

Being sole in charge wasn't too bad. At some points i the night it was dead and I kept busy with refills, delete lists, restocking OTC, robots, etc... I did not have a single Norco script overnight which seemed different from what I was expecting. The morning rush started at about 5:30 when a bunch of DURs/scripts came up in the system at once and continued until the end of my shift at 8 am. The problems that were coming up, I was able to handle and all of the overnight pharmacists were a great help when I needed them. It felt weird to verify after typing the script because I KNEW I picked the right things but I was not necessarily looking at it with a fresh pair of eyes. Thank you to the reddit community for helping prepare me for my first shift, I definitely utilized your advice.

A couple of notes: got a MAJOR DUR for Keflex (allergy) and Tessalon pearls? Tons of DURs for some combination of gemfibrozil/fenofibrate and statins that I had to use the patient's profile to override but the risk of rhabdo still scares me. Also citalopram DURs: is there any reason someone would be on citalopram and venlafaxine at the same time?"

He's not the tallest, or the biggest, or the best in bed, but he's such a sweetheart. So when he had to go to a different school a few hours away for grad school you were a bit upset, but so far the long distance thing hasn't been so bad. YOu talk on the phone all the time, skype and he tries to come down every month or so. Sure there's tons of guys giving you attention, and sure you definitely miss the sex. But once Spring Break comes, you'll be able to party together! Or so you thought. A few days before Spring Break Scott calls and tells you that he's stuck at his internship and won't be able to come down for your Spring Break trip to the beach.

Now that you've already got a hotel room booked down by the beach you figure you might as well use it. Have a few drinks, wear that hot bikini you just bought. Maybe even do a little innocent flirting with a hot [guy](http://41.media.tumblr.com/b9bb927da91bd1b42a96e12c793cc833/tumblr_npa38824Uk1tqfle8o1_500.jpg) you'll probably never see again...


Hey hey! Looking for someone to play a college aged female for some wild Spring Break fucking! 

To get a little bit more specific maybe you meet a guy at a wild hotel room party while you're trying coke for the first time...

Maybe you're on the boat on the lake getting wild with the girls when 

Really love to work cheating, booze and drugplay into scenes. Also love dirty talk, and this particular scene will probably have a bit of a cuckhold vibe for poor Scott :(  Not into noncon, pain, bathroom stuff or gore.

 I like to use pics to sort of set the mood during scenes, so hopefully you're into that! Open to playing through messages or chatzy or however else works for ya.

So if you're ready to make your boyfriend all kinds of nervous hit me up!

#/r/cscareerquestions 

**49,002 subscribers for 4 years!**

So we are reaching the end of my programming themed days.. But what better way to end it than jumping into the most important part of all! JOB! CAREER! QUESTIONS!

Computer science is a very famous field of work today. People get paid a lot, there is always demand, innovation everywhere.. Truly one of the flagships of today's information age. But this leaves people with lots of questions regarding jobs, cost of study, internship questions, culture questions and many many more.

I dont think any field is easy. If you do well, you will get to eat the fruit. But to get to the fruit a solid path is needed. r/cscareerquestions helps you solve atleast some part of that path. They have a lot of questions answered and I would really suggest everyone to use the search bar! (I know reddit search sucks but hey u could still use some keywords! :D) 



I always suggest to **do your homework and read the FAQ/wiki before asking**. It helps you get better answers and lets people know that you are asking a genuine question and they will be more enthusiastic to answer it! :)



Career building is a long process which takes tons of time and work. its not easy. But its not impossible either. Gather information from forums, talk to people, build the knowledge base and move on. 

Keep calm and raise the sails!

Here is a small interview with the mods! :)






&gt;#1. What motivates you to moderate this sub ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** I like being part of that community, helping other people and contributing to the sub. Since I'm here often I might as well help with modding.

&gt;#2. How would you suggest people getting into computer science to go forward ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** Only get in the field if you're passionate, going in for money is a pretty risky move. It's not a 9-5 career, you're strongly encouraged to learn in your free time as well to progress in your career. Easy comfy jobs exist too, but they put you at risk of becoming obsolete. Also, the first job out of school is hard to get, so make sure you have a top-notch profile at that point (do NOT avoid internships), once you're already in the field with some experience, it gets easier to find jobs.



&gt;#3. What would you say is the biggest mistake people do when researching questions ?

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** A lot of ""bad"" questions are due to the fact that people don't know what they don't know, which isn't always their fault. But generally, try to have a global understanding of the problem and project, if you're too close to the code (this line doesn't work), you'll be missing out on a lot of things that could help you elsewhere.

&gt;#4. Anything you would like to say to your present and future subscribers ? 

&gt;&gt;**CriticDanger:** Try not to ask questions that have been answered 100 times already, use the search. Also, don't just post a question, read the answers and leave. Participate with the community and especially in a thread you've created. Don't post a question if you'll be AFK for the next 24h.





Have an awesome week everyone!

3ba7wi,0,2015-06-27,"[Colorado Springs, CO] Need Help Becoming Fully Independent As I Finish College",StarshadesJack,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/3ba7wi/colorado_springs_co_need_help_becoming_fully/,"I was a bit hesitant posting here but I thought I may as well explore all possible options. Sorry ahead of time for the wall of text.

Currently, I am a super-super-junior trying to finally get through college in the next 2-2.5 years (graduate with a BS in computer science). Unfortunately, the situation is kind of precarious.

Foremost, I am currently unemployed. I used to work full time and then part-time as a paid intern in the DoD-contracted sector; however, I've had to step down because I can't feasibly take a full college load (12-15 credit hours) *and* be able to work the minimum part-time hours (~16/wk).

I cannot reduce my college load because I *need* to graduate in 2-2.5 years. I'm almost 24 years old and I'm type-1 diabetic. When I hit 26, I will no longer be insurable under family insurance and it does not look like I could easily afford useful insurance on my savings for very long. Ergo, I can't really take my sweet time.

So, here's the problem: At the moment, my family is paying my rent, food, and internet bills while I personally put myself through college by taking out a *lot* of federal tuition loans. Unfortunately, this is hardly a gesture of good will on their part. The relationship between myself and my family is extremely stressful and (to me) borderline abusive. I can't count the number of times I've broken down crying or stressed myself ill over the constant threats and blackmail thrown at me under penalty of complete withdrawal of support. While it has been all bark and no bite so far, I don't want to assume this is set in stone. I'm falling more and more out of favor with my family and I'm dreading that the bite will eventually become reality.

Simply put, I'm asking for help in affording the $600/mo (about $15,000 overall for the next ~2 years) it'd take to pay rent/food/internet ($485/mo for rent, $60-90/mo per internet [depends on how well I haggle XFinity's baloney], and the rest for food) so I can break free from them and maybe not be a crippling mass of anxiety and depression and fear. And, of course, no longer have to worry about potentially becoming homeless or screwing myself long term with the insurance problem.

**I'm not asking for just blind charity, though.** For a while now, I've been spending whatever free time I have and/or can allocate drawing webcomics and recently started up a Patreon for it (though I'm only making $22/mo; I'm no Jeph Jacques). In essence, I'm asking for help becoming independent and, in return, offering stupid comics that maybe might entertain some people.
Here's the link: https://www.patreon.com/IdiotNonoriri

I'm sorry if it sounds like pandering or asking for pity money or whatever. I'm just getting close to wit's end, honestly. I just want to be done with college and get a real job and not have to worry.

Also, I guess a few more general points I feel I should elaborate on:

* I can't use tuition loans to pay for anything other than tuition. I don't physically handle it. It just goes from the loan people to the uni directly.
* I cannot empirically confirm it but I'm fairly certain I couldn't take out a loan from anywhere else for this because I have *no credit* whatsoever. I can't even get a *credit card*.
* $485/mo renting a room in a house is a LOT cheaper than trying to live on campus. By a long shot.
* I generally aim to draw one comic strip per week, an effort that takes anywhere from 3-8 hours and is something I can flex across a whole week (or longer if necessary). Also, I can easily relegate drawing to weekends. I don't have this kind of flexibility working a ""real"" job and I definitely couldn't work weekends at my prior employment.
* I can't deny that I'm just not... ""good enough"". There are plenty of people who have done the full time college plus work thing. Sadly, I'm just not one of them. So I guess it wouldn't be fair to say this isn't at least partly my fault.
* I only have about $10k in savings as I had only worked for about a year.
* So far, it seems likely that my family not having to pay these bills doesn't also mean them taking me off insurance. They are apparently sensible enough in that regard. It's always an incomprehensible mess of bipolar *what-is-even-going-on-here* but suffice it to say that's a gift horse I *won't* look in the mouth....

Again, sorry if this doesn't really belong here. And thank you for reading. I appreciate any advice or help that anyone can pass along. If there's anything else I should elaborate on, please let me know."

Best Buy has a sale on Macs right now. Pretty much all models are on sale. The 15"" unit usually goes for $2000 but it was listed at $1900 since it is $100 off until next week. If you have a .edu e-mail address you get an additional $100 off. Also, I recently moved in with my parents for the summer due to an internship and the post office gave me some coupons for 10% off at Best Buy. Turns out you can get the coupon online as well if you register to change your address: https://moversguide.usps.com/icoa/home/icoa-main-flow.do?execution=e1s1&amp;_flowId=icoa-main-flow&amp;

So, turns out the guys at the computer section of the store wouldn't let me use both coupons. I ended up telling them I would be more comfortable taking the laptop up front to check out, and they let me. I guess they thought I would try and steal the computer though as two guys were following me all the way to the front check out counters, eyeing me the entire time I was there. The check out guy was chill and didn't know anything about coupon stacking so he just scanned them both and they went through. Final price was $1619.

So yeah, if you are looking to buy a Mac now is a good time!"

3bbef0,333,2015-06-27,Swedish Mombie tries to get me to overlook policy by talking about her baby,alcoholic_dinosaur,childfree,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3bbef0/swedish_mombie_tries_to_get_me_to_overlook_policy/,"A little background on this so that it makes more sense: I currently do customer service for Airbnb. I have a situation where a young adult, 18-20 I would imagine, booked a room with a host in Sweden where he is doing a 2 month long internship. When he arrived, he was placed into a room that was different than the one he booked, although in the same building. The only thing is that this room is above a hot yoga studio and has no windows for fresh air.

Airbnb policy states that if the host doesn't put the guest in the room that the guest actually booked, it's considered misclassified and the guest is entitled to a full refund. The guest tried to stick it out for a few nights but had to find another place to stay because it was ridiculously hot. I don't blame him at all! He was even willing to pay for an entire week even though he didn't stay there for a week after all.

When I tried to talk to the host about it she was pretty adamantly against refunding them anything at all. After a few emails that I sent to her reiterating that she broke policy, she breaks out her 'ace in the hole' saying that she doesn't ""have much time 
to write right now"" and that I will have to wait until Monday for her response...while proceeding to write several paragraphs about how she won't refund her guest and that her guests we lying to me. She goes on to talk about how she has a baby in one arm and is typing with the other and how she needs to stop replying so that she put her baby to sleep and get some sleep herself because she is just SO exhausted and can't possibly say anything else.

I responded saying that she confirmed she put them in a different room, it's against policy point blank, and I'm refunding her guest everything but the cost of a week's stay as the guest offered to pay it.

Poor girl, no sympathy for mombies from me."

I'm am very new to all of this (actuarial stuff) - and know nothing about computers. I just had my first internship working as a data analyst and have only passed exam P, studying for FM. I want something strong enough to deal with larger data sets for the future, but nothing too crazy - as I don't think I'll be taking full advantage of something more advanced for a while. For now, I am just trying to learn excel and some VBA programming and finding it annoying to deal with the differences on my mac vs. a PC. Advice please! Budget ~ $1200. Thanks in advance!"
3bbime,1,2015-06-27,need help with getting healthcare. 18 male.,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bbime/need_help_with_getting_healthcare_18_male/,"hello friends.

I'm 18 years old, unemployed, living with my parents (attending college).

My dad makes 25,000 a year. My mother is unemployed. My sister is attending a liberal arts college (5 grand a year). I'm attending community college to save money. 

Basically, I've been getting this weird feeling that someone in my family is going to be sick. I know, it's weird, but my intuition is telling me that I need to get my parents and everyone else checked out as soon as possible. No one is symptomatic, but my gut is telling me that health insurance should be our main priority right now.

My family was in around 70,000 debt. Over the course of high school, I hustled and worked my ass off to pay this off (I tutored, sold drugs, sold game entertainment systems, did other people's homework, wrote college essays [not proud of this one], worked three jobs, etc). Basically, I was able to cut the debt in half, and my sister, mom and father covered the other half. 

So now, for the first time in 20 years my parents are debt free and we feel fucking amazing. It's like we've emerged from the depths of some horrifyingly tumultuous ocean and breathed fresh air for the first time in eons. The only thing we need to pay off is my sister's car, but that's not going to be a problem.

My mom is trying to find work, and my sister got a sweet internship that will pay 4k over 10 weeks. I can't work right now, because I'm hauling ass with school (I took 24 units in the spring, 13 in the summer, and I'm going to be taking another 26 units in the fall). I tried to work in the spring while attending school and I barely pulled off working 15 hours a week while taking 24 units and getting straight A's. I cannot feasibly do this again in the fall for the sake of my own mental stability. 

But back to the main issue. I haven't had a doctor's check up in 5 years. I've found a fuckton of moles on my body (I'm low key paranoid that I have skin cancer). I want to see a doctor asap, but since I'm under Medi-cal I haven't found a primary care physician that is willing to see me (in the local area). 

I'm lost, I really am. I have no idea how to handle health insurance. While I'm the ""man"" of the family and the general caretaker (I've been in charge of all finances for a while, and most ""managerial"" decisions due to my father's absence), I'm totally oblivious in this area of life. I really wish high school prepared you better for these kinds of things.

I'm focusing on the positives right now. We're debt free, we have food and a stable place to live. I'm thinking about getting food stamps to help out more. We're not on ANY form of public assistance or welfare other than medical (that I'm aware of). My parents aren't US citizens, and they don't have social security. 

I would like for some advice on how to proceed. If you've made it this far, I'd like to express my gratitude for your time and consideration. Have a great day!  "

I have developed an interest in IT and want to go in this field. I self taught myself some basic programming(java, python), security, networking (currently working on my CCNA R&amp;S) and some basic Linux.
But I have no real experience in any of these though. Nor do I have any sort of certifications. What I am doing is getting fly by overview of 3-4 certifications instead of just digging into one certification as I am short of time and money(working at some survival jobs at present )

I found the data center field as the best of both worlds, some electrical stuff form my engineering background and IT stuff which I am currently interested in.

So I've decided to get some entry level experience. Can you guys recommend as to what kind of and what roles shall i go for or what should I learn prior to working. Shall I go for some internship or tier 1 job. Where would I learn more. 
I'm in canada and will be living in India for 1-2 years and I want to utilize my time there. As I thought it would be better to gain some real experience instead of just getting some certification.

I'm hoping you guys might be able to help me out here with these Battlelog issues. 

Firstly, when accessing the Battlelog function in-game on the PS4 I'm met with a bunch of broken images (boxed question marks) instead of whatever emblems or icons are supposed to be there. Sure, it's a relatively inconsequential issue, but broken images aren't the kind of thing one would expect in to find in a best-selling AAA title from a group like DICE, like they hosted their images on a Photobucket account that's now expired because the intern forgot to renew the membership.  It's like if you walked in on your grandparents making out on the couch; at the end of the day it's really not a big deal, but it's super awkward and embarrassing to see, and I'd rather not have to look at it given the choice. Is this a known issue with a fix? 

Secondly, and more importantly, I'm unable to access the Battlescreen feature of the Battlelog app on either my Android phone or tablet.  I've followed the instructions and tried different methods, tried joining a match on my PS4 and then going to the app, tried joining a match through the app first, etc. It's not that it won't load or connect, but that the option to use the feature never even comes up for me on either device. The little Battlescreen button that's supposed to pop up on the blue bar at the bottom just doesn't appear, and nothing I've tried so far will cause it to show up. The rest of the app appears to be working just fine. The Battlescreen seems like a really nice tool that I'd love to try, but it's as if the feature itself doesn't even exist as far as my Battlelog app is concerned. Has anyone else had this issue recently and been able to find a fix for it? I know people were having some trouble with it when it first launched but from what I've been able to find it seems as though that was addressed long ago and I haven't found any useful information on this from within the past year. 

Any and all help is greatly appreciated!"

This community has been a helpful bunch and I hope that somebody could clarify this!

Currently I'm finishing army and I'm applying for part time SIM GE course in Bachelor of Information Technology (Computing) in the Uni of Wollongong and I was looking at the exemption for advance standing (skip year) and my course wasn't in it. 

Backstory: I took Dip in Information Technology (Game Dev) and didn't do very well because I didn't really like the course and was in the rebellious stage of  adolescence, motorbiking and part-time job this and that. I woke up my idea and has been working hard towards becoming a web developer. Taking up internships before NS and a little freelancing around and still learning at every chance i get. My GPA was very ""un-colorful"" so other universities isn't much an option and I would prefer part-time to look for a job and pursue my career!

I don't consider my programming skills to be up there but I feel confident and thinking of appealing for advance standing, I wouldn't mind the interview process. But I'm not even sure if it's possible to appeal for adv-standing and hoping to lighten my load for my parents who are going to pay for it.

Hopefully somebody has gone through this process or has information. It would be really helpful! I might call up but it's the Sunday!

**TLDR;** Poly course not eligible to skip uni years, hopeful to appeal for it."
3bbukp,2,2015-06-27,I have a B.S; good idea to go back for a Bachelor's in Geography?,qAutoAttack,geography,https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/3bbukp/i_have_a_bs_good_idea_to_go_back_for_a_bachelors/,"**Background:** I currently have a B.S. in Geology and discovered my love for GIS/programming pretty late into my degree. I'm doing an internship at a mining company at the moment, and I can't help but feel pigeonholed. After almost two months here i'm already sick of the corporate bull-shit and the amount of mindless grunt work involved in this job. So far I've clicked a few data points in AutoCAD and entered some numbers in a database, not counting shoveling dirt in the heat most of the time.

Anyway, I'm really considering the BA in Geog because it offer GIS programming/automation classes with python, and a wealth of database and workshop classes. Even so, most, if not all entry level jobs in my area require a degree in Geography, Environmental Science/Comp. Science at the very least. I feel like if I apply anyway, I won't have the leverage like others because I've only taken two GIS classes in my undergrad. I am currently finishing the Python course at CodeAcademy and will be taking some SQL/web development classes at a community college in the meantime. I will have to apply to the BA as post-bacc given that I already have a degree.

I'm 22 years old, no loans, money saved up from my current job, and only 55 credits left to complete the BA so I can knock that out in a year. So, why not?

Basically I'm itching to go back to school. I want to switch from Geology completely and pursue GIS/programming exclusively to work near my home city (Seattle). Is it worth going for another Bachelors and minor in computer science on top of my B.S.?"

Ruud began his career in the Dutch leagues. He started with Den Bosch at age 17 in 1993 and played for the club for four years scoring 17 goals. He then moved to Heerenveen where he scored 13 goals in just one season. At this point, Ruud was maturing physically and as a student of the game, and he transferred to Philips Sport Vereniging (PSV). He played three seasons at PSV Eindhoven, scoring 62 goals overall and building a name that would attract the attention of Manchester United.


.


**Manchester United:**



A deal with Manchester was initially in place in 2000 but prevented by injuries that Ruud had sustained while the negotiations were ongoing. The teams eventually finalized the deal in 2001, and after clearing a medical, Ruud signed a five-year contract worth £19 million, which, at the time, was a British record. With that contract came a great deal of pressure, but Ruud’s first season was a rousing success. He scored 23 goals in 32 games and earned Player of the Year honors. 



Ruud netted 36 goals in his debut season, a frightening achievement that was incredibly eclipsed in the 2002/03 season as he scored 44 times to inspire United to the Premiership title. Another 30 goals followed in his third season. Meaning Ruud had scored 100 goals in his first 3 seasons, an incredble amount.


Injury ruined his 2004/05 campaign, although he still scored 16 goals in 27 appearances and finished top scorer in the Champions League with eight goals. Compare this to our highest goalscorer of last season (14/15), Rooney who only managed 14 the whole full season, this alone is pretty incredible.



2005/06 campaign was tempered with disappointment and upset. Ten goals in 12 games saw Ruud get off to a flyer. But by December he had 17 goals from 26 starts. But the return to form and fitness of Louis Saha saw van Nistelrooy edged out of the side. He was an unused substitute in the Carling Cup final win and wasn’t included in the squad to face Charlton on the final day of the season, with Sir Alex citing issues around “the spirit of the club” as the reason for Ruud’s exclusion.The Dutch striker left Old Trafford in the summer of 2006 and headed to Spain to join Real Madrid.During five seasons at Old Trafford, Ruud compiled 95 goals in 150 appearances and became the club’s all-time European goal scorer.

**Controversy:**


*The dutch man was subject to many controversies, such as:*


[Being pinnacle in the famous ""Battle of Old Trafford"":](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1dfphE6jOs)

In the 0–0 draw on 21 September 2003, later dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford, Van Nistelrooy was at the centre of one of the most infamous incidents of the Arsenal–Manchester United rivalry. After missing a last-minute penalty that would have won the game for United, Van Nistelrooy was attacked by Martin Keown, prompting a melee involving several players from both sides; five Arsenal players including Keown received various bans and fines, while the club itself received a record fine of £175,000. Earlier in the game, he had been fouled by Patrick Vieira, who was sent off for a second bookable offence. Vieira and his manager Arsène Wenger both accused Van Nistelrooy of cheating and stamping on Vieira, prompting a vociferous defence by Alex Ferguson.



[Ruffling many feathers by attacking ex-United wonderkid, the one and only Cristiano Ronaldo:](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/21/ruud-van-nistelrooy-apologises-ferguson-united)

On 9 May 2006, Setanta Sports reported that Van Nistelrooy's exclusion from the squad was due to a training session fight between him and team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo. Van Nistelrooy allegedly criticised Ronaldo's tendency to hold onto the ball instead of passing to his team-mates, which sparked the fight, after which Van Nistelrooy remarked, ""Go crying to your daddy."" The article claimed that this was not a reference to Ronaldo's father (who had died earlier in the season), but to United's Portuguese assistant coach, Carlos Queiroz.



[Or finally, going full black face:](http://www.itv.com/news/2013-01-07/ruud-van-nistelrooy-sparks-controversy-after-blacking-up/)

This one doesn't need explaining I think.


.


**Post United:**



After the 2005-06 season, Van Nistelrooy left Manchester United and signed a three-year contract with Real Madrid at age 30. In his first season with Real, Ruud scored a hat trick in his second game, earned the league’s Pichichi honor with 25 goals scored and helped the team win the La Liga title. Ruud played three more seasons with Real, extending his initial contract by a year, and scored 46 goals overall.


Ruud then played a season with Hamburger SV in 2010-11, scoring 12 goals, and with Málaga in 2011-12, scoring four goals. After the 2011-12 season, with age and injuries catching up with him, Ruud announced retirement. Van Nistelrooy focuses on his children, daughter Moa Annette and son Liam, and his charity organization, SOS Children’s Villages.


In June 2013, Van Nistelrooy joined PSV as a coaching intern working with the under-17s. And then in March 2014 it was announced that Van Nistelrooy will be assisting Guus Hiddink in his duty as manager of the Netherlands national team.


.


**International:**



Van Nistelrooy made his Netherlands debut in 1998 and went on to score 33 goals in 64 internationals for them, leaving him joint third all-time top scorer for his country. He announced his retirement from international football in 2007, before being persuaded to play again, but announced his retirement again in 2008 after the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament. Van Nistelrooy came out of international retirement again in September 2010,when he was selected by coach Bert van Marwijk to replace the injured Robin van Persie for two qualification matches in the group of the Netherlands for EURO 2012 against San Marino and Finland.



.


**Quote:**



“It was a dream come true – I signed for Manchester United,”


“I only wanted to play for United, although Real Madrid came in for me. Manchester United were always on my mind first. Finally the deal is done – one year after. It is incredible a club like Manchester United can wait for a player for so long. It gives me such a warm feeling. This is a dream come true. One year ago my life was going down. Now it’s going up. This Friday, I will go to Manchester and meet the fans. I am confident we can build something beautiful at United.”


""Once you have played for United, the rest don’t count anymore. All I want to do is spend as much time of my career at United as possible before I eventually return home and bring the curtain down on my career at PSV.""


""Losing is not in my vocabulary.""


“When we played the final in the Carling Cup, that’s when I started to feel unhappy. My relationship with Ferguson had ended which was very painful. He did a lot for me, waiting for me while I was injured then giving me the chance to play and giving me confidence. But what happened, happened. A good relationship ended. It was very disappointing for me.”


""It pains me that I have to leave this fantastic club, and I will be 


moving on to a new club, but Manchester United will always have a place in my heart""


""Two or three times every year I would think to myself what a shame it was that it had ended like it did with Ferguson.""

Thank you very much for reading, I'm glad I had the opportunity to write this about a player that I have always idolised."
3bcoq8,7,2015-06-27,"[28M4F] Regulatory Capture, a tale of love?",variable_frequency,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3bcoq8/28m4f_regulatory_capture_a_tale_of_love/,"I was a child of New York City.  Born and raised by a loving family that had scraped their way to a small house, and a good education for their son.  Like many of my friends, being educated in the city and having found the language of math compelling, the siren's call of high finance rang in my ears.  On paper, my knowledge of statistics, of arcane computer languages, and the way I quickly and decisively took opportunities made me the model candidate for any of the largest investment banks.  But, as an intern, I found myself repulsed.  I was overworked, hazed, and would listen to the kind of opinions that, if acted on, would deny even my hardworking parents of their retirement and well-being.

Graduating just as the latest house of cards, of bets against bets, of risk-hedging in the darkest of markets.  Shadow banks and immaterial holdings.  Liquidity in name only.  I saw what had become of my parents' savings.  The way land was grabbed by the richest just as millions were underwater on their homes.

I chose a different path.  The Securities and Exchange Commission seemed ideal, the perfect career of someone whose heart bled for those that suffered and burned for those who caused this catastrophe.  I was embedded within one of the larger firms, still picking up its pieces with the help of Uncle Sam's loans and the watchful eye of in-house observers like myself.  It wasn't hard to find problems.  Poor accounting practices.  Small cases of insider trading.  Drug use.  That was the most prevalent.  High-grade drugs to keep bankers working their 120 hour weeks when they needed to meet monthly numbers.

I saw it all, reported it all, and heard nothing.  My superious enjoyed their two martini lunches with vice presidents, their flutes of Cristal and late nights downtown.  They liked having friends in high places, higher than some lowly government title within a vast machine, an edifice left to rot.  

There were no flutes of Cristal for me.  Not when I was reporting each and every irregularity, causing trouble for my superiors.  ""PIssing in the well"" they would tell me.  I stood out like a sore thumb, even the most well-tailored 400 dollar suit looks conspicuous next to men in 2000 dollar suits.  You start to feel isolated.  Work purposefully obscured from me, socially ostracized even when I treated everyone with respect.

But then I saw you again.  The same discerning smile, the same gaze piercing straight through me.  Making your way up, working late every night, fending off the advances of your peers.  FIghting for your own slice of the pie.  

I remember our nights so many years ago, laying on the hood of that wreck of a car I drove, gazing up at the night sky and asking each other what our hopes were for the future.  There were those late nights in my dorm where I saw your skin silhouetted by the glow of the city for the first time, unblemished and pure.  The way you'd hold me tightly before an important day.  

The way we kissed when it felt our lives were diverging.  Our bodies so reluctant to part even then.  It wasn't a distance of miles, but a distance of minds.  Something hardened me in college, my passions intensified but my emotions were a cold fire, one that lost what it meant to make one person happy.  

Here you were, back again in my life, five years later just as beautiful as I had left you.  There had been women after you but never women like you.  You had haunted me as an idea and now here you were, haunting me once more as flesh and blood.  I had never expected a call from you at one in the morning, woken from a restless sleep in my tiny studio by the buzz of my phone....

So, something a bit different for you all.  I've found myself restless, especially over the past few weeks and had a lot on my mind so I write these for the hell of it.  Who you are and what you've become is up to you.  Have you fallen into the debauched, money and pleasure-chasing culture of finance, or are you a whistleblower in need of a friendly face to help?  You can take a look at my post history for more information about myself but really, this is open-ended so I am curious to see what comes of this."
3bcqfu,24,2015-06-27,Advice to myself about breaking up...,dem_cakes,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/3bcqfu/advice_to_myself_about_breaking_up/,"We were together since Jan 2014, and we went long distance in September of that year. We ended up breaking up in April this year; I had seen him once after he moved away. 

A few things I would tell myself if I was in that situation again: 

* It's not always bad because of the distance. I've seen on this subreddit, and from people I know in real life, that you **can** make it work. 

In my relationship I attributed a lot of things to because of the distance. If it wasn't the distance, it was the 3-hour time difference. If he slept in super late until noon his time everyday, it was because I was three hours ahead that we'd only start talking when my day is half over. Oh, he's not super communicative and doesn't ask me any questions? It'll definitely get better in person because it was so good before! It's because he's experiencing all this new stuff far away. 

* People change and that's alright. 

He made new friends in LA and his lifestyle changed, and I started a new internship where I was meeting a bunch of people as well. I think I just always held in my mind that he's still the same person he was when he left, and when we hung out every single day when that wasn't the case for either of us. 

* When you try and communicate about what you want without it going anywhere... it's not always best to just ""wait until we're together in person"". 

Sometimes if nothing gets resolved even after you've brought it up multiple times, if it's important to you, it's going to stay important to you. I posted about what happened on this subreddit once, and literally ALL the comments were telling me to break up with him. But I was still like no no, maybe if we speak about this in person, maybe if he sees me again, we'll go back to before when it was awesome! This was a terrible thought process for me because I just got extremely resentful towards him. 


* After you're together for a while, you learn more about them, or you learn more about yourself, about what you want and can give and vice versa. Sometimes this is a deal-breaker, and it's OK to have those! Standards are not bad. 

Since we only spent 8 months together before he left, it's possible we were still in the Honeymoon stage. I was deeply in love with him and had all the thoughts of ""wow it can't get better than this!"", ""wow I will never again meet someone like this"", ""he makes me so comfortable to be myself"". After he left though, I got more time to assess what I wanted (for example having my hand held in public, or given a kiss occasionally at a music event) and what he couldn't offer. It's the same on his side too, he wanted someone who wasn't super keen on being affectionate, and I realized that wasn't something I could do for him. 


* If you're searching on r/longdistance about breakups hoping to find one saying it's ok to break up, you're probably going to want to break up. 

Because most of the results I read said, ""talk to your SO, you can do it!"", I really took it to heart about not giving up. But I think personally, I took it too far. I talked to him, and when that didn't work, I still held on to the whole don't give up part, which I shouldn't have done. I ended up breaking up with him during exams, just because the pressure got so much and I knew I was in a bad relationship. I had been in it unhappily since February, but nothing could be done. In my case, our relationship couldn't be mended because our priorities just didn't match and no amount of talking could convince us otherwise. It was a very civil breakup though, and he's still my friend and I talk to him daily; I harbor no bad feelings towards him. 

* You're not abandoning the relationship/giving up. 

I gave it my all in talking to him about what was making me unhappy, what we could do together to fix it, etc. It didn't end up helping, but oh well! Just like I have a list of what I want in a relationship, he has one too, and that's totally fine to not change. It's not abandoning something if you've tried super hard to make it better, but it just won't. 

* You can be happy again. 

Whether it's someone nearby that you meet in person, or someone who's far from you. Life continues. For me, I had clearly left a relationship I wasn't happy in, and as soon as it was done and I told him I couldn't be with him anymore, i felt **so much lighter**. I did extremely well on my exams and landed an awesome new internship! There's been bad times of course, like recently when I scrolled through my phone pictures and found one of him with my stuffed animals, but there's so much good too. I've met someone (on Tinder no less), who is also quite awesome and is much closer to my desired SO in personality. But I would never have known what I wanted had I not been with my ex. And this will continue to change and change and change. 

~~~

I'm sure that was super repetitive at parts, but this is what I wish I could have read when I searched in this sub for breakup advice. I posted an ""Advice Needed"" post on a throwaway, but thanks all for responding to that. You probably don't know what post I'm referring to, but it really really helped me in realizing I deserve to be in a happy relationship - regardless of distance. 

Best of luck everyone!"
3bd2ec,43,2015-06-27,Don't Obsesses About It,[deleted],AsianMasculinity,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/3bd2ec/dont_obsesses_about_it/,"I've realized how destructive it is to have constant negative thoughts swirling in your head all the time. It's really bad for your mental health, and this negativity impacts every aspect of your life.

While it is extremely important to realize that us Asians are living in a world where we're fighting an uphill battle due to the system, it's still extremely important to have positive thoughts. 

I'm concerned for some brothers in here who take this ""we are oppressed!"" mentality way too far. I don't want to see fellow Asian males live depressed and constantly angry. Yes, there are elements of culture and society out there that inconvenience our lives in many ways. HOWEVER, you can't let negative thoughts and feelings of anger and hopelessness corrode your mind and soul.

As bad as things are, in reality, it's not AS bad as we think everything is. There are many horrible things in the world out there, and EVERY single race has their own unique share of problems. Don't think that the disadvantageous situation is is the END OF THE WORLD. Cause it's FAR from it. Some of the posts on this subreddit exaggerate our problems to a certain extent. Some of these posts make an unnecessarily big deal about things that HONESTLY aren't that bad. 

Yes we will deal with racism, an unfair dating market in the anglosphere due to a skewed media representation of us, and problems with the bamboo ceiling.

HOWEVER. IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. There are people facing extremely horrible problems such as poverty, war, etc. that are FAR worse than the problems we have. I'm not discounting our problems AT ALL. They are serious issues that have to be tackled. Yet if some Asian male clouds his thoughts with negativity, thinking that his WHOLE life is fucked up because of this relatively stupid aspect of life, then THAT's a problem. 

I have a white friend who is tall, charismatic, and who girls say is good looking. He has many things going for him, yet he ALWAYS complains and gripes to me about how he's angry about black males having sex with white women, and that it hurts his chances of getting with more girls. He's constantly bitter about things, and blames a lot of things on his RACE believe it or not! He got rejected from an internship and complained to me that he suspected that it's cause he's WHITE. I read over his resume and cover letter and realized that it was horribly formatted and filled with mistakes. 

What I'm trying to illustrate is that some people can let bitterness (especially towards racial issues) engulf them and lead to a much lower quality of life. You think white guys have it easy? You think only us Asian guys have it that bad? The reality is much different from our perception. Think about how bitter Social Justice Warriors are all the time. Think about how bitter White Nationalists are all the time. Think about how bitter people who think of life through a racial angle are all the time.

It's definitely important to be in tune with reality and how the world really works. However, DON'T LET BITTERNESS ENGULF YOU. There's a quote: ""The best revenge is success."" LIVE A GOOD AND SUCCESSFUL LIFE. You can't live a good and successful life being bitter all the time.

**DO** support your fellow Asian brothers.
**DO** work hard in your life to help our cause in any capacity
**DO** realize the reality of the system
**DO** stand up for yourself and live a happy and successful life
~~
**DON'T** be obsessed about 'how oppressed you are' 
**DON'T** let negativity ruin the quality of your life
**DON'T** think that issues facing Asian American males are the 'end of the world' cause it's FAAAR from it. 

The world is our oyster Asian man. The 21st century is the Asian century. Our race is the most numerous race in the world. We have economic power and rising soft power. Most importantly, we have ""home bases"" in that of our mother countries in Asia that are well-developed and filled to the brim with opportunities. The 'whites' that some of you hate so much don't really have this unique opportunity that so many of us have. 

I'm optimistic about the future. Asians Americans for the most part are just starting out in America. We're JUST starting to establish ourselves in business, media, government, etc. Along with the rising wealth, development, and power in our mother countries as well as the growing power the Asian American community will have, the future will definitely not be as bad as the present. 

LIVE A HAPPY LIFE. DON'T THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THINGS AND TAKE LIFE TOO SERIOUSLY.

3bd58e,3,2015-06-27,What am i doing wrong in looking for a job?,doughyes,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3bd58e/what_am_i_doing_wrong_in_looking_for_a_job/,"I'm sitting here on a Saturday night filling out job applications instead of going out with friends. I'll be doing that tomorrow...and everyday next week too.

I'm waiting for the rejection email to come on monday, letting me know that the media finance job I interviewed for last Thursday went to another candidate, after the recruiter informed me I would be getting a decision the same day/Friday and after confirming salary range, start date, and work authorization, and even taking me on tour of the office  and where I would be sitting. Radio silence on Friday after I sent an email asking for updates; I know the recruiter opened the email but didn't respond from email-tracking software.

This is the 6th rejection after a final round interview in the past month alone. I recently stopped freelancing, and am living off my savings now. I'll be okay for another 2 months, but with all of my freelance work dropped, I don't have anything once my savings run out. I don't have parents I can rely on for help, or any relatives/friends willing to help me financially.

About me: I dropped out of a top-10 ivy undergrad 2 years ago because I couldn't pay tuition for my last semester. I paid for my entire degree to date through freelance work/internships/workstudy and have a 3.7 GPA. My SAT scores are 2300+. I have only 12 credits left, which I plan to finish in 2015-2016 through transfer and research credits from a public school.

My parents are food service workers with no college education, and I'm estranged from them (due to me wanting to go to a school beyond what they could afford).  I took up freelance work to pay for my remaining credits, and also stay in my current city(so I could land a full-time job soon). My degree is in comp sci and econ, and I  have substantial internship experience in accounting,web design+dev, and account management (1.5-3 years for each field). I started freelancing full-time a year ago to make more money for school, but I hated it--I never felt that I belonged to the company culture at any particular client and was working 80 hour weeks regularly to keep up with client demands. I let go of all of my clients a month ago, letting them know I was going to transition into a full time job elsewhere (a mistake in retrospect).

I've interviewed at mostly large digital agencies/media companies and the biggest tech offices on the East Coast(Google, Microsoft, NBC, Etsy,etc.) for entry-level tech, consulting, and finance roles (0-1 year experience). I send thoughtful thank you emails an hour after each interview, and check if my interviewers opened the emails. I even research the Linkedin profiles of the job I interviewed for--almost all are filled by people with less experience and lower academic credentials.  I've always made it to the final round interview, being told I was the top candidate, only to be rejected a few days later. I went into this latest interview expecting the same thing, but the salary and start date chat, along with the hiring managers being OK with my soon-to-be-complete degree, got my hopes up against my better judgement. 

I feel really tired and I want to give up. I lost touch with a lot of my friends from school who have graduated and now have the jobs in tech and finance I thought I would have in 4-5 years ago. I've been sleeping 10-12 hours a day, only getting out of the house for interviews. I keep thinking about how much time I wasted daydreaming about working at all of the places I was rejected from. Most of all, I regret spending tens of thousands of dollars for a degree that hasn't gotten me where I wanted, when I could have gone to a public school, graduated on time, and at least be employed full-time somewhere by now. I don't have a bf, or any close friends because I've been so busy working and worrying about my near future.

What am I doing wrong? Is it my gender (f), ethnicity(Asian), lack of complete degree? Am I too ugly for the jobs I'm applying for? Do I come across as too poor and desperate, and not a good ""cultural fit""? Am I not interesting enough (because I spent all my time working to make ends meet so I couldn't spend time on vogue hobbies like travel)?

And what can I do better? Take the GRE/GMAT? Take more programming/finance classes? Lose weight? Dress better?

Sorry for the long post, I had a lot more to vent about than I thought. Any advice appreciated.

Hugs,

We are in our senior year of college and been friends for 12 years. I'm not sure if our relationship is a good one.

Kim definitely came from a dysfunctional family. Her dad left the family when she was in middle school. Her mom remarried. She didn't have a lot of money, in her family. During middle school, we would have sleepovers. My family would give her food and clothes.

In 9th grade, she was doing independent study. On the weekend, I would come visit her as much as I can. In 10th grade, she went to the same high school as me. I could tell she was getting depressed and told her to look up the symptoms of depression and get help. One day, her mom texted me that Kim was in the hospital because she tried to overdose on pills. After that, I tried to support Kim as much as I could. I would hang out with her, even if we didn't talk while hanging out.

Through 12th grade, she went through therapy and medication. Her family was a main reason of her depression. They didn't understand why she got depressed and blamed her. We went to community college together and took classes together. Sometimes I would get her cakes or little random things.

 In our 2nd year of college, she met her 3rd boyfriend Andy. Soon, they became close enough that they ended up moving in together. Kim told me that her boyfriend didn't think I was a good friend because I was blunt. One time, we got into an argument because she said that no one wanted to pick her up and her boyfriend alway picks her up. I told her he's your boyfriend, so he's required to do that. Recently, we got into an argument about girl's movie night. She said I didn't like her boyfriend and accused me that was why I didn't want him at movie night.

Kim follows me on tumblr and I asked her what she thought about me. She listed me as very quiet person, introverted, finicky, gossips, judgmental, and a very dry sense of humor. I was blown away by what she said. That was how she thought of me?

They also don't like my current boyfriend. They were hoping that we would break up with each other so they could set me up with a friend. I transferred over to a school that's 6 hours away from our home. We didn't talk as much because it was hard to keep in touch.

On my birthday this year, I received an email that I didn't get the internship I wanted. I told her that I cried about it and was upset. She told me that sucks and went on to talk about how Andy is going through a process of interviews for a job... I was kind of annoyed because I didn't think she was being considerate. I told her how I was tired of doing things for people who didn't care. She told me that Andy is always the friend who initiates things. I'm just sick of her always talking about Andy.

Recently, she was diagnosed with bipolar depression. She told me she doesn't like to initiate conversations and she's been feeling down. I texted her and visited her with one of our other friends. I told her I was going to deactivate my facebook because I've been feeling down about or friends. I told her that I don't know if our friendship is going to last because our lives are so different now.  She said that's fine and she enjoys talking to me, even though we're not as close as before. Kim said she was sorry if she doesn't respond. I told her that I'm here for her and it's ok.

Today, I was hanging out with a group of friends. One friend Brandy said that Kim texted her that she was coming to the event but 15 minutes later said she couldn't make it. Kim had texted Brandy that she and Andy were thinking of getting a dog. I just thought to myself that hurts...

**tl;dr**: I have been friends with Kim for 12 years. She's had a troubled life, but I have always been there for her. Recently, we're not as close. I'm not sure if I should break the friendship off."

I am your normal guy you could say, working on my resume for medical school and pushing myself every inch closer to get my credits and extra curricular activities for improving my chances into become my dream job, an anesthesiologist, I know weird but not the point of this post. My friend who was in wilderness with me got sent to a boarding school right after I was sent to boarding school which was called shortridge academy which thankfully I convinced my father to pull me out of it because of the drug and homosexual abuse that was present there after 2 months of being there and made to feel that you were sick and fucked up. My past involved weed and smoking and selling it but it never was to the point of severity i would consider unhealthy for myself or others around me, just me doing it because I felt the need to protect my future because my father left me and my mother and sister for a younger women had a kid and is unwilling to provide me with any education other than the therapy he bought for me... Anyways My friend just finished High School at Carlbrook academy which I first off was very happy to realize by the fact it was June and he finally accepted my friend request on facebook last night. I do not approve of sending him there but this is what really ticks me off about his situation, he was sent to wilderness because he got one c on his report card and he went out on weekends to drink and smoke weed with his friends and he was sent there and to Carlbrook because of that one C and his brainwashed parents. The issue of this which it really hurts me is that the school did let him on the computer to go onto facebook which I originally thought it was him alone finally back at home where he deserves to be after a year being in these useless programs which you learn nothing but to think of yourself as dirt and have low moral but this is where it pushed me over the edge, I kept on typing to him about asking him if he was happy he was finally out and he said he wasnt... Then he said he has to be there for another year. ONE WHOLE YEAR of this newly 18 year old's life being wasted after he did what his parents wanted which was graduate high school in their suited environment and he played by their rules and the schools. His birthday was June 23 and yes you could argue he could just sign out but what would he have, the cloths on his back and a broken and emotionally damaged brain from being at this program for an entire year at which first he was told was only going to be four weeks. No it gets worse, the year is spent preparing him for college. You might say oh well this is good and I might agree its good to take a gap year, go on a trip, discover a passion, learn to speak another language but he is stuck in the brick and mortar of his child prison called CarlBrook until ANOTHER YEAR has ended and he is free from wasting his life and destroying his emotions from this place. Back to my life after I left Shortridge I gained my current girlfriend who I have been with for almost 7 months now who I adore and love to death, I graduated highschool with flying colors which before my motivation was driven towards making short term profit off weed was now investing in knowledge and my education to better myself and my family for the future, taking courses at my local community college and loving every second of it, finished an internship at my local pharmacy and now I am a nursing assistant at my local hospital which gives meaning to my life knowing I help people every day feel better mentally and physically about themselves and my life is on the up and up. You could say wilderness taught me a lesson, dont take the easy way out or do it right or dont do it at all which is true for the most part but I found all I really desired and needed to be sucessful is by having a better and understanding relationship with my father which I do now and I fully understand why he acted the way he did before and now we are fully understanding of each other. The cost of being mentally and emotionally tortured being told I was fucked up there is no way out and that I was basically a slave to the will of the advisors of the treatment staff gave me a mentality that everyone is out to get me and hurt me which is untrue but scares me to death that I know that people like my friend are still suffering in places like this while their parents write checks instead of writing letters to emotionally ""heal"" their child. The ironic part of this all is that his mother is a child and family therapist and cannot even handle her own family yet gives advice to others about how to heal their own making more flawed and broken people because of misinformation. The main reason I posted this is because after looking for hours upon hours I have found his mothers email address and phone number and thought I could talk to her about my experience and give her resources to show her how messed up this form of therapy is while not criticizing her parenting and showing how much she fucked up. I need help and I don't want to make his situation worse but it kills me inside knowing that he is still in there and he has no other choice but to play their game. I know this was a rant but I really care about my group from wilderness, I made sure each one of them is emotionally stable and happy with their lives and with the two people who are now also free with me they are finally happy being done with these programs and can actually thrive in life rather than just surviving the next onslaught of painful weeks and months to come. 

To Long to Read? - My friend is done with high school at Carlbrook academy but his mother and father want him to stay another year to prepare for college and I know that emotionally he probably wants to kill himself because he was already starting to act like that when I last saw him.

Also If anyone has questions about my experience in these programs and how I got out feel free to inbox me or if you guys really want I could do an AMA because I am very open about this subject because I find that not enough people know how mentally and physically harming it can be to teens who have gone through these programs. Thank you again for reading and Have a nice day!"

You loved my creativity, my self-assuredness, my compassion, my cheerfulness, my intelligence. 

I arrived, and you - the president of the congregation - helped me get moved in. And then I started work, and you took off for a month.

And when I started doing what was required - preparing services, proposing an outreach program to the board (at your request), making friends - including the senior minister, you began to bully me and target me via email and triangulation.

Two weeks into my year here at this congregation, you had COMPLETELY undermined me. You instantly put me on the defensive, and the cowards on the board - who had already been bullied into submission by you - never called you on it; instead, they believed you and not me.

And when the senior minister dared to stand up for me, you bullied him. And when he stood up for himself, you threw a hissy, quit the board, and made sure the new president did your bidding. Yes - you made sure she put you on the finance committee, and the fellowship committee, and the nominating committee - you're not the president anymore, but you sure do hold the power, don't you.

You know it's true - you managed to make the family who bothered you resign their memberships. You managed to turn away the music director who could have made a difference (who's now working at another church that is growing). There is a list of people I've spoken to in town who would come back if you were gone. 

Now, as I'm heading into my last month in this hell of a congregation, you decide that the gift made to ensure I could get here early is money owed and you're suggesting - illegally - that you withhold my pay for July. And despite all of the law around it, you will not let up and are SURE I'm stealing from this congregation. 

And the chicken shit board won't listen to the other side. (Except for one - who feels like the lone voice of reason there.)

You are about to lose the voice of reason on the board - the one person, by the way, who holds together much of the activity of this place. You are also about to lose the senior minister, because there is no way, he says, he can continue to be associated with people who would pull such underhanded awfulness.

And your reputation in our denomination is shot. Think ministers don't talk? Hah. No one will come here after they hear how you treated me and our senior minister. You think the denomination doesn't do much for you now? Wait until you have been blacklisted for being so horrible. 

You want your little social club? You got it. You, Madame, have managed to bully away EVERY SINGLE PERSON who doesn't fit into your narcissistic picture of perfection. 

It'll be you and five sycophants by the end of the year.

Hope you enjoy it. 

And yes, you owe me - and the senior minister - and the board member - and the congregation - a HUGE apology. You won't give it, because you are so dead fucking certain you're doing the right thing. But you owe them real contrition.

Our religion is love - but you don't practice it, and you've convinced others here not to practice it. I can't be a minister in a place that doesn't practice my religion.

3beshr,2,2015-06-28,"I [19 M] asked my SO [20 F] of 3 months if we could slow down a little, and I feel she overcompensated.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3beshr/i_19_m_asked_my_so_20_f_of_3_months_if_we_could/,"**tl;dr**: Asked SO if we could slow down a little bit, and I feel like she is not herself now because of this :(

I met my SO this January as a coworker at our coffee shop and we hit it off really well. When she couldn't work our shift any more due to a internship we continued to hang out outside of work and began dating in early april. Every thing was moving at a great pace until the summer came around and I had to go back home. We agreed to not make it official and play it by ear, out of fear the distance would be too challenging, but agreed to remain faithful to each other and text/skype often. 

This went well for the first month or so until, in the last couple of weeks, it felt as if we were moving too quickly. It seemed our emotional intimacy (telling each other secrets of our pasts, insecurities, and pledging our deep support of one another) was far ahead of our physical intimacy, due to the fact we couldn't hang out, study together, go on dates, cook together, and generally have experiences together as we could before.

This began to concern me, considering we still aren't labeling each other BF and GF, so I brought this up to her. I didn't phrase it well and it lead to a little bit of a panicky, emotional discussion. Later she texted me that she agrees she was taking it too quickly (even though I am as much at fault) and agreed to slow it down a bit. She stated she really cared about me (as I do for her!) and didn't want to risk pushing me too quickly.  

This seemed fine until now, for the last couple of days, she doesn't seem herself over texts. She is not responding very quickly, won't say *anything* intimate, and when I complimented her on a snap and said ""I wish I was there babe :)"", she just responded with ""Thanks :)"" instead of our usual flirting.

I don't want her to feel like she can't say *anything* intimate and definitely don't want her overanalyzing every message to me :/ I just don't know how to bring this up to her since I was the one who asked her if we could slow down a little. 

I'm visiting her for the first time since school ended next week and want to get this all straightened out before then. Perhaps a call or Skype? Or just continue to build up her confidence? Thanks guys!! :)"

About three weeks into our relationship, we had sex with each other–it was our first time. Our relationship was pretty physical.

Alex and I lived in the same dorm, which is how we met. We constantly saw each other, slept together, and were basically best of friends as well. We did homework together–even though I was a bit ahead in terms of the classes I took. What he was currently taking, I would have already taken the quarter before. So I would find myself helping him out a lot–going actually really far to help him out despite having a very full workload myself. I remember always feeling emotionally unsatisfied throughout last quarter, because I felt like what I put into the relationship, I would never get back. He never said things like ""I love you"", or even give me gifts. He would only buy me food and spend a lot of time with me–though that might be because he didn't have many other people to spend his time with. I felt like I was putting a lot of effort in (giving him gifts, helping him out as much as possible, sexual favors), and that just wasn't reciprocated. 

Anyway, I let that go as we entered summer break. Currently, due to my internship, we live six minutes apart by drive. He can't drive due to medical reasons though, so his mom has to drive him to places. Lo and behold, his mom suddenly decides that she doesn't want him dating me anymore (he's Korean, I'm not. boo interracial relationships). So he starts dating me in secret, but he has little to no way of communicating with me–he spends almost all of his time with his family and gets very little alone time. Even texting is apparently hard, and calling/facetiming is out of the question. 

We were able to meet for the first time this summer yesterday. He was originally going to come to my apartment but his mom pulled a 180 and said we could only go to a restaurant and maybe walk around a little bit (she thinks we're just friends right now...). He tried fighting her on this, but she wouldn't budge. The date was weird. I felt awful during it and it felt wrong. He wouldn't even touch me. It felt like I was just hanging out with a friend, not a boyfriend. He wouldn't even hold my hand. But he said he couldn't wait till next Fall because sex basically. It kinda hit me there that he was just into the physical side of the relationship, and the fact that he was going to get help with his classes. I didn't feel loved.

I guess I want out. I've been trying to distance myself from him these past few days (not really replying to his texts). I feel bad though. Maybe he really does like me and care for me, and since this is his first relationship, he doesn't know how to properly explain it.

The worst part is that I'm going to be living in the same floor as him next year and that he's in my friend circle. =/ I don't know what I'm going to do.

I guess I need some reassurance that I should be breaking up with him. I also need to know how I should do it (phrasing, etc.) and it looks like the only option is text right now since he can't even call me. I also need some help figuring out how to deal with the fact that he's going to be living so close to me next year and also how to fight feeling bad because I feel like I'm abandoning him.

Sigh... thanks.

tl;dr My boyfriend just doesn't satisfy me emotionally and can't talk to me cause of his crazy mom. I want out cause I feel used. Don't know how to bring it up or how to deal with it next year because he's going to be living on the same floor as me."

His roommate is recently single, and they went out to a club. There was some guy that they both knew. The roommate told the guy he should come back - I don't know why - the roommate doesn't drink and knows my boyfriend and I are in a committed relationship. The roommate is one of those people who instigates things and is the most self-centered selfish people I know. My boyfriend only lives there because the rent is so cheap. The guy came back to the apartment, and he and my boyfriend had sex (not just fooling around, but actual sex). I listened to him tell me this, breathed a bit in silence for about a minute, said ""I gotta go"" and hung up.
    
 
My boyfriend is a good man. He's smart, and caring, and he's kind to me. I love him. It's the best relationship I've ever been in and the kind of connection I always wanted with someone. We've talked about marriage and kids. It's been long distance almost from the start - he moves around so much for school and internships - but I fly out every other weekend or so to see him. We were just putting together details for a vacation abroad in August. He's never cheated on me before, or anyone else for that matter.
     
 
I don't know what to do. I'm just shocked at the moment and hurt. He's coming into town next weekend, so I know I have to figure out something, but I feel heavy and can't think. Does anyone have any advice? I know this happens to a lot of people all the time, but does anyone had a similar relationship where this has happened?
 
 

   
**tl;dr**: In a good relationship. Boyfriend got drunk and cheated. He called me the next morning letting me know what happened. I could use some outside perspective."

Hopefully someone can look over my current plans and help me feel like I've thought of everything reasonably.

**Goals:**

The purpose of this trip was to finally accomplish something on my own. I bought the plane tickets in December almost on a whim (I even bought the departure ticket before I could afford the return, just so I couldn't back out). My idea is that I wanted to get out and have an adventure of my own before I get caught up in internships, jobs, relationships, etc. That being said, my only *plans* are that I have a flight into Frankfurt on July 11th, a mountain I want to hike in Switzerland, and a flight out of Milan on July 30th. Other than that, I plan on going to wherever calls me while I'm there.

**Timeline/Travel:**

* Frankfurt, Germany (7/12 ~ 7/16): an old friend of mine will pick me up from the airport and house me for a few days to catch up
* Munich, Germany (7/17 ~ 7/19): another friend lives in the suburbs of Munich, and will house me for a few days there as well
* Freiburg/Schwarzwald, Germany (7/20 ~ 7/22): spend a day in the city (probably a hostel or CouchSurfing for sleep) and a day hiking the forest
* Bern, Switzerland (7/23 ~ 7/24): not sure where I'd stay here, but it's a good location to stop for a day and explore before my mountain hike - if anyone living here feels like hosting me, hit me up :D
* Gruben, Switzerland (7/25 ~ 7/28): *see Mountain Hike*
* Milan, Italy (7/29 ~ 7/30): From Gruben, I will somehow figure out a way to Milan before my 6:00 AM flight back home on the 30th. This part is a little nerve-wracking.... I think there's a combination of buses, trains, and lifts that will get me to Milan, but I haven't confirmed this yet. Here's what google tells me about getting there: http://docdro.id/14yij
* Back Home: hopefully I will return safely with a lot of stories to tell

**Mountain Hike:**

The mountain I'm planning to hike is [Barrhorn](http://www.summitpost.org/barrhorn/429662), and my plan is to follow the directions on that site (train from Bern to Kandersteg, train from Kandersteg to Visp, train from Visp to Turtmann, bus from Turtmann to Gruben). Once at Gruben, it's a relatively short hike to the [Turtmann Hut](http://www.turtmannhuette.ch/) where I'll stay the night, hike up and down the mountain the next day, and stay the night again on the way back down.

**Equipment:**

Here's another source of anxiety for me. I've looked a lot into ""what to bring"" and I think I have it down, but there are still a few details I'm missing (and I always will assume that I've forgotten to consider something). Here's a list of what I'm planning to bring so far:

* Backpack: [Deuter ""50+10"" Internal Frame](http://www.deuter.com/DE/en/lightweight/act-lite-50-plus-10-3340315-34.html)
* Daypack: I'm planning on buying this [20L Pack](http://amzn.com/B0092ECRLA) by Outlander for my hiking adventures
* Clothes: One pair of convertible hiking shorts/pants, one pair of athletic leggings, 6 pairs of Merino Wool Socks, 3 pairs of boxers + 3 pairs of briefs + 2 pairs of running briefs/tights, 1 long-sleeve + 3 short-sleeve shirts, one hoodie, [buff](http://www.buffusa.com/sports/collections/original-buff-reg/styles/original-buff-celtiknot)
* Money: I just signed up for a Charles Schwab Checking account, with unlimited world-wide atm fee refunds, so I'll bring that card and about €100 to start (this is a complete guess, please recommend a better value if applicable)
* Identification: Passport (obviously) and State Drivers License (do I need anything else?)
* Phone: Thanks to suggestions by /u/aubrill and /u/c_more, I'll be using my phone entirely with WiFi. I'll bring an external charging battery so I don't have to worry about wasting battery on music, and I've downloaded maps.me to use it as a GPS while offline.
* Paperback Book, just in case
* All my normal medications, glasses, contact stuff, sunglasses, watch, etc.

Well, if you've made it this far, I **commend and thank you** so much! I love this entire community, and I really hope to get some great advice or at least just reassurance... or perhaps a healthy dose of reality. Whatever advice or comments you have for me, please share! I will eagerly read and respond to everything I can.

This trip is incredibly exciting for me, and I really want to get the most out of it that I can, so I really appreciate the fact that I can come here for help and interaction!

3bfdbo,2,2015-06-28,SSI w/ permanent disability status+disabled dependent status...SNAP and insurance questions,DecentStudent237,disability,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/3bfdbo/ssi_w_permanent_disability_statusdisabled/,"Hello all,

I have a complicated simple question!

I'm a university student in a private college. I recently moved into on-campus apartments due to an untenable home situation that was exacerbating chronic illness.

I'm classified disabled-dependent and use that dependent status to access my parents' health insurance - which pays for treatment for my chronic illness and keeps me in school. My parents are unable to assist with my apartment bills, but Vocational Rehabilitation Services is paying for the rent bill during the semester.

They don't pay for the electric bill, so I'm taking that out on loans.

My problem right now is food and living expenses. I'm using a PASS plan to pay $300/month to medical bills despite having two insurance plans covering me. My grocery bill (toiletries and medications included) is around $300/mo with about $120/mo of that being medication.

Being classified as disabled-dependent gives me about $500/mo to work with. My PASS plan is for temporary summer research internships. My PASS account is going to run out well before next summer and roll those expenses into my SSI account.

I've been told that if I have a disabled-independent classification (where I'm paying for food, rent, etc) that I may lose access to my parents' health insurance, which would make my $300/mo doctors' expenses and my $120/mo medication expenses balloon up.

But I'm looking at my PASS account depleting at a rate that tells me I need to apply for increased benefits - SNAP would go a long way toward helping me get my PASS account to last me until next summer, when I'll have a better research internship.


So. Uh. I need help navigating this. Any assistance?"
3bfewg,4,2015-06-28,Graduating early - what do?,brex2599,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3bfewg/graduating_early_what_do/,"Hi all, I will earn my undergraduate degree in accounting this December, and I am unsure what to do. I have two basic options:  

1. Do a winter internship from Jan 2016 to ~April 2016, then begin working on my MAcc full-time in fall 2016, completing it May 2017.
2. Begin working on my MAcc in January 2016 and do an internship in the summer of 2016, completing my MAcc December 2016.

The major pro of choosing option 1 is that I could choose any school I want for the MAcc program. If I chose option 2, I would probably have to stay at the same school I am attending now. I don't really mind the school that I am attending now, but it would be nice to have options. Also, a winter internship would allow me to get a better sense of busy season and make sweet overtime $$. Also, this might just be in my head, but it might be easier to get a winter internship since the supply for accountants is lower and the demand is higher.

The major pro of option 2 is that I would finish my master's degree with greater haste. I would probably enjoy doing a summer internship more than doing a winter internship (Less work, more time to get to know associates within the firm and get to be part of a larger starting class).

Obviously the choice between the two options I mentioned is highly subjective, but I would still appreciate opinions and justification for why you would choose a certain option. Also feel free to enlighten me with other ramifications that I may have failed to consider.

Thanks!"

I broke up with him several times but we always ended up back together within a few days. It's been about 6 months since our last break up but we did rekindle things for a few days here and there. If we were not rekindling things, then things were mostly very hostile between us. I recently stopped talking to him again, hopefully for good this time.

I always knew he wasn't the guy for me, but I wanted him anyway. Our relationship was troubled and borderline abusive but he had these certain qualities I've never seen in anyone else and I was really mesmerized by him. However, I could never truly be myself around him, for many reasons. I would say both of us were quite depressed during most of our time together, especially at the very beginning, when we met. 

I find myself compulsively looking at his social media sites everyday. I'm no longer in love with him, and I don't want to get back with him, ever. We caused each other a lot of pain and had a very volatile and somewhat violent relationship. My life has become a lot more peaceful and I no longer feel depressed, but I still can't let him go. I don't miss him or his company (because I never enjoyed talking to him very much) but I still don't feel like I've made peace with whatever happened. I've been told I'm ""rolling in the mud"" of our past whenever I talk to him, talk about him, or try to see what he's up to on the internet. 

Anyway, I am not super familiar with Buddhism but I studied it a bit in college classes. I realized recently that I am not so good at accepting when I've been wronged, or letting go, or forgiving. I have a tendency to be quite vengeful, although I rarely act on it. That's why I came to this subreddit, because I have tried to ask myself why I can't let go yet, when it was my choice to leave. I know I hold some resentment against him, and I want to let go of that. But I don't know how to forgive. I used to feel very very guilty about ending the relationship but I've been burned by him after our break up and I no longer feel such guilt. But I still hope he suffers. I get a sick kick (ego boost?) whenever he would tell me he misses me, or that no other girl has been like me etc. It's so vain of me to feel like that, and it made me crave more contact from him... for such an awful reason too, since I have not wanted to reconcile. I hate that I feel that way about a man I used to love.... 


I feel like romantically, I am over him. I have moved on with my life, have a good internship, become more emotionally stable, made some important educational decisions, and have dated a couple new guys (I was a big college dropout mess when I met him and I hadn't dated anyone before). But I wish that I could ""wish him the best"" and mean it. We were very love/hate during our relationship, but now that it is over I want to get off that rollercoaster. Usually when some sort of relationship ends, I can very easily let go and rarely think of them after a little while. But since he was my first boyfriend, it hasn't been as easy this time. 

How can I forgive someone? Do I need to forgive myself as well? Do I need to figure out why I am so resentful of him first, before I can forgive? Rationally, I know why it didn't work out but I'm still stuck here rolling in the mud.... 6 months later.

3bfv8p,1,2015-06-28,[Non-Romantic] How to navigate a tricky situation with my ex and visitation with our daughter.,throwaway-poptart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bfv8p/nonromantic_how_to_navigate_a_tricky_situation/,"Main people involved:

Myself (31 F)
My ex (39 F)
My daughter (9 F)

My ex is my daughter's father, who is now transgendered and identifies as female. This was a hard change for both my daughter and I to come to terms with, but we are all pretty much used to it now.

Since our breakup I have moved with my daughter to another country and very recently was married to a wonderful man my daughter adores.

I do not have any surviving family on my side, but my daughter left two notable family members behind in the states. Her other parent, and her paternal grandmother. She *loves* her grandma, so very much.

When I left I swore I would do everything in my power to ensure that they have plenty of time with her, I did my best to uphold that promise, and still do today.

I paid $120 a month in gas so they could drive out and see her every other week (they could have come every week but I couldn't afford to pay that much in gas) in the neighboring town we had moved to, I paid for them to go out to eat and see movies and go to the zoo with her too, bought tickets for them to attend her dance recital, the works.

My ex has not worked in many many years, though she did recently take up a low paying internship. The grandmother cannot work either, and is often on welfare or other benefits to stay afloat.

I knew the onus would be on me to keep everyone together when I left. Having no family myself, this is very important to me.

This brings me to my situation.

My daughter and I have moved to another country, I have recently married, and we are all scrambling to begin a new life. The costs of immigration are astronomical, and though my husband is blessed with a decent job, it's not enough to afford everything we would like right now.

We promised when we moved here that we would get my daughter to see them at least once a year. That time is nearing, and while we have been saving, it isn't enough to pay $8k in airfare, plus rental car, accommodation, food, etc.

We did the math and we just can't swing it right now while paying off immigration and medical bills.

We told grandma and my ex this and let them know that we could instead pay for them to fly here, it would be less airfare and I could lend them my car to get around. I would also provide food for them, though I let them know they would need to pay for eating out and going places.

They agreed and I got them all the information about how to apply for a passport, and let them know it takes a while so to get on it.

Later, during my reading, I found out some distressing news. If you have unpaid child support they will not issue you a passport. My ex has another daughter in another state who accumulated close to $20k of unpaid child support over the years. I brought this up with my ex who said it wasn't a problem, that she paid it off... Somehow, without a proper job.

I was happy to hear that as it had always been a dark cloud over our heads, but suddenly she is dragging her feet on getting a passport. When I asked her about it during her last weekly skype call, she said she hadn't done anything, that she thought that wasn't happening and I had said we were going to to states.

I reiterated that we could *not* afford to go to the states right now, and that they would need to come here, she said she understood, no problem.

During our next weekly skype with grandma, grandma then asks me what I would do if my ex *couldn't* get a passport. Would I still be paying for grandma to come here alone?

Aaaand this is where I'm lost. I have no idea what the etiquette is for this sort of situation! What do I do if my ex cannot get a passport? I mean, visitation should primarily be about her and our daughter, right?

The way I see it we have only a few options:

1. We pay for grandma to come out here, put the airfare that would have been spent on ex into savings til we have enough to then go out to see her in the states. (Would take many more months of saving and would undoubtedly piss off the ex.)

2. We put all the money that would have been spent into savings and tell them they will both have to wait until we have saved enough to make a trip out. (Would no doubt piss *everyone* off.)

3. I have no idea.

How would you deal with this? How do you think the court would deal with this? We were never married, no one is on the birth certificate, and there are no custody or visitation orders. I have been doing my best to be fair, but I'm not sure what's right!

Thank you for reading, I appreciate it!

TL;DR Grandma wants to know if I will still pay to fly her out to see my daughter, even if my ex cannot get a passport to come as well. 

Edit: Do you think it would be damaging to ask a 9 year old what she wants to do? I try not to put this sort of pressure on her if I can avoid it."

3bfvpa,8,2015-06-28,I have a bucket load of questions for SCA :),Chmurka7,SkincareAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3bfvpa/i_have_a_bucket_load_of_questions_for_sca/,"I have super sensitive skin and get huge hormonal pustules around my jawline. SCA has helped me sooo much over the past 5 months or so and I have a pretty solid routine. I still have a lot of questions however. Feel free to answer any that you might have some insight to. Thank you SCA :)

How does SCA feel about oatmeal for the face? I put some in a food processor and keep a jar of powdered oatmeal in the bathroom. Sometimes I mix it with my Cetaphil or sometimes I cleanse with it alone. I find it does well for my sensitive skin but then again I used to use lemons and baking soda to get rid of my 'blackheads' (sebaceous filaments). So I could very well be doing something very wrong. 

The same applies for Green Tea. I keep powdered green tea and occasionally mix it with Cetaphil as well. Is this okay or a big no?

I understand massaging and patting the skin is good for circulation and whatnot. Would vibrating the skin have similar or better results?
For example, if I bought a mini back massager and ran it across my face in the AM/PM. 

I have been wanting to add a vitamin C serum to my routine. I have heard, however, that the vitamin C doesn't last in a bottle and is useless within a few days (not actually sure how the science works or if this is true). I have been advised to make my own with Vitamin C crystals. I also have a container of vitamin C tablets, and would like to know if I crushed them and made a mask, would this be beneficial or not. 

I have been reading about at home micro needling. I read some previous discussion on here, some people rave about it being the best thing they ever tried. Others strongly advise against it. For 15$ on Amazon, it is very tempting to try. Have any of you guys tried it? How do you sanitize it? My mother just turned 40 and is not happy with her aging skin. I have been trying to suggest a good routine for her (ex. I ordered her some Vitamin C serum). Perhaps this would be a good for her? She works outside in the sun and used to tan all the time :( I am 22, would this be a good idea to start doing to prevent wrinkles or would it be sort of useless since I have not started to show signs of aging yet? Perhaps it would improve my complexion and help get rid of my acne scars? 

Speaking of scars, I have a long one across my eyebrow from stitches and eyebrow hair doesn't grow there. I have to trim my eyebrows a bit odd to make them even (luckily they are blonde and I have bangs so it goes mostly unnoticed). Still, is there anything I could do to my skin to help this? I also have two lines across my chin from stitches and a very prominent mark across my neck from stitches. Any advice for these scars?  

Lastly, I keep hearing that there is no correlation between what you eat and your skin, but this has to be false because there is a correlation between what you eat and your hormones. Hormones can affect your acne. When I eat peanut butter I break out like crazy and huge cysts on my face fill up (access Omegas perhaps?). I have also heard the people of Okinawa owe their amazing skin to a staple of sweet potato in their diet (large amounts of Beta Keratin?). When I was doing an internship in Tokyo, I couldn't help but be amazed at how great everyones skin looked, even the people who were smoking in the arcades. I am assuming it is a combination of good genes, healthy and active lifestyle, their skincare routines/makeup and of course the wonderful healthy foods. Skin is an organ so it seems right that a healthy diet and lifestyle would enhance it's appearance. However I have been eating healthy pretty much all my life (stopped eating meat at 6, loved raw vegetables as a kid and still eat them in abundance today). My skin still suffers despite this. Has anyone on here found foods or supplements that have really made a difference in their complexion? 


Sorry for the many questions and my ramblings. If anyone could answer some of these questions I would really appreciate it!!! 
Thanks so much :) 

Edit- Spelling and Grammar. I have a form of dyslexia, so sorry if there is any confusion while reading this! "
3bfw5e,0,2015-06-28,OK for me [25m] to ask for a promotion or raise?,Throwawayraisehunter,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bfw5e/ok_for_me_25m_to_ask_for_a_promotion_or_raise/,"Hello everyone.  I am using a throw away just in case any of my managers or coworkers are redditors too.  Anyway, I had a question about how I should approach asking for a raise.

I have been working as an entry level internal auditor 1 at my company, XYZ, for 2 years come September.  This is my first real job outside of internships and such out of college.  I accepted the job at around $45k per year.  Since then, I was given a 2% raise last fall.  The departments are only allowed to give a certain number of raises (the did not say how big each one was allowed to be), so I felt very fortunate.  

Recently though, I coincidentally discovered  through one of my audits (and out of curiosity), that I was hired very cheaply.  The data I saw was about the average low, medium, and high salaries for that position.  It showed that my salary was the lowest of the low on that low medium high scale.  Low = $45k Med = $62k and High = $71k.  I knew I was hired on the cheap because I just wanted a job, but I didnt know it was the lowest value for my position.  So coming up on my 2 year anniversary, I think that I deserve a raise to the Med pay level or a promotion.  I work some weekends to keep up with work and have also started studying for the CPA Exam which comes in 2 weeks.  I feel like my coworkers enjoy working with me and that I have improved my productivity, skills, and knowledge enough to warrant my request.  However, sometimes I feel that I am not as productive or as skilled as I need to be to meet some expectations.  

I am wondering if it is reasonable for me to ask for a raise from the low of $45k to the med of $62k if not a promotion to the next level (internal auditor 2).  If it is reasonable, how should I go about asking for it?  Thank you all for your help and I'll try to contribute more to this and other subreddits on my main account.

3bg0eu,5,2015-06-28,IT jobs and IT schooling,LobsterFarts,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/3bg0eu/it_jobs_and_it_schooling/,"Since Seattle is known for its tech boom, I'd like to pick the brain of all you techies out there reading this on Reddit.

My original field isn't panning out for me like I hoped (yes, it's a BA) and I'm seriously considering going back to school for a second bachelor's in IT perhaps to focus in:
Database Administration &amp; Development
IT Systems Specialist
Computer Support Technician
Network Design &amp; Administration

All of these areas of interest are offered at the local community college (CC), which I would prefer to attend for financial reasons, but I really don't want to waste anymore time or money if it's going to end up being another useless degree collecting dust on the wall. I'd want to get involved in internships so I can learn hands on, but I'm worried that a community college might not offer them or help guide me.

If anyone has attended a CC or Seattle CC and are working in IT, I'd really like to know what was beneficial to you and if it worked out (or didn't and why). I know pretty much every job out here seems to be highly competitive, so I'm worried that might also be a factor since I would only have an associates in IT, rather than someone with years of experience.

Any advice and info is greatly appreciated!"

&amp;nbsp;

I'm really interested in Tesla and motivate to join the team and participate to the futur of this company. But I need to learn.

Currently I'm in a school in France where we only learn how to code (C, C++, Obj-C, swift, java, Ocaml, web techo', ...) bot nothing with embedded system. I personally learn how to use an Arduino board, I play with a Rasberry but nothing else. I don't know if I have to start a personal project in this subject or pure learning.

&amp;nbsp;

My questions are :


- What have I to learn to join (in an internship) the firmware team and do you have any advice ?
- Can I learn, without being in an engineering school, topics like :

    * Using national instrument testing software (LabView, TestStand, VeriStand).
    * Designing and developing complex power electronics control systems including AC-DC and DC-DC converter topologies.
    * CAN system
    * Automotive ECU
    * Using FPGA/CPLD device
    * ...

Basically : Do you have more programer than engineer profile in your team ?

3bg4ls,2,2015-06-28,Numbness,Fapony,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3bg4ls/numbness/,"I started nofap because of PIED, for more information on that here is a link to my first post: [ED Since 17 Now 20](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3ajae4/ed_since_17_now_20/), but now I want to cure the fogginess in my head.

For at least half a decade nothing has really excited me. I feel so numb to everything and haven't had a good cry since I was like 11ish (and believe me I have tried). I am a generally reserved person and have had anxiety for a long time; I'm constantly over-analyzing everything and my hands are always sweaty. I'm trying to work on this by trying new things that are outside of my comfort zone, one of them being making an account on reddit and posting (I have been a lurker for quite a few years). 

However, a lot of these things would get me in trouble at home, as my mom (dad isn't in the picture) is very religious and might kick me out depending on the severity of said action. This makes me paranoid which doesn't really help with the over-analyzing/anxiety. With that being said I am a person who thinks highly of themselves (I don't think less of others, I used to but luckily I've grown out of that) and have enough willpower to override my fear. 

My latest adventure was trying weed out for the first time - it was fantastic. However, I recognize that weed is not a solution and will only use it recreationally, at max once a week (realistically once a month) and only with friends.

In addition to trying out new things here is what I do:

1. Work Out - this is a big part of my life. I lift 5 days a week (have been doing so since high school) and I believe this is why I have a lot of confidence in myself, even though I am paranoid.

2. NoFap - I have been trying to successfully complete the 90 day challenge for a while now. I usually fail because I tend to try to ""test"" myself and edge. No more of that. Period. This time I will make it to 90 and maybe even stop forever.

3. Cold showers - this is relatively new and was extremely hard for me to do (I love my hot showers! lol). It did increase my willpower and slightly decrease my anxiety, but so far I'm only a week in.

4. Open up - I told my best friend about my agnostic beliefs, which was something that was very hard to do. I also told him about how my dad ran out on us (he was a bad person and I am happy he is out of our lives) and how my family is financially not sound (me and my sibling are graduating college right after one another so this should soon be a lot less of an issue once we get jobs).

5. Talk to strangers - I try to introduce myself and be friendly with people. However, I am horrible at small talk and often draw blanks. Also, I have a very stoic face and have been told I look depressed or angry - which doesn't help when meeting new people (I do try to smile though, but it doesn't look genuine when it isn't).

Also, there is a girl at work (summer intern, like me) that I like. I think she likes me too and I want to ask her out. However, if we do go out we will have to keep it a secret because if my mom finds out my life would be over (my brother goes to the same school as me and he isn't on the same page, so there would be a decent chance of my mom finding out through him). I don't want to burden her like that, but I also can't spend the next 3 or so years repressing myself. I don't know what to do.

Do you guys have any advice on what to do in this situation? 
Also, is there anything else I should add to my list of self-improvement?

3bgb27,1,2015-06-28,[M/21] Should I go for it or bad idea?,theWayOfTheThrow,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3bgb27/m21_should_i_go_for_it_or_bad_idea/,"Thanks to everyone in advance for the help, it feels kind of silly to worry about something so trivial but I feel that I'm too biased to make a good decision.

A little background about me to put this in perspective, I'm a senior at a large southern state school. Never had a girlfriend in college, but never really worried about it either. I'd say I'm mildly attractive, but not superman or anything and I consider myself a pretty good flirter (subjective of course.) I'm a big partier, and most of my experience with women has been one night stands. Most of the time I don't get attached or anything, but there have been two exceptions where I've gone head over heels for the girls and it didn't go well, I would think about them 24/7 and my schoolwork would suffer, and in both cases I felt way happier after we ended whatever small relationships we had.

Fast forward to last Friday night. I'm in Atlanta for an internship and I got totally tequila trashed celebrating gay marriage downtown, and this beautiful girl [F/24 - I'll call her A] walks in with her friend [call her B] and sit together at a booth. I feel like A is out of my league, but I'm even more confident drunk so I go sit down and talk to them. We ended up having a really great time all together. It wasn't all physical, I feel like we connected well all around. They weren't from Atlanta and they were staying with a guy B has a thing with. They invited me to join them, and A and I slept on the couch together. We fooled around a lot but she didn't want to have sex and kept dropping hints about ""the next time"" in a positive way. We cuddled all night and she drove me to my place the next morning. We got along very well and B privately told me that A really likes me. They live in Alabama but they want me to watch the USAvGermany game in Atlanta on Tuesday night. On one hand, I'm really happy. I like A a lot, we just click in a way I normally don't with girls. She's very caring and stunningly gorgeous. 

So that's the backstory, sounds really good but I'm worried I'm going down the same path again where I like her too much too fast and it's going to affect my internship work. On the other hand, this feels very real and I think there could be a future to look forward to. I'm obviously not making rational decisions, so hopefully I can get some good advice from fellow redditors. Any general advice would be great but these are some specific lines of thought I'm working through:

* She lives in Alabama and it seems like she visits Atlanta a lot. Am I just a quick escape for her or does she really like me like me?
* Should I even attempt to make this happen? Normally I would say yes and not worry but I don't want my work to suffer if I get myself in too deep (as I have before)?
* If it were all to work out for this summer, I still have a year left in school and am 3 years younger than her. I should have a good job if this summer works out, but idk if she would just be too mature for me?

I'm not going to try to get with her Tuesday night since I work Wednesday. I also can't bring her over for the night since I am staying at my dad's apartment for the summer. Part of me wonders if during their trips to Atlanta they have a plan for where to stay or if they just find random guys to stay with.

Anyway, I know there's a lot of this that can't be answered, just letting y'all into my thought process. Any and all help is very appreciated.

I'm a 21 year old male Computer Science student entering my 3rd year of college. My parents have been helping me pay for my college expenses, and have said that they will continue doing so. 

This summer, I picked up a paid internship at my father's workplace. By the time I leave for school, I will have earned approximately $3000 dollars. My question, is how do I go about handling this money? I'm not an extravagant spender. (I have a girlfriend and we try to split the costs of dating as evenly as possible)

I'm having difficulty deciding between sticking the majority of it into a Roth IRA to take advantage of time, or potentially saving it in the form of treasury bills, or even just sticking it in a savings account, and letting it sit.

The biggest part of this that weighs on my mind is that I have a unique opportunity (very few expenses, stability, time to mature) and that I'd like to help my parents retire earlier than expected (They're approximately 10 years from retirement.)

Thanks!


EDIT: tl;dr: I have $3000 dollars, and am assured that I have little to no expenses for the next 2 years. How do I get ""the most bang for my buck""?"

I lost my hearing completely at the age of 15 during high school and was implanted with a cochlear implant. I was bullied a lot when I first lost my hearing, but then people just started to ignore me and not include me in anything. This led me to not eating food and losing a lot of weight (5'11'' at 100 pounds). I was feeling ugly and incredibly insecure about myself.

Fast forward to first year of college, due to not eating, it somehow led me to getting Crohn's disease. As a result, I was not able to focus on my classes, due to constantly having to poop every 5 minutes. It sucked bad, couldn't do things that people in college do, and went home every weekend, because I couldn't handle the stress.

Junior year of college, a friend introduced me to weightlifting, and this helped me pack on some more muscle (after I started taking medication which put my Crohn's in place). I was feeling more confident in myself, and girls even said I was cute! I was feeling good about myself, and despite everything that happened previously, I felt I could finally stand up in this world.

Last summer, the summer before graduate school, I then developed a vicious stye in my left upper eyelid, which to this day, has not completely gone. Even after numerous trips to the doctor and 3 surgeries on my eye to reduce the swelling/pus, it never went away and has disfigured my eyelid, to the point where it is now droopy and uneven with my other eye. I have become incredibly self conscious about this, and coupled with the stress of graduate school and TA duties, I was and still am having a hard time coping. My doctor even said to not be vain and that girl's don't care about ""silly stuff"", and my parents tell me to stop complaining as well...

I know the stye doesn't really count as a disability, but all of this packaged together is making me upset. It is summer now, and when I am not in my internship, I just sleep the day away. I don't even go to the gym anymore, even tho I used to be incredibly diligent about lifting weights and making progress -- mostly because I don't see the point anymore.

3bgues,1,2015-06-28,Short Term Loans for Student Rent?,Sneet1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bgues/short_term_loans_for_student_rent/,"So I'm in a bit of a situation. I am a US student who is currently working in London for the summer. Unfortunately I have three co-current loans running at the moment, from a student apartment for the year before, the next academic year, and one in London (I did an exchange term on a scholarship at a prestigious school and London has a plethora of job opportunities for someone in my position) so that I can work my internship. For context I am a high-need student with no financial reserves or extended family. 

I'm currently managing to find a subletter for both of my leases back home. The problem is I am short for simply this month in London, but it puts me in a bad position because I am already behind on bills. My school had changed the date of when my scholarship for the next year will come through (which I looked forward to as funds for my internship, which unfortunately for all intents and purposes in my background is a necessary educational step). 

While I have money guaranteed to come in from my old lease ending, by getting back my security deposit and last month via subletter, as well as my scholarship paying in full for the rent in August, I am stuck with a rent payment now that I must deal with 
ASAP. Going home isn't an option at this point because while I could fly out at an affordable price, I had already rebooked my flight for this internship so to ignore it and buy a new, cheap flight would waste the equivalent of the month of rent anyways in already paid money. 

The reason I post this here is because I unfortunately cannot seem to figure out the best option to go forward. I would like to take a small loan that I can absolutely repay in August, but as I have no co-signer nor collateral and a very short credit history no bank seems to be willing. I had also explored the possibility of a student loan via FASFA, however they are quite cryptic in how quickly you receive funds and whether you receive them directly or whether they are paid directly to your school.

I have thought about opening a credit card with a new bank (I have one for my current, Wells Fargo, but the credit limit if my balance was fully paid off would not even cover the rent). I have also looked into payday loans, however they seem to require the funds back quicker than the 1.5 month window I'm looking at it. "

I'm currently in D.C. (I'm from LA) for an internship with a government agency and so far have mixed feelings about the field. The agency says that I have been doing well and if I continue to impress them they would have a job lined up for me after I graduate. However I'm not so sure I would be open to such a large relocation. I have a few questions for anyone established in the field as hopefully it will allow me to gain some direction 

1. Is there opportunity for employment on the west coast? Most of the people in D.C. have discouraged me from staying there but I love it back home. 

2. What sort of further degrees (masters, law) can help advance my career, increase my salary etc. I was originally looking at degrees in public policy or adminstration however someone informed me that IT and computer science related degress can go a long way in the field is this true? 

3. I have tried getting peoples opinions on the private sector but as I work for a government agency most I've heard is negative, can anyone provide a different perspective.

I apologize if these questions are to broad or if I didn't provide enough information about myself. If you guys would like to know anything else I'd be pleased to answer."

I just got paid this week and I wanted to keep good financial habits and just save in general not for retirement or anything like that, but just have a good amount of money for savings in general. 

The downside here is I pay about $30/day to get to and from work by train and this doesn't include cafeteria food prices($4-6), which I'm planning to bring down by just bringing my own lunch everyday.

I'm thinking about keeping $200 saved in a savings account every week but I'm not sure what resources and such to use to figure out what my best options are. 

I know most people here don't like trading, but I've done a lot of trading as my parents would let me trade at times. I'm considering day-trading (It's 3 trades per week for non-pattern day traders) as it'd keep a limit on how many trades I could do, and to start off at decent amounts when I get enough money saved up. 

I'd just like any thoughts on what to do to save well. Any thoughts would be welcome!"

3bhjxn,3,2015-06-29,"Me [20F] with my boyfriend [20M] of over 3 years, brought up proposing to his parents but they have concerns.",havmack1415,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bhjxn/me_20f_with_my_boyfriend_20m_of_over_3_years/,"My boyfriend and I just turned 20 this year and have known each other for almost 7 years and dating for over 3, we have a very open relationship and discuss marriage and our future together very often and over the past year and a half have decided we want to start beginning our family together. We have just completed our 2nd (and my final) year of college and he has 1 semester and a 4 month internship left of college, all throughout my 2 years of college we lived together, the first was in a residence and the second was in a town-house that we payed for ourselves (Without our parents help) with 3 other roommates (rent was still $600 each person despite 5 people living there). As far as we go personally, I would say I am more mature than most of my 19-20 year old friends and that because of family issues I had to grow up and take responsibility a lot younger.

The other night he brought up to his parents that he is planning on proposing on our upcoming vacation in a month. When he brought it up their initial thought was that we're very young, which I do agree with.. where we live it is not the norm to get engaged this young, but just because we are getting engaged does not mean we will be married within the year... We intend on him finishing his school within the year and then we have plans to move in together into an apartment and starting a savings account to save money for the wedding which we intend to do for 3-4 years. They also agreed that my boyfriend and I are very mature for our age. 

Another concern is that because we're engaged we won't live up to our potentials and that being engaged may hold my boyfriend back... when my boyfriend was younger he used to not go to tryouts because he knew he wasn't going to make it and they felt like maybe if he was engaged he would say no to opportunities because he's engaged. Which personally I don't feel will happen, my boyfriend has done that with acting opportunities that have come up for him but I have encouraged him to do them and he ended up doing them. 

Another concern was what everyone else will think, especially because we're so young... personally I see getting married at a young age so taboo because it DOESN'T happen often and when it does it doesn't always work out... It's rare that you truly do meet the person you're supposed to spend your life with at 13 years old but we did. We both have grown a lot in the past 7 years, and intend on growing together and as individuals for the rest our lives. 
 
Another concern was that they never see any of his friends from high school and were like ""whose gonna be your best man?"" and my boyfriend doesn't talk to his friends from high school because he doesn't like any of them, all they want to do is go to clubs and party which isn't what either of us are interested in anymore (we both went through our ""drinking and partying"" phases when we were 13-16)

His parents said regardless of anything they will be happy for us and will support us through it and that they love me and would love me as a daughter in law (his mom has said that to me before). I just get the vibe that they aren't too thrilled and are slowly trying to convince him it's not the best idea... because his mom said to him that he could just get me a promise ring (which I already have) and he told her that I already have one and she was like oh well you could get her a nicer one with an actual diamond!

My boyfriends main concern is what my parents will say because i'm their ""little girl"", but I've had talks with both of my parents about it without telling them that it's going to happen, but they've said I'm too young, but they would be happy for us regardless. My parents had a child when she was 17 and my dad was 22, got married and had me when she was 20 and have been together for 20 years. so I don't think they would have too much of a problem with it considering we aren't getting married until we are 23-24. 

I just don't know how to feel about all of his parents concerns, I couldn't help but feel like they might think I'm going to hold him back from some opportunities and that he doesn't see his friends because of me.
   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend is planning on proposing within the next month or two after discussing it for over a year and a half. He told his parents he's going to propose and they were happy but had some concerns... not sure how to feel about their concerns. "

After a 6 months internship that finishes tomorrow evening, it's time for me to part ways with Dontnod, at least for now.

This was my first experience in a video game company, and it's been absolutely great, thanks to them, but also to you guys !


When i started studying/working in the video game field, it was scary, because i thought that it might just have been a phase. But after interacting with some of you, and watching people have fun, laugh, cry and generally enjoy somthing i've been (a small) part of, feels incredible.


So i want to thank everyone on this sub, and more specifically /u/haXona , /u/kemando , /u/Hoonder for the fun discussions we've had, /u/DuckOfDuckness for keeping this boat afloat, and of course, /u/sashimi_taco for the awesome playthrough and theories that were followed here at Dontnod.


To celebrate all that, i'm running a small giveaway, where the first prize will be a custom T-Shirt selected together with the winner.

3bid82,6,2015-06-29,"Me [22 F] with my bf [23 M] 6-8months, dysfunctional &amp; unable to communicate, broken up but I want to reconcile, help",rlnshpdrama4dayz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bid82/me_22_f_with_my_bf_23_m_68months_dysfunctional/,"So this relationship began with the cards stacked against it. He was my rebound from a serious 2-year relationship that was heading toward the alter until he pulled the plug. We started as FWB, and had this immediate emotional and intellectual attraction (the physical part came after I saw him with his shirt off. :P) I told him everything, and he helped me work through my breakup and other life-long psychological issues. We were FWB for a little over a month, with plenty of drama in between (Vegas and an ex-boyfriend was involved...) before we decided to be official. Since January we've pseudo-broken up at least three times, but we could never stay away from each other long. It's been a rough road. For as long as I remember, we've fought regularly. Like real, emotionally draining fights that end in sobbing on bathroom floors, storming out in the middle of the night, hopping out of moving cars, etc. for both parties.

But strangely... we're perfect for each other. We moved in at 3.5 months and lived together for 2 months with almost no cohabitation-related issues. His friends and family love me, and my mom highly approves. Neither of us violate each other's pet peeves, and our biological rhythms are clearly in sync. We have complimentary life goals, and similar perspectives when it comes to philosophy and politics, but can NEVER seem to see eye to eye when it comes to our relationship.  We both find each other's quirks and flaws endearing, yet we always seem to fight about the same bullshit. (I'm overbearing, hard to please, and too selfish to be empathetic; he's insensitive, stubborn, and ruthlessly vindictive.) All of our fights seem to boil down to a failure to communicate, which we acknowledge, yet nothing seems to work. We're a couple of paradoxes, I guess. We're both each other's biggest support but also harshest critic. He is amazingly insightful when it comes to other people but ridiculously stubborn and short-sighted when it comes to our relationship.

Anyway, I just left the country a week ago for a summer internship. The week before I left, we had a huge fight that ended up in a breakup... which turned into a break... The day before my flight we had a long phone conversation and talked things out (or so I thought), and the break turned from two weeks to a week to three days. Then this morning, a normal conversation turns sour, he accuses me of turning our relationship into a shitshow (the fight I thought we resolved), triggering a strong response from me (since one of my biggest grievances this entire relationship has been about him acting like things are resolved and that he understands my perspective when he actually doesn't, and brings supposedly resolved matters up in later fights.) This time, it was him who called it off. I was exhausted and instead of diffusing my anger like the thought of a breakup usually did, it only fueled it. It also felt much more real this time. I guess it's easier to walk away when we're thousands miles away already.

Then immediately after he breaks up with me OVER TEXT, he asks if we can be friends. I shoot him down pretty sternly... and we haven't communicated since. It's been 15 hours, and it feels like days has gone by.

I want him back, but I know things need to change and we need to figure out how to communicate. PLEASE give me advice on how to make this work? After all this, I still think he might be my soulmate... but I don't know if he thinks the same. My best friend thinks I was more into this relationship than he was... but I've seen him at his emotional lowest and I know he's just as invested as I am. He seriously had trouble eating and sleeping when I went abroad/no contact for a week in April. I find it hard to believe he can walk away, but he just might because we're both so worn out from our repeated battles.

So... how do I get him back. How long should I wait to talk to him, or should I just wait for him to text first? My friends think I should actively try to move on and even he's said repeatedly this relationship does more harm than good... but against my every better judgment I don't want to let go. I'm a mess without him, but I know better than to just text him and tell him I'm willing to keep trying like I always do. This breakup seriously hurts a million times more than the end of my two-year. Help, please.

TL;DR; On again, off again with boyfriend. We're perfect for each other: he's brought me the greatest physical, mental, and spiritual pleasures of my life, but our incessant emotionally charged fights have also brought me to crippling lows. I feel like he's my soulmate, but I don't know how to salvage this. I'm a mess, and need outside perspectives. How should I approach this breakup? How can I change his gut reaction to a bad fight from wanting to break up to wanting to work harder...? And from an outside perspective... is this more trouble than it's worth; am I blinded by love?"

I'm an AE student at a top 5 university for AE. (Just started my Junior year, GPA 3.8). I have heard from a few individuals that having experience in Machine Shop work is extremely important. I have none, and it is starting to concern me. 

As far as my other employ-ability skills, I have stronger than average coding skills for my major (MatLab, Java, I am pursuing a CS Minor, emphasis in AI). I have experience with Inventor, Solidworks, and some NX. (Never used CATIA, although I have heard industry uses it heavily. ) I have one internship under my belt. It was at a paper product manufacturing facility. While it wasn't AE, I learned a lot in the process. I intend to have 1-2 more internships before I graduate, this time with an AE company. 

As far as personal projects go, I have been working on drones in my spare time, and have been doing Combustion research on campus. I feel like I am in a fairly strong position for job applications, but my lack of machine shop skills has me worried.

How important do you feel machine shops skills are for a new hire out of college? Are there any other skills that I should have that I haven't explicitly mentioned?

Thanks in advance!"

I'm in the middle of an internship that pays about 16k (after taxes) for the summer and I'm trying to decide if I want to take out student loans again.

Last year I took out 5k to pay for tuition for the year (my school is so cheap!) and didn't feel too bad doing that. Doing that for the next two years though is a little more stressful, especially when I probably could bunker down, keep working part-time while a student and pay tuition while in school. However, I really want to have more free time, go out to eat, go to concerts, and take advantage of my college years.

The absolute most debt I could graduate with is 15k, and after this internship I pretty much have a 100k job lined up after graduation. That doesn't sound too bad, but it is probably unnecessary. I see a lot of stress about student loans here in this sub, so I guess I'm looking for outside advice on whether what I'm doing is dumb."

It's just pointless in my opinion of even talking about them because everyone already knows their story. But the big problem and has been for months is Seamus. Where's Seamus? That's the question that's going around and who can blame the people asking? He just went AWOL one day and hasn't even attempted to give an explanation to why. I mean we at least deserve a ""sorry I've been gone I have X problem"" but no nothing. How long before people ask ""Who's Seamus""? New fans will come in and don't know who he is as I'm sure many don't know Ze or Sp00n. I mean it even seems like the actual creatures don't even know Seamus' situation at times which isn't only worrying from a business standpoint but a friendship one too. We seen James say months ago when Dex came in that it was because they needed extra help so whys Seamus seemingly gone when they need the extra hand? It's not fair on the fans or the creatures by all accounts. That brings me to my next point. 


The people they've brought in. I like all the creatures they've brought in. I actually relate a lot more of Dex's humour than most because he simply doesn't give a fuck and says what he wants to be funny. That's something not a lot of the guys do anymore which tells me they're trying to tone down on their ""adult humour"". I don't know why they're doing this be it perhaps wanting a younger audience to be more attracted or to be more appealing to sponsors. Who knows? It's seems the guys curse less and all that and that's what I can gather. It seems only James Aleks and Dex are the only ones to still consistently swear and do shit like that. 


With regards to the group in general I get the feeling they're trying to pander to the younger crowd for views and such but I'm probably wrong. I just feel like some of the older viewers might be sacrificed to entice the younger crowd into overreacting in videos and just humour based on acting ""goofy"". I hope I wouldn't be considered an older viewer after all I'm only 18 but I feel like their humour a lot of the time is just stupid really. They're really losing Seamus' humour too because he had the sarcasm which took some intelligence and quick wit. As for the interns they're getting to be annoying in all honesty. I mean Spencer is in most of the content now. He's alright but not constantly video after video. Joe gets annoying because all he does he use the same jokes as shown by the recent creature talk. Aron just tries to be like James and Aleks because they're the two most popular but he's not charismatic or funny enough to pull it off so he just gets annoying and looks to try too hard as all of the interns do. I haven't seen enough of Stefani but she seems alright because she doesn't freak out like the other interns and is actually just chilled out. 


Now onto their projects and content. As I said their content hasn't been great in the past couple of months. The constant board games and minecraft just got annoying to the point where I wouldn't watch them because there's no point really. It seems the effort wasn't really being put into their games at all. It was literally just all party games. They never make coop series anymore when that'd really freshen things up. Maybe the get the idea that people mightn't like the series but I for one would rather a coop series than a board game. I'm not watching another board game game night again honestly they're just drained of all fun really. It always goes the same way. James vs Jordan. Jordan's winning.  Aleks tries to fuck over everyone for no reason. James or Jordan win. That's it. That's the basic formula. 


Their real life content has been improved in the past year but they really need to stop hyping things up. I mean the ""salad wars"" in the road trip wasn't that great in all honesty. The trips and such have been good but if it was kept really to just the actual creatures and maybe an intern for camera purposes itd be better. 


As for their ""upcoming"" projects this is where it annoys me and where the biggest problem lays. Almost everything they've ever promised hasn't come to fruition or has been a bust. I've just come to the point where I know Tr4pville isn't going to be made and if it is its not going to be very good. It's the Duke Nukem forever process. I mean since they've announced it they've had so many changes in the group that they couple possibly have finished it. I mean they lost a main character in Sly and could lose another in Seamus if he does actually quit. So everything they had done to that point had to be either rewritten or reanimated. It's always with false promises with them. It's annoying because whenever they announce something I'm just thinking it's not gonna come out or it's just gonna be meh. I mean I know all that takes time and everything but cmon its been years. I mean their 1 million sub special should be already out as should their creaturetopia special but they're not. I appreciate that it's hard to get everyone at the same time but you're telling me I'm assuming everyone is in the office 5 days a week at certain hours that you can't spare an hour or two for a video. Cmon that's just bullshit. I know everyone has their own channels and everything but in fairness you can pause a game or get an editor to edit for you. You're not as busy as you claim to be that's not possible in a job such as yours. Look I'm not telling them how to run their business but in fairness you guys have a duty to your fans so either stop lying by saying something's gonna be this or that or just work harder I guess which I know is a bad thing to say but if you can't meet a deadline you set you shouldn't make a deadline. I mean at least give some sort of update on the progress of projects. I don't care if it's ""spoiling"" it or whatever I just want to know if you guys are actually working on something like you said you are. Really it's just not good enough in all honesty. 



I know this post seemed a bit hateful and stuff but that's not its intent or purpose. The guys need to know what they're doing wrong and we as fans deserve the best content they can give us. We all know they intended to be a Rooster Teeth type of company but there's a reason why Rooster Teeth are so successful. It's because they're good with deadlines and creating good content. "
3bj94p,1,2015-06-29,I [25 M] have been dating a woman [25 F] for a month and I'm not sure if she's into it,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bj94p/i_25_m_have_been_dating_a_woman_25_f_for_a_month/,"Here's a not-so-interesting fence of text. I appreciate any input though!

I just moved to a new country to start a PhD program. I met an intern in the department who is leaving in two months from now. I'm a pretty outgoing person, whereas she's *extremely* shy. We communicate in my native language but her second language, although she's basically fluent. She's also probably one of the prettiest people I've ever seen in my life. (I'm no George Clooney but I'm not too bad looking)

After a department outing one night, she came over to my apartment for drinks and ended up staying til 4:30 am. We hung out on my bed, but she kept a pretty clear distance. We flirted a bit (tickling etc) but her body language told me she wasn't interested in being kissed, so I respected that. I walked her home, got her phone number, and pecked her on the cheek. 

We texted a bit and I asked her out to dinner. She came over to my apartment after dinner and this time I did try to kiss her, but she stopped me and said ""Don't you think it's a bit soon?"" She asked me what I wanted, I said that I liked her and just wanted to keep spending time with her. She said she didn't know what she wanted. I told her that I would stop putting moves on her and if she ever wanted to, then she could kiss me. She agreed to this arrangement. I walked her home again but this time didn't kiss her on the cheek. We hung out one more time and just walked around the city together at night, but again didn't kiss. 

We both went on vacation the next week and texted throughout the week. She sent lots of flirty messages with smilies and winky faces etc. We hung out the day we both got back in town. I told her that I like her and she said that she likes me too. She said that she wants to kiss me now but that she has a cold sore and so it would be unwise to do that. We cuddled a bit and I went home. We hung out again a few days later, she still had the cold sore so we didn't kiss again but she ended up sleeping over at my apartment (!). We cuddled all night, but the next day she complained about not getting enough sleep ;p

We met up a couple days later to see a concert together. After the concert she came over to my apartment. I told her that I noticed her cold sore was gone. She agreed but said she didn't know if she wanted to kiss me. She asked again what I wanted, I said that I'd like to be her boyfriend but I understand that she's leaving in two months, but regardless I'd like to spend this time together. She said that she finds it a bit strange to just date for a short while only to break up, and that she has only been in two serious relationships before but that it hurt them a lot when she broke up with them and she didn't want to hurt anyone again. I told her that if we know going into it that it'll end in two months then she doesn't have to worry about me getting hurt. She then asked, well what if she decides to kiss me and then later decides she doesn't like me? I told her again that it's fine if she changes her mind, kissing me doesn't bind her to anything. She continued like this for about two hours, saying that she enjoys spending time with me but she just isn't sure what she wants. I reassured her that if she isn't interested in me, that's totally fine, I won't be offended and I'll be happy to stay friends with her. 

So she finally says, how about a kiss goodnight? So I say ok, and go to walk her home. We both stand there awkwardly and nervously, and she says that we should take a walk. So we find someplace dark, she hugs onto me, and finally we kiss...for a good ten minutes. It was awesome. I walk her home and go to sleep. 

Two days later we meet at a mutual friend's house for dinner. We stay there super late and bike home together afterwards. I drop her off at her place and stand around awkwardly hoping for another kiss. I ask her if she wants to take another walk but she declines saying that it's too late. She gives me a kiss and I awkwardly tell her that she can sleep over again if she wants to. To my surprise, she says that she doesn't want to go to my place but that I can sleep at hers if I want to. So of course I agree. Since it's so late we both just passed out. In the morning I practiced her language a bit and asked for ""reward kisses"" for correct sentences, which she obliged. After a bit I went home. I saw her at the department lunch today but she didn't seem too interested in talking to me. I asked her if she wanted to hang out tonight but she said that she's too busy cleaning her apartment. 

Ok, so writing this all out I've made it sound like everything's hunky dory, but the thing is, the whole thing is pretty asymmetrical. I get really excited to see her, but she always seems pretty neutral. I always do the ""asking out"" and I'm not sure she would if I didn't. We eat lunch in a group with our department everyday and she's always very shy to say anything to me there. I think I just generally enjoy being around her more than she does me. The night when she was deciding whether she would kiss me, I was pretty damn convinced that she was just trying to work up the courage to tell me no. I thought it would get better once we kissed, but my uncertainty just keeps growing. 

So this situation is a bit strange to me. I've never really had any problems dating - I usually make my intentions clear, and either get a yes or a no, and that's fine. So I'm wondering if she's actually even interested, or if she's too shy to just tell me to go away. Should I approach the topic with her at this point? Or am I just overthinking this? 

**TLDR**: Been dating a woman for a month, she is leaving in two months, it took weeks of dating for her to agree to kiss me, I'm wondering if she's just being shy or if I should back off. "

3bjh2u,6,2015-06-29,I [25F] am suddenly having major insecurity issues about my relationship with my [26M] boyfriend and his 'friend'.,shnaz7,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bjh2u/i_25f_am_suddenly_having_major_insecurity_issues/,"Hello good people of /r/relationships! 



I have been in a relationship with my current boyfriend for over 2 years. 
The whole time I have known him, he has had this super hot, really funny and down-to-earth friend (female) who he considers one of his best friends. They talk about everything together and usually hangout one-on-one when they see each other. I never thought much about it and it never really bothered me. Our relationship was fun, exciting, I've never doubted his love for me and we've even discussed moving in together/marriage possibilities in the future. Basically, I love this man and I feel like he loves me. 




About a year into our relationship, I accepted an internship in a foreign country for 8 months. My boyfriend wanted to come with me, but due to sickness and not being able to find a job, left 2 months in to go back home. During our long distance, I would see facebook posts of the two of them hanging out together, going to dinner, museums and exercising. I heard from friends back home that their relationship was a bit flirty - but still, that's how my boyfriend is naturally, so I wasn't too bothered aside from the typical jealousy one gets when they can't hangout with their boyfriend. 




When I came back home after my internship, I found out that he used to have a HUGE crush on her for an entire year before we started dating. I asked him why they never got together and he said ""We were never single at the same time"", but assured me that since meeting me, he doesn't have feelings for her anymore. Then, a few months later, I accidentally discovered some messages between them from when we were both abroad, which were (to me) more than just a ""little flirty"". I got mad, we fought, but he still assured me that I'm still the one he loves. He even told me he would stop hanging out with her, because he doesn't want me to feel insecure about it. I told him I don't want to ruin any friendships and that he could still hangout, just don't be overly sexual with her anymore because it makes me uncomfortable. 




Yet, for some reason I'm still having a hard time getting over it. I look back and see so many signs - how he doesn't mind being late to visit all his other friends but CANNOT be late to hangout with her. Or how I've had the chance to meet all his other friends individually, but he always hangs out with her when I'm busy. It's gotten to the point where almost every week I'll have a dream about him sleeping with her and it makes me very scared and nervous. I always wake up and I'm super mad at him for no reason! 




Meanwhile, ever since our fight it seems like he's stopped trying in our relationship. We 'hangout' a lot, but its not particularly exciting.  He takes no initiative to plan any dates together, he also doesn't seem to show much enthusiasm for the dates I try to plan. (And I've been planning every single date for the past few months...) Last weekend we hungout at a party that she was also attending. The whole time I couldn't stop thinking how incredibly good looking she is, how funny and easy to get along with and fun she seems. My boyfriend called his last girlfriend fat and as he's a very attractive Male, so I know that looks seem to be a big deal for him. 




Despite my boyfriend's best efforts to assure me otherwise, I can't stop comparing myself to her and feeling like I always come up short. I love my boyfriend but my enthusiasm and trust in our relationship is taking a huge hit. Its starting to effect the way I talk to him and when I'm not physically with him, I find myself finding new ways to get mad at him over something. I never used to be this jealous or insecure - in fact I was usually quite the opposite!! What's happening to me? How can I get over my insecurities and jealousy issues? Is it possible for a guy with a huge crush on a girl, to just suddenly get over it - or do you think there could still be some residual feelings?



   
**tl;dr**: I can't help but feel like my boyfriend still has feelings for one of his closest female friends. While he tries to assure me otherwise, my insecurities and mistrust keep growing and its starting to effect my relationship. How do I get over jealousy issues and start just being happy and care-free again?

Am I doing everything right?,darockerj,learnjavascript,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/3bji4y/building_an_api_at_my_new_job_am_i_doing/,"(Cross-posted from /r/learnprogramming w/ minimal edits b/c I wasn't entirely sure what sub to submit this to.)

Hey /r/learnjavascript!

So, through a family friend I landed an internship at an SBDC as an intern. The family friend knows that I'll be majoring in CS in the fall, so he wanted this internship to act as an intro into programming in a business environment. Once I started, he pitched me an idea for a project: create an API that would connect two databases we use - Smartsheet and CenterIC (customer relationship system) - and do something with the information (still a little hazy on what).

He said something about JavaScript, so in my first week I started and finished Codecademy's JavaScript course and began learning Node.js from nodeschool.io. Now it's the Monday of my second week here and I want to make sure I know what I'm getting myself into.

So, /r/learnjavascript, my questions:

1. Am I learning the right language and technology for this project? Is there something else I should look into?

2. I've found a few guides on constructing RESTful APIs with Node.js, but are there any really good ones you guys know about?

3. Am I in over my head? Should I try a different project? (For reference, my background: Took and excelled in CS electives -- including AP CS w/ a 5 on the exam -- for first three years of high school but not senior year b/c there weren't any left to take. Other than JS, I have experience in Java and a little Python, and I created and published an Android app with a partner in my junior year.)

4. Is there a particular sub I should ask this? I'm just shooting in the dark here.

Thanks for all of your help, guys!"

I really want to experience a different country, particularly one that seems to score highly in international civil liberties ratings. I'm studying politics, and I want to see what it's like advocating for civil liberties in a country that seems to do a better job protecting them than mine. 

To that end, I was wondering if any of you have recommendations about organizations that might accept interns in my situation. Ideally, it would be with some sort of civil liberties advocates, but I would accept any sort of policy advocacy if necessary.

When I was still a small boy my dad had loads of canary's and I always enjoyed feeding them etc. Now I've come to a point that I've bought my own house and felt the need of getting a pit. Maybe half a year back I told my niece that I may get a Cockatiel later since I just like the looks / sounds they make. (Since I was following yous on Reddit).

Last Friday suddenly my nice connected me saying that she has 2 young cockatiels for offering for only 45 euros at her internship! So I was oke... give me a day I need to think about this. So I did some thinking and not this Wednesday but upcoming Wednesday I will take my Cockatiel to my own home!!! 

Below you will find a picture of her. She is just 6 weeks old and has been hand fed from the beginning. She is already comfy around people and can be handled well. 

My nice has just taken her from the store and brought her to her home to learn her a few things and play a bit with her and one important thing to learn her to fly better since the flying that she does now is more of a nice way to fall softly to the ground :p

I've already given her a name too.... Lady will be her name. I have to say I can't wait till I can see her this weekend for the first time since I live 150 KM away from my niece and this weekend / upcoming days are extremely busy for me. 

I must say that I've been never so exited to have a pet that will hopefully be a very very nice companion to have around in the house! Planning to make her very loving since she already wants to sit on your lab all the time when she is out of the cage. 

Feel free to post any tips comments, below to chat around a bit :)

Thank you for reading!

3bjsq9,11,2015-06-29,"""Why would a guy suddenly stop talking to you?"" or ""I need to chill the crap out""",[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/3bjsq9/why_would_a_guy_suddenly_stop_talking_to_you_or_i/,"I'll disclaimer this right now: despite being in my late 20's, I am extremely new to dating.  Long story.  And I feel like this may well be stuff I should've figured out in my teens if I had dated back then.

There's this guy I've been talking to since mid-March, met through an online dating site.  At the time, neither of us had much going on in our lives -- me on vacation, him sort of between things -- but it was also a time where we both needed someone to talk to.  We were countries apart, but I was due to move to the UK (where he was) about 6 weeks later.  So we chatted/Skyped a lot, literally every single day, hours at a time.  We got really close.

After I get to the UK, we eventually work out a date where I can go see him (we're in different cities).  It's two months now, and not a day has gone by where we don't talk/flirt/etc.  He's a fixture.  I wake up finding messages from him, and I get woken up just as I'm drifting to sleep at night by a notif from him.  I do the same.  On the agreed day, I go up and we meet and spend a really chill, lovely day playing games, walking about the city, me watching him bake.  That night, we sleep together, and it's -- how to say -- goodtimes?  Nuff said?  Nuff said.

That was also the day that he got offered a summer internship in a foreign country.  It was gold for his career; he knew it too, and I encouraged him.  He soon accepts.  The next day, I go home and we don't see each other for a couple of weeks.  The first few days after the visit, we're so cutesy it's almost sickening.

After that afterglow, I hear a lot less from him.  And I get it; he has to pack, move city, get his workface on.  But it's not just the frequency that changes -- the temperature does too.  He feels distant, even a bit cold, at least compared to how we usually are in text -- and especially how he was those first few days after the visit.  I ask him if I've done something wrong, and he assures me I haven't; it's just that he's moving and stressed.  I tend to be something of an inquisitor, preferring to ask more than talk about myself, so he then asks me to talk about myself for a while and then he'll catch up.

It's nearing 3 months now since the beginning, when we see each other again.  He's come down to my city, where he flies out from, and he carves out half a day just for us on the day before he leaves.  And we gallivant.  Again, it's another great time, for me and it seemed like for him too.  When the date ends, I wish him a safe flight and we part ways.  I message him the next day before he takes off, saying much the same and that he'll be missed.

A few days later, we have something of an odd exchange.  I'm on a tour with some friends, and I message the guy noting a couple I see (we both like to people-watch).  My exact phrase: ""Omg the cutest gay couple touring Harry Potter studios together"".  He responds to this with: ""no we're not"" and ""also, you're not cute, and we're not a couple, and F Harry Potter and his bleached [something-or-other]"".

It strikes me as a joke at first, so I respond to it like one.  It seemed clear to me I wasn't talking about us.  Only later I read it differently.  I think he might have misunderstood, and in case it really was the equivalent of someone throwing a hand in your face and saying ""back off"", I gave him some space.  I knew we weren't a couple; I wasn't saying we were.  I guess I hoped he'd realize that and it wouldn't be awkward.

For the three days after that, he doesn't message.  The Every Day Streak stops.  When I finally message him, he puts off the convo til the next day.  He had to sleep.  It wasn't about the odd exchange, but something else.  Then I later make an off-hand comment about another couple I saw during the tour, to clarify that I wasn't talking about us, albeit in a roundabout way.  He doesn't respond to that at all.

It's now been two weeks since then, and conversations have been short, and most initiated by me.  He just doesn't seem to want to talk anymore, and I don't get it because I thought we were really close and things were going really well.  In our early days, he made a point of saying that he tends to be direct with people and what his expectations are and being honest, even mentioning how his past SOs have let him down in that respect (growing distant, not talking).  And now it feels like he's doing what he said they did.  And it doesn't make sense.

My question is simply: what do I do?  I really like this guy, and I get that two dates don't make a relationship, but I just want to keep talking with him and continue this... 'courtship'?  Sure.

**TL;DR**  A guy I've really hit it off with, with 3 months of online chat and two IRL dates on the latter end, has grown distant, possibly due to an awkward misunderstanding.  Do I just take a hint, or ask him about why he's distant, or something else?  Do I just need to the chill TF out?"

However, I was recently placed in charge of ""Procedure X"" for 6 coworkers. If Procedure X doesn't get done, we are open to serious legal trouble (think lawsuits, patent claims, etc.), and I can get in trouble with my boss's boss. A branch department violated Procedure X recently and was involved in a huge scandal and multimillion dollar lawsuit (plus many firings...).

However, none of my coworkers take Procedure X very seriously. Every day I find that at least one of them has not gotten it done. The problem is, I have no power to enforce this. I cannot write up or fire anyone, I can only report them to our boss (on a business trip until August) or to HR's ""Procedure X"" division--the nuclear option.

I would really appreciate advice on how to deal with these particular coworkers and how to talk them into doing Procedure X without making them all hate me (and making my job miserable):

1) ""Jasper"" [20s M] is an asshole who doesn't care if we get sued. He's irreplaceable due to his technical knowledge and feels like he's too important to be bothered with rules.

2) ""Camilla"" [20s F] is super busy all the time and constantly forgets about Procedure X, if I ask her to do it she does, but when I'm out of the office it doesn't happen.

3) ""Jimmy"" and ""Albert"" [20s M] are scatterbrains who leave procedure X half-complete and cause a lot of hassles. They don't seem to understand that Procedure X is *really fucking important.*

4) ""Calvin"" and ""Cooper"" [30s M] are above me on the corporate ladder (title, paid more, etc.), if I ask them to do Procedure X they say they will, then never get around to it.

Should I just give up and threaten them with HR to get them to follow procedure? Is there anything I can do to make the fact that I'm ordering them around bother them less?

3bk7mt,1,2015-06-29,I lost my first ever job and I keep going over it again and again.,Artsydircy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3bk7mt/i_lost_my_first_ever_job_and_i_keep_going_over_it/,"I went for my first interview in a field I had not studied but had done the odd freelance job for. They knew that. This would be my first job and I barely had any experience. I passed the test at the interview and started on a 6-month internship. I may not have had the experience but I loved my work and finally found the field I wanted to continue in. I have had a passion for it from the beginning and had been teaching myself what I could, so I wasn't going in entirely blind. 

Our department consisted of EgoBoss, James (who hired me) and Nick, who I had to work with mostly. EgoBoss did his own thing and didn't pay much attention to me. James was chill and appreciated all help I could give. Nick, however, I came to learn had control issues and liked to micromanage a lot. It came heavily in the way of my learning. EgoBoss tended to go on power trips so I avoided him, plus some of his actions let me know that he would screw me over without remorse if he felt like it so I felt really insecure.

I eventually got hired full-time. I had gotten them a client, and worked on a big campaign with them too so things were not too bad.

However things started going downhill as work progressed. Nick wanted things to go one way and that was his way. I was slow and I tried to be faster. Nick understood because he started out like me and was incredibly slow himself. I tried to learn but they wouldn't include me in meetings but expected me to work on whatever they had discussed. I stayed late nights, made sure they knew that my time would always be available and learned whatever I could.

I started out with so many ideas but ended up executing Nick's ideas instead because he just couldn't have it any other way. I spoke to James about it and he knew it was a problem but didn't know what to do. The few times Nick was forced to let go, we worked great and I was very productive but those were far and few in between. I really felt as if my soul was being sucked out of me. 

I felt insecure in my job and James told me that my performance was not up to par. I really tried to improve but I had zero support. Nick was getting annoyed with me asking him for approvals (had to. It was part of my job. As a junior I couldn't give out anything without an approval) and they reduced me to doing all the things they did not want to do. My creativity was dwindling out and I was extremely frustrated and about to leave, when I got my letter of termination. They said that the agency was moving forward but I wasn't moving with them so they had to let me go. 

I blamed myself until one of the management (who seemed sick of the place undermining her, I learned) told me that it was not me, it was the agency. They had mis-hired me. This agency is struggling and they needed a senior who had years of experience to do the job on their own. They don't have time to look over a junior. I'm at the level I should be and need to be in a proper big agency where I will have a real chance to learn. This place is good only for those with experience, who can hold their own. 

James had been the only one fighting for me and was frustrated with Nick. He finally told me what had really happened. Nick and EgoBoss didn't want me around anymore and so EgoBoss upped his expectations of me without telling me. So when I failed to meet them they used it as a reason to fire me. And of course, EgoBoss waited till he was out of the country to send James to give the news. But I was grateful because James did it with tack and felt remorseful. 

So I'm now in limbo. I finally got my license after months of struggling and I go out every morning to practice driving. I've started going to the gym and am spring cleaning all the junk out of my room. I'm stuck though because my laptop's broken and I'm terrified that I will get it back forever broken. It's my life and it's bloody expensive.

My friends and family have told me that I can be very anxious and negative. That's true. Now I am trying to be more positive but it's a struggle. I feel like a failure and scared of what is ahead and if I'm going to get there. I'm going to be 26 and have nothing figured out. My parents have been amazing but I feel like a burden and I keep going over what happened and why it did. I'm the only one of my friends to lose a job and that stings too. The future is so uncertain and time seems to be flying by so fast, it's terrifying. 

I wish I could get over the fear and anxiety more than anything. It's suffocating. 

Thank you for reading. :)

I've been meaning to talk about this in length and glad there is a place where I could let all this out. "

3bkb0d,1,2015-06-29,Really interested in becoming a writer for a game studio...where do I start?,FickleWombats,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3bkb0d/really_interested_in_becoming_a_writer_for_a_game/,"After having just finished my freshman year at college, and tasting a bit of what it's like to be on my own and pursuing whatever is going to be the next step in my life, I realized something. All the things I love came together in one field, writing on a narrative or lore team for a game studio.

I've been an avid reader of fantasy for as long as I can remember and have loved all the classics of the genre. I have scoured fiction for my favorite authors, to name a few, Tolkein and Jordan to Sanderson, Rothfuss, and Martin. Science fiction too has been a great love of mine, with the words of Isaac Asimov and Kim Stanley Robinson sending my imagination far beyond the realms of fantasy.

But enough of inspirations, what makes me want to write for a video game the most is this: I love to write. I write for myself in the form of poetry and fiction that I create and I write for others in the form of journalism and active blogging. Writing does something special to me, it centers me a bit. To do it for a career (and not to mention doing it in the coolest way possible) would be a dream.

And to compliment my interest in writing and reading, I have a fascination with the early mythologies of cultures. Exploring their histories, and seeing the patterns that appear in folklore and myth throughout the world is something that really excites me. To help build or create a mythology, history, or legend for a video game would be a dream.

But the video games that inspired me to start thinking about all of this are probably the most important. Dark Souls was probably my single favorite game of all time, the experience of traveling through Lordran and attempting to piece together stories from the scattered NPCs and items in the world was intoxicating. The Dragon Age and Mass Effect series hooked me with their intense portrayals of single characters, delving deep into their personal histories. The ability to come away from a game understanding the personality and nuance of a character like Garrus Vakarian is pretty amazing.

So I just kind of threw a lot of information at you guys, but I figured that some game writers must be on /r/gaming sometimes. Or at least people that have been interns! I want to know how to get started, I've looked at some companies internship programs, but most just got interns at the beginning of the summer. 

In conclusion, to anyone who knows, what is the best way to begin the path to writing histories/lore/narrative for a video game? Any general tips for someone who is looking for a position like this? Useful items to build into a portfolio?

Thanks to anyone who responds :)"

I've been lurking this sub for a while and finally decided to post something as I've had a few ongoing struggles with motivation.

I've been producing music for a few years now and through thick and thin that has been the one thing in my life that has stayed consistent and I've really put lots of time and effort into. Music is my true love and I want to make a career out of it, hopefully a really successful one.

My struggles pretty much started after I graduated school. I moved to Atlanta for an internship because I thought it was what I wanted to do. I was an intern for a while and doing intern-y type stuff, but in the back of my head I saw the direction it was going (in my mind most interns at the studio were headed to be recording/mixing engineers, and while I respect that craft, it wasn't what I wanted to be doing) and I chose to opt out. Part of me regrets the decision because A. I could've built up great contacts and B. I could've done the recording/mixing work there but still work on my own craft in the meantime (which I didn't like the idea of doing) but what happened, happened, and I ended up leaving the studio and moving home.

It took some convincing from my parents as they were financially supporting me while I was there, but I convinced them and myself that I was going to move home to focus on my solo career, and give myself a year to get off the ground and 'build my buzz' so to speak. I was told I needed to get some sort of job to pay the bills and support myself, which I obviously agreed to and knew I needed to do.

So I moved home and thats where the problems have started. I basically have been home for 2 months now, and the first month was primarily me just working on music. I was couped up in the house a lot, and had no income. I wasn't even looking for a job. Month two rolls around and is coming to a close now, and I'm just noticing weird things about myself that are pretty uncharacteristic. For example, I had a job lined up as a dishwasher, and then had a friend tell me he could get me a job at the gas station he works at, so even though I had been hired at the dishwashing job, I told them I got another job and I couldn't work there due to schedule conflicts. So gas station job training starts, and I'm there for one day of training and decide to quit. It was my pride talking me out of it, saying that I would rather have 0 income and be able to work on music all day, then give up time (only during the weekends mind you) to work at a job that I despised. So now I'm back in the same situation as I was in when I first moved back: no job, no money, just the music.

But I think the ultimate problem lies in the fact that I'm never doing much to progress my musical career aside from the fact that I actually am making the music on my computer (im an electronic producer fwiw) - and what I mean by that is, I'm not going out networking, I'm not getting involved in the local scene which is Boston, and I feel like overall I'm having social anxiety issues like I've never had before, so that has been really hard as well. My parents look at me differently now, as I'm basically couped up all day at the house and when they come home it feels like I have nothing to tell them. I feel like a bum, and I'm sure they look at me in that way which is tough because two years ago when I went away to school I felt like the world was my oyster. I will say however, I have been applying to a lot of music related jobs in the city and so far no luck, I've probably sent out like 10-15 applications in the last few weeks.

I feel like I am pretty insightful as to my own problems, but whatever has gotten into me lately has just been filled with self-doubt, social anxiety, and a real defensive attitude towards any and everyone.

Sorry for the rant, I'm not even sure how one would answer this post, but I was just looking for some advice and comments from anybody who is willing to contribute."
3bkt41,1,2015-06-29,I want to feel again...,Fapony,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3bkt41/i_want_to_feel_again/,"I started nofap because of PIED, for more information on that here is a link to my first post: [ED Since 17 Now 20](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/3ajae4/ed_since_17_now_20), but now I want to cure the fogginess in my head.

For at least half a decade nothing has really excited me. I feel so numb to everything and haven't had a good cry since I was like 11ish (and believe me I have tried). I am a generally reserved person and have had anxiety for a long time; I'm constantly over-analyzing everything and my hands are always sweaty. I'm trying to work on this by trying new things that are outside of my comfort zone, one of them being making an account on reddit and posting (I have been a lurker for quite a few years).

However, a lot of these things would get me in trouble at home, as my mom (dad isn't in the picture) is very religious and might kick me out depending on the severity of said action. This makes me paranoid which doesn't really help with the over-analyzing/anxiety. With that being said I am a person who thinks highly of themselves (I don't think less of others, I used to but luckily I've grown out of that) and have enough willpower to override my fear.

My latest adventure was trying weed out for the first time - it was fantastic. However, I recognize that weed is not a solution and will only use it recreationally, at max once a week (realistically once a month) and only with friends.

In addition to trying out new things here is what I do:

1.Work Out - this is a big part of my life. I lift 5 days a week (have been doing so since high school) and I believe this is why I have a lot of confidence in myself, even though I am paranoid.

2. NoFap - I have been trying to successfully complete the 90 day challenge for a while now. I usually fail because I tend to try to ""test"" myself and edge. No more of that. Period. This time I will make it to 90 and maybe even stop forever.

3. Cold showers - this is relatively new and was extremely hard for me to do (I love my hot showers! lol). It did increase my willpower and slightly decrease my anxiety, but so far I'm only a week in.

4. Open up - I told my best friend about my agnostic beliefs, which was something that was very hard to do. I also told him about how my dad ran out on us (he was a bad person and I am happy he is out of our lives) and how my family is financially not sound (me and my sibling are graduating college right after one another so this should soon be a lot less of an issue once we get jobs).

5. Talk to strangers - I try to introduce myself and be friendly with people. However, I am horrible at small talk and often draw blanks. Also, I have a very stoic face and have been told I look depressed or angry - which doesn't help when meeting new people (I do try to smile though, but it doesn't look genuine when it isn't).

Also, there is a girl at work (summer intern, like me) that I like. I think she likes me too and I want to ask her out. However, if we do go out we will have to keep it a secret because if my mom finds out my life would be over (my brother goes to the same school as me and he isn't on the same page, so there would be a decent chance of my mom finding out through him). I don't want to burden her like that, but I also can't spend the next 3 or so years repressing myself. I don't know what to do.

Do you guys have any advice on what to do in this situation? Also, is there anything else I should add to my list of self-improvement?"

3bl5nh,1,2015-06-29,Should I take this internship?,castro524,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bl5nh/should_i_take_this_internship/,"Hello,

I don't know if this is the correct place to ask for advice, but it does relate to money. So, I applied for a summer internship through the MESA center at my community college and recently got word that I got it. Now I called and asked to confirm my spot, as the internship starts next and I had already believed I didn't receive it. They tell me I received the spot but that they had forgotten to send out the emails last week. The reason I mention this is because I work full time. I want to participate in the internship, but if I do I would have to quite short notice. I called my boss and asked her if I would be able to work weekends until it is over, which is at the end of July. She told me no and that if I did quit it was not going to be properly, basically telling me that if I wanted my job back or a job at the resort again I would not get it. This shocked me as she has always seemed supportive of my schooling. 

Anyways I need to decide if I am going to take the internship. I am leaning towards no, even though I believe it is best for me simply because I have a car payment. I live with my parents and pay for no rent or food. I do have 3 months worth of car payments and insurance covered as well as some money for gas. However like I said, I believe I should do this because it would give me more experience and an upper hand when applying for 4 year universities to transfer out to. The job I work at now has nothing to do with my degree, which is in aerospace engineering, and really wouldn't bother me if I left. The Internship would pay for all my housing and food while there and pay me $1000 for 3 weeks. Anyhow, I still think of the car payments and although I know I can get a job in the 2 months I would have afterwards I feel, i don't know, scared I guess that something might happen. 

Anyone out there that has had a decision like this to make before? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank You! I am sorry if this is long I just wanted to give out as much information as possible thanks!"

She (21F) and I have been living together for a little over two years now. About ago month we moved into a new apartment in a new town, but she hasn't stayed in our apartment at all because she accepted an internship position out of state.

Last week I received a text message from her saying that she could no longer afford to live with me and that she would be moving in with her grandparents. Her financial troubles come as no surprise to me, as I've lent her approximately $1,200 over the past year to help her get on her feet. She has made a few small payments to me, but still owes me over one grand.

Only my name is on the lease, so technically she can leave without any legal ramifications. I told her that she would need to bring me a cashier's check for what she still owes me before I would let her into my apartment to collect her things and officially move out. After I told her this, she completely stopped communicating with me. After not hearing from her for a couple of days, I told her that I would not be able to afford to live in the apartment on my own, and that if she didn't get me a check by July 15 that I would be selling her things so that I will be able to move. It's been over a week and she has since blocked my phone number (presumably), removed me from her facebook friends, and even blocked me from facebook. 

I don't want to sell her things, obviously. This is going to be a huge hassle for me, and I don't want to take all of her belongings away from her. I just am really at a loss for what to do, and any advice that you could give me would be much appreciated. We have several mutual friends that I suppose I could talk to, and I have her grandparents' phone number/address. I would really like to get in contact with her to sort this out, but I just don't know what route to take.

Thanks in advance for any advice!"
3blcjz,3,2015-06-29,(21m) Falling in love with another intern at work. Has boyfriend.,Overth3re4,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3blcjz/21m_falling_in_love_with_another_intern_at_work/,"So I started this internship about 6 weeks ago. ""Falling in love"" may be an exaggeration, but she's pretty much all I can think about in and outside of work. It's driving me nuts. I've fallen for girls before, but it always ends up not working out and i'm really hoping this can be the one time that something good happens.

I'll try to make this short as possible. So, the interns are all in the same conference room for all 8 hours of the day, therefore I see her all the time. We don't sit at the same table, but she is always coming over to my desk and talking to me. I'm not the best at reading people, but I feel like she has some feelings for me that are more than are more than ""just friends"". She always singles me out when we're in a group conversation. And will e-mail me sometimes just to joke around. But I'm also really bad at reading people so I could be wrong. 

She is someone that makes coming to work enjoyable (which is very rare for me). The weird thing is that I didn't know she had a boyfriend until about 2 weeks after we really started to become good friends. I never asked her if she had one, but she never brought him up.

Basically, my question is...what do I do? We have about 6 more weeks of the internship. If I tell her how I feel then...

**#1** she has a boyfriend, and **#2**, if she doesn't feel the same way, then it will be incredibly awkward at work

Maybe I should stay friends and just wait until they break up?

I am a transfer student who is coming to UNCC's Mechanical Engineering program after leaving NCSU's Aerospace Engineering program, and I'm hoping that someone who is subscribed here can help me with something I've been debating about. 


First some background: 

I have always loved working on cars or anything mechanical, and ended up taking two years of automotive classes in high school. After that, I joined the Navy and worked on F/A-18's. I have always wanted to be an Engineer, and so after leaving the Navy, that's what I set out to do. 


I did my first 3 semesters at Wake Tech Community College in Raleigh, and I did pretty well. I took care of Calc 1-3, Physics 1 &amp; 2, and a few other classes, and transferred to NCSU going into my Sophomore year. My last semester at WTCC I got a 4.0 (Calc 3, Physics 2, and Spanish 2). 

Despite doing well at WTCC and transferring with a 3.5, I had a terrible sophomore year at State. My main courses were Statics, Dynamics, Solids, and Diff EQ, and out of all of those, the only class I enjoyed was Diff EQ. I got so bored with drawing FBD's over and over again, and tirelessly deriving things without ever gaining an intuitive feel for any of the material we learned. I honestly don't feel any smarter about any of the subjects than I did before those classes, and that bothers me as I feel like I should be adding tools to my tool box with every semester. The two classes that I took in my major (Intro to Aerospace and Aerodynamics) were extremely dry, and even my wind tunnel lab turned out to be painstakingly boring. I spend countless hours in the library doing homework and studying for tests, but at the end of the day, I still had a terrible year (2.5 GPA) and don't feel like I learned anything. 

I am really a hands on type of learner, and it has been a hard change for me to go from working with my hands all of the time and feeling smart and capable, to sitting in a classroom getting lectured about theory and feeling completely stupid. Sometimes I just can't see the real-world application of endlessly deriving things and never seeing where it applies. We rarely used anything except for variables in my Aerodynamics class. 

I have been told by a few people that UNCC's Engineering programs are different (and it looks that way by the curriculum) and a little more hands on than the programs at NCSU. I am really hoping that this is the case, because I don't know if I can put up with two more years of what I just went through. I am trying to get into the Motorsports program and participate in Forumla SAE and all of that, but I'm hoping that the core curriculum as a whole is a little less dry. I honestly wouldn't have felt qualified to be an engineer if I would have continued at NC State (if it would have stayed that way throughout my time there). 

I have also seen the Mechanical Engineering Technology degree, and this is kind of new to me as NCSU didn't offer one. The only thing that I've really heard about it is the stigma that it isn't ""real engineering"", but from reading the ABET website description of what it is, it does seem a little more in line with what I want. However, I don't want to give up on what I have already started and regret it, and I am afraid if I switched there wouldn't be as many job opportunities and the starting pay would be lower (although if I enjoyed going to work every day, I wouldn't really mind as long as there was room for growth). I head some companies stick their nose up at people with BSMET degrees because they don't know what all the coursework covers. 

I have had two internships at this point (UTC Aerospace Systems and NAVAIR Systems), and it has been far more deskwork and excel than I would have liked, with little to no hands-on (not just for myself as an intern, but this is what I observed of the engineers as a whole). At NAVAIR, all it seemed like anyone did was update publications and try to act overly smart if one of the hourly workers asked them a question. There didn't seem to be any actual ""engineering"" going on at either place. If I have to go to work and sit in a cubicle 90% of the time I am going to be miserable. I like to think of it in the sense of a prototype- I would rather be testing it and building it with some design input than designing it and maybe getting to touch it a little sometime. I'm not sure if this is actually how it works in the real world of engineering, but I don't really have much to go off of here with my limited experience. 

So after this rant, I guess I should boil it down to a few questions: 
-For those of you in the Mechanical Engineering program, how hands-on are the courses? Do you feel like it's just endless theory and no application? Do you feel like you'll be a good and effective engineer who is equally ready to grind out Diff Eq's or go in the shop and weld something together?

-For those of you in Mechanical Engineering Technology, how bad does the stigma affect you, or have you even noticed it at all? What are your internships like? Are you worried about finding a good job after you graduate or making enough money? What kind of job do you expect to have? 
 
-For those of you who have switched (in either direction), why did you do it? Are you happier now, or do you wish you would have stayed where you started? 


I hope this all made sense, thank you for your time. I may edit this a little and post it to one of the engineering subreddits as well, but I also really want some insight that is specific to UNCC's programs since that will apply to me most. "
3bljdy,2,2015-06-30,"Me (24f) and longdistance bf (22m), together almost 4 yrs, just not sure if I'm into it anymore (long, sorry)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bljdy/me_24f_and_longdistance_bf_22m_together_almost_4/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 3.5 years. I am 24 and he is 22. In October, I told him I was ready to take our relationship to the next level and wanted to talk about getting engaged. He was unwilling to talk about it or consider it and I think it has taken a major toll on our relationship. He graduated from college at the beginning of May, so we are now long distance (about 2 hours driving time). I am currently finishing up my last year of grad school, and he wants me to consider looking for jobs near where he lives. But I’m not sure I can do it anymore…

In the past few months, everything he has been doing is annoying me. The stuff he posts on social media and literally just the fact that he wants to talk EVERY. SINGLE. DAY and gets angry if I am not able to answer him right away has become a huge issue. I am completing my internship to become a therapist and meet with clients practically all day, but he refuses to hear that. He says I am not putting enough time into our relationship, but I work 8-hour days, do my internship at least 4-5 hours per day, AND go to school on top of it all; I don’t have a ton of free time. 

Like I said, he just graduated in May, with a good degree. He has the potential to get an awesome job with good money until he starts school again in fall 2016. However, right now he’s working at a restaurant. He refuses to search for a job where he can use his degree because “no one will pay him enough” and he does not want to work a 40-hour work week. I try to help him find jobs online to apply for and he dismisses me. He keeps saying he’s “going to start looking” but puts it off because his resume is not ready and he “needs his mom to help him with it.” I’m frustrated because I feel like he doesn’t want to be an adult. He was in a fraternity in college and is fucking obsessed with it – it is all he posts about. He took a position on the frat’s alumni board and that is how he spends his free time – researching stuff for the fraternity. The last time I went to visit him, he spent the majority of his time on the computer doing “Research”.

I last went to visit him about 3 weeks ago, and something he said became the final nail in the coffin, I think. We were talking about what we would like at our wedding when we got married, and who we would have in our wedding party. I named four of my closest girlfriends, and mentioned that I’d also like to have my friend Aaron in our wedding, who is gay. My boyfriend looked at me like I grew another head and said “there is NO way Aaron will ever be in our wedding.” He didn’t elaborate why, but I think it’s because my boyfriend’s family is SUPER catholic and demands a Catholic wedding, and my friend being in our wedding party would somehow offend his family. 

His and his family’s beliefs are another issue I’ve been thinking about. They are very Catholic. My boyfriend goes to church every week because he lives with his parents and says his mom “forces” him to. Religion is not a huge deal to him, however, he says if we were to get married, it would have to be a Catholic wedding because his mom would not accept anything else. I have a huge issue with the whole non-Catholics having to ‘agree’ to raise their children Catholic and send them to Catholic school. I want my kids (if I ever have any) to be worldly and not bound to any particular religion. I also feel shitty that my boyfriend seems to agree with his mom more than me, and doesn’t really stick up for me. I told him we can have Catholic wedding, but I did NOT want a mass because my family is not Catholic and would not be able to participate. He told me I would just have to deal with it. If we are going to spend our lives together and you want to agree with your mom on everything and do everything just to appease her…I don’t think this is going to work out.

8 months ago, I really did want to get married to him and start our life together, but I’m not so sure anymore. I don’t know if I’m just too busy for a relationship right now (is that even a thing?) or just don’t want to be with HIM. The thought of spending time with him isn’t something that I look forward to or get excited about anymore – it feels like a technicality that I have to deal with. He is also very certain he wants 3-4 children, and I am starting to wonder if I even want kids at all…I just feel like we are going different directions. He’s just finished college, and I’m almost done with my master’s degree and ready to start my career and adult life. I don’t know if it’s just the wrong time, or really what is going on.

I’m starting to think maybe this relationship should just end due to some conflict of interests. I have a hard time thinking about it…we’ve been together for so long. I admit, I have the whole “I’m afraid to be alone, I will never find anyone else who will love me” syndrome…plus many of my friends are getting married in the next two years, which makes it even more difficult for me to think about breaking up with my longterm partner. Any advice would be appreciated!

TLDR: Long-distance boyfriend and I seem to have different ideas of what we want in life and are in two different places right now. I’m afraid of being alone, but I don’t get excited to see him anymore. Should I just end it now?

3blmwz,1,2015-06-30,Some questions on the Graduate(MS) CS program.,ankitvg,UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/3blmwz/some_questions_on_the_graduatems_cs_program/,"Hello slugs,

I am an incoming international graduate student for the MS in CS program at UCSC. While the time of my application, website mentioned that we require 48 credits to earn our degree, however a few days back while I was planing my class schedule for the upcoming quarters, I learned that credit requirement has come down to 40 only. So basically, it is possible to complete MS at the end of the Spring 2016 semester for me (I start in Fall 2015). Before graduating, I wish to spend as much time as possible in the industry/research projects.

My questions are:

1) Will this decreased credit requirement have impact on the ""value"" of masters degree in CS at UCSC?

2) I crawled through the whole UCSC CS department website and couldn't find the minimum credit requirement to be taken in a quarter to be considered as a full-time student. Please share your knowledge on the same.

3) Is it possible to do co-op internship as an international masters student at UCSC? I have heard some colleges require students to take some number of credits while they go for co-op. What are the conditions at UCSC?

4) Course enrollment has began. I wanted to take CMPS242:Machine Learning course this quarter so I would be eligible for Advance Machine Learning course to be offered in next quarter. But the course if full. I have mailed Prof. Helmbold regarding my issue and requested him to take me into his class; yet to receive a reply. Can I attend his classes for the first 2 weeks and wait for people who might drop CMPS242 and ask him again to take me into this class? Is it possible?

5)  Who is Wesley Mackey?

Thanks guys ;)"

    On my calendar is a ?Leap Second Party? at our house tomorrow (Tuesday) night. It?s been cancelled. sorry Linus. 
    I?m going to be off-planet tomorrow night, and the kitchen is in the midst of an upgrade. so it can?t happen there. 
    
    However, if anyone wants to call a Leap Second party anywhere else, I?ll be there in spirit?
    
    I hereby abdicate my throne for Leap Second day. On the good news, I?m teaching Linux to aliens (ok, not exactly aliens, but they don?t speak English)..

    Here is my listing of job resources in Chattanooga in IT related fields
    that are usually missed:
    
    Lamp Post Group is one of the main Venture groups in town and they have a
    list of job postings for all their companies:
    https://boards.greenhouse.io/lamppostgroup
    
    There are also several meetup groups in town, many of which have postings
    from time to time. You can see that entire listing on
    http://chadev.com/lunch-slides/#/3
    http://chadev.com Which is sort of the meta group in town for devs/IT/etc...
    They also run #chadev on irc and http://jobs.chadev.com/
    
    Other startups are under the CoLab http://colab.co and many of those are
    looking.
    
    http://spartanventures.co/ Might be hiring or hiring for a portfolio
    company.
    
    (And also here, but you already found that one...)

    I know people complain about it, but I actually like the explicit `cat` at

I’m very excited about learning more about Moldova and Chisinau, and I have a couple of questions:

1. Is it easy to find ATMs that will take Western European chip-and-pin cards? I have read contradictory things about this online.

2. I’m learning some Romanian at the moment but am still on the basics. Is English spoken in many restaurants and shops?

3. What’s the best way to travel around the city? I’ve heard there’s a trolley bus system. 

Thanks in advance for responses and any other things you think I might need to know!

My name is Tom and I am the social media intern at The House Shop, an online property portal for private landlords (check us out - https://www.thehouseshop.com/) 

I have been tasked with creating a video about 'living and working in Wimbledon'. As we all know, the Wimbledon tennis tournament is currently taking place and will be lasting for the next two weeks. We are looking to find out what effect the event has on those who reside in the Wimbledon area as well as the effect the tournament has on trade for local businesses.

If anyone here falls into the catergories of living or working in Wimbledon or knows of someone who may be able to help me with this task, please drop me a PM and we could hopefully get an interview arranged for 1st July (morning or afternoon)

We are looking to ask general questions such as effect on transport congestion, litter, crime,  parking space rentals (if this is something you are doing this year). Please also don't hold back on your thoughts about the tennis. We are trying to obtain a mixture of responses. So if you adore it or you need to rant about it, why not have a quick chat with us.

Thanks for your time Reddit!

Tom"

Like the title says, I am an aspiring program evaluator. I am currently a dual masters degree candidate (MPH/MSW, concentrations in research methods and social policy and evaluation, respectively, with a graduate certificate in health informatics) who has spent the last year interning as an evaluation intern in a major health system. I find this profession very exciting and rewarding, specifically the areas of health and mental health, and hope you all can provide me with some insight (this cross-posted in the Evaluation subreddit. I apologize for the lengthy post). 

Is joining the American Evaluation Association worth the money? 
What blogs/twitter feeds/ email lists do you all follow and/or find worthwhile? 
Are there any trainings/certification I should look into getting that would increase my skill set/marketability?
Im a bit of a data viz nerd, does anyone have any recommendations for books/resources I should look into? 
Lastly, I have a year left of grad school, but I am always updating/modifying my resume, would anyone be willing to give it a once over and provide some constructive feedback? 

Thanks!

3bmfyv,7,2015-06-30,Help finding an internship at a Library or Historical Society,Macaroknee,dayton,https://www.reddit.com/r/dayton/comments/3bmfyv/help_finding_an_internship_at_a_library_or/,"Hello fellow Dayton Redditors! 

I would just like to preface this post with a little info about the most amazing person I know. I originally wrote a huge piece but figured I would break it down into a somewhat smaller tl;dr post so you all don't have to dig through paragraphs upon paragraphs upon paragraphs. 

*First and foremost my mom is the most amazing, sweetest, and caring person I know.

*The past 4 years she has gone from a GED to one step away from a Bachelor of Science in Information and Library Services all while working a very physical full-time job and taking care of her mother who suffers from numerous mental and physical disabilities. 

*She has a 3.9 GPA and has made the Deans List or Presidents List every single semester of college. She has been out of school for 30 years mind you. She completely blows my mind. Her dedication and work ethic are unparalleled. 

*She recently moved to Dayton from a tiny close-knit New England town to be closer to my brother and I.

*Things were going great. She was feeling more comfortable day by day. She found a decent job to hold her over until she graduated. Ecstatic to be just minutes away from her children again.

*Robbed at gunpoint at her place of employment a few weeks ago. Emotionally distraught. A third of her hair turned grey that week. She vacated her position at work as she was too frightened to return. My mother would never hurt a fly and it angers me deeply that someone did that to her. No arrests, no leads, the police have bigger fish to fry, sadly. 

*The house she owns in New England was being rented by a tenant she believed would fulfill the lease. He did not and missed months of rent which went directly to her mortgage payment. She had to evict him. Since she was unable to pay her mortgage for months due to the tenant, and the unfortunate events that led to her leaving her position at her job, the bank is threatening foreclosure if not acted upon soon.

*The robbery and foreclosure notice happened the same week as the majority of her finals. Despite being incredibly shaken and distracted my mother passed all her finals with flying colors. She once again showed me that she is capable of anything. 

*Her degree is a Bachelor in Information and Library Services. It is somewhat of a uncommon degree, nonetheless is was the one my mom felt most passionate about achieving. My mother is a quiet and reserved woman who has a love for literature and history alike. Her dream job is as a Librarian but her door is always open to opportunity.

* The only requirement she has left in order to earn her degree is a internship at either a Library or Historical Society. She has contacted nearly every library and historical society in the greater Dayton area. (Dayton, Kettering, Beavercreek, Fairborn, etc, etc) Hardly any of them even reply and the ones that have stated that they do not have any internships available at this time. Her time to find an internship in Ohio is dwindling down and she is starting to lose hope.

*Though she doesn't want to, she is heavily contemplating moving back up north into her house, retaining a position at a previous employer, and finding an internship there. The college she attends has guaranteed placement within the state libraries there. That is a viable option, but one she really does not want to take. She wants to stay close to family and Dayton has FAR more opportunities employment wise than the area in New England in which she would be living. 

*I know this is a very long post but I'm just really hoping someone can help my mother out with finding a internship. We don't know anyone here and we don't have any connections. She just wanted to be close to her boys. She has worked harder than anyone I know to get to where she is in life. I guarantee as even just an intern she would be one of the libraries greatest assets. She is my hero and she deserves the best and nothing less. If anyone has ANY advice whatsoever please comment or PM. I would be so grateful and I know she would too. Thank you all so very much! "
3bmixx,3,2015-06-30,GMAT vs GRE,JerseyMan080,GMAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/GMAT/comments/3bmixx/gmat_vs_gre/,"Hi all, I'm entering my senior year at UConn as a finance major.  I want to go to grad school so im looking at entrance exams.  I currently have around a 3.0 and 3 summers of intern experience.  not the best grades but certainly not out of the running.  my question is will I have a better chance getting accepted taking the GMAT as opposed to the GRE? (assuming I score the same on both).  I've gotten mixed results while researching which one colleges prefer and how much that will influence their decision."
3bmmsb,3,2015-06-30,[Advice] 18 y/o recently hired in cybersecurity looking for guidance financially,Aerto_,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bmmsb/advice_18_yo_recently_hired_in_cybersecurity/,"Hello all,  
I am an 18 year old male living in the Fort Worth/Dallas, Texas area with my Mother (50) and Sister (12). I have been interested in cyber security and within the past year I had a job shadow of a Security Analyst at a 600+ person company. Since then, I have been offered an internship, and recently a full time job making $40,000 per year. I graduated high school with a 3.989 GPA and will be attending Penn State Online to further my education in Cyber Security.  
  
Now to the finance part. I ended high school, got this job, and had to select an online college all within the past 2 weeks. As you can imagine, this is a fairly crazy part of my life right now. I live with my mother and sister as previously said and we live in a good neighborhood close to my grandparents. My mother is recently divorced and we don't talk to my father as he is an alcoholic that needs to get his life together. Anyways, my mother makes roughly $35,000 a year. I am currently at a loss on what to do. The company I work for is offering me $40,000 and will reimburse my college at $1,000 per semester. The will also pay for a bootcamp and certification every year. Those run anywhere between $1,500 and $5,000. They offer full benefits which I assume is a good thing. I want to plan for the future so I can live comfortably later on in life. I don't mind saving if it will help me later on. I drive a 2011 Nissan Altima that costs ~$175 a month. We also borrow money from my grandparents to help pay for the house we live in. They don't mind at all since we are so close and we help them out physically in any way they need. I have a debit card and use it for basically everything.  

Now that you know the backstory here are the questions I have,  
1. Should I get a credit card? How to build up credit?  
2. I will be paying my mom roughly ~$500 a month to cover my living expenses at our current house. Would it be more beneficial for me to move into an apartment by myself? We have discussed that as an option.  
3. Saving, here is where I want the most help. What can I do to ensure that by the time I'm 30-40 I will be living comfortably? What are some options that I can do now to save and have my money work for me?  
4. If I do stay at home, would it be okay to upgrade to another car?  
5. What are the ""rules"" as to how much to spend on certain things? Like 20% on your car, 40% on living, etc.  
6. Any other advice that you can throw at me! I really want to make sure that I can live without worry later on.   
  
  
Thank you for reading and let me know if you need any more information. I might not respond right away as I am currently at work."
3bmorq,23,2015-06-30,I really want to expand my business wardrobe but I'm really not sure what to add to it.,Sheehan7,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/3bmorq/i_really_want_to_expand_my_business_wardrobe_but/,"I just started an IT internship in the city and I finally get to dress like I want to.

In addition to those I also have another outfit that is a white shirt, black tie, black pants, black shoes so I don't have a picture of it, pretty simple. I want more clothes but I just don't know what to get. I'm kind of at a wall. 

I want to try out some new things and pieces of clothing but I really don't know what to get. The office is mostly business casual no suits but so far I'm really liking what I have. Any recommendations on shoes, shirts, ties, pants, whatever?

3bmxnz,4,2015-06-30,"Succeeding In Corporate America, Response and analysis of some questions and complaints regarding the issue of a living minimum wage, and whether or not America rewards a strong work ethic.",Cad42988,inthenews,https://www.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/3bmxnz/succeeding_in_corporate_america_response_and/,"I would first like to mention this is a response to a previous thread called ""Salaried workers who earn nearly $1,000 per week would become eligible for overtime pay under a proposal President Barack Obama unveiled Monday"" by OP /u/bulldog75 that can be found here. http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3blho3/salaried_workers_who_earn_nearly_1000_per_week/
My response Is mainly geared toward the comments regarding men and women who work long hard hours for little money, and why they are not rewarded for their hard work. I mostly analyze the issue by drawing from my own life experience. While there is no empirical evidence or data in my analysis. I could easily find plenty to support it, and would be happy to do so upon request!

That's because the notion that hard work is valued in America is a lie. I once had a high-school math teacher tell me, ""if you're smart enough you'll never have to work a day in your life."" At the time I interpreted this to mean that I would find a job I loved so much that I wouldnt consider it work, however I would still need to work my ass off to get and hold that job.

More than ten years later I feel like I have a much better understanding of how the world works and now I realize that what she said should actually be taken literally. I have found that companies are most impressed by the person who can create the best and most creative shortcuts to avoid ever actually working. I think my life up until this point if anything is proof of that.

During High-school I was a major Slacker and basically blew off everything. I graduated with only a 2.2 GPA. every term at the parent teacher conferences my parents heard, ""He's such a gifted boy, if only we could get him to apply himself."" I was grounded from the 6th grade until I turned 16, because my parents did not allow us to get C's on our report cards. In the 7th grade I literally got straight C's for an entire year.

When I turned 16 I got a job that paid very well for a 16 y/o at the time, and I basically got paid $12/hr to do nothing. I worked this job all the way through undergrad and managed to complete my B. A. with no debt. in College I was an even bigger slacker than I was in high-school, however I became much smarter about it. I would only register for classes between 2-9 pm, taught by professors who did not take attendance. After my first semester I realized I could fit all my classes into two days a week. the first year I was there I developed a strategy that involved sitting by the nerdiest looking girl in the class who was above a 6 on my attractiveness scale, and immediately charm her into being my friend. then I would skip about half the classes, and basically only show up to chat with said girl, and other friends I would have/make in the class. at the end of the semester I would always bum an outline off the girl and host a study group, sharing outlines with everyone involved. from this i created one master outline which i then gave a copy off to the nerdy girl. then we would cram the night before and, 7 times out of 8, ended up hooking up.

As college went by I got into drinking, I made the deans list at the shitty Community College I attended for free, and transferred to a better school. By the time I got to my Junior year I attended on average less than 25% of my classes. I graduated in 2011 and had already decided the year before to go to law school. I rocked the LSAT studying only the night before playing logic games. Got accepted everywhere I applied even though my college gpa was average (3.0).

I decided to attend the highest ranked law school I applied to. so this is where I tell myself for months that I really actually need to put in the work. After all, every person you talk to prior to attending law school will tell you about the grueling amounts of work they have to do. My new found work ethic lasted about a week before I fell back onto old habits of never taking notes, and literally playing cash poker games online during 90% of the time i spent in class. Near the end of my first semester everyone around me starts freaking out since at my school finals are 100% of your grade first year. I did not freak out, most likely because i had always been a terrible procrastinator, am probably the only person at the school who isnt capital type A, as in Anal, And honestly just had faith that I would somehow do well even though I had only a weeks worth of notes for each class, consisting mostly of things discussed in the syllabus. 

Apparently my non-nonchalant attitude caused quite a few people in my section to think I was some kind of prodigy genius. About 3 weeks before the final I start getting random facebook msges, and even a few friend requests from people asking me to look over their outlines to see if they looked sufficient. After that my old system basically fell into my lap, and I made no effort to fight it. I made it through all but one week of lawschool without ever taking notes, or even paying attention in my classes, unless for some off reason I felt like it.

I Graduated Law School in 2014. so I thought, Ok I will definitely have to work my ass off to pass the bar right? After all it is supposedly one of the most excruciating tests one can take in academia. like many of my alumni, I decided to take a vacation immediately after graduation before my online bar class opened up. The bar class was completely on demand, with videos of the lectures streaming, practice tests, outlines ect... well about 2 weeks before the bar I still had not started studying. I basically get in a week of cramming, one day for each subject on the MBE and a cumulative day at the end.

Not only did I pass the bar, I got a job almost immediately following.
So my job consisted mostly of talking through legal problems with other first year associates, at a decently sized law firm with about 200 employees. We occasionally had to write Legal memorandums, or other short writing projects, every time I convinced someone else to write based on my own verbally expressed ideas, and told them I would proofread the work and credit them as having assisted when I passed it to my boss. 9 months later the company eliminates about 80% of the first years, which is pretty common in the legal job market. Not only was I one of just 4 attorneys to be offered a Job, I found out a couple months later that I was also the only 1 of the 4 who even attempted to negotiate salary, and as a result I managed to begin my second year with about 25% salary increase over my peers.

I literally do nothing now except explain my idea's to first years, hire unpaid interns to do things for me off my schools version of Monster job finder, and show up to expensive client lunches where I can be drunk or even stoned, as a lot of my clients now are, and I dont even have to pay for any of it! The moral of my story is, Corporate America does not respect work ethic. Work ethic is almost useless, anyone can work hard, and most of the time those who do are rewarded less than their lazier peers. My advice to you (reddit). In order to succeed, instead of working hard, focus on improving these three things about yourself. 

1. Your attitude. The problem with people who work too hard, is they often care too much. As a result they come across nervous, anxious, or weird. This often prevents the people/person who works hard(PWWH) from actually getting the credit they deserve, because when their boss has to take credit for the ideas of the people below them, they will likely not want give credit to the PWWH. This is because not only can they just take the credit themselves, no one has even heard of the PWWH, and the person cares to much about being seen as a ""good employee"" to confront their boss about it. To change this all you need to do is care about 99% less. People who dont care, often come across more relaxed, charming, and assertive than PWWH. As a result, their boss will not only be more worried about you calling them out for taking credit for your work, they will also see you as a leader, and will be more likely to include you in talks with their superiors. This is crucial for success, because It allows you to move up in the company solely based on how your bosses bosses perceive your personality during usually short time frames. This brings me to Item #2 

2. Learn to read people. I developed a texas hold' em addiction around the age of 16 when I joined my first Boss' weekly game, which lasted 8 years. As a result I had a nice head start on honing this skill. Also by the time I got to Law School I had become pretty proficient at Online poker as well, And managed to use it to pay for a decent sized chunk of my Law School expenses. Now when I say Learn to read people, I do not just mean find out if someone is bluffing or not. Watch people, see how they re-act to things, learn to read context clues in order to accurately guess things about a person before they even speak. As you do this you should be thinking, ""what is this person thinking, how will this person re-act to a given relevant hypothetical situation, and when they do that how can I best respond to further my own agenda. Once you do this for a while, people will start to become very see through and predictable. Personally I like to expand the hypothetical analysis to not only include usually 5 or more ""moves"" in, but also to include a couple back up conversation routes/Plans, in case the person act's in a way that does not conform with my top ranking predictions. I'm not sure how difficult this is for other people to master. While I think I clearly have a talent for it, I cant imagine it is impossible for anyone with Slightly above average intelligence, or higher. Then again, as far as I know, I have never lived as anyone other than myself, therefore I have no clue how difficult it actually is for others on average.

 Finally this leads me to the last, and in my opinion, most important tool you'll want to develop in order to be successful.

3. Learn to Hustle! No I do not mean quickly run to first base, or get your homework done in a hurry (although being able to write a 30 page paper the day it's due is a useful skill to have!) When I say Hustle I mean the ability to create money from nothing other than being clever! To be clear, I am not advising you to break the law, or intentionally hurt people through deception. I personally have my own moral code when it comes to hustling, but I think that will differ from person to person and is something everyone needs to find for themselves. As I previously mentioned, I paid for the entirety of my undergraduate experience while attending school, without loans. I had some scholarship and grant money but being 19 and trying to come up with even 10k a year for tuition on top of rent, bills, gas, food(beer), and spending money, can be a difficult task. So some weeks money was tight. By tight I mean, its Saturday, I already spent the entire paycheck i received 2 days ago, and I dont get paid again for another 12 days. So in order to eat drink and date I needed to find alternate sources of income.
 I continued to do this for the next 7 years and became exceptional at it. I'm not going to tell you my tricks, because I would refer to keep my IRL identity anon, and too many of my friends know my tricks and also use Reddit, and I would likely be pretty boned if anyone I work with could identify me as in this post. 
The Hustle is the most important factor in your success because this is what 90% of corporate America is Built on. all the Targets, Walmarts, and yes, even the entire legal community, is just one big hustle. None of these Jobs, or businesses actually create anything! All they do is take something from one person, whether its an idea, knowledge, or actual material goods, and they turn around and sell it to someone else at a higher price. Once you learn to hustle well on a smaller scale with your own dinner on the line, hustling rich people who have never had to take a bus in their entire life, becomes almost effortless. I know this was a way too long answer to your question, but I enjoyed spending 50 mins to type it all out, so I hope you find it useful, or at the very least, entertaining. Also I am linking a response thread I also posted it in, because I love to hear peoples reactions, and the more the merrier!

Tldr: Hard work is for suckers, if you read about half a paragraph and then jumped here you're probably already doing it right!"
3bn04o,13,2015-06-30,"Workplace life advice for ""conyos""?",IndiscreetThrowaway,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/3bn04o/workplace_life_advice_for_conyos/,"Oh shit, I made a blog post.

I've started doing my internship and I realized, it's college life all over again. It seems that people automatically hate me when I speak in English. But I'm too scared to speak in Tagalog since I sometimes struggle with it. I'm also that ""rich"" kid who realized too late that carrying a high-end phone, driving to work, and wearing certain clothes can incite criticism. I constantly try to be careful of what I show and say nowadays.

English speaking has become a bane for me these recent years. People expect you to speak Tagalog else you're not accepted. This has impacted my social skills, tbh. For example, the way I try to mediate this problem is by speaking silently (to the point of mumbling) or just nodding yes/no at questions.

The people there do make fun of me. Sometimes, they would say it in front of my face, thinking that I wouldn't understand Tagalog or thinking that I wouldn't recognize the words they call me. After a rough week, I was overly depressed after hearing all the things they would call me, indirectly and directly.  Even just after hanging out with friends and having a good time, I went to bed crushed over the judgments made on me at work.

On the bright side, I can socialize naturally when it's one on one with someone I think wouldn't judge me for my poor Tagalog or my English preference. They would speak Tagalog and I could understand them, I'd even reply in Tagalog, oftentimes without struggling.

But when I'm in proximity with others, I react badly to people talking to me. Mumbling, broken or just plain stupid.

So I guess I'd like to ask for advice. Advice on how to deal with this and possibly fix my own problems."
3bn4ou,12,2015-06-30,Saw Trainwreck last night. A very good comedy.,batatasta,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3bn4ou/saw_trainwreck_last_night_a_very_good_comedy/,"Went to an advanced screening last night. I went in with decent expectations because I'm an Apatow fan and I was mildly familiar with Amy Schumer. Glad to say that the movie definitely delivered. Easily Apatow's best movie since Knocked Up, and Schumer is probably going to blow up after this because she is very talented.

There's a ton of small supporting roles played by familiar faces and famous athletes. The stand-out being John Cena, who got some of the biggest laughs in the movie and shows off a shocking amount of skin. Lebron has a big part too, and is solid in the part and got a lot of laughs, but I don't see him becoming a successful actor.

Love me some Bill Hader so it was fun seeing him be the male lead for once. Unfortunately he is definitely the straight man here so doesn't get to be quite as funny as we're used to. His character is also a bit too perfect so it can be a tad hard to believe he would fall so hard so fast for the titular trainweck. He does have what I personally thought might have been the funniest bit in the movie when he plays some one-on-one with his bff Lebron and it goes exactly how you'd expect a one-on-one with Lebron to go.

There's also a strong B-story featuring Amy's dad and sister. Colin Quinn absolutely kills it as the dad, but he does still look a little young to be living in a nursing home surrounded by people that are clearly a lot older than him. I also appreciated that this story didn't go the way I expected it to for a rom-com and delivers some really strong dramatic scenes (Schumer can really act).

The movie's definitely not perfect. Like all Apatow flicks, it's too damn long! Easily could have cut 15 mins and the movie would have been much more effective. There's a subplot involving an intern (played by the guy that will be The Flash) that didn't really add enough. One of the guys I saw it with did find the it to be one of the funniest parts of the movie so I might be alone on this. Mainly Apatow just needs an editor that can help him reign it in here and there because this really effects the pacing of his movies.

Overall the movie was great. Every scene made me laugh out loud, and the whole theater was laughing the entire time as well. The last scene in particular brought the house down with some good old physical comedy. I did not partake, but the audience did applaud at the end which is always a good sign. I'd go as far to say it was my favorite comedy of the last year or two.

tl;dr Despite being too long, it's Apatow's best since Knocked Up and Schumer is definitely the real deal.

So here is my problem:


A little background, my gf and I have been dating for a year an a few months (both college students) and it's the summer. We live an hour away from each other but see eachother 2-4 a week. Now at the beginning of the summer life got a bit stale (mostly my fault in poor date planning) and I bumped up my game and now no problem. Well I shouldn't say that. There is a problem.


My gf interns at a large technology firm, I won't say what but it's big and located west. Anyway she has tons of intern friends now that she'll hang out with after work, mostly guys but that's just because it's a technology firm. This didn't bother me because why should it, she can have a life outside of me.


Here's the tricky part, my gf is very competitive and is good at teasing/smack talk and I have seen how she is around my guy friends and it can totally be mistaken as interest/flirting. Well as I suspected there is a dude who was interested in her at work. I didn't know this until she took me to a concert with the other interns and his feelings were apparent to everyone. I tried to brush it off and just make small talk between sets and the night went without conflict.


After he texts her and says how he had no idea how she had BF (he definitely knew, I'm a photographer and I'm all over her social media) but he doesn't want to come between us, he didn't even know if he liked her yet blah blah blah. Basically saving face and at the end offered just to stay best friend. Now that shit will not fly with me. When someone announces they are into you and you have a SO and you do not feel the same way you back off right? Wrong, being the nice(sometimes too nice to a fault) person she is she feels bad and still wants to stay friends. She even wants me to come on the group hike the two of them had planned in 2 weeks. I've tried telling her how that him no longer liking her is bull and that she needs to separate from him and she just brushed the topic off after apologizing a ton. I'm getting dinner with her tonight and I'm still a bit pissed.


**tl;dr**: Girlfriend lead a guy on at work, I told her how I was against it and was brushed off.  How do I deal with this? 


Edit: oh and one more thing, we crazy about each other she's just a tad naive. Smartest person I know but there are sometimes when I just think ""did you not know this?""


Edit 2: So I forgot to add one major detail. I moved to this state a week before starting university which, as fate would have it, means I have 0 friends where I live. Tons of friends at school but 0 in my hometown. The GF is the only one I hang out with besides going to work. I freelance so no work buddies.


Edit 3: She actaully has mentioned him and not in a way that was good at all. She had brought up the fact that she was questioning what if she ever wanted to see other people. Her words were something along the lines of ""theres this guy at work, I know i would never date him but what if I wanted to have the opportunity to find out."" Basically I'm her second BF in college and she always looks towards the future and if she marries me she says she doesnt want to regret not being single. That was a while ago and she had just felt that way because we had an off week and she will focus on a doubt and sort of freak out so I wasnt too worried although it hurt to hear she had her doubts. And so yeah that's why I was worried about this.

3bn9q5,5,2015-06-30,"Me [21 M] with my girlfriend [21 F] 3 and a half years, just broke up while she is doing an internship abroad in Spain",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bn9q5/me_21_m_with_my_girlfriend_21_f_3_and_a_half/,"My now ex-girlfriend has been doing an intership abroad for the past 3 weeks in Barcelona. She is supposed to stay for an additional 6. Since she has been gone, we have been having minor issues in our relationship. Due to the time difference here in America, 6 hours, it made it difficult for us to talk sometimes. However, we still spoke every day. 


Before me, my now ex-girlfriend (lets say Amy), was an abusive relationship for just over a year. About 6 months after, I came along and we completely fell for each other. Our relationship for the past 3 years had seriously been like a fairly tail. People would commend us on our communication skills and our ability to work things out maturely. We got along great and everything was perfect. Now this is the part that I need help understanding a bit. Throughout our relationship, it had been brought up many times that she suffers from mild to severe depression. Something she has been battling most of her life. 

When she was younger, she used to cut and contemplate suicide on a regular basis. Nobody would ever suspect this from her. She told me she hated who she was. Now fast forward to her time in Barcelona, eveything was goin great for her at first. She was doing this internship with a company that gave her housing and all that jazz. But something bad happened. She got in trouble for having a little bit of pot in her apartment, and it resulted in her almost getting kicked out of the program entirely. This was terrifying for both of us. After like a week of hard ache, misery, and simply not knowing what the outcome was gonna be, they decided to just give her a slap on the wrist. Although that sounds great, she suffered a lot emotionally from it. Her new group of friends have basically shunned her from the group. She feels like she is in the darkest place she has ever been since the point in her life she used to cut herself. She said something along the lines of ""I have locked myself in a room with all the fucked up parts about myself and im not meant to escape."" 

She told me that she feels worse than she felt when she was 15 yearls old. She is in a very dark place right now. And she told me that there ""is something inside of her that is missing."" She says its something that nobody can provide for her, its something she has to find on her own and she doesn't really know if she can. She told me that I have been the most amazing, supportive boyfriend anyone can ever ask for. But she feels as if she may have used that as a crutch, a shield so to speak, that protected her from the parts of herself she hated. She feels emotionaly unavailable and unable to invest in not only our relationship anymore, but other relationships with her friends back home too. Her emotions are so messed up right now that she says she feels like she doesn't even know who she is anymore.

I am posting here because I am lost. I am so fucking broken and I feel like I lost the love of my life. I need help understanding what happened. I have never been depressed before, so its hard for me to understand where she is coming from. If someone asked me why we broke up, I would be unable to give them a short answer. I need to know what to do with myself. I have already deactivated my facebook, unfollowed her on other forms of social media, I have pretty much gotten rid of every aspect of her on any social medium I am subscribed to. I don't know how to move on from this. Any other relationship I have had has ended in cheating (on the other part, not mine) or much worse. This is killing me. 

tl;dr Is there anyone out there that can help me understand 
what my girlfriend is going through and why it ended our relationship? What can I do to help me cope with losing the one person I thought I could actually spend the rest of my life with?"

*Cheers my friends, enjoy the game! Thanks for all your advice and help! I hope to see some of you online some day!*
**END EDIT**

Hi everyone,

First off, you're a great group of redditors! So supportive of one another and the devs, I admire that!

With that said... I've been checking out this subreddit for the past week (found via AlienTube) and saw how awesome and helpful everyone was. I was hoping someone who has experience with the game could help me out?

Below is my current setup and I was curious if the game would be playable for me? I can't afford to spend money on a game if my computer won't be able to run it... Gotta save that money from my internship and PT job for fall tuition/her engagement ring!

If something in my setup is lacking and I won't be able to play it... Let me know what I need to save up for after my bigger purchases (mentioned above)! Whether it be a GPU, MoBo/CPU upgrade, etc.

Lastly, I would still love to help the devs as I think most of you love them to bits! Haha. Even if I can't play, maybe I'll just donate a five or something... Even if you can't help with advice, maybe you know of how I can ""tip"" them?

Thanks guys! Continue being an awesome community!

3bnqs8,0,2015-06-30,Early warning signs between me [26M] and my girlfriend [25F] of four years.,dbdb4,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/3bnqs8/early_warning_signs_between_me_26m_and_my/,"I love her and want to marry her. She feels the same.

Excepting our dead bedroom, or at least what feels like a dead bedroom.

I'm enrolled in a graduate program at a university on the east coast. She lives on the west coast. My program is two years long, with the option of a third year, and I'm to enter my second, and hopefully final, year this fall. I fly home to her in northern California at every opportunity. (Out of the first nine month academic period, I spent about seven or eight weeks with her in California.)

When our relationship began, she warned me that she was ""broken."" She couldn't become aroused. We discovered very quickly that that wasn't the case. There was a lot of sex, maybe seven to ten sessions per week, despite her insane schedule. She had two jobs, two internships, and was a full time student. We also lived forty minutes apart.

The first nine months I spent out east were hard. I pursued therapy and became more communicative and open with her to make things work. And now, we are closer than ever before, just not physically.

Infrequent sex was already an issue before I left for school, so I spent February, March, and April amping up my workout routine to two and a half hours a day, six days a week, while sticking to a strict diet. I was in unbelievable shape. I told her that my goal was to get her wet just by taking my shirt off--to no avail. We didn't have sex for the first 13 days after I returned home for the summer. The only palpable response I got out of her was her hands on my chest and a momentary, ""Ooooh.""

It's now July, we're in Vegas, and we've had sex eight times since my return in early May. One session was pity sex through and through. One was her watching me. And another was our first foray into light bondage: I tied her down and used an assortment of toys on her for an hour and a half. The others were, more or less, vanilla.

I feel petulant, like I'm expecting too much of her, too much of a relationship. What confuses me is that we've had a heart-to-heart about our libidos: she's satisfied by sex one to two times per week, whereas I'm satisfied by three to five (I'm hungry for more than three when I work out). We aren't even hitting her minimum (I returned nine weeks ago).

I can count the number of times she's initiated sex with me in the previous two years on two hands. Initiation is my job, and I'm tired of it. I feel that if I were to stop, sex between us would disappear completely. Her rejections are almost rote, ""I'm too tired. It's late. I haven't showered. I feel gross. It takes too long. I have to drive to the city tomorrow. I'm hungry. I'm too full. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe this weekend."" She'll spend several hours on her phone before bed every night reading social media and Reddit while buffeting me with these excuses. I've even upped my foreplay game: ten to twenty-minute massages before gently kissing her neck and unfastening her bra, but I'm shoved away regardless.

If it helps, she rarely masturbates (maybe twice a year).

From what I've read, most DBers would kill for weekly sex, even biweekly sex, so I wonder if I'm the problem; however, I can't help but feel that our libidos are mismatched and that I should consider moving on.

Thank you for your time."
3bnu1u,4,2015-06-30,My [39f] nephew [21m] is a white supremacist and my BIL/sister[46m/45f] don't care,nationalisticnep,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3bnu1u/my_39f_nephew_21m_is_a_white_supremacist_and_my/,"*tl;dr - my nephew seems to have become a white supremacist/ultranationalist and I'm worried about having him around my kids, my BIL and sister don't seem to care at all because I don't think they see it as a problem*


My nephew has always been an independent and controlling person, and he's never really been a person that interacted with others. Whenever he visited us as a kid he
never really got along with his nephews and anyone else and always went on his own. He's always been a loner. He was more interested in technology and history then he was
interacting with people. 

When he got to 14-15 he rebuffed invites to hang out with my brother who was 18/19, and preferred to spend his time walking through forests near my
parents house and visting the history and technology museums. 

My BIL and sister fed into his interests a lot which grew into a military fascination which they fed by taking him to airshows, helping him participate in Civil Air Patrol, naval things since his father has a relationship with the navy through work and never really encouraging him to be social beyond CAP.


He spent a lot of his time in high school from what I know trying to get internships at companies in their local area that offered high school apprenticeships, mainly Sikorsky and I think it fed into his ideals even more. 


My husband and I, are rather liberal, and my BIL and sister were more in line with my parents that, they're pretty conservative, and they reinforced a lot of that into their 3 sons. My nephew is currently living overseas for school and my brother
is facebook friends with him, and he posted pictures of visiting war museums and gravesites through Germany, CR and Poland. 

I took a look and from first glance he's become a survivalist, he spent a lot of time hiking alone
in the alps and posting his escapades after, and he's been posting material out of ultra-right wing parties out of Europe and some specific anti-racial stuff. It looks like his friend group is pretty much people in the same vein
as he is. He even learned german and polish enough where he could talk to these people. 

Am I supposed to worry about this? Is it my job to worry about it? My sister said he wanted to come visit our dad because he hasn't seen his grandfather in something like 5 or 6 years now, and my father wants to see him too,
but I'm worried about him being around my kids because of his views, but my kids are really excited to see him because they haven't seen him since he was here visiting my dad. 

Should I keep my kids away from him? Is it something
for me to worry about when he comes to visit? My brother plans to have him stay over at his house and watch his daughters so they can have some bonding time. I'm not sure if I'm making mountains out of molehills since I know
that everyone is entitled to their own beliefs. My kids are between 10-16 right now.

3bo515,1,2015-06-30,Should I negotiate an internship offer from a start-up company?,Lmitation,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3bo515/should_i_negotiate_an_internship_offer_from_a/,"If this is not the correct subreddit to post this let me know and I will remove it; first time posting here. I was offered to work at a start-up a few days ago for $12/hr as an intern. I was told I would be doing software and wet-lab related work due to my computer science and chemical engineering background, one of which is my minor. I was told I should not negotiate the offer by my family due to it being a start up and this being my first internship (although not my first working experience in the technical field) in industry. I just wanted some more advice on how to handle this situation, and if I should negotiate how to do so."

3boopo,1,2015-06-30,[Need Advice] I don't know where to go,[deleted],getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/3boopo/need_advice_i_dont_know_where_to_go/,"I'm sorry if this doesnt fit the criteria for the sub but I just want some guidance and sorry for the long read. This is written on very little sleep.

I'm a college student (19 Y/O) going to community college for Computer Networking I enjoy working with computers. I don't enjoy school very much so I'm choosing to only get my associates and hopefully find an internship or something, I also don't want debt.

I've also been working a minimum wage job, the job itself is easy and co-workers are fun. My only gripe is it doesnt allow me to do the things I want because of money. Because of this I applied to a major warehouse (Amazon) not too long ago and started 4 days ago. The job itself is soul sucking and I'm a zombie all night (7PM-5AM) but I suffer through cause the pay is much better compared to the other job. I work 4 days on 3 days off. I told myself to push through cause of advancements but I dont know If I/my body can take it. Even though I'm fresh I dont think the job is good for me even if the pay is good.

Having experiencing both of these jobs, I have perspective that I dont want to be stuck like this and work my life away. I always wanted to do music production but I lack the motivation/diligence to keep after it. I yearn to travel with friends and especially skydive eventually. Of course theres a list of things I would love to get into (photography to name one) but again it all comes down to money. I'm also not in the best shape and play games all the time in a way to escape.

I just want to know what this sub thinks is the best way to find where to start and escape this hole I feel like I'm stuck in. I want to be successful and content in life while getting to do all the things I want. If you have any advice I will appreciate anything I can get.
