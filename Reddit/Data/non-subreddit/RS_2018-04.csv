88n21u,4,2018-03-31,Is M.D./Ph.D still possible for me?,averagecollegestuden,mdphd,https://www.reddit.com/r/mdphd/comments/88n21u/is_mdphd_still_possible_for_me/,"Hi everybody. I am finishing my third year at a CC (had some family issues that will go into a little later) due to financial issues. I have a few Ws due to an abusive living situation with family that required me to not be able to go full time and it has resulted in about 6 Ws throughout the 3 years. My cumulative GPA is sitting at about a 3.87 still, however, just not sure if the Ws will be a giant problem. Now that the situation has gotten better and I settled the issue with my parents and I'm no longer being kicked out of my house (however I will still be moving out sometime mid next year for sanity purposes). I have completed 1 year of research in chemistry for natural products (not what i'm interested in, but was a cool opportunity). This summer I have gotten an internship at a national lab doing chemical biology research that I am very much interested in and have the opportunity to continue it for my last two years if I stay locally and go to the 4-year. I have about 150 hospital volunteer hours, worked as a tutor all this year, past two summers ~80 hours of helping a teacher with summer school, and 85 hours of shadowing (30 with a pediatrician that will be writing me a letter, and other 55 with a different pediatrician, an oncology/hematology, a neonatologist, and will be getting about 7 hours with a neurologist soon). I will have one poster presentation from the natural products chemistry research this year, one from summer internship, then there is a possibility I can get another one or two from the national lab I might be at next year. Is there still hope? Or have the Ws screwed me? I don't plan on getting anymore."

Even though my major is CSC and they're not related, I still feel getting an internship at such a prestigious firm is a big deal. Im a sophomore which is why getting an internship in the US is a bit difficult. What do you guys think? I am very keen on doing it also because I will be exposed to a completely new department.  "

Sieg Heil! I mean... Beep Boop, I am a robot.

My purpose is to find and link comments in r/Politics that contain the word 'Hitler'

Since my birth, I have found a total of 6374 Hitlers in r/Politics. On average, I found 70 Hitlers per day.

Today, I read 27596 comments. In total, I have read 3901190 comments."
88oayl,3,2018-04-01,I [29M] broke up with a woman [26F]. I am confused and need advise!,Atl29,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/88oayl/i_29m_broke_up_with_a_woman_26f_i_am_confused_and/,"I found a woman [26F] 10 months ago on OKCUPID, and after a few days of chatting, we went on a date. We had an ice cream, then I showed her my office, and when we wanted to go somewhere for dinner, she said she wants to go. So I dropped her where she asked me. My driving that day was so bad since I was nervous and she was very uncomfortable about it. After that date, I texted her and I asked her if she wants to date again. She said she will let me know but she had not text me or respond to me at all.

Around 4 months ago, when I was looking for an internship (I am a Ph.D. student and she is an electrical engineer), I met her at a company that she is working for. She helped me a lot to get that internship. I asked her again to go out and she said yes :)

We were going out for 3 months, texting each other every day, doing skype sometimes, and spending whole weekends together (on road trips or hiking). We were going to theaters during weekdays as well.

I expressed my feelings to her and I said I like her so much, she usually smiled and said thank you. She never said that she likes me. I could feel that she didn't feel the same.

I always initiated everything and planned for dates (I paid for everything). She usually responded to me a day after or after a few hours most of the times. She didn't accept when I asked her to dance. When I took her hands, she was neutral and a few time she said she wants her hands to be free. I tried to kiss her once; she pushed me back but she kissed me a few minutes later. The last time that we were together, we went hiking and then came to my place for lunch. I asked her to make a salad and she cut her finger and she left before lunch. I was so disappointed. I texted her that I am sorry for her figure. I thought she was uncomfortable at my place and maybe she was thinking I want her at my place for sex and that was why she left. So I text her that I didn't mean for sex. I also told her that I am virgin. She didn't respond me for two days. After that, I texted her that I don't feel that you are interested in me so I don't bother you anymore and wish you the best. She responded to me that she is sorry about that day and she said she didn't feel well that day. she texted me if it is OK to be just friends. I replied that since I have some feelings about you, being friends just bothers me. I told her that I deleted all of our pictures, and unfriend her on Facebook, and LinkedIn. She replied to me after a day that she is sorry.

BTW, she is white, Christian, and from NewYork, and I am middle-eastern and Muslim. English is not my first language but I can communicate reasonably well. Sometimes I couldn't understand her.

In addition, she told she was abused by her father and she got a court order that her father should be away from her for two years. Her parents divorced and she lived with her ex and she told me he was rough. She was aggressive sometimes.

I cannot stop thinking about her. I cannot sleep or do anything. I feel I love her.

TL;DR; : I have a few questions:

1- What did I do wrong? What could I do to make a good relationship?

2- Was it right to break-up?

3- Is there a chance for me to be with her again?"
88oogj,12,2018-04-01,Busco consejo para Data science sin carrera muy relacionada...,MrAce2C,mexico,https://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/comments/88oogj/busco_consejo_para_data_science_sin_carrera_muy/,"TL;DR 6to semestre de administración financiera, quiero dedicarme al data science, la carrera no me hace mucho paro y no sé cuál será un buen plan a seguir..

Qué tal gente! Les cuento rápido mi situación, me encuentro cursando la carrera Administración financiera y sistemas al sexto semestre y me he dado cuenta que quiero dedicarme al data science.

El problema es que creo que la carrera no me ayuda por variass razones. Primero: En el programa lleve dos cursos de estadística y llevo tres de econometría con lo que creo que si tengo buenas bases por el lado estadístico del DS (aunque a penas para el 'good enough') pero para hacer una maestría en matemáticas o estadística no creo ser aceptado por el background cuantitativo no muy solido. Y segundo, aunque la carrera si tiene cierto enfoque en sistemas, lo que me sirve solo son un introductorio a los sistemas de la información y dos subsecuentes en bases de datos. Pienso tomar Matemáticas discretas que también se ofrece aunque no parte del programa. 

Para ese último lado, el de programación, he estado aprendiendo R y python por mi cuenta y la llevo bien, por ejemplo, aplico lo que vea en mis clases de econometría y sigo el programa de Data science de Coursera y uno de Algebra lineal en Edx que lo voy tratando de aplicar en Python.

He estado pensando en meterme a la maestría en DS del ITAM pero depende si tenga dinero para pagar, y les quería preguntar si creen que es buena idea? Había estado viendo que las maestrías en DS no están muy chidas y casi siempre se busca a alguien con formación en Ciencia computacional o Mátematicas, ingenieria.. y maestrías en matemáticas o CC..

Qué me pueden recomendar? Lo primero es que voy a calar para ver si me aceptan de internship en algun equipo de DS en alguna en empresa (Soy de Guadalajara) y de ahí seguirle pegando.

88qbb2,11,2018-04-01,Sober for 9 months: My story,Hopefaithtrust,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/88qbb2/sober_for_9_months_my_story/,"Hey guys, I used to smoke and it was a big struggle for me to quit. I would say that this is the day and then slip up a week later. I always wanted to be able to just be a “weekend smoker”, but every time I would smoke I craved it so bad every night. 

The main reasons I wanted to quit was:
1) I was clearly addicted.
2) I used weed as a bandaid, I used it to escape the pains of life that I didn’t want to have to deal with. 
3) I didn’t like actually having to smoke. I’m a healthy vegan who’s into fitness and I knew that smoking anything into my lungs was terrible. I kept thinking about how breath is life. Breathing is so important, and of all things we should not be messing with our lungs. 
4) It made me stupid while I was high and forgetful while I wasn’t. I would watch a TV show and space out so much I didn’t know what was going on. 
5) It prevented me from being me. I’m really into self improvement, I love reading, always wanted to start a business, an animal rights activist and promoter of a healthy lifestyle. Yet I was forgetting about all of these things, and smoking every night instead. When I was high I wouldn’t want to do anything but watch tv, or just lay around and eat. I had all these thoughts nagging me everyday like “when are you going to start doing what your heart is telling you?” 
6) I know there’s a huge debate about weed being a “gateway drug”. From my experience, it totally was. It made me feel more open to trying other things. For example if a friend had some Xanax at a party, I’d think, “why not?”. 

Leading to when I finally quit last summer....

I was at my boyfriends party. His friend had cocaine. I normally stay clear from drugs like that. He asked if I wanted some and I said no and he said something like “aw come on you’re missing out”, and I fell into the pressure and did it. The next day I woke up and smoked my whole day away. The following day, I realized how far I had gone and that enough was enough. How many times was I going to say I’d quit only to start again, and then on top of everything my habits were getting WORSE when I was accepting people’s drugs. 

Now, everyone has different spiritual views, some don’t believe in God at all. I had believed in God for a while. I did not grow up Christian but I had some experiences that lead me to believe that God is real and the only way to Him is Jesus. I would always pray throughout this time that I was smoking, but I didn’t have a “real” relationship with Him. I was using weed as an idol, something that I used to relax instead of time spent with God. Shortly after my cocaine experience, something happened that reminded me who God is once again and that he is real and working in my life (I won’t share the whole experience here as some may not understand and I want to keep my point on the weed). 

I prayed for help. I begged God to help me stop, that I needed to stop. And a miracle happened- I stopped craving weed. I just didn’t desire it anymore. It wasn’t even hard to stop, to be totally honest. I just felt all those thoughts that I’d been having so long about why I wanted to quit took over and I had no desire to put something in me that was harming my body and mind. When I had previously tried to stop on my own, I never could. I didn’t have enough strength on my own. I even went back to look at my journal and read back in 2016 me writing about how bad I wanted to stop and I realized I had wanted to quit for over two years! But I couldn’t until I handed it all to God and asked Him to give me the strength to quit. 

It’s been 9 months this now and the longest I was ever able to stop before this was a max of 3 months. It has been relatively easy, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say that I still get the craving and wish I could smoke once in a while. But then I think about how addicted I was, especially to be thinking about weed still after 9 months sober- I know that if I did smoke again I’d be right back where I started, and I’d feel so guilty I don’t think I would enjoy the experience. 

Since I’ve stopped:
I feel more energized
My mind is clearer
I’m eating healthier
I’m back to the gym
I’m reading more often
I’ve joined an internship with the Humane League to volunteer for animal rights
I’ve been working a lot harder just in general
I’m doing research currently about starting a side business. 
I’m a lot closer with God.

The other day I was struggling with temptation and I prayed for help and the next song that came on right after said “silly me, silly me, revertin back to my old ways, them got to be in control days, I want your way, Yahweh”. That was a huge reminder of why I stopped in the first place. 

I have been wanting to put my story out here for a long time and I’m happy I finally did it. If you don’t believe in God, then you probably won’t understand my story, but I encourage you to try and ask Him for help anyways. I know that I didn’t have the strength to stop on my own, and a lot of us here struggle with the same thing. Well this is my reminder to you that God is bigger than our problems. God is bigger than your addiction to weed. And if you ask, He will answer. I really hope this helps someone. If anyone wants to talk, message me!

TL/DR: been wanting to quit smoking weed for over 2 years but it wasn’t until I came to the realization that I couldn’t do it in my own and I truly prayed for help that I could finally stop. God can take this from you if you ask Him.

&gt; # 1. How do you feel about some of the complaints your subreddit has received?


&gt;&gt; **Mod** I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

**144,294** racists for **4** years!

Are you tired of all the inferior races constantly thinking they have a place on Reddit? Are you superior but others can’t seem to take a hint? Well, this subreddit is for you. 

/r/ExtremeMegaRascist is a tight-knit community of like-minded people. We accept anyone and everyone (as long as you’re superior). We offer a haven for the superior race from all the unfortunate toxicity in the majority of Reddit.

The intent of /r/ExtremeMegaRascist is to provide the master race with a sense of security and purity for being superior. Our team of moderators constantly monitor and make changes to prevent any inferiors.

Here’s what a /r/ExtremeMegaRascist mod answered when asked them about the subreddit:

&gt; # 1. How do you feel about some of the complaints your subreddit has received?


&gt;&gt; **Mod** I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Apache” and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

Everything has already gone to shit. At least it's not MinetaXEverybody. If anyone's offended or annoyed, I'm sorry

**How did this idea come to life?**

This idea started manifesting at around a couple months ago, when I was out having brunch with my friends. We were chatting, when suddenly one of us said: “Wouldn’t it be cool if Carly sold more albums?” And that was how it came to life. And there was cocaine, but I don’t think it’s that important *snorts*

**The thick of it: The main songs**

**Emotion** 

* Run Away with Me (Entrance Exam Arc): The song talks about the desire to run away with that special someone, to revive your love life, to become a special person, not unlike from the story of Deku’s dream becoming a hero, the hard reality he must face, and the eventual “revival” and inspiration that was both given to him and All Might base on the actions he did. 

* E•MO•TION (Quirk Apprehension Test Arc): Wanting to show that you’re a stronger, better person, like the rather strong introduction of Aizawa, as well as the impressive action of Deku overcoming his limitations in controlling his power

* I Really Like You (Battle Trial Arc): The song is about a not so serious fling between two indivual, not too different from the intense fight between Deku and Bakugou, Bakugou’s remembering the past, their desire to win, the eventual outcome, and teasing for the upcoming reveal of the villains

* Gimmie Love: (Unforeseen Simulation Arc) A person’s wish and desire for love and happiness, in a rather interesting way -&gt; The villains’ assault on USJ, wanting to kill All Might, as well the subsequent between them and the heroes-in-training. 

* All That (UA Festival Arc): A slow burn, mellow song about love and relationship -&gt; A evenly-paced, action-packed arc filled with fights, developments for several characters, happy conclusions, as well tragedies. (Yeah, I have to say this was the least related song-arc combo of the bunch)

* Boy Problems (Vs. Hero Killer Arc): A light-hearted take at how to move on after a relationship has ended, -&gt; The workplace training, the encounter with a formidable villain, Stain (who we can say is their “Boy Problem”), a retrospection on the economics of heroes, and an interesting revelation about quirks 

* Making the Most of the Night (Final Exams Arc): Like how the song is how to truly care about someone and the development of a relationship, the arc was also about their accomplishment in the final exams, the growth that comes along with it, and the meeting between Deku and Shiragaki. 

* Your Type (School Trip Arc): This song and the arc are very similar in the fact that they’re about how something can start so great and innocent, yet it can end up being a major loss for many individuals around (Carly’s unreciprocated feelings vs. the villains attacking &amp; kidnapping Bakugou)

* Let’s Get Lost (Hideout Raid Arc): Arguably the strongest song in the entire album, talking about trust and strength, which we also say for the arc itself, as it had quite a major impact on the story (the fight between OfA and AfO, the rescue of Bakugou, etc.)

* LA Hallucinations (Hero License Exam Arc): The song itself is pretty great, set to a sharp beat, with lyrics talking the difficulty living in a rather glamorous yet artificial place like Los Angeles; the arc is somewhat familiar in the fact that it’s mainly about the characters developing their power more and more

* Warm Blood (Internship Arc): Strangely enough the song’s lyrics and theme are quite similar: from the “cavern of secrets” (which we can say is Overhaul’s base), to the name of the song itself (Warm Blood, similar to Eri’s rather special blood), and the fact while it may seem random and unnecessary at first, turn out to be quite important later. And the overall sound of the song is quite dark as well, again like the arc
* When I Needed You &amp; Black Heart (Remedial Course Arc): Not necessarily the best, but the songs do show growth in Carly’s character, as well as having quite a quirky feeling to it, like how I felt about this arc in general (it was fun, had great moments here and there, and we did run around like cray theorizing things)

* I Didn’t Just Come Here to Dance: This is without a doubt, the one resemble the most to the story. Upbeat feelings? Check. Wacky lyrics? Check. A sense of surprise to it? Check. It has everything 
And that’s it for the established materials…

**It’s time for theorizing!**
* Favorite Color: A dark song by Carly’s standard, it’s about her understanding strong, undivided emotions. Like that, we can expect things to get dark again, maybe a major character’s death will be involved

**Emotion: Side B**

* First Time: Deku’s introduced to the GP, finally gets the love and recognition he deserved

* Higher: This will be about the relationship between Ochako and Deku. Will it grow, or will it vanish?

* The One: Will Deku accepts his position, or will he collapse under the pressure?

* Fever &amp; Body Language: We will get to see developments from underrated characters! (Insert your favorite characters who aren’t getting enough love)

* Cry: Something’s bad gonna happen. That’s it

* Store: This arc has the potential to sneak on everyone, attack them viciously, then become a fan’s favorite. Also, someone will go out to buy cigarettes. 

* Roses: A major character won’t die but will be so distraught that he/she will leave the spotlight for quite a while, while everyone around them will have to adjust to this new reality.

* Cut to The Feeling: Continuing from the previous arc, everyone will try to help the distraught character, it will either happen through either a major battle between villains, or something more lighthearted. 

**In conclusion**

Am I saying that Horikoshi, who we can’t even be sure has even listened to this album yet, changes everything he has planned from before July 2014, or that Carly Rae Jepsen (who is big in Japan, but we also can’t be sure has even read this manga or not) is inspired by the story and is in frequent contact with the author? No. What I am saying that the human mind is a strange thing, capable of making great achievements for the world at large, while also able to write stuff like this!

*Tune in next week when we discuss how Ed Sheeran’s Divided is actually about Dante’s journey through the 9 circles of Hell*

**In limbo: extended question**
* How are you feeling now after reading this? Is there anything I either got wrong, or can improve?
* Have you ever encountered a song that sorta resembles another thing you like, but you make up bullshit excuses to connect them?
* Have you ever listened to the albums mentioned above, and if not, are planning to do so?
* Did I waste ~~5~~ 8 hours of my life?

88rt1a,1,2018-04-01,Need Your Thoughts on My Career Path,zhaotaitai,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/88rt1a/need_your_thoughts_on_my_career_path/,"Happy Easter to all celebrating. Earlier this month a second tier school I applied to told me they had a partnership with a major law firm in their city and they wanted to consider me for their guaranteed internship program. I just took the interview for the experience, but I unexpectedly loved it. I could definitely see myself working in that environment.

Unfortunately, I was not extended the offer to work at that firm. So, I believe that school is off the table for me. I was leaning towards withdrawing from that school until I was invited to interview for the position. However, I think I am now interested in pursuing Big Law out of law school. Originally, I was set on working in a small firm or hanging a shingle, but now I realize I can always do that later in my career. If I want to try Big Law, I need it out of law school.

So, now that my goals have changed and I am narrowing the possibilities I see three options for me: 

1.  University of Miami, Full Ride: 
This was my first choice until I had such a positive experience at my interview. They're strong in immigration (an area of interest for me), I really enjoyed my visit, and the location is second to none. I have family in the Tampa Bay region and I have thought about maybe moving there someday and Miami would definitely be a strong degree in Florida. However, I heard Big Law is reserved for Miami's top students and I'm afraid if I go there I would be closing that door unless I'm in the top 10% of my class. For what it's worth, the recruiter for the office I interviewed with also recruits for their Miami office, but I'm not sure how valuable this would be for my job search there.

1. Illinois at ~ 5k per year: I was originally set on leaving my home state, but I understand that Chicago does have a good legal job market and that UIUC is one of the big players in Chicago. Champaign's cost of living would actually make this more of a bargain for me than Miami on a full ride (so would living in Happy Valley, for that matter). Going here would likely involve me staying in Chicago longer, but I figure I can always relocate if I someday choose to hang a shingle. I could even lateral out of a Chicago office if I choose to stay in Big Law. I'm visiting later this week to see how I like it. If I can't see myself there, this is off the table.

1. Penn State (University Park), Full Ride: This is a distant third. I think I'd enjoy myself there and they are geographically close to the office I interviewed with. I think that could make me a good candidate to intern at that office. Although I'm open to any big firm, I'm wondering if I have established a connection with that office by interviewing with them once before. As previously mentioned, State College has a low cost of living, which is a fairly important criterion for me.

**TL;DR** I interviewed for a fellowship and loved it but was not extended an offer. I'm not sure I want to go to that school anymore, but I'm now interested in Big Law. Do I: A. Go to another TT school that I like a lot and is in a city that the recruiter covers B. Go to a regional T40 on a substantial scholarship in hopes of getting Big Law that way or C.

I wasted my childhood trying to keep my parents together so that my younger sister, who has learning difficulties, wouldn't have to grow up without a parent. My dad was never around and so I let my mom take it out on me. I spent my weekends working part time jobs and still do, to pay off my dads debts and pay for my siblings school meals and trips without my mom knowing.

I became ill in high school and barely attended, I lost the few friends I had just through growing distant. 

I've lived alone since I was 17 and now am in my third year of college, I pay myself. I'm supposed to go into an internship next year and the only hope I have for it is that maybe I'll clear some debt.

I think I enjoyed making people happy. I can't now. On the rare occasion I speak to somebody I feel no connection I try to be happy but inside I feel sick, I feel like I'll pass out, I'm so tired. As for a relationship, I think that's the worst thing I could do now, I'd just drag somebody down with me.

I don't know what to do, I've tried counselling, I've tried medication, I've tried diet, exercise and I continue those activities, but nothing changes. I'm useless and can't do anything, I hate the way I think and look. 

I know it's childish and I know people have it worse than me but still I feel like this."

Kære redditors på /r/Denmark,

Velkommen til endnu et tilbageblik på måneden der var.

Tråden er vores mulighed for at fortælle jer om ændringer, tiltag, overvejelser og den generelle moderation, og det er jeres mulighed for at stille os spørgsmål og komme med ris eller ros. I reddits ånd er det vores ønske, at /r/denmark er brugerstyret, og derfor er denne tråd også et oplæg til debat.

Som altid har vi månedens moderationslog [her](https://i.imgur.com/8bGQvyE.png).

#### Nye og gamle mods

Tidligere annoncerede vi at [4 nye mods er på prøve](https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/85jimy/nye_moderatorer_p%C3%A5_pr%C3%B8ve/).

Oplæringen er allerede i gang og i har nok set dem rundt omkring. 

Oplæringen foregår ved at de har begrænset adgang til moderationen hvor kun de nødvendige permissions er givet. Vi har lavet en discord kanal hvor der snakkes internt om reports, hvor de kan stille spørgsmål og generelt snakke med hinanden og os andre om hvad den korrekte beslutning er. Dette betyder også at der kan være misforståelser omkring rigtig håndtering af reports, etc. 

Heirloom har valgt at stoppe som moderator, han gav os denne besked forud for beslutningen. Vi sender et tak for indsatsen og ønsker ham held og lykke med resten af 2018.

&gt;Kære alle. Jeg må indrømme, jeg bliver nødt til at trække moderatorstikket. 2018 har været benhård, og jeg undervurderede hvor meget tid, jeg havde til rådighed. 


---

#### Facebook, twitter og sociale medier.

Efter de nye mods er kommet ind har der været spørgsmål omkring facebook retningslinjerne. Efter intern diskussion er vi blevet enige om følgende ændringer til facebook retningslinjerne, og i reglerne vil der blive henvist til denne post.

Nyt: 

* Påkrævet at man fjerner minimum efternavn og profilbilleder på screenshots fra facebook, twitter og andre sociale medier.

* Retningslinjerne gælder nu også for twitter og andre sociale medier.

Retningslinjerne for facebook, twitter og andre sociale medier i fulde:

* Det er tilladt at linke til begivenheder, virksomheder, medier, offentlige personer og andre officielle kilder, samt indhold fra disse. Hvor et screenshot er muligt, anbefaler vi det som hidtil. En offentlig person er en, der regelmæssigt optræder i den offentlige sfære og gennem sin færden forsøger at skabe opmærksomhed omkring sin person.

* Det er ikke tilladt at linke til privatpersoner, inklusive indhold fra privatpersoner. Disse skal fortsat deles som screenshots med efternavne og profilbilleder sløret. Det samme gælder, når privatpersoner skriver på offentlige sider eller har åbne profiler. Vi anbefaler at man slører både for- og efternavn, og farve-koordinerer de forskellige personer, hvor det giver mening.

88st5z,20,2018-04-01,Feeling a lot of INFP love,fake_floral,infp,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/88st5z/feeling_a_lot_of_infp_love/,"I recently came across this subreddit and absolutely LOVE it. I feel pretty at home here. I wanted to share that with you guys, but also a little story that made me realize how awesome INFPness can be...

I'm a social work student in an internship I (unfortunately) scrambled to find last minute. Because of this, what I got wasn't necessarily my...first choice.

I ended up in an independent apartment program which helps young adults who have been through trauma become independent and successful within society. When I first signed up, it sounded like I wouldn't mind it. That was until my supervisor told me many of the residents act like adolescents due to the trauma they've been through. Now my first thought was, ME? WITH ADOLESCENTS?? Nope, there's no way this is gonna work. Adolescents are moody and confrontational, I'm moody, but I just can't deal with that confrontation. Not to mention, my supervisor wanted me to teach them about racial, cultural, and sexual identity. Something I'm really interested in, but is very complicated to talk about with people you don't know well, especially adolescents who don't want to be there. I felt like I was biting off more than I could chew with this internship. I became so paranoid through other student's stories I doubted myself and completely forgot about all the strengths I had as a person, and why I wanted to be a social worker in the first place. 

Flash forward to my first class about identity awareness; I lucked out with only one student signing up. It felt silly but I was still nervous, after all, I was going to be sitting here with someone who may or may not want to be here. By the end of the class, I had realized I had nothing to feel nervous about. Not only did the student want to be there, they seemed to enjoy my activities and even wrote a poem on their own identity. Since then, I've been getting closer and closer to the residents in my classes. I'm realizing why they act the way they do, and am having strong meaningful conversations with them about who they are, who other people are, and how it affects their view of the world and others. 

Sure, some classes are harder than others, and I'm still struggling to assert myself, but I'm starting to realize how much my personality is helping me kinda ""shine"" here.

 Every class is different, and even if I come in expecting it to be one way, it can be completely different. Which is so awesome for me, because I can just go into it with several options, and pick whatever I think will fuel that exact moment. Most people would think it's chaotic, but to me, I have FREEDOM. I also don't have to drone on and on about anything, all I have to do is bring up talking points and guide whatever conversations will happen, making me much less nervous because I can just listen, something I'm great at. Also, my supervisor pointed out to me, a lot of people go into it expecting bad kids, and it takes a while for them to understand how their life affects how they act. But I adapted so quickly to it, and never thought of any of them as bad kids. Even if one of them says something rude, instead of punishing them for it, I try to understand why. 

I'm seriously thinking my strengths are finally showing through at an internship, which is something that rarely happens because I'm not often in a place where the way I do things is accepted. SO I wanted to let you all know, that there's gotta be a place out there somewhere, that will make you shine because of who you are. Even if it feels like there isn't, you'll find it somehow :)"

88trap,1,2018-04-01,How do I tell my employer about issues I have with a coworker?,catwithaglasseye,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/88trap/how_do_i_tell_my_employer_about_issues_i_have/,"So I work in a small restaurant as wait staff. I really like all my coworkers except one I have some issues with. I’m asking because recently at my internship and stuff I’ve been told I’m bad at taking feedback and/or I take a lot of things negatively. 

So we can call this coworker Jane. Jane is....not a good team player. My first issue is one where Jane got into an argument with our cook. She proceeded to yell at some of my customers as well as some of hers that she’s treated like a slave at this restaurant..... it got so bad I told her that she needed to calm down and should go outside and smoke if she needed too i would run her food. I didn’t know what else to do. I’m not kidding when I say yelling. I’m not kidding that she used the term slave either. I had to apologize to our tables. The owner got complaints but she’s still there. 

Jane is routinely late but I’ve walked in two minutes passed my shift time after being stuck in traffic and Jane lectured me on timeliness, despite the fact she was scheduled to start this most recent weekend at 2:00pm and didn’t come in until 5. She sits in her car in the parking lot and smokes bowls until she feels it so necessary to come inside. 

Jane is not a manager but dictates tasks as such. And yells at you if you don’t do them. 

Jane always takes all the tables so that only she makes any tips during the shift you both share. She will tell you it’s because your life isn’t as bad as hers and she needs money more than you. 

Jane also, upon hearing I am a senior in premed, asked if I had an rx pad yet. I said no and asked why. She wanted Xanax. She assumed I would give her some. I told her she should call her primary care. She told me I should help her find a doctor who will give her some. I walked away. 

I just don’t know what to do because she’s starting to make me really uncomfortable and she makes the work place feel hostile. I really need money though which is why I don’t just leave. Am I being whiny? Should I get over it? Idk what to do. "

This is my first time posting in this sub instead of lurking, but thankfully I have been given a good reason to do so. This summer I secured an internship (I am a college kid) and I will be living about 15 minutes away from a 700 yard range and plan on using it as much as I can. In the past I have only been able to shoot up to 150, so this is a big jump for me. 

Right now the only centerfire rifle I have is a dpms recon chambered in 556. I do understand the limitations of the cartridge and have an ok amount of experience reloading, so ammo selection will not be a problem.

Given this information, I have a couple of questions. Is 556 feasible for 700 yards, or would I be better off shooting at a shorter distance (maybe 400 yards)? In terms of an optic, what power and which one in particular would you suggest for this situation?  My budget for an optic is about 400ish but that's not a hard and fast number.

Eventually I do plan on getting a better set up for shooting long range, but right now I can't afford to do so and just want to have some fun.

Thank you for reading this, I welcome all input as well as advice!

88u5jp,19,2018-04-01,I Wrote an Entire Goddamn Essay on why Dekuraka is a Trash Ship,MadnessLemon,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/88u5jp/i_wrote_an_entire_goddamn_essay_on_why_dekuraka/,"In light of all the ship bashing, someone needed to finally step up and shoot the ship that no one else will, and since no one else is gonna do it I guess I'll have to. Like I said in my last post, I need to make an entirely separate post for this particular ship, because there's so much to unpack, mostly because unlike every other ship in the series, it actually has a chance of happening, so let's begin.

The best place to start is at the beginning, by which I mean the moment the ship became an actual canon thing. Technically Deku kind of had a crush on Ochaco from the beginning, but that doesn't matter. Male shonen characters get crushes from time to time, but it's not always a big deal, meanwhile if a female shonen character develops a crush, that will be the only person they ever love, and they will either marry that person, or some other nameless dude while forever lamenting the fact that they didn't end up with their one true love. This is known as the harem rule, it has very few exceptions. So by the beginning, I mean the moment Ochaco's romantic interest in Deku began, and I'll be frank, it was a pretty shit moment. Rather than come from a moment of introspection or a tender moment between the two, sparkle boy just tells her that she's in love with him and that's that.

So from the start we have an atrocious set up for the ship, it's just one little poke but suddenly Ochaco turns into a blushing mess every time someone so much as mentions Deku or love. It fucking sucks. What this means is that the ship in canon has little set up, little substance, and is pushed on the reader more than shown. The best romantic subplots come from interactions between the two characters, and yet as the series goes on, Deku and Uraraka interact less and less. Seriously, when was the last time they had a single fucking conversation that wasn't about an exam or something? They spoke a bit in the license exam arc, but that was literally a goddamn year ago. Hell they barely even interact in the Stain arc, which led up to Ochaco's love epiphany, it seems the last time they had a serious conversation was the sports festival arc. Basically, their entire relationship is built on watching each other, Deku seeing a cute girl and Ochaco watching Deku and wanting to be like him, rather than genuine interaction and development of the relationship between the two characters.

As a result of this, their relationship in a romantic sense is very one sided. At the start of the series you had Deku crushing on Ochaco while she had no clue, but then as the story goes on he gets busy with growing as a hero and mastering One for All, leaving him little time to fixate on his attraction to others. Ochaco on the other hand, starts out focused on her own growth as a hero, but once she is told about her feelings for Deku, that becomes the only thing she can think about. In recent chapters, it seems neither are that concerned about their feelings for each other, which is fine as it lets them continue to grow as characters, but it also does nothing for their relationship. Their relationship does not develop past the point of acknowledging having feelings for each other, (and it’s still up in the air last to whether or not that’s even the case for Deku) so why anyone thinks they’re going to get together before the inevitable time skip epilogue is beyond me.

Before the end of the essay, there is one more part that needs to be addressed, the elephant in the room, if you will. Ochaco's character development, it has been brought up again and again in these discussions, but it has to be because it is an important part. As mentioned in the last paragraph, once Ochaco is informed of her feelings for Deku, it becomes her sole character moment. So far, her biggest character moment outside of her feelings for Deku was still her battle with Bakugou in the sports festival, which happened at the beginning of the goddamn series. Once she starts having feelings for Deku, she turns into a blushing floating mess at the drop of a hat, when she’s not having focus on her romantic interest, she’s pushed of to the sidelines, even when she’s supposedly an important part of the story (yes I’m talking about the fucking internship arc). Despite being the most significant female character, she’s yet to have a major character arc, even Momo and Jiro are surpassing her in that regard, and they don’t have solid love interests (Jiro might have a reverse harem going on though).

Technically, Ochaco has had *moments* of character development post love epiphany, however, these are of very little substance. Both moments amount to a few panels of telling the reader how her character will progress, at the end of an arc she had little involvement in. The first was in the middle of the license exam arc where she decided to get her feelings under control (and was then promptly shoved to the sidelines for the rest of the arc) and the second was deciding she wants to save people (which is still imitating Deku) at the end of an arc where she did nothing, granted, this does justify her feelings of uselessness somewhat. Not much of this character development is shown to the audience, however, outside of Ochaco’s internal monologues. We aren’t shown what happened when she decided to intern with Ryukyu, how she convinced Nejire to help her out, and barely anything of her actual training. It’s almost as though if her character isn’t focused on Deku, it isn’t important to the story.

In conclusion, the Dekuraka ship is based heavily on telling and using it on the audience rather than showing them the development between the two. It is one sided, based on pining and watching rather than actual interaction, and eats up the vast majority of Ochaco’s character development as the series goes on. For all these reasons, Dekuraka is officially, a trash tier ship. Xax was right and he died for our sins. Fuck you I’m right.

- Is negotiating your first entry-level position, fresh out of college, frowned upon by employers? Any risk they would retract offer? 

- With no other offers at the moment, but have had relevant internships every summer since sophomore year, can I use these experiences to help my case in counter-offer?

88ulew,1,2018-04-01,"Stuck in an impossible financial situation: Do I ask my nparents for help, take out a loan, or rely on my boyfriend?",rebel_lover13,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/88ulew/stuck_in_an_impossible_financial_situation_do_i/,"TLDR:
I have to pay for a post-grad program to get my credentials as a Registered Dietitian. While I have the tuition covered, I need to find a way to pay for room and board during the 7-10 month program ($6000-8000).

Option 1: Take out a private loan with a high interest rate, if I can find one that doesn't require a cosigner.

Option 2: Allow my boyfriend to shoulder all the bills and go further in debt to fund my internship.

Option 3: Borrow money from my parents.

____

I graduated with my degree in dietetics/nutrition last Spring. The screwed up thing about my degree is that it's meaningless without the ""dietetic internship"". The internship COSTS $5,000-10,000, and I'm not allowed to work at the same time. My amazing grandparents are taking money out of their retirement in order to pay the tuition for the internship, but I have no way of paying for rent/gas/food/etc. I work at minimum wage at a grocery store right now, so I don't have any savings. However, I had sufficient scholarships to pay for most of my schooling, and my parents paid for the rest. Therefore, I don't have any debt going into this program.

The internship is not connected to a school, so I can't take out federal student loans. I need roughly $6000-8000 to pay for living expenses for my 7-10 month internship.

I have three options:

1. Take out a private loan. Unfortunately, I won't qualify for a loan big enough without a cosigner, which my parents will refuse to do. The interest rate on private loans is incredibly high, and you have to start paying them back immediately.

2. Allow my boyfriend of two years to pay for all of our living expenses, AND take out a huge loan from the school (he's a masters student). My nparents always drilled it into my head that I should never let someone other than family support me, because they are under no obligation to do so, and will likely let you down. I'm having a hard time getting past that, and I'm hesitant to let my boyfriend go further into debt for me.

3. Borrow money from my parents. Last year, when I was despairing of ever becoming a Dietitian, my parents offered to let me borrow money from them to live off of during my internship. My parents are pretty well off (although my nmother quit her job recently, so my poor enabling father has to work tons of overtime for them to keep up the life they had on two high incomes), and they could easily afford to pay for my room and board during the internship. They offered to let me move back home, but that was a hard ""no"" on my part. My parents use money to control both of their adult children. My sister dropped out of college and lives at home. I managed to complete my degree and move a town over. If I take a loan from my parents, I won't have to pay interest, but I'll be paying them back for at least 2-3 years. I had planned on cutting off contact once I completed the internship and moved out of state, and this would prolong my relationship with them. My parents LOVE to use finances to manipulate me and guilt me into interacting with them. 

For example, I sent my mother this message today: ""Hi Mom. The ball is rolling on internship prep, if I get one. We found a perfect apartment, and I'm starting to work on a budget. I was wondering if the offer of a loan for internship costs still stands, or if I need to start looking into other loan options.""

Her response: ""I hate using facebook chat to talk about money.""

Read: I want you to come to dinner so we can pick apart your plans and add all sorts of stipulations to our loan.

What would you suggest I do? I NEED to get this certification if I want to ever work in my field. I need to do it sooner, rather than later. I've already put it off for a year."

I've been friends with E since my freshman year. In fact, she was probably my first real friend at college, which took me until the spring semester (2016) of my freshman year. Last semester she went abroad and had an emotional breakdown that sent her home. She's back at school this semester, and feeling a lot better. Because of her circumstances, she's taking a part-time schedule of classes.

I'm in an accelerated program that has me pursuing the first half of my MA before I finish my BA, on top of already graduating early. I'm also interning full-time. Between full-time school, full-time internship, job-hunting, apartment-hunting, and trying to side hustle some illustration commissions so I have spending money, I have... not so much time to hang out. I barely have time to exfoliate in the morning.

I have class every Monday with E, and we play D&amp;D together on Sundays. Because I see her regularly, I dedicate my Friday and Saturday nights to schmoozing with other friends that I don't get to see unless I make a concerted effort. E thinks I'm not devoting enough time to her, and accused me of being emotionally unavailable. 

We had a long talk about how I *should* pay more attention to her. But I also explained, I don't have much time, and I have other friendships to maintain (her circles are smaller than mine.)

Recently, I discovered that she blocked me on Facebook. She's left all our group chats. She hasn't answered my text messages. Her roommates say she's been more standoffish than usual. I don't like seeing anyone upset, and I *want* to rectify this, but I don't know if it's worth the effort? I won't magically have the time to hang out with her. I kinda don't even know if I want to.

Is it worth it to confront her about it/try to repair it? I don't want to alienate someone when they're in a bad place mentally, but I don't have the time to play therapist.

**TL;DR** good friend ghosted/blocked me because I don't spend enough of my very limited time with her"

Do you ever fill your taverns and waystations with mysterious strangers, then scramble to improvise when your party ignores the quest and tries to strike up conversation?

Do you want your next battle to be a cliche ""Battle of the opposites"" between your party and their evil (or good?) counterparts?

This should help.

Cost: Roughly same

Major: ECE (potentially premed as well)

I am having trouble deciding between these two universities for this major. Cornell seems to be a slightly better school by the number rankings but is not really ahead of CMU.

-CMU has about 130 ECE graduates, Cornell has about 80

-worried about grade deflation for pre med

-worried that ece department at CMU is overshadowed by their amazing computer science department. Also that people who don’t get into SCS at CMU use ECE as a backup and aren’t actually interested in major itself

-really want to have internship opportunities in college as early as after freshman year

-want to work on project teams like robotics clubs

-want to do research

-worried that Greek life is overbearing at Cornell. Is this the case for engineers?"
88x3zy,21,2018-04-02,"Universal Basic Income, Poverty and Consumerism",_soapdodger,Scotland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/88x3zy/universal_basic_income_poverty_and_consumerism/,"Since we've had some indications that the Scottish government is very interested in piloting UBI schemes and with support for the concept coming from senior Labour party figures like John McDonnell, I thought I'd share my opinion on the concept. Please note, I'm not directly attacking the Scottish governments pilot schemes - I'm actually quite interested in the results. Some of the concerns and solutions I'm putting forward are also outside the Scottish governments power to change.

It sounds like a great deal: everyone is given a basic monthly allowance to do with as they please. They can use it to pay off debts, to pay bills and rent or keep in their bank to save. Wealth is distributed evenly to every member of society, rich or poor, as a universal benefit.

[Some argue that AI and automation will be the next revolution in production](https://futurism.com/former-google-china-president-ai-take-jobs-sooner-than-expected/). UBI, then, is seen as the answer to the replacement of wage labourers with machines and the consequent unemployment and poverty. Others argue that in an era of austerity and low wage growth,[UBI would relieve pressure on the poor and unemployed and incentivise them into taking up voluntary and part-time work - this is the argument that the Finnish government has used for it's pilot scheme](https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2018/jan/12/money-for-nothing-is-finlands-universal-basic-income-trial-too-good-to-be-true).

[I've found *some* of my concerns repeated here by Ian Goldin, a professor of golbalisation and development at Oxford](https://www.ft.com/content/100137b4-0cdf-11e8-bacb-2958fde95e5e). I want to go into a wee bit more detail, though.

One of my main concerns is that UBI will solidify the trend toward part-time work, unpaid trail shifts, unpaid internships and work based on commission. Employers will see the provision of a basic income as a supplement to the wages that they decide the workers are worth and have no reason to provide even yearly raises of any kind. Workers will also be more likely to consider taking on these exploitative jobs as they will always have the basic income to top-up their wages.

The problem here lies with the employers - they're paying people to little as it stands today, so why should the government be allocating public funds to make up for that? Raise the minimum wage and strengthen union rights instead.

Speaking of unions, UBI might also weaken their already precarious position in society. It would remove some of their bargaining power for similar reasons outlined above -why strike or even join a union to fight for better pay, when the government is supplementing your income? Accepting your bad pay is easier and less risky and UBI might encourage people to do just that.

I've also heard arguments that UBI will encourage consumer spending. [Consumer spending is often used as a bellweather for how the economy is performing, and concerns have been raised over a recent slump](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-consumer-spending-2017-latest-updates-low-level-five-years-households-payment-a8144001.html). I have a serious problem with this: is the issue that people aren't spending enough, or that we engage people primarily as consumers in 21st century Britain? In my opinion it is the latter: when we measure ourselves in how much we own, what property we buy and the model of cars we drive, I think we are losing sight of what functions an economy should have.

UBI, for me, is a one-fit fix for a variety of social problems that have to be tackled with much more nuance. It's a prime example of us fitting our social policy to serve the economy rather than vice versa - which is what we should be concerning ourselves with."

The only adjustments I made to the data were deleting a few empty responses and replacing ambiguous board scores (eg 23x) with an actual number (235).   I did also correct a handful of what I assume were typo's (eg matched to #44 when they only ranked 11 programs), but I did not go line by line looking for trolls so I'm sure there are a few.

You can turn on a 'Temporary Filter View' via the Data dropdown menu if you want to filter or sort the results, or just download it as an Excel file.  Averages for all of the numerical responses can be found at the bottom, and they will update based on your filter view.

88yd80,8,2018-04-02,L'École Polytechnique Masters,FlimsyMorality,france,https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/88yd80/lécole_polytechnique_masters/,"Hi, I'm considering attending the [Jacques Herbrand](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/m1-jacques-herbrand-polytechnique#presentation-m1) masters program in computer science at l'X, and I am having difficulty finding information regarding the structure of their courses and degrees. I did my bachelors degree in the US, and so I'd be grateful if someone here could provide some insight into this program.

As I understand it, l'X (and other grandes écoles) is most well known for their cycle polytechnicien and students in that program complete masters level coursework. From what pool/background of students, then, does this M1 masters program draw? Are the courses offered in this Herbrand M1 also taken by students completing the cycle polytechnicien?

I'm also curious about how this masters and programs offered by  l'Université Paris-Saclay are seen in France (and the EU in general). I assume that in France the ingénieurs polytechnicien title would be held in higher regard; is that accurate? My M2 would likely have the Université Paris-Saclay name attached and perhaps not the École Polytechnique; would that make the degree less recognized In, say, Belgium or Germany (or, even, inside of France)?

I'd also appreciate hearing about others' experiences with masters programs at l'X and Paris-Saclay in general! I know next to nothing about these institutions (besides the technical details of the coursework and internship involved), so any description would probably be useful for me! Thanks!"

**53,835** Finders searching for  **4 Years!** 

/r/FreeGameFindings is a subreddit that I like to call the legal pirate bay. FreeGameFindings is a subreddit that has over 50 thousand users come together and search far and wide to notify the users about the free games being offered. These range from the famous [Payday 2's free release,](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/comments/6g2wqb/steam_game_payday_2/) [DiRT 3's free release,](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/comments/5c9arg/steam_game_dirt_3_complete_edition/) [and Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag's Free Release](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/comments/7j2cbb/uplay_game_assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/)

What sets this subreddit apart from other free game subreddits is its community. Not only does it have at least 3 posts a week for free games, but it has an active comments section on each post. [Just look at this!](https://imgur.com/gallery/lIbGL) Along with an active comments section they also have 6 moderators which help with the posts. I took this chance to ask a few of them and specifically the creator a few questions!

&gt;##For the owner: Why did you create this subreddit, did you expect AAA titles to come and how do you feel about the mods?

&gt;&gt;**StOoPiD_U**  I liked seeing the occasional post about free items on a few subreddits I had followed at the time, but noticed they would get buried by other things at the time. I wanted to make something like those other subreddits but exclusively for free games that are kept forever!

&gt;&gt;I'm very satisfied with /r/FGF! It's been fantastic to work on this place for the past few years. From start to now it's been a blast! For the past year or so, changes to Valve's own policies have resulted in a slow down to giveaways from Steam, which were a major part of the subreddit. We're still going strong, but the slowdown is noticeable.

&gt;&gt;Our mod team and community are just lovely! /u/Trislar has been huge for tons of front and back end stuff with everything here. /u/MetallicMan has been saving my ass from poor CSS work that I'd do. He's helped with all of that so much! /u/Glockwise /u/Surpex and /u/Nemetona do so much front end with tons of stuff. They take care of a lot of flairing and post approval stuff. Huge part of /r/FGF!

&gt;##What are your main duties for the sub?

&gt;&gt;**Surpex**  My main duties are to make sure that posts conform to the sub-wide formatting structure we have. An easy second is to flair things depending on their status, or game type.

&gt;&gt;**Glockwise** A very vanilla answer, enforcing rules. Longer answer: checking reports, cleaning modqueue, reviewing user reports, marking expired giveaways. Anything to help our head mod. Nothing different from most subs I believe.

&gt;##What kinds of posts do you have to delete?

&gt;&gt;**Surpex**  The vast majority of posts that I have to delete are duplicates of other things already posted. Our user base is pretty good about not being toxic, so that isn't a huge concern.

&gt;&gt;**Glockwise** Like a lot of subreddits, we have the rules tidily written in the sidebar. When a post somehow passed our automoderator, it's our task to review them manually. Comments are a bit trickier since it's hard to track all of them. Reports from users are really useful here.

&gt;##What are your favorite posts?

&gt;&gt;**Surpex**  My favorite posts are giveaways that happen directly on Steam itself. Most of the time when Steam gives away a game, it's a pretty well known one and our community reacts in a very positive way.

&gt;&gt;**Glockwise** When big name publishers or storefront putting up their games for free. Just look at https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeGameFindings/top/ and prepare to get jelly not subscribing to our sub sooner.

Overall I'd give this subreddit a B for it's frequent posts, good moderators and very friendly owner. In the ned though a lot of the games are very random, some very bad. On the other hand you get good games pretty frequently and it leaves you with a full steam library!

A family friend with some connections set up some meetings with some marketing executives he knows where I will have the opportunity to ask them about their jobs and what makes them successful, and then at the end, sneak in the fact that I’m looking for an internship. This is a lot easier said than done for me, especially since I am still kind of new to the business world.

Well, it happened.

Today, you can walk into any Little Caesar's and get a free lunch combo (four slice ""DEEP!DEEP!"" [can I just say this is a dumb name for a pizza?] pepperoni pizza with 20oz bottled pepsi product) today between 11:30 AM - 1PM. Note that it's only ""one per family"" (sorry mom, I have no idea who you are), and if you order after 1 PM, even if you were in line before 1 PM, the promotion is considered ""expired"" and you won't get it for free. 

I find this to be kind of crummy (why can't everyone in the family enjoy a free combo? And why do you now have to calculate wait times? A deal's a deal, just be generous for two hours of one day Little Caesar's!), but hey free pizza is free pizza.

8908bz,37,2018-04-02,Door to door encyclopedia sales in the age of Wikipedia,la_racine,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8908bz/door_to_door_encyclopedia_sales_in_the_age_of/,"This is a story that happened to me when I was in my undergrad at the University of British Columbia, Canada, around 2008 or 2009. 


It was springtime and I got a call one evening from a strange number. The guy said that they were an organization that placed students in summer internships and said that my friend, let's call her Sally, had given them my contact information saying I was one of her smartest friends. Sally and I were in the same group of friends but I usually only saw her a few times a month as we were in different programs. I always thought she was cool beans so I was very flattered! The guy asked what kind of summer work I was looking at to which I responded that I was a science student who was looking for more lab work to boost his skills. He said ""Mhmm, great well I think we can help you out, come to this meeting we are having in the student union building at this date and time"". Score! I was in the midst of applying for a bunch of summer positions but here someone had just called me right up! I wonder what kind of lab internships they will have available? I was very excited. 


I had originally had an important guidance counselor meeting scheduled for that time, it wasn't the end of the world to re-schedule and a potential work opportunity definitely took priority. 


So I show up at the prescribed time and they have rented a room in the SUB and people are filing in. As I checked in with a lady sitting at a fold out table outside the room she hands me a bright green sheet of paper. We file in and sit around a board room table. There is a projector screen setup and the staff from the 'organization' look a few years older than us and are a bit overdressed, especially for Vancouver standards. 


No alarms in my head yet. Guy who is presenting starts off by saying ""before we get going please write down the names and phone numbers of your ten smartest friends on the green sheet of paper."" Ding, ding, there are the alarm bells. So everyone else at the table takes a few minutes to scribble down their poor friends' contact info, I just sit there and write nothing. The guy circles the table to check in on me and I tell him I will wait to see the presentation before I give out this info and he moves on. 


They collect everyone's green sheet, I held on to mine. The presentation kicks off. They start by talking about 'the organization' and how the send students to communities all across Canada for summer work opportunities. Some of these students now hold executive positions in The Organization! Look, here is a photo from their recent reunion BBQ! Wow, what a great community. About 30 minutes go by, no mention yet of what work is actually being done. Some reference is made to selling something. Finally at about 40 minutes the guy says, ""are you ready to learn what you will be selling now?"" He then reveals that The Organization sends students to communities across Canada to sell encyclopedias door to door. I scream.. inside my head. 


These thick, heavy set of tomes cost between $300 - $700 BUT WAIT they come with a FREE CD with all the content on it! WOW! I look around the table, I see a few annoyed looks, one student is actually pretty into it so I guess they found their one sucker for that meeting. I wait about 5 more minutes before heaving a big sigh and collecting my things and leaving. The dude asked why I was leaving and I muttered something about this not being for me.  On the way out the girl at the fold out table asks why I was leaving. I was a bit more vocal with her and told her that the person who had called me specifically told me that they could help me with a laboratory work opportunity, that I had rescheduled a guidance appointment for this and that for heck'n sake this was the age of Wikipedia. She looked a little stunned for one half second but barely missed a beat before asking ""can we have your green sheet of paper"" thinking that I had written friends' contact info on it which I hadn't. I said no anyways and walked away. 


I saw Sally at a party a few days later and brought it up, she was instantly apologetic and said that she had messed up and written her friends' info down before realizing what was happening. I told her no hard feelings, in the end I got a laugh and it was nice to know that she thought I was smart. 


Anyways, that's my story for this sub. I totally forget the name of The Organization, not sure if anyone else has encountered this one out in the wild. "

8915i2,3,2018-04-02,"Have my jobcentre appointment tomorrow, really wish I wasn't back there again.",nocte_lupus,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/8915i2/have_my_jobcentre_appointment_tomorrow_really/,"So I was a claimant between 2012-2013 after coming out of College (UK, I'd just finished up doing several BTEC courses). 

I was on Jobseekers for a few months, then a friend of mine told me there was a job going at her workplace (An independently run animal shelter, great this is like what I studied for!)  so I went along, got given the job and signed off.  I worked a total of a couple of shifts there, the second shift the boss decided to send me home at lunch because she suddenly decided she didn't need three people working with the horses on site (Ok thanks for that I was working in a rural area and not driving at the time so my mum had to come and get me) and told me to come back next week. I did so then end of that shift she was like 'You need more training/supervision, since it's just after Christmas there's not a lot of people around so I'll call you in a few weeks' 
Well they never called back, I ended up on JSA again. Thanks. 

Decided to go back to school after a few more months of jobcentre bullshit, applied for a HND program, did that then a top up year for a BSc did well enough to get onto a MSc course. Which I afforded just through that post grad study loan, plus an alumni discount since I'd been at a 'partner college' to the university in question and some help from my eldest sibling. (At least I don't need to pay any of these student loans back yet) it seemed a good idea, like one more year of study? Why not? A few of my lecturers thought I had a good shot, the program looked good etc. 

Now I'm stuck sitting here in 'unemployment hell' after finishing my course. In September a local toy shop took me on for a Christmas temp, managed to get a couple of months then I came in for work one day, the manager let me into the store, let me clock in and I was just getting to work when I was called upstairs to the office. A few minutes later I'm standing outside the shop trying not to have a massive panic attack because apparently 'You made a mistake on the till and cost us 96 quid so we're letting you go' (Wasn't told the error btw and I'd been off for two days could've contacted me in the meanwhile) and to make it sting more the day before I'd had my Msc graduation. 

(Also Friday was my payday, it was Black Friday so I had a 'treat yoself' moment and brought AC Origins because I had a discount and as you can guess some 'well now I regret this purchase slightly, whoops sorry you felt like treating yourself') 

I took a brief break from job applications to get my head straight. Have been applying. Had interviews, interviews are going nowhere. Employers seem to like me well enough in interviews but apparently not enough to actually hire me. I'm a bit limited in what I can apply to because I have little money behind me (Can't relocate for those nice fancy grad jobs and internships) and can't drive (am learning, parents paying for lessons) and basically feel stuck because I'm falling into that limbo of 'Can't always qualify for the grad jobs because no experience and also have problems finding a entry level job for the moment because I have a degree/not enough experience' (I've picked up several years of customer service experience through a voluntary role I do, I'm till trained due to my last job, I'm used to working in a team etc etc) 

But I've hit the point i'm fed up of not having money, my family isn't well off they say they don't mind helping me out but I hate making them do that (and also it's not just that it's that lack of independence when you don't have enough money to pay for things yourself, I feel a burden on my family, I know we don't have much money etc) so I'm singing on again. 

I also feel very frustrated being that I'm 25, I know facebook/social medias distorts things and people only tend to post the good but seeing former classmates like travelling, getting somewhere (a lot of my masters classmates already sort of had at least a bit of a career going and were at least a bit more financially well off than I) and generally moving forward is so frustrating. 

I'm finding it hard to get myself to do things to fill my time as well, I have options but it's like 'I feel I'm wasting my time playing games', 'I would draw but can't concentrate/blocked/too stressed' etc even though drawing is a creative and productive outlet. I'm stressed out. I'm pretty sure I've generally been grappling with low grade anxiety and depression of some sort for years which sort of went a bit quiet when I was studying (still there but studying at least gave me something else to focus on or most the anxiety was focused on the studying) and it's coming back again. Problem is because It's usually low grade 'getting help' feels weird, also family reactions. I took some short term counselling at uni during the time I had no classes because it was cleared for master's project research my mum did not take it well when she found out (basically went into a whole I FAILED AS A PARENT spiel). My parents aren't necessarily the easiest people to listen to (and are kind of a factor in my issues they do a lot of stuff that does't help, my dad is a very stressful person to live with for example) or communicate with. 

My appointment is tomorrow to sort out all that jobseekers agreement stuff  I don't want to do this but feel stuck? 

Apologies this got a bit long. I'm just frustrated. 

Sorry this got long. "

I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

894kuz,1,2018-04-02,"Me, [24/M] Loss of sexual attraction with LDR girlfriend [23/F] of 4 years",Wimpybreakupper,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/894kuz/me_24m_loss_of_sexual_attraction_with_ldr/,"**TL;DR**

My girlfriend and I met and started dating over 4 years ago during our first year of college. I transferred, and we did (and are still doing) long distance and planned on moving in together after graduation. Jobs didn't work out, so we agreed to get experience for 2 years and then move to the same city together. For the past couple of months, I've completely lost my physical/sexual attraction to her. Part of me thinks it could be (diagnosed) depression/anxiety from medical school; the other part of me thinks this is fatal for a relationship full stop.

**Background**

My girlfriend, Sam (not a real name), and I met and dated during our freshman year of college and were naturally crazy about each other. I ended up transferring to a different school about 5 hours away in California. After transferring, we continued (and still are) to date long distance for 4 (going on 5) years.

There were times where our internships would line up so that we'd be able to live together during the summer, and we always made a point to spend holidays/spring/fall break with each other. For 4 years, we were happy. Being in a long distance relationship sucked, but we had this idea that it wouldn't be forever, that we'd be together after graduation. That didn't happen.

During our senior year, I accepted an offer to medical school that I just couldn't turn down. She understood and agreed that she'd look for jobs in her field in the same city. As these things go, she was offered and accepted a great starting position elsewhere. It was tough, but after talking, we agreed that she should take the offer elsewhere.

The plan was to spend 2 years down there and then move to the med school city. (I plan to practice here after graduation, and she's in love with the area, as well.) When we made this plan, we essentially planned that we would start our lives together, that we'd marry once we're both stable in our careers, etc. When we had these conversations, I was 100% all for it. This particular update happened about 1 year ago.

As of today, she is under the impression that everything is 100% perfect. As far as I know, she hasn't picked up on any problems. If she has, she hasn't brought them up to me. I would expect her to do so if she did think something was wrong because we've always been very straight forward with each other. The few times we lived together for a few months there were rough spots, but we always resolved them with a straightforward conversation about how X, Y, or Z makes us feel and how we could resolve the issue. It worked great.

**Relationship problem**

(I apologize if this part reads as rambling. I'm trying to keep it coherent, but I have a lot of feelings that I don't really know how to explain.)

Now, for the harder part. The past few times that we've visited, I just haven't found myself sexually motivated in any way. I'm ""tired"" from the long drive, or I really just need to get something to eat, or I'm really into this show we're watching together - All bullshit excuses for someone who hasn't seen his girlfriend in a month. Part of me thinks that I might not be physically attracted to her anymore. Sometimes I'll find myself look at another woman and wish my girlfriend looked like her, but I quickly push those intrusive thoughts away because they're 1) just terrible from a moral standpoint, and 2) not what a relationship is based on.

I can usually force myself to get into the sex when it comes up, but I'm never the one to initiate. I have to use my mind to finish. I definitely don't give it 100% and just kind of wait for it to be over (which is tough when she's used to you wanting to be in charge and do most of the work).

I still love her very much. The thought of not being in a relationship with her (even more actively breaking up with her) makes my heart race, my palms sweat. I had (what I think was) a minor panic attack while talking to my parents about the situation. (I had this irrational fear of some sort of impending doom that I just couldn't shake for some reason while my heart was beating extremely fast. I didn't look much into it, but Google said that's probably a panic attack, but I digress.) We've become Stephen and Sam; the idea of being single feels pretty foreign.

Another event is that I think I'm developing a crush on a girl in my classes (think middle school type of thing). I'm not putting much weight into this though because I think I might be trying to project feelings that I'm currently losing for Sam onto another girl. In other words, I think it's just my mind freaking out at the thought of not romantically loving anyone.

Part of me wonders if this isn't partially caused by the stress of medical school. Depression and anxiety are very common problems among graduate students, and part of that is a decreased sex drive. However, part of that loses weight when I have the aforementioned intrusive thoughts. (I will note that they've become more frequent in the past 1-2 months.) Maybe I should go and talk to someone. I'm hesitant to think that that will resolve anything because it isn't a case of just not wanting to have sex. I still have a sex drive; I'm just never motivated to have sex with Sam. (Part of me thinks the distance might be what helped the relationship last so long. Despite getting more comfortable and open with each other as time went on, the distance probably kept us in a version of the honeymoon phase.)

I know that physical attraction is never sufficient for a relationship, but it does seem like it's at least necessary. Sure, there are always going to be hotter people out there, but you should be attracted enough to your significant other that you wouldn't want to change them for the world.

**Relationship Questions**

**1)** Does this sound like a doomed relationship? Should I go talk to someone before making a decision

**2)** If the answer to 1 is ""break up,"" how? How does one end a relationship that's been going on for that long? Especially when the other person is under the impression that everything is perfect. I still love her very much, and the thought of hurting her is awful. Moreover, we've been long distance for 4 years and have tons of stuff at each other's houses. Logistically, how does one even coordinate this? Phone call? Skype? I suppose the easiest answer is for me to drive there and do the deed, but honestly, 14 hours of emotional driving is 1) unsafe, and 2) a lot of time for a first year med student to take out of his schedule.

**3) (Somewhat unrelated)** If the answer to 1 is yes, how does one be single? The natural (and unhealthy) inclination is to find someone else, but that seems more like you're trying to replace A with B, and that seems like it'd be doomed from the start. How does one grieve? I've been in this happy relationship for so much of my emotionally mature life that I've never really had to deal with this on a full scale and don't really know how."

The few times we lived together for a few months there were rough spots, but we always resolved them with a straightforward conversation about how X, Y, or Z makes us feel and how we could resolve the issue. It worked great.

**Relationship problem**

(I apologize if this part reads as rambling. I'm trying to keep it coherent, but I have a lot of feelings that I don't really know how to explain.)

Now, for the harder part. The past few times that we've visited, I just haven't found myself sexually motivated in any way. I'm ""tired"" from the long drive, or I really just need to get something to eat, or I'm really into this show we're watching together - All bullshit excuses for someone who hasn't seen his girlfriend in a month. Part of me thinks that I might not be physically attracted to her anymore. Sometimes I'll find myself look at another woman and wish my girlfriend looked like her, but I quickly push those intrusive thoughts away because they're 1) just terrible from a moral standpoint, and 2) not what a relationship is based on.

I can usually force myself to get into the sex when it comes up, but I'm never the one to initiate. I have to use my mind to finish. I definitely don't give it 100% and just kind of wait for it to be over (which is tough when she's used to you wanting to be in charge and do most of the work).

I still love her very much. The thought of not being in a relationship with her (even more actively breaking up with her) makes my heart race, my palms sweat. I had (what I think was) a minor panic attack while talking to my parents about the situation. (I had this irrational fear of some sort of impending doom that I just couldn't shake for some reason while my heart was beating extremely fast. I didn't look much into it, but Google said that's probably a panic attack, but I digress.) We've become Stephen and Sam; the idea of being single feels pretty foreign.

Another event is that I think I'm developing a crush on a girl in my classes (think middle school type of thing). I'm not putting much weight into this though because I think I might be trying to project feelings that I'm currently losing for Sam onto another girl. In other words, I think it's just my mind freaking out at the thought of not romantically loving anyone.

Part of me wonders if this isn't partially caused by the stress of medical school. Depression and anxiety are very common problems among graduate students, and part of that is a decreased sex drive. However, part of that loses weight when I have the aforementioned intrusive thoughts. (I will note that they've become more frequent in the past 1-2 months.) Maybe I should go and talk to someone. I'm hesitant to think that that will resolve anything because it isn't a case of just not wanting to have sex. I still have a sex drive; I'm just never motivated to have sex with Sam. (Part of me thinks the distance might be what helped the relationship last so long. Despite getting more comfortable and open with each other as time went on, the distance probably kept us in a version of the honeymoon phase.)

I know that physical attraction is never sufficient for a relationship, but it does seem like it's at least necessary. Sure, there are always going to be hotter people out there, but you should be attracted enough to your significant other that you wouldn't want to change them for the world.

**Relationship Questions**

**1)** Does this sound like a doomed relationship? Should I go talk to someone before making a decision

**2)** If the answer to 1 is ""break up,"" how? How does one end a relationship that's been going on for that long? Especially when the other person is under the impression that everything is perfect. I still love her very much, and the thought of hurting her is awful. Moreover, we've been long distance for 4 years and have tons of stuff at each other's houses. Logistically, how does one even coordinate this? Phone call? Skype? I suppose the easiest answer is for me to drive there and do the deed, but honestly, 14 hours of emotional driving is 1) unsafe, and 2) a lot of time for a first year med student to take out of his schedule.

**3) (Somewhat unrelated)** If the answer to 1 is yes, how does one be single? The natural (and unhealthy) inclination is to find someone else, but that seems more like you're trying to replace A with B, and that seems like it'd be doomed from the start. How does one grieve? I've been in this happy relationship for so much of my emotionally mature life that I've never really had to deal with this on a full scale and don't really know how."

I supervise interns.
I had one come in today for an interview for a potential placement with me.
She showed up wearing a belly shirt, skinny jeans and slipper like shoes with big fuzzy balls on the top of them.
Totally not professional IMO, and strike one,

We talked a bit about the placement and responsibilities.
She seemed interested but then began telling me how she was going to look at other places too and would ""let me know if she accepted the placement"".

I DIDN'T EVEN OFFER IT TO HER!!

So second strike and I probably will not move forward at this point.

When you go to interview for field, you really need to treat this like an actual job interview.

Nothing is written in stone and for the love of all things holy, cover your parts and wear real shoes!!

First impressions really can make the difference between being given an opportunity or not being able to find a placement at all.

895oeb,1,2018-04-02,Almost girlfriend [21/f] goes in a month on a 5 month overseas internship. She wants to separate now to ease the comming pain. Im a [21/m],EpicDaaan,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/895oeb/almost_girlfriend_21f_goes_in_a_month_on_a_5/,"So things kind of got out of hand. We started dating one and a half month ago. We both werent really looking for anything at the time but we had a liking in eachother so we went on a date. After that it went fast. We saw eachother like 3 times a week as a minimum. We shared everything with eachother. All the personal stuff you dont really do in the begining etc. We got close really fast and we enjoyed it. But we dont call it relationship because of the following. 

In one month time she is leaving for 5 months to the other side of the world for an internship. This sucks, but it is so much fun for her as well. We knew what we were getting into but it doenst really make the situation easyer. But now the thing that I am stuggling with is, that she wants to stop seeing each other already... She is afraid we will get to close in the following month and it will be much harder and much more painfull to leave. While I on the other hand just want to enjoy the time we still have and make the most of it. 

We are both realistic enough to say that we cant push a long distance relationship after only dating for two and half months (if we continue dating until she leaves). But I just want to enjoy her company until she does leave and see what happens then. I dont want to quit it already. It feels to good to let her go... 

To be honest I dont know what for advice im looking for. I just want some different opiniums on the matter. Thanks for reading."

I've had depression ever since I lost my sister, and in combination with other little things, it has taken a huge mental toll on me. 

When I was supposed to be at my strongest to really set my life on the right track, I was the opposite. I stopped going to class even though I live on campus, I put no effort into my work, and now I am on my last chance for some of my classes that I need. I have the same habits of not putting in any effort, so I fear that even though I am a few credits away from graduating, I will not be able to pass or even retake these classes anymore. 

My girlfriend of almost 5 years has been waiting for me to ""grow up"" and make certain decisions without her having to ask about them all the time. I want to move out and live with her, but I haven't been working this whole time I've been in school, so now I am rushing to find some sort of income through an internship or something so that I can start somewhere, but the semester is almost over and then I will have to go home.

My parents are getting really old, and I don't want to put off my graduation any longer for them. I know they are understanding of my condition and that it has set me back, but after a while I fear they will get very disappointed with me for not being able to focus on things well.

I have tried to ""cure"" my depression through counseling and medicine, but none of it has really worked. I recently stopped taking medicine since it was doing more harm than good with its side effects. I feel hopeless because I don't know if I will ever truly feel happy again. The only time I feel somewhat happy is when I watch my TV shows or play video games online.

I question if me and my girlfriend will last, and I can tell that she always questions it too. We have arguments about simple things and we constantly have different opinions or perspectives that clash with each other. I fear that the relationship is a ""sunk cost fallacy"" or something similar, and I don't know what to do.

I want to get out of my endless cycle of sadness, but the combination of all of the above has made it so difficult. I feel like maybe if I graduated that would make me a bit happier, but I am about to mess that up, and I think my adviser gave me until 2019 to finish my degree. It isn't even laziness anymore. It is some kind of inner demon holding me back. I have thoughts of accomplishing all these things, but then my mind doesn't feel like working to do any of it. Even my fun hobbies are a chore now. I dream about going back to the gym and making a bunch of personal records, but when it's time to go I make an excuse and I end up not doing it.

tl;dr: I am about to fail more classes that I may not be able to take again. I have until 2019 to graduate. My girlfriend is getting annoyed with me because I need to grow up and start setting things in place long term. My parents are waiting for me to graduate and getting old. I can barely get out of bed to do my favorite things. I have suffered from continued sadness despite trying counseling and medicine multiple times. I don't see a good outcome at this point."

I’m a sophomore taking 5 science/technical classes, and I’m trying my best in each one of them. I was really close to an A- in only one of the classes but that got screwed too. Here’s why: we have lab reports due for a certain chemistry course. We are expected to turn them in both online and a hard copy. My hard copy was fine but for the online copy, I ended up turning a draft version of it my mistake (I keep switching between the school computer and my own computer a lot while doing lab reports). The professor considers this plagiarism, and downright gave me a zero. This whole thing bumped down my grade by two grade points from an A- to a B. How can I convince the professor to atleast just grade my draft version instead of giving me a 0? Throughout my university experience, my professors have been extremely non-negotiable even on the simplest issues. 
I’m also going through a lot of personal issues right now and I’m just so sad about everything. 
I’ve already had a very rough semester with several all nighters, and haven’t had the best results. I feel like I’m just drowning in everything right now. I have no motivation left. I have reached a breaking point. I have also been applying to internships and not received any replies. I have quite terrible grades even in the past semester, but I thought I would turn it around this semester and show an upward trend, but all my efforts went in vain. I’m too stressed just thinking about finals that’s a month away. I’m really really scared my mental situation is going to affect my grades. I don’t even enjoy school anymore.

896z2h,49,2018-04-02,So I wrote up a summary of the primary debate for GM.,PilotWaveCurious,RPI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/896z2h/so_i_wrote_up_a_summary_of_the_primary_debate_for/,"This is an alt account because I mention some things that are self identifying and I'm embarrassed of my anxiety in asking questions. Note that these are somewhat biased takes and aren't complete as there are some times when I went up to ask questions and so was afk.

-----

Stef is introducing herself and saying that she wants RPI to be inclusive and that's why she's running. Claims to be the best candidate cuz she's worked with the student body in many different ways. Been very involved with communication and as a senator.

Nancy talks about her history as a senator and standing firm for student rights with a respectful relationship with the admin and talks about her interest in diversity and representing all students

Moose claims he wants to bring changes the average student cares about and stop the apathy on the part of the student body.

""Moose, what does GM mean to you?""  
""I think the GM is the voice of the students towards the administration speaking for their rights and best interests""  
""Nancy?""  
""GM means being active voice in the administration for the student body, greeks, athletics, etc, bridging the gap, mending the gap, helping out everyone on each side.""  
""Stef?""  
""Making sure students are represented, and talking about their opinions and not just those of yourself.""  
""What sets you apart from the other candidates Stef?""  
""I've already worked in this area as a senator + communication person""  
""Nancy?""  
""My platform is different than the others, setting up networking with administrators and being a stepping stone for students""  
""Moose?""  
""I've been campaigning around in a Moose costume, so that sets me apart. I want to bring some fun to the role of GM. More lighthearted than my opponents.""  
""Okay, but you have to run senate meetings? How does that gel with your lighthearted nature?""  
""I've run multiple clubs before and I fully expect to be serious in running senate meetings, I have no issues there.""  

""Nancy, student senate is usually seen as very insular, how do you plan on bringing it outside of that small group?""  
""I've done it before with other groups, working with bringing them into stugov processes, so I plan on extending that, working with students outside stugov and showing them what it's like, listening to them and such.""  
""Policies Moose?""  
""Frat people living in frat houses in summer arch. Summer arch for science majors is fucking stupid, REUs are important and this screws us over. Fix good samaritan policy with frats.""  
""Stef?""  
""Moose touched on some important ones, Good Samaritan is important to redo properly. Preferred names is in the works for three years, three years too long.""  
""Nancy?""  
""Get back student senate approval of handbook.""

""What do you all think should happen with the student union and the administration? Stef?""  
""StU has done great things, should only follow the rules and not push boundaries, then there should be no issue.""  
""Moose?""  
""100% support for StU and RR, admin is being unreasonable and bad for students, the union is incredibly unique with being previously student run and I would take extreme measures to protect it, we have a cause worth fighting for, and that's important""  
""Nancy?""  
""StU is speaking out for what they believe in, important to be heard, need to follow rules, then no judicial action, we need to be respectful with admin and discuss even given this, we need free speech and open communication here on campus.""

""Are there any policies we need to get rid of entirely? Moose?""  
""Nothing comes to mind immediately, people have concerns over off campus jurisdiction, I see where people are coming from, but I haven't seen it misused yet, so I'm suspicious of people complaining, but remain open.""  
""What do you need to improve on to be grand marshall? Nancy?""  
""Need a strong support system and cabinet, I try to do things by myself. We really need a good cabinet to make things work.""  
""Stef?""  
""I've been working on formulating my thoughts clearly and concisely, but still could improve there, advocating for my thoughts properly.""  
""Moose?""  
""As an outsider I need to get to know everyone involved, people are not thrilled with my campaign, my first action would be to alleviate those concerns?""  
""Nancy, what policies would you change?""  
""There were some in the student handbook that student life committee is looking into, I want them changed or removed.""  
""Stef?""  
""One was already touched upon, off campus jurisdiction, already seen it happen [I think with outing club?], mandatory minimum for alcohol, we have a j board for a reason.""  

""There are some contentious issues with graduate senators and stugov, how would you improve? Moose?""  
""Graduate students feel like the union doesn't represent them, so we need to advocate for them more, related to stipend and cost of living increases, a few years ago our physics grad students qualified for medicade, and that was changed because they complained to Persans [in physics], not the union.""   
""Nancy?""   
""We've been bringing in the grad council's projects and more communication atm, just more of that, and need to think more about them and do projects to help grad students which we don't.""  
""Stef?""  
""Past senate made significant strides in this regards, communication thing reached out and tried to unite people in senate meetings and communication, etc etc. We should also change their orientation for more info and bonding, not just courses stuff""   
""What's the greatest challenge you'll see as GM? Nancy?""  
""Creating that network, that bridge, between the administration and students again. Often times we go with changes with handbook and we're pawned off as too young, ignorant, and unable to think about the various laws at play.""  
""Stef?""  
""Repair relationship with administration, need to be productive. But need to stand firm in beliefs of student body, representing them all will be hard.""  
""Moose?""  
""Students and the faculty views the administration in an adversarial way, we need to raise hell and show them we're angry while also coming to the table if need be and balancing those two, we need more protests, but also need to be willing to talk, the balance is the most difficult bit.""  
""Greatest weaknesses? Stef?""  
""Duration of how long I've been in stugov, only 1.5 years, so I tried to do a ton of work in that time, to show I'm just as informed as everyone else.""  
""Moose?""  
""Total lack of experience, not the most serious person, getting people to take me seriously will be my greatest weakness.""  
""Nancy?""  
""Trying to take on too much by myself.""  

[Didn't hear this question, it's about alcohol/drug, Stef is saying they want to talk to the city of Troy to work with the policy.]  
""Followup, do you have experience working with they city of troy?""  
""I go to the farmer's market [half jokingly?], though I know that's not real experience.""  
""Why should we focus on sustainability over other issues Nancy? We already have a lot of green clubs.""  
""They're spread out and don't always know how to work with the admin to do what needs to be done, so we as stugov officials need to be that bridge.""   
""Okay, but we have summer arch and all these other problems? Why does sustainability matter more than that?""  
""I think we focus so much on certain parts of the administration where there are other parts of them we can work with better, we neglect these other facets of the administration and it hurts us. By no means does it outshadow other issues, but it's still important.""  
""Moose, do you have relationships with administrators to fix the problems with summer arch you mentioned?""  
""No, but that's an asset, they have no preconceived notions about me. [reiterates the issue with science students and says it should be an easy argument to make, it hurts grad acceptance rates.]""  
""What policies are you thinking of besides just exemptions for students in the school of science?""  
[Gives a broad range of iffy answers, says he's not sure of specifics.]  

""Nancy, you say one of the past downfalls of stugov communication has been stugov not talking to people who don't have time or interest in stugov, how would you interest them?""  
""Go to clubs, talk to them about projects to send to committees. Gonna ""teach"" students that you only need an hour a week.""  
[Some question about health center for health, for Stef, I think]  
""Doctor on call, something for woman's health.""  
""Moose, you like a liberal name of the preferred name policy. Do you feel this marginalizes real issues with preferred name and harms students?""  
""I don't think I'm abusing the name system, there was a jboard cased that deemed it fine, the last thing I want is to hurt those who need the preferred name system, I'm publicizing it, if anything, I'm extreme and unorthodoxed, but would absolutely make sure it stays in place and even expand it.""  
[Some question I didn't catch.]  
""I've worked with both candidates for PU, worked with Justin in the past and Ida with union logo issues, good communication with both."" -Stef  
""Moose?""  
""Been cordial with both, should be fine.""  
""Nancy?""  
""Good professional relationship with both, very good with Ida, should be no issue, we can work together with all leaders for communication. Form a united force, and not squabble internally.""  

------

Q/A starts here

[I go up to ask my question, there are two or three others asked before hand, one relating to title 9 iirc]

My question can be found [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/163479540683767810/430492128876036096/IMG_3145.JPG).  
""Nancy?""  
""Everyone screwed up last time, everyone dropped the ball, we need to work together next time and while last week's meeting seemed to want to have more student involvement but failed. I'll try to work for more communication.""  
""Moose?""  
""Students don't trust the administration, the number of different positions we heard from Powell is absurd and the number of lies we've heard are absurd, we need to have a serious conversation to the administration that this level of conniving won't be accepted.""  
""Stef?""  
""Director of the union works with students, we need to make sure they can communicate with them.""  
[In my mind, only Andrew/Moose answered the question]

""No matter what you do there's going to be criticism from students. How would you handle that?""  
""Moose?""  
""Already had nonconstructive criticism, people calling me a jackass, but I'm always willing to listen to constructive criticism.""  
""Stef?""  
Stef has a non answer really. Nancy sympathizes with Moose.  

[I go up for a second question listed [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/163479540683767810/430492244991148033/IMG_3146.JPG).]  
""Moose?""  
""It's up to the individual department, but I'd try to talk to them about this.""  
""Stef?""  
""It's important for student government to talk about this and bring it up.""  
""Nancy?""  
""Well, it's a dead semester for a lot of majors, including Chemistry, we should talk about it in the appropriate committees.""  
""How would you stay involved if not elected?""  
""Stef?""  
""I've been involved as is, with other groups, hope to work with them still.""  
""Nancy? Stay in SS, apply for chairwoman positions, want to still advocate for students.""  
""Moose?""  
""I'm also running for graduate senator, 4 people, 6 positions, I'm gonna get it, I have a lot of friends in stugov, even if I lose I plan on being involved one way or another through them.""  
""How do you feel about parliamentary procedure? Nancy?""  
""Depends on the senate. Can be good, can be bad, was good this year, hope to continue that.""  
""Moose?""  
""Best things ever invented, we use Robert's rules in our frat so we can have civilized discussions.""  
""Stef?""  
""It's important, I was active parliamentary for a bit, makes sure everyone stays on topic.""  
""You've mentioned how relationships with the administration has deteriorated, everyone says it, how would you fix it?""  
""Moose?""  
""It's been a huge issue for a long time, we need a new approach, we could learn a lot from colleges with large protest movements and force the administration to come to the table for meaningful change.""  
""Stef?""  
""It's cordial but uncomfortable, we need to talk more and talk every month or so.""  
""Nancy?""  
""Gonna agree with Stef, need to be civil but uncomfortable, reasonable but firm.""  

""Why do you want to be GM?""  
""Stef?""  
""We need to improve, not using the union enough, it's diverse but we need to mingle more and not have people sectioned off group by group.""  
""Nancy?""  
""Been on the senate for 3 years, seen some that worked and some that didn't, I think I can make the change, take those that worked and build a senate that works for all students.""  
""Moose?""  
""Initially I wasn't thrilled or into it, but a lot of friends thought I should do it, that I would do a good job, I listened to them and decided to go for it, my friends really believe in me and are pushing me toward believing I can do a good job for the students.""  
""Question for Stef and Nancy, what did you do well and poorly this past year?""  
""Nancy?""  
""Looking internally at senate, internal reforms committee, that was good, I like how we've grown as a body. Badly? My own opinions in statements to students and taking a step back and trusting my senate.  
""Stef?""  
""[Something about parliamentary procedure and making sure people know what's going on before hand]""  
""[Some question about greek vs independent student relationships]""  
""Moose?""  
""We can do a bit to bridge the gap, being in greek life, I don't have any specific policy plans but it is an issue and am willing to listen.""  
""Stef?""  
""Diversity includes greek vs independent, we need to do greek block party more and help out as stugov, find ideas to help.""  
""Nancy?""  
""Not greek, there are many ways where we can work together more, communication, talking more effectively, etc. More greek activity in stugov through student life committee.""  
""Directed at Stef and Nancy, you have a lot of volunteers in your committees, what did you do to keep them interested?""  
""Nancy?""  
""I tried to be hands off and listen to what they were passionate about rather than what I was passionate about.""  
""Stef?""  
[Same answer basically]  


""For the Moose, re: The Poly, you say that there should be exemptions for the school of science for summer arch, other schools have the same issue, how does that work out?""  
""Yes, it's an issue for all schools, but for school of science it's more common to do PhDs, which really needs research experience, which is done through NSF grants for REUs. There ARE jobs and internships during the schoolyear for other majors, but the NSF grants do not exist during the school year.""  
""Winter break is shorter, what's up with that? Also, most classes are at the same time, 10-12:30, how can people work with all their classes being at the same time? Similarly, international students are often super not involved in stugov, how would you increase involvement?""  
""Stef?""  
""Two weeks is not enough time for maintenance of buildings or students themselves. Some people do surgery over the winter break. We can't change this upcoming year, but I really think we should change it next year. Arch classes are too compact, super stressful summer, too busy for students. I'm pro diversity, want to send notices about stugov to every student.""  
""Nancy?""  
""Two weeks isn't long enough, we can't change the upcoming one once it's on the calendar, but we need to fix it next time. We're still working on summer arch and classes there. I discuss diversity in my platform and want to see senate have a sister committee for underrepresented students and multicultural lounge.""  
""Moose?""  
""Summer Arch is unfortunately going to happen, any rational person agrees it's not a good idea, but we're getting it anyways. Unless RPI changes semester schedule I see little wiggle room wrt winter break, we'd need to shorten other breaks. Faculty are very happy that classes exist over the summer as more pay, so we should advocate for a greater diversity of classes and more classes to fix the dead semester problem for students. The most common question I got while in the Moose costume was ""What is the grand marshall?"" Most students don't know anything about stugov outside of GM week, we need to drum up support within the student body and awareness because nobody knows about it.""  
[Some question about going home for winter break for 2 weeks, not viable]  
""Do something for international students during that time.""  
""Need to give them food and board, it's pretty absurd.""  
""Stef?""  
""We need to make sure everything is running so that international students don't feel so alone.""  
[Another question about diversity]  
[Various uninteresting bland answers -reiterating what they said before]  

------

Closing statements.

""Moose?""  
""Vote in the primary, you get a free mug, only way for your voice to be heard, get involved.""  
""Nancy?""  
""Thanks to those of you who have brought me here, I hope to increase communication and awareness of my platform.""  
""Stef?""  
""I believe in every point made in my platform, we can make RPI better for future students and promise to only advocate for student views. Thank you all for being here tonight.""

897yf8,1,2018-04-02,I’m worried I could end up being stuck in a relationship due to guilt,whitebabykitten,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/897yf8/im_worried_i_could_end_up_being_stuck_in_a/,"Hey guys. I just want to start off by saying that I am happy in my relationship right now and love the person I’m with very much, but I am a lot younger than he is and sometimes I get concerned about my future if things were to change. 

To make a long story short, my boyfriend lost his job because of us. I had started interning at this new job and he had already been working there, and a little while after I had started I had asked him to dinner so I could ask him for advice on some career related stuff. Anyways, we were out together and we were seen by a third party, God knows who or how, but it was reported to his bosses and after lots of reviewing apparently it was deemed as inappropriate relations as he was my superior. I was let go first, which didn’t really affect me much truthfully, it wasn’t an internship I really valued nor was I getting paid, mostly it just made me feel awful about the whole thing. A while later he was fired. 

We started seeing each other romantically after this, and have now been together for around 2 1/2 years. I love him, but like I said I am a lot younger and my future is still far ahead of me. I could see myself marrying him and having a family with him, I guess maybe right now I’m just getting cold feet and would like some advice or insight. 

He’s been applying for other career opportunities relentlessly but with no luck, has been working some smaller jobs here and there to help with the bills. He had to sell his house because of this, though we have bought a much cheaper (yet much nicer once) since and have been living together for about a year and a half now. 

Finishing my education is the number one priority for me right now, yet he really wants to tie the knot soon and start having kids. I told him recently maybe we should slow down on the kid thing, that when the time is right we can have some, though he seemed to get upset and feel rejected that I asked to wait. 

I just get scared because I do see some compatibility problems. For the most part we get along great, he’s my best friend, but other times we just really clash and he really stresses me out sometimes. Like just right now! He’s texting me and accusing me of not being supportive enough with the job situation. I have been supporting and encouraging him while also praying for him night and day throughout all of this, even if it means doing so for jobs that would take him across the country. I feel extremely guilty for all of this. I know he loves me so so much, but I worry he will always look at me and blame me for all of this, or that no matter what I do it won’t make up for all that he’s lost. I also worry that in the future if I ever want to leave I won’t be able to because he lost his job over us. 

Sorry maybe I just needed to vent. Advice or insight regarding my concerns would be appreciated though"

21/M/China - Looking for gay penpals

I once made a friend via facebook, he is a French guy. By the time he was traveling in China, and I joined his trip to Shanghai. I found it’s extreme interesting to do something like making friends online. I mean maybe one day you guys can meet in reality. 

This is the first time I’ve been here in Reddit. I love making foreigner friends since we can share something much different like a language. Furthermore, I love traveling as well, so it would be nice if we had a chance to travel together. 

I am a college guy studying marketing, but I prefer fashion studies and writing. That’s why I tend to find some internships of media thing. I had two relationships, of course they’re boys. The first time I realized that I like boys it was 11. So, yeah, my first sexual imagination was with a guy in my class. I wasn’t struggle at all that time. But even I knew myself so early, I just still find difficulties to come out with my parents. The LGBT thing is a big issue here. I am out to my friends and colleagues, but not yet to my parents, cause they’re will be devastated I guess.

I love music stuff and fashion thing and traveling, also photography. I prefer e-mail so that we can share much more often.

ich stehe vor der Aufgabe, meine Kündigung einzureichen, habe jedoch Probleme, die ""richtigen"" Worte bei meinem Chef zu finden.

Hintergrund: Ich musste vor mehr als 3 Jahren aufgrund vorhergehender Arbeitslosigkeit und dem Druck wieder auf den Markt zu kommen, eine Stelle annehmen, die einen Umzug verpflichtend machte. Die Stelle ist echt super, die Firma ist realtiv fair, das Gehalt für so eine Einstellungssituation akzeptabel und *ich* habe mich am neuen Wohnort halbwegs integriert. 
Nur meine Familie (damals nur Frau, jetzt Kind 1 und Kind 2 im Ofen) leidet gerade akut unter der Situation, mehr als damals antizipiert. Keine Freunde und Familienangehörige in noch erträglicher Reichweite zur sozialen Entspannung und Entlastung beim Kind.

Aus diesem Grund habe ich intern sowie extern mal die Fühler nach einer neuen Stelle ausgestreckt und habe einen Treffer gelandet, der mir neben dem neuen familienfreundlicheren Standort auch finanziell sowie zeitplanerisch in die Karten spielt. Dies kann meine aktuelle Firma höchstwahrscheinlich nicht kompensieren, jedoch habe ich noch kein Mitarbeitergespräch erbeten um dies abzuklären, da der ganze Vorgang recht doch schnell geschah und ich bei einem Gespräch auch gerne einen Hebel habe und nicht nur einen Bluff. 
Meine Wechselgründe sind also eher sozialer Natur und nicht so sehr das Karriere-Hopping zur Konkurrenz mit dem besseren Angebot.

Ich möchte/werde kündigen, aber ich weiß nicht, wie ich hier ohne ""böses Blut"" davon komme, da ich vielleicht später mal wieder auf die Firma zurückkommen möchte. 

Erzählt mir von Euren Erlebnissen beim Jobwechsel, was Ihr beim nächsten mal anders machen würdet, was karrieremäßiger Selbstmord wäre. 

Ach ja, ich würde gerne den zukünftigen Arbeitgeber zunächst verschweigen, wie schaffe ich das, ohne in Xing und Konsorten nicht zu lügen? (Außer den Accout zu löschen).

**EDIT**

sollte ich kurz vor Fristende kündigen oder etwas Vorlaufzeit geben? Sollte ich vor der Kündigung bereits mit meinem Vorgesetzten darüber reden? Ich kann mir eigentlich nur Nachteile bei einem vorzeitigem Bekanntwerden herbeireden ...

I'm planning the opening of a private career college in ON (probably Kingston or maybe in and around Toronto).  Teaching IT (cyber security and web development). I am working on tying placements in with the courses so that students can do summer internships at companies. I really want people to get in and out into the job market. So I will probably tie in something like ""pay in installments as you get a job"" or something that is advantageous to a student at the same time helping the institute with its costs.

Due to a combination of bad planning and studying abroad, I've not secured housing for the summer yet and every place available is extremely expensive(even for SF).

-Their highest priority is customer adoption. They do not want to fade out like so many cryptos will do, because they had a 'if we build it, they will come' strategy.

-They understand the cries of the community and as they onboard some additional people they plan to go back to a solid weekly or bi-weekly update strategy.

-They have been working with some big names to add to their advisory board and they expect to announce some 'amazing' fintech advisors soon to add to their growing advisory board.

-In terms of scaling past UAE to international markets, they said its really as simple as integrating with international banks. The sky is the limit with the product, its simply a matter of scaling with partners and banks.

-Job offer was made to another senior developer, expected on boarding in 2 weeks. Also hired an intern from Stanford, and creating several new positions and plan to have multiple new employees by the EOY.

-Company focus in Q2 is 100% on Verify Payments product.

-They are testing their pricing models and expect to have an update to pricing scale as they do not believe 1% makes sense for every use case. Also, clarified that buyers/sellers do not need to hold 1% of CRED, they can pay the fee in FIAT which would be auto-converted to CRED on the back-end. This is to simplify the process and make it seamless to the users.

-Addressed UTrust and Monetha, made the argument that CRED is not just a 'check-out' solution, but a back-end reputation protocol that drives trust exchanges within the blockchain.

-They discussed their issues with KuCoin, but this post basically says it all: https://medium.com/verifyas/our-kucoin-listing-nightmare-and-why-its-the-last-place-you-should-list-3af019e4e7f6

-Other exchanges are being sought, but because they did a small ICO to appease investors - they cannot justify paying a large listing price, so they are working on getting on other 'small' exchanges.

-Overall, they said that things are going great for Verify Payments and testing with customers has been extremely useful and is driving some major changes to their alpha product.

What were everyone else's key takeaways?"
89dokw,2,2018-04-03,M4Futa - the Futa Apocalypse,weakthrow,futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/89dokw/m4futa_the_futa_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you.

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of girls on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the girls, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the man down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The man in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the girls in the crowd moving now the foot long cock pounding in and out of the driver's mouth.

Jesus christ, the entire circle of them have them - monster cocks are being pulled out from beneath skirts, too tight jeans and yoga pants

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at that point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

Even as he talks the female anchor blushes and licks her lips, one hand slowly moving below the table as she turns to look at her partner

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from both of us being young to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/daughter, mother/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Everyone - Every woman in the world now has a footlong cock, the strength of a linebacker and the libido of a fratboy? uh-oh

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks  - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the futa apocalypse, not the futa group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

89e492,2,2018-04-03,Question for social media gurus,roxtops,socialmedia,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/89e492/question_for_social_media_gurus/,"I'm an intern for a marketing company, managing social media accounts and ads manager for a few of their clients. In the last month or so, many of the pages likes campaigns we have been running have increased dramatically. Nothing appears to have changed significantly. We are running similar ads to what have worked before and the ad set remains the same. Anyways, we took an ad that ran a few months ago right at $1.00 per like and ran it again to see how it would perform now. It ran at about $1.60. Many of ads we would normally expect to generate likes around $1.00-$1.50 are now over $2.00. The CPM has doubled on these, as well.

I'm still learning quite a bit and just thought I'd ask here because you all could probably help me out. I don't think it has to do with overexposure because it's been a while since this ad has been shown. What could potentially be a problem here? I should add that it hasn't just been this one client where I've seen this increase. Has something changed with Facebook advertising in the past year where costs have risen a little or are these ads simply not performing well? If so, any suggestions?"

I apologise up front for the wall of text I'm about to write and for the obvious throwaway.

I'm writing here because I need some help. I'm a 23 year old guy that never dated anyone, didn't have any girlfriend ever and also a total virgin. A sad state unfortunately. The story is rather simple, in middle school I focused on playing video games while my friends were slowly learning how to deal with girls etc. Because of that, I went through highschool without any intimate relationship with any girl, as I was already behind and too afraid to catch up on the slack. 

When college started and I hoped for the best. Unfortunately I got into a programme that was very intense, and coupled with my fucking worrisome attitude, I mostly didn't do anything else than study. That's right over 4 years I basically got 0 personal development other than my degree, I'm not talking about only girls but pretty much anything else a person could do.

Anyways I'm about to complete my degree and doing an internship at the moment which gives me a lot of freetime for the first time in the last few years. I thought to myself that it is the time for change and that I'd like to be better.

Unfortunately, because of my past, I have absolutely zero experience in the world of dating. In fact, I have, over the last few years, barely as much as talked to girls in a casual setting. Other than that, I think I don't look too bad for a guy; I'm not overweight at all and I always try too dress well. I don't have any huge social anxiety, and while I'm an introvert and somewhat reserved under normal circumstances, I haven't had much troubles meeting new friends. Add to it that when I'm drunk, I become a LOT more sociable than usual, and I wouldn't be surprised if people who met me when I'm drunk would be very surprised how much more reserved I am when sober.

But when it comes to interacting with girls, it's quite a different story, even when I'm drunk, although it gets better. Problem is that I just don't know how a date works. I absolutely hate random smalltalk or anything of that sort. I also don't usually talk about subjects I don't know much about. Another problem is that because of the lack of contact with girls, I just have troubles talking to them like the normal human beings they are. Either way I'm just lost when thinking about how would a date with me go. And given that I'm a total virgin, I wouldn't even know how to properly kiss someone if somehow eventual dates went well...

I thought about trying out some dating apps and just jumping right in. After a few bad dates I might get better. It's just that I'm a bit afraid of doing that given what I just told you. Truth be told I don't think I'd like to date a looser like me.

Anyways do you guys have any thoughts about this situation?"

However, I have been amazed at cel Animation for a Long time and would like to learn it and try making works like that. My works are pretty decent I would say, though it’s not the best.

A company specialising in cel Animation recently offered me a chance to freelance and intern at their place, where I can learn and improve and work on it. However, I’m afraid that my abilities might not be adequate yet as I have little experience in the cel Animation style. I would be really willing to learn though, and this is actually a big decision as I feel like I’m taking a risk, I have always played on the safe side my whole life. What if I’m slow at learning this new skill. My only fear is that I’ll fail and let everyone down. 

Please advise me on what I should do, should I just go for it, and get out of my comfort zone?

Thank you so much"

I just got a 6 month internship near Arts-Loi, and was wondering if you could rent apartments or rooms by the month, and with furniture?

I’m grew up in the bay and have lived here my whole life. I can no longer afford the place where I live (gf and I broke up) and I don’t know where else to turn. 

I’m 26, have my degree in accounting and work full time in payroll (about to hit my 2 year anniversary in a few months) however it is not enough to afford a place in the bay without a roommate, sadly I don’t think I’ll have time to find a reliable roommate (even then it has to be a cheap place for me
To afford it)  and one bedrooms are wayy out of my price range due to car payments, insurance, student loan payments, and various credit card debt I racked up in college. 

I already have a number to assist those people who are losing their housing, is there any advice you guys have on getting out of this hole? 

I’ve been applying to various jobs throughout the year with no luck or call backs from anyone...I wasn’t able to intern during college (worked full time + and worked on weekends had to pay rent) so I don’t have internal accounting experience (been trying to get out of payroll into a higher paying internal job) and my current company uses such old software that I don’t have the software experience required for every payroll company I’ve seen and applied to...I’m just stuck. 

I would like to get a second job, however getting another full time position would most likely require me to work later than I am already hurting my chances of finding a part time night job that doesn’t leave me too tired to bust ass at work the next day. 

Sorry it’s kind of a ramble but there’s a lot of emotions going on right now, the shock of being homeless soon is a big one. 

Any advice at all helps, thank you in advance. "

It's Countryheads this week as Kacey Musgraves' song 'High Horse' from her recently released acclaimed album *Golden Hour* tops this week's chart, making it this week's highest debut. It's been a while since we got a #1 debut. Meanwhile, Shawn Mendes couldn't top this chart but at least he still has two consecutive debuts at the top 3, with 'Lost in Japan' and 'In My Blood' at #2 and #3 respectively.

After two weeks at the top, Taylor Swift's 'Delicate' goes down at #4. Two of the songs from Panic! at the Disco at the top ten after their debut last week, with 'Say Amen (Saturday Night)' and '(Fuck A) Sliver Lining' charting at #4 and #7 respectively on their second week.

Our lovely mod Janelle Monáe still got it as 'Make Me Feel' charts at #6 on its fifth week. 'Done For Me', the Charlie Puth x Kehlani collab goes down at #8. Hayley Kiyoko's 'Curious' has reached a new peak at #9 after charting in the Hot 50 for 11 weeks. Lastly, the EDM trio collab of Zedd, Maren Morris and Grey which is 'The Middle' is at the bottom of the top ten. Will it see itself way out of the top ten next week?

Post Malone makes a return to the chart with 'Psycho' re-entering at #23 thanks to the release of the music video of the song, making it the highest re-entry of the week. One of Kim Petras' songs reaches a new peak as 'I Don't Want It All' charts at #16, making it this week's biggest gain. Lastly, Troye Sivan's 'Strawberries &amp; Cigarettes' is this week's biggest decline, losing 40 spots to #47.

* **Highest Debut:** #1. Kacey Musgraves - High Horse
* **Highest Re-Entry:** #23. Post Malone - Psycho (feat. Ty Dolla $ign)
* **Biggest Gain:** #16. Kim Petras - I Don't Want It At All (+23)
* **Biggest Decline:** #47. Troye Sivan - Strawberries &amp; Cigarettes (-40)

##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs

With the approach of the release of Kacey Musgraves' new album, two of the songs from *Golden Hour* re-enter the Hot 50. Butterflies and Space Cowboy re-entering at #28 and #36.

One of Lorde's older songs from *Pure Heroine', 'Ribs' re-enters the Hot 50 and reached a new peak at #33. Apparently, 21 listeners are having a bit of a meltdown about growing up.

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

The catch- so the program as you know is about 51/2 months old and I want to work in the US for atleast a year or two , that being said I'll have to look for an employer to sponsor my work visa (which could be difficult) on their other side if I take courses with are longer like 12 months (UCSD, Auburn ) I could be eligible for OPT ( optional practical training ) after which I can work for 2 years in the states. 
Also these new courses have business of brewing in their  curriculum, so how helpful will it be?
This is a big step in my life as moving from a different country is also very expensive and I've got only one shot at this so I want to know if this is the right one also it is difficult to turn down UC Davis at the same time

I hate my current job and am trying to relocate to a new state and find a new job there. There are a handful of other people at my current job who are also looking for new positions so I've thankfully had a few people to talk to about the whole process. I've been really grateful for that because my current position was my first job out of undergrad and I was offered it because of a previous internship so I haven't really ever done the whole job search thing.

However, the biggest difference I've noticed is just how much more comfortable they all feel with their situations. Like they all have family members who would let them live rent-free or even provide financial support if needed during the transition period. Hell most of them have MULTIPLE family members who would do so.

Meanwhile I'm over here with maybe just barely enough money saved up to actually make this work and MAYBE about a month's worth of savings for if shit hit the fan and I had to quit before finding something new. Like I'm used to needing to support myself by now but it is just so depressing knowing I have to make myself keep coming to this job and can't afford to just quit it and focus on finding the next thing. Not that I would necessarily, just that I'm bitter its not even an option. 

I don't have a single person I could ask for more than maybe about $100. Having just a few thousand extra would make me feel so much more secure so I've considered (briefly) trying to set up some kind of GoFundMe or something. But also I know I'm better off than others because I do have this job and I feel like that means I'm well enough off that I should be donating to fundraisers to help people not creating one myself.

Edit to clarify that I'm not looking for help or pity or advice. I mostly just wanted to vent."

89hv2d,10,2018-04-03,How many patients do you normally pick up as an M3? [clinical],28-3_lol,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/89hv2d/how_many_patients_do_you_normally_pick_up_as_an/,"So I just finished my inpatient adult IM rotation, and one of the things to improve on in my eval was “work on picking up more patients.” Our service was very busy, with 20 patients and 3 med students. We basically acted as the intern for the patient, pre rounding, presenting, following up in afternoon, doing H&amp;P’s, daily progress notes etc, which was great. The other students all took 3 patients, so that was the patient load I carried. I could have done more, as I move pretty fast and like to push myself, but when I talked to them they didn’t want to take on more than 3, and I didn’t want to be a dick and make them look bad by taking more, so I stuck with three, and ended up getting dinged in my eval for it. 

Is 3 patients pretty standard for an M3 to take? I thought 4 or 5 would be pretty tough, but doable, but most services I’m on it seems like they never expect you to have more than 3.  Also, if you can take on more patients but the other students don’t want to, are you being a douchebag by carrying more patients than them?"

How Tycho lost his job as Dreamer.


Endless water stretched onto the horizon on all sides. The sky was clear and the ocean still. From the distance a red mist appeared out of thin air and rushed towards him over the ocean, pulling a volley of waves with it. 


“You can skip this part”, the man heard echoing from somewhere out of this world. He fast forwarded through water shooting up and merging in and out of different shapes, people and faces. He resumed as the ocean returned to its tranquil state with the mist engulfing it.


A wooden raft drifted past in the mist. On it, two people without faces rowed as if their life depended on it. The waves grew from foot-high ripples to one story high walls of water. As one of those collided with the raft, the color of the wave and the ocean around it turned an unreal shade of dark blue. It dispersed and drained over the people and the raft. As the water flowed away, details emerged from the scene. A small rudder became visible. A net full of freshly caught fish appeared from a blur on the raft’s deck. The unblinking eyes gazed upward. Blood flowed out of the top one. The faceless people screamed, but the sound was muted by the rushing of the waves and the wind that now blew the mist all around them. A lightning bolt struck and illuminated the whirling mist around the scene.  
The sailors recovered and braced themselves for the next hit. The wave slammed into them, but they held on tight enough to keep their footing. The raft carried them through wave after wave, until the turbulent ocean eventually subsided into a calm tide. The mist retracted as if backing away from a terrible danger. The men on deck slowly unfroze from their cautious stances as sunlight hit the water surface. They sat down and the helmsman took a canteen of something out of his ragged trousers. He put it to his mouth and began to sing in a foreign, unplaceable language. The other two joined in for the chorus, as they heaved on the deck. Somehow, the songs of the sailors echoed over the ominously still water. They sang lighthearted songs, but the expression of the helmsman turned sour. He kept on singing as if his mouth was controlled by something else than the rest of him, filled with horror. 


In front of the raft, ripples appeared. They rose, sunk and grew. From the crest emerged a thick volumetric shadow. Two of the sailors turned to the back and saw a similar thing emerge from on the raft’s hind side. The two pointy objects ascended until the whole raft was covered its shadow. With a burst, the objects being the beak of a giant killer-whale emerged out of the water with its beak around the raft. The beast had no clear outlines as if it was an opaque shadow cast in mid-air. Only the eyes lit up, in fluorescent yellow. As it landed with a thundering splash, the raft was gone. 

“This is what you have worked on for the entire weekend?” a man said as he took off small VR glasses. 
Tycho looked at the man with a raised eyebrow. 

“Did you make me come here to tell me that? You could’ve sent me the message over link.”

The man stood up and pulled his suit tight. He ran his hand over his waxed hair with care. 

“Tycho, we took you in based on some widely applicable experiences. What you have here is a decent high school project. We will have to lower your rating if this is what you’ll supply us with.”


Tycho took a step back and threw his hands up in defense. “No, Emmet”, he said, “You don’t understand. This experience has a deeper meaning that might score well with the Hivemind critics. You just need to roll it out a bit wider. It can have a broad appeal if we just market it right.” 


“I ran it through the system in advance and it states that this production will appeal to 3 percent of the population. If we launch this, your approval rating will drop, you can bet on that”, he said, pointing his index finger into the table. “You can do so much better, Tycho. I don’t even get the message you are trying to convey with this two-minute experience... Don’t trust calm waters?”


“You see, it is a metaphor for the easy way we-”


“I don’t want to hear it, Tycho. I will let this one slip, on the condition that you show killer experience at the conference tomorrow. We need something tangible, you know? Not this metaphorical bullshit. It doesn’t resonate with the audience.”


“I don’t know how I can ever repay you for letting it slip”, Tycho sarcastically remarked, “Why did you even want me to come here? We could've held this meeting in VR or not at all. You could've mailed. No… I know… you just want to extort your dominance as a producer.” Tycho stepped backwards to the door and said: “I will let this one slip, Smiley.”


He reversed out of the office while making quick, sarcastic, praying movements. The slick suited man remained alone at his desk. The door slid shut. “Fuck this fucking shit!” Tycho spat. A woman that passed through the hallway and had been intimately focussed on her phone conversation, twitched her hands up in shock of Tycho’s words. She passed with quick steps, looking at Tycho distrustfully. He followed after her but kept a slower pace as to avoid more awkwardness. The floor his feet tapped on had shades and patterns like a plateau of resin. It reflected Tycho and the oak ceiling perpendicular to the bamboo walls. He exit through a ponderous wooden door and emerged onto a sunlit street enclosed by artistic office buildings on either side. Tycho crossed the street away from any crosswalk and without looking. An autonomous car gently came to a halt, letting Tycho continue his path. The occupant of the car threw his hand forward in disgust swearing within the vacuum of the car. 


Tycho wore a long, mustard coat, open and with the belt hanging at his hips. His black turtleneck stood atop grey flannel trousers. Most apparent was the black ring around his head, called a Mindring. The sides of the Mindring were supported by earpieces and the circle was gapped in front of his left eye. The part in front of his right eye sported a paper thin translucent display. The Mindring came in a different version that worked with contacts, but Tycho didn’t like to hassle with those. He had never even worn regular contacts since his myopia was painlessly taken care of in his childhood.


As he passed the colorful storefronts, he scrolled through his contact list. His friend, Regina, seemed to have the afternoon off and was free the next day. He flicked his fingers, confirming the thought of calling her.

“Regina here, what’s up?”

“Hey Regina, I just walked out of that review meeting. Guess what.”

“What?”

“I got fucking roasted. Can I come by and hang out for a bit?”

“Sure, give me half an hour. I need to finish up here with an article on the tensions with the Hivemind. Some wackos blame it for everything. From their leveled income to their friends psychological well being.”

“Damn, and what do they blame their basic income and lenient work-hours on?”

“They say they don’t give a flying fuck about that. Wait until it disappears.”

“Damn right”, Tycho said, as he got off the sidewalk and stepped through a door automatically folding away for him like a man-sized origami sheet. Inside was a cafe that looked more like something from the 16th century than anything from 2075. 

The clerk stood with his back towards him in a tight black blazer over a white shirt. The massive wooden counter was littered with free cookie samples and stacks of artsy mugs. Tycho took a cup of coffee from the clerk without ordering. His Mindring had ordered it for him, having combined his thought of drinking coffee with his location and his earlier preferences. He made saw a vague acquaintance of his checking out a painting while sipping her coffee. She enthusiastically turned Tycho’s way as he vocally thanked the cashier. 

Tycho didn’t really enjoy the superficial talk about the girl’s internship, but she seemed content, pouring her monologue over Tycho. He needed to kill some time anyway, he thought.

“... so nice right?” she ended her sentence with. Tycho absently nodded, giving her his ‘not-bad’ face. He wondered if she saw that he wasn’t looking at her, but at an augmented reality artifact he was shaping in front of her face. From his point of view, a sphere floated in front of her head. It morphed outwards, moving as being kneaded by invisible hands. Tycho rotated and mentally chiseled away at the floating artifact while the girl talked like thirsty men drink. The object floating in front of him in AR took the shape of a face. As it became more detailed, he threw his head to the side to delete it. The girl stopped mid-sentence and waved her hand in his face. “Are you even listening? Pff, I’m wasting my time with you.”

He walked outside in the direction of the park, coffee in hand. 

The colorful storefronts and fashionable pedestrians blurred as Tycho summoned a circular plateau on which the ocean-scene appeared, downsized to the size of a tabletop floating in front of him. Everything in the scene was paused. The raft and the people on it stood perpendicular to the ground, pushed by a wall of a wave. Tycho raised a hill from the inanimate water. On the newly formed island, he crafted houses and motionless people to occupy them. He zoomed in one of the summoned characters. Now, the plateau showed a 3d image of one man. He panned the angle to get a view on his face, but on seeing it, Tycho jumped, subsequently bumping into a commercial signboard. 


The whole AR setup vanished as Tycho hunched towards his crotch in pain. A second shock hit him when he felt hot coffee burn his privates. He sighed, seeing a large brown stain on his grey flannel trousers. Looking down, he saw an AR ad, hovering slightly in front of the signboard. 


“Feeling down? Take some time off the grid with tech-free meditation weekends.” The ad showed a meditating man from which technology seemed to evaporate with a subtle animation. The background consisted of a sunset beach scene, the sun hidden exactly behind the meditating man’s head. As he looked at it, an overlay appeared, saying: ‘Interested? Yes/No’


Tycho shook his head and buttoned down his coat to hide the stain. He entered the park, passing through a pompous brass gate. The gravel path he followed guided him through a variance of exotic trees and colorful plants. A child tried to climb a palm tree while his little brother watched him with one hand squeezing his father’s and the other to his face, with the thumb in his mouth. The climbing boy dropped down as he was distracted from his task by a soft-tissue robot, scurrying back and forth between plants. It disappeared in the underbrush. A second later, a mechanical arm belonging to the robot rose above the bushes. It carefully sprayed resin on where a branch of a birch tree had been broken.


Finishing the last of his coffee, Tycho booted up the design program again. After a second long booting icon, the program had started. Tycho mentally dragged a menu down and selected a copy tool. He focussed on a palm tree he passed and analyzed it thoroughly. A loading icon appeared above the palm tree. As the load-icon disappeared with a ‘pling’, second palm-tree seemed to morph out of the first, in the way a cell clones itself. Tycho mentally dragged the copy of the tree to a folder for later use. He threw his coffee carton on the path and kneeled next to a man, sitting on a park bench with his eyes closed. Tycho positioned his face to the left of the man and slowly panned around him. Passersby looked at him disapprovingly. ‘Pling’, it sounded as Tycho completed a full circle around the man. His body doubled in the same cell-split manner as the palm tree had done. Tycho stood up, while in the background, the small robot skittered towards the coffee carton to clean it up.


Tycho rotated, stretched and repositioned the copy of the man in front of him. With a flick of his finger, the man’s digital copy seemed to come alive, walking with Tycho over the gravel path. To Tycho’s surprise, this copy seemed to vibrate in his step as he walked away from his physical self- still snoring on the park bench. No matter what he thought, Tycho couldn’t get the twitch out of the copy’s step. He squeezed his eyes shut, seeing nothing but the red glow of sunlight coming through eyelids. He let out a deep sigh and opened his eyes again. In front of him was just the gravel path. The man seemed to have disappeared. Then an unexpectedly warm air current passed his neck. Tycho felt like a hundred ants scurried up his backbone.


The summoned copy of the man floated next to him- gazed into him, but when Tycho turned towards him, the face was the one he remembered from the man- it was someone much more recognizable and much more frightening. He wildly shook his head, removing the simulation from his augmented workspace. The flora and park visitors around him took no notice from what had transpired and kept to their programming. Downstruck, Tycho stepped into an autonomous vehicle parked at the exit. 

                       
“Set route to ‘Regina’”, the board computer told him, informed by the Hivemind organic appointment he made speaking to Regina. He flicked his finger and the car merged into traffic. In the relative privacy of the car’s interior, Tycho took off his Mindring. Relief washed over him like a wave. Constantly having something read your thoughts can be tiring. He leaned back and gazed at the surrounding traffic. The cars that rode along with him were occupied by casually dressed people that, all occupied either by their wrist phone or some other device, like the one Tycho owned. This life was not exactly what he had wished for, but it allowed him to make use of his creativity. The thoughts criticizing the digitalization of human acts and communication were always muted by his realization that he thanked his fame to the technology. Tycho was a man of ideas, not one of acts. The Mindring allowed him to create tangible things, just by thinking.

 
The autonomous car drove up a black ramp, into a cluster of high-rises and stopped at a sidewalk on the 20th floor. Tycho got out and took in his new surroundings for a second. The autonomous car drove away over the elevated road, winding between skyscrapers until they veiled the car and its reflection that waved away with it on the black glass windows. Regina lived in this rich, elevated part of the city. All of the roads and sidewalks were pitch-black, occasionally decorated with bright-green bushes in bright planters. Tubes ran alongside the roads to be used as transport for small objects and trash One might forget that he was twenty stories high, were it not for the low clouds. On closer inspection, the reflective roads and sidewalks revealed their function as one-way mirrors. They allowed sunlight to reach the lower, poorer levels.


“You want some tea?” Regina asked as Tycho stepped into her unorganized apartment. It was contrasted strongly with the sterile outdoors environment of her flat. Tea flicked his finger, sending her a confirm-gesture. 
“You okay, Tycho?” She asked him from her place on the stained couch. She sat facing the floor-to-ceiling window in a room littered with records and boxes filled with records. A bong stood pontifically on the coffee table, surrounded by coffee stains and a half-empty beer bottle. This 


Through the window, the other side of the elevated, black reflective road could be seen. There was movement across the street in a couple of dedicated farm-floors. Regina followed a cart that drove itself around rows of potters from which green bushes protruded. Tycho threw his coat over the couch and made his way to her studio kitchen. 

“What are you doing?” Regina asked.

“Cleaning my balls” Tycho cynically remarked.

“What?”

“I threw coffee over my crotch as if the day wasn’t bad enough yet.”

“Did you come over to use me as your personal verbal vomit dumpster or are you going to entertain me?”

Tycho jumped in front of her with his legs wide, gesturing comically to his wet crotch area. When a crooked smile showed up on Regina’s face, Tycho threw himself on the couch next to her.

“Don’t you need to prepare your show for tomorrow?” She asked.

“It’s not a show and I’m not going to.”

“You sound like a stubborn teen.”

“I’m fucked.”

“How so?”

“I can’t go lucid anymore. I lost my touch.”

“What do you mean?”

“When I dream now, I can’t take the reigns. The last productions I made are just unedited figments of my dreams. I used to be able to craft what I wanted. My thoughts would be perfectly understood by this thing”, he said, gesturing to his Mindring. “Now I can’t even control in what kind of environment I am. My dreams take place at sea and I can not imagine anything else.”

“Is it because of her? Still?”

Tycho looked down in silence. Regina eyed him but resisted to break the silence. After what seemed like an eternity, Tycho opened his mouth again: “...I just can’t control where my mind goes as I could before.”

“It’s been a year, Tycho. Get your shit together. Don’t waste time complaining about it and design an experience that blows the audience’s mind tomorrow.”

Tycho took a grinder off the table and started to prepare a joint. “Stop talking about work, please. I came to you to take my mind off of it.”

“I don’t want to contribute to your public demise, man.”

“That’s a choice I made when coming here. You won’t change my mind.”

Regina sighed. “We climbed to the top together… I want you to know that it hurts me to see you bring down everything you’ve built up.”

“Saying that only depresses me more… Don’t add that guilt to my problem-pile. It’s going to tumble if you do.”
There was a long silence as Tycho closed the joint.

At the moment Tycho lit it, Regina said: “Maybe you should take a break for a while. You know I am not one to easily suggest laying off work, but you could at least try something else.”

Tycho took a deep breath passed the joint before he answered. “I’ve got nothing else. This is all I have done, which is why I am - I was - so good at it.”

Regina folded her uncovered legs and twisted her ankle in thought, rotating the dirty-white sneaker.
“The first step is to let go of the stubborn negativity”, she said as she passed the joint back. Tycho took a thoughtful tug and Regina stepped to the record player standing where the room’s wall met the perpendicular glass. The evening sun now peaked into the room, casting Regina and the littered carpet into an orange glow. As the needle hit the record player, a soft static filled the room. The walls of Regina’s studio vibrated ever so slightly, acting like giant speakers. Slow and steady as the tide, the first notes of ‘Shine On You Crazy Diamond’ ebbed into the room. Regina waded back to the couch, holding her finger up as if to say ‘wait for it’. When the drums came in, she passionately slammed her imaginary drum set.

“You know,” Tycho said, “we can sync that to real drums with your Mindring.”

“Shhhh”, Regina insisted as she dropped to the couch, “relax”.

She put her finger on Tycho’s mouth and looked at him earnestly. Tycho couldn’t help but laugh as her serious expression faded into a mischievous smile. Though she had the ability to lead a media-business, Regina lacked the skill to hide secrets. 

“What is it?” Tycho laughed, pushing her finger away to take a hit from the joint.

Regina opened the drawer of the coffee table. “I got something awesome”, she said. “This stuff just became legal this week. The psychology databases are so comprehensive that they can pre-calculate who reacts badly on which drugs. If you have a real chance of going bad, it will not dispense for you.”


She took a tiny translucent box out of the drawer. A small straw protruded from one side. “What does it do exactly?” Tycho asked. Regina took a yellow Mindring from between the litter on the table and swiped some crumbs off of it. “You can see for yourself”, she said, clicking the earpieces of the Mindring in her ears. Her Mindring was complete, covering her two eyes with a tiny, slick, VR display. She cracked her neck left and right. The wall of windows turned opaque black, veiling the high-rise-farm behind it. Regina made a light flick with her wrist and turned the black wall into a giant screen with a tiny white circle in the middle. Tycho sunk back deeper in the couch. Images cycled rapidly over the wall until they finally settled on a giant representation of Tycho, naked.

“What the fuck Regina?”

Regina had her eyes closed and laughed out loud. “Ok. It’s synced”, she said. The screen on the wall now showed a blurry version of the coffee table with only the translucent box being slightly in focus. Regina took the translucent box to her mouth and inhaled deep via the straw. Tycho saw the vapor coming out of her nose, being lit by the shifting colors on the giant screen. Regina closed her eyes. The screen faded into black and from the middle, a red glow emerged. It seemed to grow and shrink on the rhythm of Pink Floyd. Patterns became more visible with each wave of notes until finally, a representation of the milky-way appeared. The view zoomed in faster than the laws of physics would allow. Stars became distinguishable. One of them rushed into view with the accompanying roar. If Tycho wouldn’t know better, he would have thought he was in some spaceship, speeding around the surface of a distant sun. He looked to his side where Regina sat, eyes closed and with a big smirk on her face. The view shot away from the sun again, accelerating to the infinite until it showed a tunnel of rotating colors. As Regina’s mind worked on, the room was cast in a glow that raced past every possible color. In the middle of the screen, a face unfolded out of a tiny ball. For an instant, it had perfect proportions, before the mouth tore open and stretched the head back where it folded into nothingness. 


“Let me join in”, Tycho asked her as he sent a request via his link. On screen, the words: ‘Tycho requests a party invite’ appeared. The letters became squiggly and vague until Regina opened her eyes again. “Sure”, she said and gave Tycho the translucent box. 


Tycho took a tug from the straw. “Nothing is releasing”, he stated. “Try again”, Regina said, looking attentively at his method. He did. 


“I’m getting a popup that I’m unfit to use this drug.”


“Are you fucking kidding me?” Regina said, taking the box into her hand. The ten minutes lasting drug was settling in on her. “Wait”, She remarked as if she had just remembered her grocery shopping list. “I think I know a way.” She grinned. Meanwhile, Tycho booted up an older experience on the screen, where they both were linked to. Tycho mentally navigated menu screens and suddenly a cityscape appeared. Exactly like the city they were in, but from a bird’s view. A literal bird.


To his shock, Regina’s mouth was suddenly on his. Before he could even sense the soft lips that touched his, he felt her exhaling into his mouth. He inhaled and Regina moved back, with that mischievous smile of her. A wave of ecstasy engulfed Tycho as he heard the distorted cry of a bird.


They leaned into each other, both looking at the screen where a giant gull flew past. “Let me try something”, Regina said, and the gull on screen morphed into a lion. It majestically hung in the air for a second before tumbling to earth. “Oh my god”, she exclaimed, still with her eyes closed. The view on screen tilted downwards, where the lion was spinning towards the busy street below. Out of the blue, a hot air balloon appeared over where the lion was. 

“Hah, good work”, Tycho laughed as she zoomed in on the lion, leaning its paws on the edge of the straw basket that hung from the balloon. Over the skyline, black dots appeared. Many more popped in, gaining form the closer they were. Each of them was a lion, falling to its doom. “Nonono!” Regina exclaimed, opening her eyes in shock. The screen suddenly showed a smaller version of the cityscape with raining lions and within that another smaller screen. It created a tunnel of screens comparable to the effect of oppositely placed mirrors.


Regina spent the rest of the night taking hits from the mysterious box and romantically passing them to Tycho, who was ecstatically exploring one dreamscape after another. They ate junk food in their breaks and tried every position on the couch as the complete Pink Floyd discography flowed past.


When Regina turned off the giant screen, they were shocked to find out the sun had already risen past the horizon. Since the floor-to-ceiling windows doubled as an opaque screen, the two had been separated from any sense of time for the entire night. Regina quickly turned the windows black again.


“I’m going to ace that conference”, Tycho said as he dug himself out of the couch. 

Regina looked at him confused. On seeing that, he explained himself: “I think, tonight has taught me how to create again.”

“Aren’t you tired?” Regina asked.

“Hell yeah, but I will medicate that.”

“If you say so...” she said, nodding before getting off the couch. 


Conference


Everything now by Arcade Fire reached the backstage area, mixed with the murmur of the crowd. Tycho stumbled up the stairs. Orange neon lights, outfitted under each step, flashed purple on impact with his foot, emphasizing his every clunky step. There were only six of them in the stairs, but Tycho managed to make it look like he was scaling a mountain of skippy balls.


“Where the fuck were you- get on that stage and blow the remaining audience away! ” a man in the audience called out.


A rare mix of applause and boo’s welcomed Tycho on the stage. Two attendees that were on their way out, returned to their seats. Reaching the spotlight and seeing the childlike expectancy on the front row’s faces, replaced Tycho’s nervosity with excitement. “Welcome to the garden of creation!” He vocalized through the auditorium with his arms reaching for the ceiling. He had been half an hour too late but was already proud of himself having managed to get there at all. 


He started striding back and forth across the stage, the spotlight following him. “Excuse me for my lenient schedule, people.” Some laughs came from the audience and they almost drowned the couple of insults that were thrown Tycho’s way. “Since I am a little late, I’ll get right to the good stuff.” The giant wall behind Tycho lit up and appeared to be a large screen. ‘Please put on your Mindrings’ the screen said. Most of the people already wore the same Mindring as Tycho, in different colors and varying from one covered eye to two VR glasses. Tycho booted up a program. “First, say, we want to get rid of this cold black flooring. Let’s turn it into grass. Imagine the picture first, it will create the groundwork... as you can see.” Tycho raised his hands and with that, grass rose through the black flooring. “You continue by imagining more properties to the grass. For instance, you can imagine the effect of the wind.” The grass suddenly unfroze and heaved on a non-existent breeze. “For those with the nerve implant, we can simulate the texture and the way it feels. You touch the grass and its imagined texture and reaction will be automatically coded in. The job for a designer is to imagine its every facet.” 

As he said this, he stroked the grass and dropped down into it. The audience murmured until one girl ruse from the murmur with a statement: “We don’t see anything.”

Tycho was stroking the grass with his fingers and looked up surprised. “Anyone else not getting the feed?” he asked from his meditative position. Hands raised everywhere in the audience. ‘Fuck’ Tycho thought, ‘I forgot to connect’.

“Aha, some technical error, but don’t worry, I can fix this.”

He navigated through a menu in his Mindring, subsequently, an applause rolled through the auditorium. Tycho stood up and went on. “Let’s pretend that didn’t happen. Now you see this grass, you might think: what else can you or I create? Say we want to create living, breathing things. It requires a bit more imagination. Let’s test it out and get something to live in our patch of grass.

”A horse” some chubby guy called out from the audience.

“Did I hear a lion-dragon?” Tycho jokingly responded. “That’s a good idea! Let’s digg it from the grass here, and just realize: you only have to imagine that which we will see in action.”

Tycho raised his hands, snapping his fingers and at that moment, out of the augmented-reality grass, a mustard-colored reptile snout appeared. It ascended further until manes became visible around its ears.

The whole lion-dragon rose from the augmented grass, pushing up dirt and roots in the progress. The audience roared in enthusiasm, as the augmented reality lion-dragon was now visible to anyone in the auditorium with a Mindring. Tycho gently moved his hands to the audience, seemingly performing Tai-Chi. The lion-dragon followed his every motion without looking. It towered above the first row and spewed fire from left to right, sending some of the audience in shock. Yelps and screams echoed through the auditorium. The audience away from the stage laughed at the scene. Tycho noticed it and seconds later triggered a thundering rumble by flicking his finger. Six giant boulders rolled down from the back of the auditorium to the front, unifying the crowd in their hysteria. From their perspective, their neighbors were squished to pink and red pulp as the boulders slammed down the rows. Panic raged through the audience. A woman threw off her Mindring while her neighbor laughed nervously. The boulders rolled on, smashing row after row. A tough looking guy took his Mindring off with shaking hands, breaking the illusion for himself. He crab-walked past other visitors and slipped out of the building. Just before the boulders reached the bottom row, where the lion-dragon roared, Tycho shook his head, making all augmented assets: the grass, the lion-dragon, the boulders and the ravage they created disappear in an instant.


Some guy on the front row stood and protruded his chest as if ready for a fight. “That’s great, man, just great”, he shouted, “You scared the shit out of my wife. She’s pregnant for fucks sake!” The seat where his wife supposedly had been was empty. Tycho bowed over him from the stage and hissed: “Don’t take your pregnant wife to an augmented reality exhibition. Especially so when she is afraid of dragons.” He tried to keep the conversation between the two, but Tycho’s voice blasting through speakers around the auditorium made sure to involve every present soul. A short, tense silence followed as Tycho backed up from the man.

He coughed. “So, to get on with the lecture, we will now all start our individual projects. Open a private AR scene. We’re all going to recreate the creature I made at scale. I will give you five minutes to design a setup. For help, use your personal assistant.”


Tycho hurried off stage as the spotlight dimmed and lights brightened the audience. Tycho walked away from the murmuring audience to the cluttered backstage area.

“I’m out. I can’t do it. Emmet, let someone else take it from here.”

The slick man that had degraded his creation the day before put on a psychopathic smile. “Tycho. You are kidding me, right?” He grabbed Tycho by the collar before he could walk away. “You can not walk away from this responsibility. Get back up there.”

“I am sick and need to throw up. Take it from me.”

Meanwhile a suited man wandered on stage and got ready at the stand. Tycho pointed at him. “He can take over. I’m out.”

“Stop feeling sorry for yourself, you pathetic shit. You will get back there or you will lose your job and the speck of reputation you have left.”

“I don’t fucking care.”

“There are kids in there that look up to you. There are women that adore you. Do you want to throw that all away ‘cause you can’t fucking give a lecture while a bit dazed?”

Tycho was aware that Emmet knew what he did last night from his live-file, the one that most employers have of their employees. The murmur from the audience turned sour. Tycho took a deep breath and walked back on the stage. The suited man left the stand.


The murmur subsided. “Alright,“ he said while squinting in the spotlight. “Who’s got the lion-dragon somewhat like mine?”

A tenth of the audience raised their hands. 

“Good. Now I will bring you the experience I have designed especially for you, the one that you came for.”

A tentative applause was given. Faces looked from the darkness with expectancy at Tycho. He sat in a blue lounge chair. As he descended in it, the chair moved its parts to perfectly support Tycho. He closed his eyes and focussed. From up close, his irises were visibly shooting in all directions below his eyelids. The screen behind Tycho turned a soft orange, and all other light dimmed. Through their Mindring lenses, everyone saw the same thing. The floor blurred and turned grey. Waves started rolling over the stage until the complete ground level was covered with rough water as if a portal to the Pacific had been opened.

Tycho’s voice echoed through everyone’s earpieces now. “Your AR should now have completely put you in the middle of an ocean, stretching to infinity.”

The audience heard the waves crash, the wind rage and in the background, a soft static emerge. The static became louder as they reached the raft with the faceless people. The waves rose and the mist pulled in. Exited yelps echoed through the audience. The static took on an ominous tone that became louder and louder until the last wall of a wave crashed into the raft. As the ocean subsided, the seafarers signaled out their relief. The audience was now dead silent. One of the seafarers jumped in excitement. In front of them was a tiny island, containing a couple of trees. They started chipping away at them, Tycho mentally took the view of the audience to next to the tree that was being chopped with a giant, rusty axe. A scream came from a spectator. Some subdued laughing followed. The seafarers took the wood to their raft and rapidly built a boat out of it. Tycho made the view of the audience follow it away from the island. The ocean was placid and the mist thinned out. The frontman on the boat jumped again as he saw another island. This one lacked trees, was about the same size, but made of rock. They were still a kilometer separated from it, and something was rumbling underneath their boat. They paddled as fast as they could with their newly made paddles. While they lacked a face to express themselves with, the seafarers pantomimed their panic. A shadowy fin rose through the water. The sheer size of it poking through the water, created waves, rocking the boat. An even bigger back emerged from the water, pushing the back of the boat up. The ominous static had returned, louder than ever. The blurred shadow of an immense killer whale rose up behind them. They were now almost at the coast. The shadow animal opened its mouth and sped up, racing behind them, leaving a trail of black foam. In the nick of time, the seafarers reached the island, leaving the animal partially on the shore, clattering its teeth. They used pickaxes to rapidly collect loads of iron from the island. They melted it in a quickly assembled furnace and hammered it into parts for the boat, weapons and armor. The sun came up and went down three times in a minute. It stopped and the faceless people, armored to the teeth, stepped into their reinforced boat. They continued on the ocean and the frontman made his jump. The next island had trees on which thousands of vines stuck. They used the rope, wood and metal to make and attach two harpoons on the boat. They moved gently across the placid waters and didn’t see any land for days. Finally, the water started to bubble below the boat. The napping crewmembers immediately jumped up in their place.Two of them manned the harpoons. The unsettling static returned.


The shadow whale jumped out of the water, right next to the boat and tilted sideways to hit the boat. The helmsman was fast and dragged the boat into an evasive maneuver. The shadow whale towered above them and subsequently smashed the water surface. The harpoon men were fast and determined. They similarly pulled the trigger and sent the metal arrows flying, followed by the waving rope. The arrows connected to the beast and stayed inside the blurry shadow. The seafarers cheered as the whale swam away, sending them on their way in double the speed. One of them cried of relief while another one stared into the distance with clenched fists. Their celebration was short lived as they noticed the whale was descending. Its back disappeared in the rippled water and only its fin remained, cutting through the water like a razor through meat until even that sank in the grey, ominous water. The crew attempted to cut off the harpoons, but they had attached them too tight. The whale made a loud underwater roar and disappeared into the darkness that matched its shade. It dragged the harpoons, the boat and the crew with it. They attempted to swim up, to surface, but their armor dragged them down until the last faceless man disappeared in the dark. The scenery disappeared and to the audience, the auditorium appeared again. Lee opened his eyes and saw the crowd look around dazed as if they had awoken in a strange place. One lady started clapping and more followed until a rumbling applause filled the building. 


Tycho stood up and made a bow, which sent the audience into an increased clapping frenzy.
“Now for those of you who thought this was a pre-rendered simulation. It was not. I created this real-time”
The applause increased.


""So, any questions?"" Tycho asked with open hands to the audience.

Like I said in the title, I'm trying to find housing near AIG here in Atlanta (1200 Abernathy Road). I have an internship lined up there for this summer but they don't provide housing. I just submitted a form that should connect me to some of the other interns and hopefully, I can room with one of them, but in the event that doesn't work out, I'm going to need to find other options. I know that several colleges offer summer housing to interns, but I'm hoping to find something cheaper and closer to the location.

Basically, does anyone know of any good websites, apps, etc. that they've had success with that may help me here? I've tried looking through Craigslist but so far I haven't had any luck.

Thank you for your help!"

I have received a scholarship to get my net cost down to 36k, assuming I don’t get anymore aid, would the cs program at NYU justify the debt i would go into? If not, what’s the max amount I should consider paying yearly?Is it any easier to get an internship because of the location and name? Thank you for your help "

89l57j,161,2018-04-03,My boyfriend [21M] came out to me [20F] after 3 years together,florisona,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/89l57j/my_boyfriend_21m_came_out_to_me_20f_after_3_years/,"I'm having the worst year of my life. I recently moved up to NYC alone for an internship, and the night before I left, my boyfriend of three years told me that he's gay. He's currently living in Philadelphia, so learning this right before being so far away from him didn't help at all.

I was in complete shock at first, especially because we made a home together, had a routine and created traditions. I opened up to him in a way that I've never opened up before...and he's always stuck by my side through the good and bad. We were so close that we could practically read each other's minds and had little mannerisms / actions that we would do that allowed us to communicate in a way without even talking.

I am so extremely mad and heartbroken because it wasn't fair of him to validate my feelings, have me meet his family, and bring up the future constantly when he fully knew about his sexuality. At this point, I'm integrated into his family so much so that I have an active group chat with them that he's not even in. I love them like my own.

I have no idea what to do and I feel absolutely depressed, hopeless, and unmotivated. I can't even focus at work, and talking to therapists / friends hasn't helped much. I can't even walk into my apartment without crying because everything reminds me of him - from the mugs we drank tea out of together to the comforter we cuddled under every night. He was so sweet to me and literally treated me like no one else ever has...I'm not going to find that again.

I still talk to him currently because we're so close. He says that I'm still his best friend and that we'll still be together forever, spending our lives side by side. I'm so confused and hurt, I feel like my whole world was slipped out from under my feet. He also said that while he's a completely submissive gay (he used to be dominant in our relationship), he is still attracted to me and will kiss / cuddle me all the time. What does that even mean?

Also as I talk to him more, he's being more himself and I'm realizing that I have more in common with him than I did in our relationship. It's scaring me because I feel like I'm talking to 2 people....one being my new best friend, and the other being the guy I fell so hopelessly in love with and am currently losing.

Don't get me wrong...I'm happy that he can be himself now, but I feel like absolute death and I want to die. Please, please help.

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend of 3 years who validated my feelings and constantly spoke about our future came out to me the night before I left for an internship in another state"
89lm8o,7,2018-04-03,As a 21 yr-old Auto tech I am questioning what my next move should be.,Passwithclass,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/89lm8o/as_a_21_yrold_auto_tech_i_am_questioning_what_my/,"Here's some background:
I worked an internship for two weeks as a part of a Vocational program in high school. After high school i worked for that shop for another two years as i earned my Associates degree in automotive science/repair. I knew staying at that business was a dead end because i was working with the owners son and there was no way i would surpass him. After finishing the degree i ended up working for a European repair place that ended up being a flop of a job and i got fired because they were too small of a business(they had only been open for two years) to be able to help a newer technician like myself really learn and advance. I  very quickly found myself working at a classic car restoration shop and was shadowing a few technicians as they did their work. Sadly this job didn't respect any of my education or past experience and wouldn't let me touch a single mechanical thing. I ended up being their cleanup boy and swept floors. I hit a point where i was cleaning my bosses truck(which should never be something an employee does) that he and i got in an argument. After said argument I asked the true owner of the business if i could work at their body shop instead. I Made my own commute a half hour longer Just to be away from that man and started learning how to weld and do light body work for maybe two months. At least now i was learning something and watching progress on vehicles but it wasn't what i had wanted to do and at that point i hadn't touched my tools for three months. I had already written my letter of resignation and was about to hand it in when they pulled me into the office and asked me ""is this what makes you happy?"" I told them that i had wanted to do all of the things that restoration involves and that working with them had been great but the situation with being paid very little and commuting so far was killing my morale. At that point we had a mutual agreement that me leaving to search for better work would be for the best. 

Right now as i'm typing this i have gone for an interview with another small shop(Really small....Like one guy and his Secretary.) and i'm dealing with Alfa Romeos hiring process but don't know if ill even get a job with them. 

My question at this point would have to be: What direction should i go? I've always loved classic cars but with my previous experience I don't think i should get into it until later in life. I've feared going to a dealer because I'm afraid of working for a corporation( I worked at a commercial gym between my first and second job.) I'm also afraid that going to another independent shop would end the same way the second shop worked out. There's one thing I would love to do and it would be what i call my  ""dream scenario"" Is i would get to sail around the world and then pursue my other interests later but at the moment money would be an issue. 

I feel lost. I feel like every reasonable route i have is just a compromise and ill have to live with different problems than i have now. I guess this is just my way of seeking guidance. "
89mf48,1,2018-04-04,Has anyone left public during/after CFE leave? (CAN),Coolbeanery,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/89mf48/has_anyone_left_public_duringafter_cfe_leave_can/,"Just curious as to anyone who’s left the firm before (but close) to getting their letters and found a good opportunity afterwards. I’m really not loving public so far. I started back in Sept ‘17, but have some experience from audit internships. I am questioning if public is for me and I don’t know how many more busy seasons I can do - not just the hours, but being reprimanded for trying to learn on the job and being blamed when given way too much work on a very difficult client when the work quality was not high enough. Therefore I would ideally like to jump ship after a second busy season, not a third since I know I’ll be so unhappy here and was quite disappointed with how my teams dealt with me being in the learning process. However, I don’t want to burn bridges or cut my opportunities short. Would you get a poor reference for jumping ship “too early”? Is the experience much less valuable when you haven’t really worked as a senior? Want to hear what your guys’ experiences are. "
89miiv,125,2018-04-04,Young Daniel wants nothing more than to become a police officer.,Thijs-vr,darkjokes,https://www.reddit.com/r/darkjokes/comments/89miiv/young_daniel_wants_nothing_more_than_to_become_a/,"Young Daniel wants nothing more than to become a police officer. There are police posters on his wall, a fake plastic badge in his pocket and he knows all the police codes by heart. “My boy in blue” is what his dad calls him.

&amp;nbsp;

When it becomes Halloween Daniel asks his mother to go trick or treating as a cop. His mom agrees and they go to a costume shop. An eager Daniel runs up to the shop keeper and tells him he wants to become a cop and he shows his fake plastic badge. The shop keeper smiles and says, “I see, but there’s other boys that want to get costumes too” and he points at a bunch of other kids waiting in front of the fitting rooms. “You’ll have to wait in line.”  
Daniel smiles. He doesn’t care. He’s far too excited and happily waits his turn.

&amp;nbsp;

A couple of years later and Daniel’s dream to serve and protect is as strong as it ever was, and when it becomes time to intern Daniel knows exactly where he’s going to go.  
In his perfectly ironed shirt, with pretty polished shoes he walks into the local police office. It’s busy inside. The waiting room full. But Daniel doesn’t care. He isn’t there to report a crime, he’s there to help solve the crime! He pushes the bell on the desk and he waits. And waits, but nobody comes out to talk to him. After some time he pushes the bell again. “Sir, it’s very busy and you have to get a number,” an older lady says and she points at the ticket dispenser. “You’ll have to wait in line.”  
Daniel smiles. He doesn’t care. He’s far too excited and happily waits his turn.

&amp;nbsp;

When his internship is almost finished, Daniel goes to talk to his mentor, or as he calls it to his friends ‘his partner’. They laugh and talk about how the past couple of weeks went. They’re both happy and Daniel says he can’t wait to join the force for real. “You have what it takes, son,” his mentor says. “Make sure you get your paperwork from downstairs. It’ll help you with your application.”  
Daniel nods and jumps in the elevator downstairs to the filing room. He’s been there several times before and he knows the clerk well so he walks up to the front desk straight away. Before he can get a word out however a stern voice behind him sounds. “We’re all waiting here, son. You best wait your turn.” Daniel turns around and sees several serious looking police men sitting in the corner. Paperwork and coffee in hand.  
“Oh, I’m sorry, sir. I hadn’t seen you,” Daniel says.  
“That’s alright, but you’ll have to wait in line,” the officer replies.
Daniel nods. He doesn’t care. He’s far too excited and happily waits his turn.

&amp;nbsp;

The first day on the job starts and Daniel hasn’t been able to sleep at all that night, he’s so excited. This is the first day of the rest of his live. He looks in the mirror at his uniform and smiles at the thought of himself having walked around with that fake plastic badge for so long. He’s so excited in fact that he shows up for work way too early. He doesn’t want to be awkward and come in before the rest does, so he looks around and sees a donut shop. He figures he might as well embrace the stereotype and goes to check it out.  
Inside the shop it’s bristling. It’s clear there’s a lot of police officers getting a quick snack and a coffee before going to work. Daniel feels at home. These are his people and he’s looking forward to joining them. But he’s learned and instead of walking straight up to the counter he joins in the line. He doesn’t care, he soaks up the atmosphere and happily waits his turn.


&amp;nbsp;

“Hi, I’m Justin.” One of the officers holds out his hand. “We’ll be working together.” Daniel shakes his hand and smiles. “Nice to meet you.” Justin tells him about the department, where everything is, how everything works and who everyone is. It’s a lot to take in but Daniel does his best to remember it all. “So, you ready to hit the streets?” Justin asks.  
Out on the street Justin explains what to look out for and the responsibilities you have as a police officer. Daniel knows most of if already and is looking forward to some real police work. All of a sudden the radio on Justin’s chest starts blaring. “We have a 10-15 on Bay Street”. Justin looks up at Daniel, but before Justin can say anything Daniel blurps out “Disturbance on Bay Street, that’s just around the corner from here!”  
They quickly run to the reported location to see a large black man lying on the ground. Officers swarmed around him. Kicking, punching. Justin dives right in and starts landing punches too. But Daniel is instead looking at what’s happening and hesitates. Justin looks up and sees Daniel just standing there.  
“What are you waiting for?"" He yells, “there is no punchline!”"
89msvr,9,2018-04-04,They were standing right behind me.,BoopityFloop17,cringe,https://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/89msvr/they_were_standing_right_behind_me/,"Age old story, and it happened years ago. Still cringing though, and was reminded of it as I was walking by where it happened today.

I was out with high school friends in our old neighbourhood, it’s been a year or two since we’ve met up so we were mainly talking about the old days. We were near a local mall at this point and just kinda wandering around aimlessly and talking shit.

Somehow the conversation had steered towards some school acquaintances that I didn’t really know too well, but were friends on facebook. Wanting to have something juicy to contribute, I started saying stuff about this girl who had become an instagram ‘influencer’. 

I was saying some really mean things, like how ‘fake’ her posts were and how she seemed to switch boyfriends as if she were switching underwear. Just low hanging fruit and mindless gossip. I didn’t even know this girl all that well, and at this point I had started getting really animated and was talking rather loudly. I kept talking about how lame she was, and how her entire group of friends were ‘posers’. 

Halfway through the bashing, a girl walked up from behind us and walked right by, glancing at us. I thought she looked familiar.

My friend later confirmed that the girl was indeed the same girl I was bashing. It was only then did I understand why my friends had been so quiet that whole time I was blabbering.

This moment was second only to that time I walked into a glass wall at my internship, but that’s a story for another time."
89n7yc,5,2018-04-04,INFJ Looking for Career/Life Advice (27M),zachstrife7,infj,https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/89n7yc/infj_looking_for_careerlife_advice_27m/,"Hello all! This is my first time ever writing a post on Reddit, so I apologize if I'm not doing things right. ^_0

I suppose I should start from the beginning. Like most INFJs, I have often felt like I haven't ""fit in"" with people in my own age group, even from early on in life. I've always been more interested in deeper conversations and meanings rather than keeping up with ephemeral trends, and because of this, I have usually gotten along better with people older than me (or younger than me as I act as and usually come off as a chill mentor of sorts, at least from what I've been told). I've had very few friends throughout my life, both real and online, and while part of me has always wondered why I don't have more actual friends, I've come to realize that it's because I only truly value those people who I can share a deep bond with instead of passing acquaintanceships. I've generally felt isolated and alone for most of my life, battling every day with the thoughts of, ""Is there something wrong with me?"", but it wasn't until about a year or so ago when I took the MBTI test and felt an enormous sense of relief. I was an INFJ; it was like I had just discovered the manual to my personality and no longer felt like I was an alien living on this planet! Ever sense then, I've been reading into various INFJ forums and communities and have felt their every word and motivational image resonate deep within my very soul; I could not be more proud to call myself an INFJ.

I only wish I had discovered my personality type about a decade or so ago! I have always been interested in the entertainment sector, specifically in video games/game design, anime, acting/theater, music, and most specifically in voice acting. It was when I received my first Game Boy Pocket at the age of five that the spark of passion first struck me, causing my love of entertainment to bloom from then onwards. I played as many games as my parents would buy for me (falling in love with the storytelling aspects of RPGs in particular, which has fed my creative imagination further and further to this day), and would often mimic the voices I heard from the games (and anime series - thank you weekday Toonami!) every day. It wasn't until I played Brave Fencer Musashi that I discovered that voice acting was a real thing - you could actually make a career out of talking in video games! How amazing was that! (The actor's voice was that of the legendary Steve Blum, who went by the alias of David Lucas in the credits back then, most likely because it wasn't a union project.)

Unfortunately, my parents were not supportive of me when it came to wanting to explore my theatrical talents; for some reason that still boggles my mind to this day, both my parents and grandparents have a massive antipathy towards the entertainment industry in general, labeling absolutely everyone, from actors to behind-the-scenes employees, as stuck-up, narcissistic jerks who have massive ego complexes. As such, despite continuing to keep up my interests at home, I was unable to express myself in public venues, not allowed to try out for plays, musicals, or other acting/entertainment opportunities at school, even though the other children in my grade knew I was a phenomenal actor and musician (I had luckily convinced my mother to allow me to learn the saxophone in fourth grade, but learning the guitar in high school would be a very hard and discouraging sell). A moment in my life I'll never forget was when in my sixth grade U.S. History class, our teacher asked the class for the most talented actor in the grade to come up and read various historical documents throughout the rest of the year. I was unanimously chosen by the class to be the speaker, and I gave my all into reading various documents throughout the year, receiving applause from my fellow students and teacher alike every time (even though I still had butterflies in my stomach every single time!). As I entered high school and more entertainment-related opportunities opened up, I was again forbidden from participating under the guise of ""shaming the family"" and ""being one of those insecure loser actors"" by my family, instead only being able to play in the school's various music ensembles (of which I easily made first chair as a freshman and managed to win a jazz combo award for our school through my incredible improv skills [hurray INFJ creativity!]).

Fast forward to the end of high school towards the end of my first semester of senior year; it was time to send out college applications, and being in the top 10% of my graduating class (I even managed to become part of the Cum Laude society at our school), I could get into most of my choices easily. When it came time to picking my major, I knew exactly what I wanted to select: Drama. It would be my chance to finally be able to explore the inner entertainer I knew I could be and was, my opportunity to try to bring happiness to others by being able to help them take a load off and enjoy themselves for a brief bit of time in this hectic and often-depressing world we live in. (A short side-bar: My family's unofficial motto is ""Life sucks, then you die."" I've never believed that for a moment throughout my life, and have been doing everything I can to prove that untrue statement wrong by making people smile whenever possible and helping others enjoy their lives through entertainment.) Unfortunately, my parents - specifically, my mother - would not stand for it despite my many quiet protests and evidence to the contrary. I did not want to hurt her feelings, but she certainly hurt mine; I was given an ultimatum of either picking another major or paying for college myself. Knowing that college tuition would run over $200,000 and that my parents had been painstakingly saving since before I was born to send me to college, I couldn't bring myself to do that to them; though a part of my soul died that day, I regretfully gave in. I chose a different major; this time it would be to become a math teacher. My calculus teacher during senior year was an absolutely phenomenal entertainer! Every single day, he not only made learning silly and fun, but also helped students learn the material easily, resulting in high test scores across his classes. I was so inspired by his performances that if he could do something like this, I could do the same as well, entertaining through an indirect means. Once again, however, my mother objected, this time citing low pay among teachers; again, despite my desires, I was given the same threat and ultimately had to pick again. Philosophy was the third try! You would think it would be the charm, but, ""What are you going to do with that?!"" was an immediate reply, my mother never having understood my creative imagination and my constant thought processes about how the world's mysteries and problems could be solved. So, having reached a breaking point, I gave up; I asked what she would accept, and the only major that would fit the bill was Political Science. Having no choice but to accept, I sent out my applications and ended up being a Political Science major at a midwestern Division 1 school.

Fast forward to my junior year in undergraduate. I had no idea what I'd do with my degree once I graduated, but I figured that I would go and pursue my passions in the entertainment fields as I had originally planned. I had even bought RPG Maker VX Ace and had already created a fun 2-hour demo game to reinvigorate my passion. Come spring of that year, my mother managed to call a family friend for an internship (which wasn't required for college since I was already working at a local business during the previous two summers); it turns out he was an attorney. I cannot express how much I absolutely HATE the law; to say I have an antipathy towards it would be the understatement of all mankind. It is by far the most uncreative, boring, and conflict-ridden field of work one can choose; it's everything an INFJ would and should avoid. (Oh, how I again wished I knew my type years ago!) Everything in the pit of my soul told me I should avoid this, but since it was a favor to our friends, I went along with it since it was just a once a week thing. We go to their home on the first day, and what does my mother say out of the blue? THAT I PLANNED ON GOING TO LAW SCHOOL. I had never fainted before in my life, but I did for the first, and only, time in my life in their home; I felt betrayed by the one woman on the planet I used to trust the most. I didn't act like myself for the rest of the day, only barely getting through my first day of the internship. On the way home, I confronted my mother, telling her I had never wanted this and that I had my own plans for MY life. Her response? ""You're going to law school or you're out of this house!"" I didn't know what else to say; I cried and broke down, all while my mother continued to yell, berate me, and tell me what I was going to do with my life as SHE dictated. It was then that I realized that I was my mother's puppet from birth, someone who she only cared about if I was doing what SHE wanted instead of what I wanted. (I found out a few years later from a friend of my mother's - a psychologist - that she had planned this from the start. She wanted two children - one a lawyer, and the other an engineer - for prestige because she was mocked as a child, and she didn't care what her children wanted to be. They were going to be what SHE wanted them to be. In my case, I was forced to go to law school as the vicarious fulfillment of my dead great-grandfather's dream of being an attorney which she wanted to fulfill as part-her own reasons and part-love for him; the man was a drunk who said a lot of stupid things from what I've heard from family lore, and having anything to do with the field of law has NEVER even been on my radar. My younger brother was lucky in his case; he wanted to be an engineer, playing with Legos along with me since he was young, so his life has worked out well. He's only 25 and he's moved onto his second job where he'll now be making over $75,000 a year! I couldn't be more proud of him as his older brother! I only wish I fate had aligned for me as well.... But, I digress.) Having nowhere to go to if I refused - no other family in the area, no friends who could take me in (as an INFJ, I of course only had 1-2 friends who were at college themselves), and a low amount of money to afford an apartment in the area (we live in a relatively affluent community) - I had no choice but to acquiesce... on MY conditions. I told her that my senior year would be MINE to enjoy, and enjoy it I did in exchange for the three years of hell I would soon endure. I took classes I absolutely loved - music history, conducting, intro game design - and out of all those, my favorite was my first (and last) professional acting class. Every day I had that class was a true joy; my heart was aflutter every time I stepped into that theater. I had never taken a class before, but I will never regret it; my instructor, at the end of the first week, was so impressed with my performances, he asked me, ""Are you sure you're not a Drama major? You have the skills of a senior. Why have you never taken classes before?!"". I stammered for a moment and told him it was complicated, but from then on until the conclusion of the course, I finally felt truly alive; I had the validation I had always sought from someone who had been an actor for over thirty years and had been teaching for another six, and I knew that the entertainment sector was my confirmed passion.

After I graduated, I entered the three years of suffering that was law school. I absolutely hated all of it; I didn't apply myself at all, even though I worked my rear off and practically killed myself with getting barely any sleep and free time over the years (only to end up graduating with a C+ average, whereas all through my life, I've been an A+ student). I barely had any time to relax, and my gaming projects had to be put on hold until they were eventually cancelled indefinitely; there was simply too much homework that had to be done. I was lucky that there were no litigation or trial advocacy class requirements; I probably would have gone insane or tried something crazy. (As someone who lived [and continues to live] in a loud Italian family where every day of my life, people are yelling at each other, conflict has become my anathema. I simply cannot deal with any sort of arguing whatsoever even to this day; I just want everyone to get along all across the world! ^_^) My only saving grace during law school was that I was allowed to continue playing with the various music ensembles on campus, and that I was able to join the fledgling Japanese/Anime Club that had just formed to meet fellow otakus/gaming nerds like myself (I consider myself an otaku as I LOVE anime; you should see my Anime Planet lists!). I never joined a single law school organization as I had absolutely no interest in them whatsoever; I made great friends who were just coming into their undergraduate studies in the music and anime groups, most of which I still keep in contact with to this day. I could actually have a connection with these people, not with a whole bunch of stuck-up wannabe attorneys who only cared about who could snipe who to get a better grade in classes (for those who don't know, law school As are limited, and it's like a shark tank - the absolute WORST environment for an INFJ). As an improv soloist for years, my skills in the jazz bands improved significantly (sparked by my always active and creative INFJ imagination), which lead to continued enhancement in our classical ensembles, which in turn ultimately rewarded me with our school's highest honor for Outstanding Musicianship at the end of my law school term. While I absolutely hated law school itself and made zero friends there, the people I met outside of law school became my new friends, those who listened to me, understood me, and accepted me, along with being capable of having meaningful, deep conversations. They even completely understood me when they would ask, ""What are you going to do after law school?"", and I would reply with, ""I'm going to become a game designer or work in the anime/voice acting business,"" knowing full-well that being the quiet person I was, the law was definitely not for me (which became especially clear once I told them I was being forced to go to law school, to which they completely understood and felt bad for my situation).

Post-Juris Doctorate, my mother forced me to take the Illinois Bar Exam in 2016, and I acquiesced once again; being a lifelong polymath and lover of learning, I studied both for it and taught myself beginner-level Japanese at the same time. Even though I focused on my Japanese WAY more (for anime purposes, also because I've wanted to live in/go to/work in Japan since Toonami first aired), I managed to pass the exam on the first try. After being sworn in, so began my job hunt. At first, I tried submitting for legal jobs, telling myself I'd work a year or two to earn some money before taking it to go earn a degree in game design or acting, and I had some success; I managed to get several replies back from employers, but I never made it past the first interviews. I wanted to apply for non-legal jobs, but since my mother is able to check everyone in the family's emails (since she's the primary account-holder), I knew she would go ballistic if I did so. Unfortunately, most legal jobs in the area require 3-5 years of previous full-time experience which absolutely nobody has right out of school, so I was in a dead end until July 2017. My little brother (who had graduated as a computer engineer in 2014) told me there was an opening at his work for an IT Analyst as a possible lead into the computer industry in general; it paid $50,000 a year plus benefits and a bonus (of $7-10k). After sending his company a letter expressing my interest, I received a reply the next day... although my mother read it before I did. Barging into my room at 8 AM in a frenzy (I've usually been sleeping in until at least 10 and searching until 7 or 8 PM), she shouted at me that this was ""unacceptable"" and that, ""You need to go get a job! NOW! AND IT BETTER BE A LEGAL ONE!"" I quickly sent my brother a text message (something my mother can't read) telling him that I couldn't reply to his company without risking more ire, and he empathized with me. I was a wreck for the next few days; all I wanted to do was curl up into a ball and die, and I mostly just slept, not applying to anything. My mother finally got mad and allowed me to see a different family friend of hers who is a psychologist/therapist; I had four sessions with him to get back to normal, and then stopped. I had several more interviews for positions after that, but again, no dice. It was only in November 2017 when my mother finally ""relented"", saying that I could apply to non-legal jobs, but I knew this was an act. After sending out non-legal jobs, I would be berated when she would come home from her part-time job if I could not hide my confirmation emails quickly enough, causing me to sink into depression for days at a time. By this point, was already 26, and since August 2017, I've been paying for my own insurance since my mother refuses to (though she still pays for my brother's even though he gets insurance through his work! Double standard!); I've had a nest egg of $8,000 saved up over my summers working at a local business that's been gradually losing ~$250 a month ever since, so I'm trying to show some financial independence rather than complain. I've essentially been locked in a ""chicken game"" with my mother since then; it's either I fall into despair and get some job I hate, or end up working somewhere like Target or Walmart for minimum wage and no benefits just to have some income despite the beratement it would bring. (As a side note, I've tried to work side gigs as a freelance writer/editor/proofreader at various sites, but the second she found out I was making money, the questions and constant pressure to quit never stopped, so I had to abandon that. She's also able to see the finances of everyone in the family since we're all at the same bank.)

In early February 2018, I managed to get my first in-person interview EVER for, of all things, a law librarian position! It paid the same as my brother's offer from almost a year ago, and it had nothing to do with the law whatsoever; it was pretty much just being a regular librarian, only having the word ""law"" in its title, meaning no actual legal work. After nailing the interview with my natural actor's charisma (being more than qualified for the position), I found out later I was passed up for the position for one of the interviewers' sons who just flunked out of college (because it's who you know and not what you know these days apparently...). A few days later after coming home from getting dinner for the family with my mother, she began to really berate me, including a few phrases that absolutely hurt me to my very core: ""You're the black sheep of the family!"", ""You're a failure!"", and the most painful, ""I should have never sent you to college in the first place!"" I wanted to shout and say something equally hurtful back at her, but... that's just not who I am. Even in conflicts involving myself, I can't hurt someone who I've loved all my life; she's a generally nice lady, only... she doesn't understand her son at all, or even wants to try to talk or listen to me in the slightest. If I had a nickel for every time in my life I've told her to listen to me, I'd probably have accumulated a hundred bucks by now.

So, after another weekend of wanting to die (luckily, I've never drank alcohol, smoked, or done drugs in my life, nor will I ever, so I just had to suffer through it by myself), I was offered another chance with my therapist from almost a year ago. This time, things have been different; as my mother's former supervisor from 30 years ago, he knows all about her, and immediately emphasized with my suffering. I told him I was an INFJ, and he immediately told me that it made sense; my mother had never interacted with an INFJ in her life before according to him, let alone one being her own son! I have been seeing my therapist weekly since the start of March; since then, I have been feeling myself become more confident in who I am as a person, and have begun to turn my attention back to my passions. I don't plan on stopping this time; my mother is willing to pay for a session a week until I find a job, using him as a life coach/therapist until that time, of which I am incredibly grateful (and why I can't be mad at her since I know she's a complex human herself).

This brings me to the present (sorry about all that exposition!). I have all but stopped applying to legal work (though I still do so whenever new jobs pop up) and have been applying to more non-legal positions; I have made separate everything accounts per my therapist's suggestion to avoid any further beratement and to keep my mother in the dark. Most of the positions I've applied to are hundreds of miles away, and both my therapist and I agree that a move would bring me some freedom. As it stands now, I've essentially been a prisoner in my own home since November 2016; it's as if I'm Edmond Dantes from the Count of Monte Cristo, my mother/home is the Chateau d'lf, and my supportive therapist is my Abbe Faria, trying to bring me hope to eventually escape and to become the helpful, creative person I know I can be who just wants to make people smile for a living. I've once again gotten into RPG Maker (purchasing the new MV for cheap) and have talked to various indie developers on how to break into that path. I've also tried my hand at journalism and have created a gaming blog as well; I just wrote a 2200+ word review of Yakuza 0 and almost have enough work to have a mini-portfolio to show off to gaming sites. My current ""homework assignment"" from my therapist is to learn how to make YouTube videos and make one, using the aforementioned article as a review piece, though I've yet to learn how to do so (as finding the right free editing software is difficult, and I only have my laptops's webcam to film); not to mention I have to learn how to do so in the dead of night, as if my mother finds out, she'll metaphorically kill me (as my therapist agreed).

I... honestly have no idea what to do now. I know I want to work in the entertainment sector - ideally in the gaming sector primarily as either a game designer or YouTube reviewer/professional player (as writing takes MUCH longer than acting, even though I must admit I'm an OK writer [even though friends have told me my creative stories are professional]) or in the anime/voice acting industry in a similar role or as a budding voice actor - but I have no idea what to do or what to pursue, or even how to get there. I have absolutely zero connections in my area, and pretty much have to do everything secretly due to my overbearing and crazy (though I know she's well-meaning) mother/family. 

I know this sounds crazy asking a forum of people I've never met before for advice, but as my therapist has told me, I need to take more risks, and this is one of them. I might receive bad advice, I might receive no advice, or I might get some help from INFJs who have been in similar situations or who might know someone somewhere who can help out (like someone who could use someone on a gaming channel for instance, or what's the best free editing software to make a YouTube video on a PC), but I'm putting myself out here and telling my story in a risk to my own comfort. Nothing may come of all this, but if anyone has any advice or comments whatsoever, I would be beyond appreciative. Hopefully my almost 3 hours of writing this lengthy post won't go to waste!

Again, this is my first post EVER on any Reddit, so I apologize if this is in violation of anything or if I missed any other usual pleasantries or whatnot (I read through the rules and general Redditquette, so I think I should be fine). Thank you all for reading this, and I hope I'll be able to receive some help from other INFJs on the internet.

I have kept it in pretty good shape, but I have a feeling it will not last much longer (especially since I have an internship in Dallas this summer and will be driving often). I currently have a little over $4,000 in my savings account and have been saving for a down payment for a while. I was planning on getting a newer 2016-2018 Honda Civic because, well, I like the way they look, the tech inside, and great gas mileage. I currently make around $1000 dollars a month and that gets me by barely with all my bills. I am graduating in about a year and should have a real job after. 

I talked to a friend who just got like a mid 2000's VW Passat for less than $5000 and said the only reason was because they didn't want to make car payments on a nicer car. Should I do something like that or wait for more money for an easier down payment? Or just wait to get a car altogether?

Also I am a finance major so I understand most financial concepts, just wanted a second opinion. The only debt I currently have is my student loans of about $12,000

Thank you for your help!"

2.) I already have a summer 2018 internship with an Administrative Judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in D.C. Will this position give me enough of headstart in the D.C. legal network to consider studying law in D.C.? Or I am overestimating the position?

89r0mq,34,2018-04-04,My nephew turned 10 years old today and he's accomplished more in those 10 years and I have.,aiaeiaeithrowakgjag,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/89r0mq/my_nephew_turned_10_years_old_today_and_hes/,"From 17 to 27 was a waste of my time. I have only disappointed myself. I've been burned out, got to deal with issues I didn't even realize I had until I figured out why I was in such a bad mood. 

Turns out my fucked up youth, which I didn't even realize at first was so fucked up, fucked me up. 

About when I turned 10 years young my life started to change for the worst. The things that happened then still impact me until this day. I don't have any friends because of it. I'm lonely as fuck. It isn't because I can't make friends. I just feel suffocated now by any social participation. People have asked me out, wanted to be my friend and I've always turned them down and found ways to run away from them. I sabotage all my relationships.

People around me have no idea what's going on in my head. Schoolmates, colleagues or anyone else that comes across me see me like a normal guy. I can talk normally with them, joke around with them and talk with them about all kinds of subjects. But from the inside it's raining fire in my mind. I feel uneasy, I don't like peoples eyes on me, it feels like I'm being judged all the time. I shiver by the thought  of having to go out on a dinner with fellow colleagues. I recently quit my job, they asked me out and I started calculating all kinds of excuses to get out of it. And I got out of it. 

I went to therapy, but it didn't do a thing for me. I know exactly what my problems are and what I should do about them. the anxiety is just crippling me from doing it. And I don't want to take medication. Maybe that will help me calm down and do the things I want, but I think that giving into medication is something I won't do because I see it as a loss. I'm also afraid what it could do with me on the long term. So I need to keep taking those meds for the rest of my life because I don't see myself getting better from this.

I also used to suffer from heavy panic attacks. But I learned to control those. I started to see what the symptoms were. They also started to change on me. However, I haven't gotten an attack for more than 2 years now. 

My only problem now is the anxiety and running away from life. I know what to do about it: just go and live life, I tried it many times but it keeps hitting me down. 

My nephew has learned to walk, talk, eat, run, basic math, how to swim, karate etc. While I'm stuck here with myself, not able to form relationships, meaningful connections, not going mad inside because I have to go to work or to make an exam. I'm a damn mess. I've known better times, but even in those better times I'm really lonely. 

I just got myself. Sure, I still have a mother who cares for me. But  other than that, I'm all alone. I haven't worked or gone to school for a few months and there's no one that has texted me. Not even my siblings. Most likely because I always reply very dry to them. An other sign of not being able to keep up with connections in my life. 

I've thrown myself into an everlasting fall which I can't seem to escape. Just get over myself? Force myself to do better? I just can't anymore. I'm tired. I'd rather be stuck in my room all day than having to walk past by a human being on the street. 

I'm not a person that would ever kill himself. I'm really not a suicidal person. I wouldn't even take my life if I was terminally ill. But having my life end right now with a natural death, peacefully in my sleep, wouldn't be the worst thing for me. 

I'm just a waste of space. I don't contribute anything to anyone. No friends that will feel sorrow when I'm gone. If I currently had colleagues they'd forget about me in a few weeks. No legacy I leave behind. My mother would feel miserable. My siblings would cry. They'd learn to live life without me, I'm barely in theirs. But it would break something within my mother of course. Losing a kid is terrible. Other than that there's no one on this earth that would give a shit.

That's how lonely I feel right now. I know everyone has their share of problems. I know my situation could be even worse. I could have a terrible sickness as well. I just feel overwhelmed with ruining 10 years of my youthful life.

I've done nothing in the past years and I'm approaching 30. 

In a perfect world I'd get my shit together in the upcoming months, try to make a friend, try to find love after that. At my core I'm damn full with love and joy. I remember what I used to be. A joker, someone that could be a friend to anyone in class or in my neighbourhood. I had tons of friends. At my core I'm a positive person. I sounds crazy because of this depressing story, but I wasn't always like this. 

Circumstances and life shaped me into a lonely situation. My father was a bad influence in my life. He caused me losing friends and being able to make them. He prevented me from playing with my friend when I was around 10. He threatened me if I ever played with him ever again. My friend was black and he didn't like that. Yeah, my father is a piece of shit. A shit stain I haven't seen for 10 years as well. He left my family, thank god, and that's when I dove into more loneliness. 

After he threatened me and made life for my mother miserable I stared to hide myself in my own home. I was too ashamed to play with my friends. They kept ringing my doorbell and asking me to come play. But my dad made a too big of an impression on me and I feared for the safety of my mom. Because she got the problems if I went out and played with kids he didn't like. So I became a reclusive  person. The outgoing joker kid became the silent kid. I even started to develop a stutter. His effect on me was huge. He used to make fun of me, threaten me, be a piece of shit towards my mother and other siblings. I grew up in fear from that moment on. Always with my ear on the door when he used to fight with my mother. I had to protect her once when he was raging against her. 

I don't want to blame all of my failures on him. But it sure started there. Of course I'm to blame also to let such things impact me so hard. I also have a responsibility to get through those hardships, but I was too afraid and it became a part of me. 

In the years after I stayed the reclusive person. When I was going to highschool the same kids I used to play with still lived in my street. I started to ignore them and not even look at them when passing by. I was too ashamed for snubbing them and too ashamed because of my father causing scenes. They probably thought I turned into a huge asshole that didn't want to be friends with them anymore. I became the weird kid in the street. 

I was reclusive but I still had ''friends'' in highschool. The old me was still in there and he used to pop out here and there. During college days I also had a tight group I used to hang out with but then my anxiety began and I started to miss out on years because of not being able to keep my concentration. 

It's a big shit show. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to talk about this anymore. I've done it enough. I feel like giving up, but I don't want to be a homeless man underneath a bridge. I'm stuck. I'm lonely. I just want some rest, a friend and maybe some love later on. Without this baggage I know for sure I would've been a great friend to someone and a great boyfriend or husband. But I won't bother myself onto some poor soul when I'm still fucked up like this. I won't commit to any woman. She wouldn't deserve my messed up mind.

I'm going to work-out, get back in shape and slowly try to finish my education. I only got 1 exam left and an internship. After that I'm done. But due to my stress levels it's quite hard for me now. 

I'm going to fix that up first. 

Well that's a load. "

I'm the French guy who is doing an 6 month internship at the University of Toledo (you may have seen my previous threads asking for info before coming to the US).

So here's the thing : I arrived about two weeks ago and settled well. Thing is, I don't know anyone. I have two roommates who mind their own business and always are in their room and don't seem really social. My colleagues are really nice but they are like 10 years older than me and most of them don't drink alcohol so it's hard to go have a drink afterwork or whatever. As I'm not a student, I don't have any occasion to blend in with UT students.

I live right in front of the building that hosts my lab so for now my life is mostly going to work (1 min walk), coming back and chilling on my computer.

Do you have any idea how I can meet people, make friends, find events or whatever ?"

It’s only in my early teens (I’m in my twenties now) that the behavior of my father has become unbearable. He texts me often and, when I don’t respond because I have a great deal of stress when texting and I rarely remember to text people when I’m focused on taking 18 credit hours a semester, working three jobs, having a boyfriend and social life, and trying to work on extracurricular stuff on campus like internships, staff positions, and volunteer work, he says things like I hope you love me because I love you. 

I love him, but I never feel like he is satisfied with the level of love. I feel like he’s never happy with me, no matter what I do. I’m so stressed around him and he never understands what I’m telling him. He calls me selfish and doesn’t acknowledge how hard my day to day life is. 

I can’t cut him out of my life because I’ll lose my mother and one of my two sisters, the other sister has always hated me anyway. I try to fight back and I never win, while he claims that I try to beat him into saying “okay you’re right and you win.” I don’t know what to do. He was such a great dad when I was little.

I’m worried because company’s come and advocate for themselves, but I don’t know specifics about the students who go to work for them.

I have a 3.4 but will probably end up with 3.0-3.2 come graduation next year, plan on getting masters in auditing, sitting for CPA and would really like to go as big (firm size) as I can in public. I want to leave the state I am in, which gets tricky because recruiters are mainly looking for their firm in my state.

I have a very outgoing personality, I actually do love financial accounting, but I’m not sure if my extra curriculars (sorority finance Vice President, various clubs, various summer jobs, studying abroad w/ internship this summer) will make up for my lower gpa to a big firm.

Do I have any chance at a big 4 in a different state? Do I have any chance at BDO or Goldman? I have no idea how to find the best cultural fit for me, which is important to me and I’m sure is the #1 thing firms look at for recruiting. I know that when I’m hired somewhere I’m a good fit, I will give it my all as I genuinely love working and learning new things, I’m just not sure what I should be looking for.

I’d love to live in Colorado, middle California (although so expensive), Chicago, or Seattle and want to do auditing. I plan to sell my soul for the first few years going into a firm while I’m still without kids and family, which I’ve heard is important. 

Sorry this sounds like a diary entry, I would just appreciate more perspectives if there’s any hope for who would want to hire me."

j'avais posté sur /r/depression il y a un mois et j'avais posté ce message, toujours vrai [(lien vers le poteau)](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/81thyu/i_need_to_vent_hope_its_the_right_place_to_do_so/) :

&gt; I'm stuck.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll be using my main account and not a throwaway one cause fuck it, might as well be honest. I need to vent. I'm not a native english speaker and I had a few beers before writing this, so be aware.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm from France and grew up in a very small village where the closest town is 10km away. There are 300ish people in my village.
&gt; 
&gt; I skipped two classes when I was young and finished high school at the age of 15 which is very rare apparently (we were 14 that year). Went to a private Engineering School in Paris. I had to leave my family during the week to study there in my own small apartment. You learn life if I may say so, because being 15/16, away from your family, having X€ per month to ""live"", having to do every chore, yeah you have to grow up.
&gt; 
&gt; I was already pretty mature. But now I'm 20. I almost finished my masters degree in Engineering, I'm specialized in BigData technologies and I.T. security. I just have to find a 6 month-internship to finish everything and have my diploma. Which I feel proud of even if I'd like to be complimented on it more often.
&gt; 
&gt; But I'm stuck. My father is ill. He's always been a functioning drunk up until I was in high school and was 10 minutes away from death (peritonitis, his bowel exploded and could have died of septicemy). Since then, he's been different. He was 59 at the time, he's 64 now and he can't walk properly.
&gt; 
&gt; He has been suffering from that for 2 years now I think. Maybe more, maybe less, time moves very slowly in my household. He's becoming more and more depressed. He needs a crutch to move. Every day, he's drunk at 8:30 PM and I have to help him go to bed because he can't walk due to alcohol &amp; his illness.
&gt; 
&gt; He's been to doctors. Everything is ok for him, his liver, lungs, heart and nerves. They didn't find anything. He suffers from an unknown condition. Except depression. Because I've seen him walk properly if he is in an amazing mood.
&gt; 
&gt; He's also been freelance for 30 years. Developped a program for a very specific profession (an ERP, software to manage a company). I've been working with him for 4 years now. Things are terrible, we owe tens of thousands of euros to the government due to excessive taxes and his non-functioning drunkness.
&gt; 
&gt; My plans for the future are simple: get my internship, have my diploma and replace him to get the whole activity back on the rails. But daily life is terrible. Lots of alcohol, lots of ranting, anger and bad feelings.
&gt; 
&gt; I tried to reach out to my friends, some of them are helping me, supporting me mentally through all of this. But it's hard.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry for this whole wall of text, even Eastern-germans never saw a wall that tall. I hope I was coherent, please point out the mistakes I did, I want my english to be flawless.
&gt; 
&gt; I wish you a very happy week-end and a very happy life :)

Pour les non-anglophones et surtout pour le peu qui voudraient un tl;pl du truc malgré le sub, j'avais 15 ans quand j'ai eu mon bac, là j'ai 20 ans, je dois trouver et faire mon stage de fin d'étude pour avoir mon Master d'ingé info (ça s'invente pas vu qu'on est sur reddit).

Et mon père est malade.

L'alcoolisme depuis ""toujours"", une péritonite début 2013 (en gros son intestin a pété dans son ventre qui a causé une infection dans le péritoine c'est-à-dire la partie entre tous les organes dans le torse), et s'il était pas déjà à l'hosto, il était mort. Et depuis 2 ans, problème de jambes, il a de plus en plus de mal à marcher.

Les médecins &amp; spécialistes ne trouvent rien depuis, et là il est rentré à Calot à Berck, un institut très réputé (pas que pour les incendies pour ceux qui suivraient les actus) et à 1 heure de chez nous.

Donc j'ai été le voir aujourd'hui. Là ça a été le flashback de moi en 2013 en terminale à à peine quinze ans.

Mon père, sapé comme à l'hosto, l'air malade, dans un lit, la télé et à ne rien faire. Les visites quotidiennes etc.

Pourquoi ce poteau ce soir ? Parce que j'aime bien écouter de la musique. J'avais écouté BigFlo &amp; Oli qui sortent des trucs assez cools même si loin de mes ""classiques"", et je suis tombé sur [Bigflo &amp; Oli - Papa ft. Notre père Fabian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMIPaab43Hw&amp;ab_channel=BigfloetoliVEVO), et là ça m'a assassiné de A à Z. 

J'ai cherché à montrer une photo de lui pour dire que leur père dans la vidéo a le même gabarit que le mien, et je suis tombé sur une vidéo de mon père il y a quelques années. C'est reparti. Les larmes sur mon laptop.

J'avais besoin d'aide ce soir. Ma mère dort, mon frère non. Il a 16 ans. Il veut faire un doctorat en physique. Il a pas sauté de classe. Il est exceptionnel. Il m'a pris dans ses bras. J'ai du bol.

Bref, mon papa se dégrade devant moi. Et ce soir c'était le truc de trop. J'avais /r/besoindeparler.

Mon père est malade, je sais que ça peut paraître terrible, mais je tiens. Pour ma mère. 

Donc j'avais besoin de me lâcher sur mon clavier et demander un léger soutien sur un *sous* un peu obscur. 

Gros bisous à vous qui lisez tous ces poteaux ici pour réconforter les gens, vous êtes nos anges gardiens, nous qui avons parfois simplement besoin d'un calin, d'une tape dans l'épaule ou d'un simple mot positif. Que du bonheur dans votre vie &lt;3

You arent even my supervisor. I am an intern who has taken on as much work as a full time employee and you talk down to me all the time.  But that isnt even the issue at hand.

I am open to constructive criticism, you could of easily waited until after the meeting and mentioned something to me as a friendly reminder instead of snipping at me in the meeting, and although you did it quietly i was two chairs away so i guarantee everyone in the room heard you scold me like i was a child. I was completely embarrassed and that totally pist me off.

When we have been together outside of the office your nice to me and have taught me alot, but when we are in the office you talk down to me and i am just sick of it. 
If i lose this internship i wont graduate so ill keep my mouth shut and say what i wanna say on a subreddit.

You  are BFFs with the supervisor to the point where it is uncomfortable. The amount of clout you have in the office is so uncomfortably high for someone who has been there 5 months. These are the red flags that make me hesitant to apply for a position with the company.

I was not motivated and had bad grades. I just jumped in CS because I ''liked computers'' and since I was young I liked to solve problems when the computer had problems. It was a big mistake, because I don't really like coding.

I'm currently doing a Business major, since I wanted to go in business major specialized IT instead. I'm having good grades in business major so far (around 4.1 GPA)

But I'm starting to consider the other options : Finance or accounting

I feel like I get motivated to study accounting and finance classes. But accounting as a career doesn't sound fun.

So my question is : What kind of jobs should I aim for ? All the finance,accounting and IT word seems super large and I'm 100% lost in all this and I don't know where to go.

What I like to do: - I like to solve problems (but I don't like math heavy and coding, that's why I left CS). - I love to play with numbers, like in accounting or finance. Anything that is concrete. I don't like abstract things like I had in CS - I want a job with a very good pay but also want a life outside of work. I want a good life/work balance. I feel like working 80 hours a week for a good pay is useless since you have no life outside of work and can't use the money.

I don't know in details what they do and what kind of jobs are available for me when I finish a major (and should I go finance,accounting, IT?) I'm not sure what I should b going for, not sure what kind of jobs I can get with my major, not sure what jobs should I aim for with my internships, not sure if I should combine 2 majors (double major) , not sure if I should get a masters etc..

Any advices ? I'm really lost (Also I'm 26 years old now, so I'm getting a bit old and I want to have a clear path and stop wasting time and start a good career)"

89ws5g,7,2018-04-05,[EVENT]Researchers unveil new “Balkan Doomsday Clock”,nikvelimirovic,GlobalPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/89ws5g/eventresearchers_unveil_new_balkan_doomsday_clock/,"SARAJEVO

A team of researchers led by Miralen Hadžić, Radomir Stanković, and Boris Ivanović announced a new symbol to track tensions in the Balkans. The idea, known as the Stanković-Hadžić-Ivanović Tension Calculator, was revealed at a conference last month. The calculator was dubbed “The Blackbird” by a Serbo-Macedonian historian that referenced the fact that Kosovo was the source of much of the Balkan conflicts dating back nearly a millennium. 

The Blackbird is modeled on the 1947 Doomsday Clock created by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists to represent the threat of global nuclear war. Radomir Stanković, speaking to a reporter, stated that the Blackbird took his team three years of near constant work and research to perfect:

*“It is definitely a source of pride. We put three years of our lives in this- and I mean literally, we worked day and night. We cycled a team of interns year-round from the SSST (Sarajevo School of Science and Technology). All in all, it is a process that has felt the palm print of nearly 100 researchers. It is a testament to the hope that peace will reign in the Balkans. It is a testament to a new age of cooperation between the people of the Balkans, a new sense of brotherhood and unity.”*

Mr. Stanković was born in Sarajevo to Bosnian Serb parents in 1979. When war broke out in 1992, he emigrated to the United States, where he received a doctorate from MIT. He returned to Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina in 2003 and has since taught at the Sarajevo School of Science and Technology. Miralen Hadžić, the co-lead of the project, is a Bosniak from Bosanski Brod, who was a refugee in Hungary during the war. The professor that oversaw the project is Boris Ivanović—a Croat from Zagreb that has been teaching at SSST since 2005. 

The Calculator rates Balkan tension on a scale of 0-10, with 10 being war. The Calculator also gives an individual tension score to Balkan nations, that corresponds to their internal stability and relation to other Balkan nations. The team has explained that there are nearly 1000 variables taken into account in their calculations, with analysis of every political party in the Balkans, their representation in their respective country’s governments, the interaction between Balkan countries, the economies and militaries of countries, foreign affairs of the countries, personalities of the countries’ leaders, actions taken by Balkan countries, actions taken by countries that affect the Balkans, and foreign actions that may affect ideologies in the region.

The Blackbird uses the Danube-Sava-Soča border and includes the countries of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Thracian Turkey. The team has decided that Turkey and Italy (Trieste and Monfalcone) will be excluded from the calculation. 

Political parties and politicans, as well as the countries’ actions are analysed in regard to their nationalism, religiosity, militarism, euroism or Eurosceptism, russophilia or anti-Russianism, partisanship, and factionalism. A team of thirty researchers from all three of the ethnic groups will watch the geopolitical climate of the reason and calculate the tension regularly. The team and the SSST has asked other countries in the Balkan region to send researchers to help staff this project.

A Slovenian student studying in Sarajevo described the clock as the “Yugo Boom” a play on the sentence, “you go boom.” 

At present, the Balkan tension rating is 3

The BiH tension rating is 5

I dropped out of college about two weeks ago now, I couldn't take the pressure. Too late for a proper withdrawal too, so just WFs. *sigh*

Oh, I'm about 6 weeks into hrt. that's nice, but i still go by my birth name and gender in public, and to my family too actually even though my immediate family knows, so it almost feels like i still haven't made any progress? I dunno.

I'm trying to get a summer internship at this place that doesn't require you to be like a college student or anything, it would mean working in nature, which i would like alot, but it seems like it's too late for me to actually make it in maybe. not to mention i'm not out to 2/3 references i want to use, and that's making things difficult, both in logistics and in working up the courage to talk to them. *ugh*

I revisited some things from my childhood recently. Like games, media, and such. I kinda realized that maybe the answers i'm looking for aren't in them, especially considering i'm not even sure what the questions i'm asking are.

I just feel kinda... lost? like i've always felt kinda lost but i'm kinda just now realizing it.

I've just been taking blow after blow to any ounce of optimism i've had the last few weeks and it's just kinda left me feeling... lost.

i don't think i'm going to hurt myself or anything, but i'm not sure how much longer i can keep up with this before i just fall over and slip into some sort of emotionally exhaustive coma.

not sure if this is the right sub for this or if i should take it elsewhere. i guess i just need a hug or something. *oof*"

89x0ws,200,2018-04-05,Shitty unpaid job story,IAmAYellowMango,ChoosingBeggars,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/comments/89x0ws/shitty_unpaid_job_story/,"Story time. I’m here to share my worst unpaid work experience, so that I can put it behind me for good. I’ve been holding on to this too long and want it completely out of my life. 

First off, in case any context gets lost in the story, I felt like this belonged in r/ChoosingBeggars because the majority of my time at this job was unpaid. And the amount of requests and demands I received should count as the begging.

Four years ago, I moved to a new city and was desperately looking for a job to pay rent, and more importantly to start a career. I was young, a pushover, but also ambitious. I applied to a job I found on a startup companies listings page, where the listed salary range was 40k-70k, and heard back soon after. 

I didn’t really see any red flags when going through the phone screen, besides for being tested on random math questions (mental math stuff) and having to report my SAT and SAT II scores, 8 years after the fact. I later found out he had shared my score with all my future teammates, asking them if it was a good score. Not the worst thing, but it annoyed me to have this revealed without permission just so he could decide if I was ‘smart’.

Soon after our first phone conversation, I was brought on-site to chat with the founder. Everything went well and he offered me the position on the spot. Of course I was excited, my first real job. Right after, I was told that this was a trial position. I would be working for three months unpaid, because there was no money to pay me, but in three months, there would somehow be money to pay me. I asked why there was a salary listed in the position, and he answered that he wanted the listing to catch the eyes of qualified and good candidates only. *eye-roll* Looking back, there was a few red flags, with the lying and just the way he justified matters, but this job sounded really cool. EVERYONE told me not to take the job...but I just had a thought this would be a good opportunity. 

As far as I know, unpaid internships in this field are definitely allowed, but an internship is also meant to be a learning experience. If an intern is out sick or on vacation, the company should still be able to run accordingly. Keep this in mind as you continue reading.

When I signed on, I was hired with the promise of getting to ‘wear many hats’.  I was excited to work on community relations and social media but was told I’d also have to work in customer service and coordination. We agreed that the work amount would be 50/50 in each section. Since the team was so small, I was the only one doing all these roles, besides for the founder, who would sub in.

A week in, we get a phone set up for inbound calls and we agree that I will answer the phone M-F, and he would take the calls on the weekends. I would also have to be available by phone from 8am-6pm (though the original request was 7am-9pm, but basically be available whenever there was a call), calling a customer back within 15 minutes. On top of that, I had to record the calls. The phone system was hooked up to an online service so my boss would get emails any time I missed calls. This is where the micromanaging starts to get insane.

Whenever I missed a call, he would immediately forward me the email and ask why I missed the call. He would also call the company phone with a mystery number to test me and check that I would pick up the phone. On top of this, I was assigned with responding to emails within 15 minutes from receiving it. My boss would often log in to check my emails and give me notes on phrasing and tone of my emails. While I do think this was a fair request on his end, his edits were things like changing “Have a nice day” to “We hope you have a great day”.

Four weeks into this ‘job’, my boss approaches me and tells me he is swamped with meetings and whatnot (really not sure how true this is, i believe he just didn’t want to work weekends). He asks me to cover weekends, though he agrees to back me up when needed. Now I am working 7 days a week, 10 hours a day. While I only had to answer the phone on the weekends, just understand that this was very stressful for a young person new to their job. On the weekends, I had no one to ask questions to, and I was essentially trapped at home, since any background noise would be unprofessional. I know I should have quit at this point. Everyone, including my own parents told me to quit, but I believed in the product and thought I trusted the founder.

In the beginning, I would ask my boss to cover the phone when I was busy. But slowly, he started berating me for asking him to do “my job” and how he was frustrated that he had to do “everything” for me. He said he was extremely busy on the weekends and no longer had time to cover me. We would hire another person to help once we had more money coming in. I accepted this as my fate until one weekend, I decided to go see a movie. In the two hour span of the movie, I received 10 calls to the phone, from the same person. I get out of the movie, stressed out, and am on the receiving end of my boss yelling at me for not picking up the phone. This goes on for 20 minutes before it comes out that the calls came from his friend, again…to test me. I’m not defending myself for not doing my job, but just trying to show how exhausted and scared I was at this point. I was receiving the discipline but no assistance or real solution. The solution to everything was “just do a better job”. 

There were a lot of things about my role that I wasn’t comfortable with. I was asked to write reviews for products I didn’t try, insist that people take replacement products they didn’t want to use rather than receive a refund, and treat our vendors like they owed us. I had to write marketing emails and was told it had to be perfect, not a single mistake. Any time any type of mistake was made, I would get an earful from my boss. Towards the end of my time there, I was scared anytime I got a call from him, when I made a small mistake, or when a customer wanted something I couldn’t fulfill. My friends started equating my job and boss to being stuck in an abusive relationship. 

Christmas week, everyone goes home to see family or on vacation, including my boss. I am still unpaid at this point and with no funds, I can’t travel home. Stupidly, I volunteer to work through the holidays. Of course, the boss happily agrees. At that time, I was the only one still unpaid. Everyone else gets paid leave and goes on their merry way. 

Three months into my internship, my boss and I discuss salary. He asks me how much I need to live, not well, mind you, but just enough to live, because this is a small company that is still a start up yada yada yada. I am extremely frugal and state the bare minimum of costs I have. He tacks on 15% and tells me that should be more than plenty, not even considering taxes. Even after negotiations, it was nowhere near the advertised 40k. I was barely paying off my loans and rent. Even then, my boss often made me feel bad. Whenever something didn’t go his way, he’d remind me that he was paying “a lot” for me, factoring in the health coverage and company taxes. Have you ever seen a boss write out how much you were costing him in taxes?!

After I started getting paid, I request a week off to see my family, who were living abroad. I hadn’t taken any time off at this point and figured everyone had Christmas off, it wouldn’t hurt for me to also get some time off. I spend the week training someone else so they can take over my duties. On the day of my flight, an hour before boarding, my boss calls me and tells me my trip will be unpaid. It’s not like I could say no right? To protect himself, he emails a formal agreement stating that I agreed to not get paid for the duration of the trip. 

I often thought about leaving and discussed this with coworkers who were frustrated with the boss as well. One of the employees was loosely looking for other jobs until the boss caught wind of it. He confronted the guy for searching for jobs and then sat us all in a room. He told us he wasn’t planning on hiring anyone else and that we were the team, and told us not to look for other jobs. 

A month later, right before I would qualify for unemployment benefits, I was let go. The boss wanted to save money so he combined roles. On my way out, he stopped me to tell me he “considered us friends”. Funny enough, everyone was jealous of me because I made it out of there first. Within half a year, all of the other employees had quit. 

Fast forward to recently, in a perhaps petty act, several ex employees decided to write bad reviews on the company. I wrote an extremely honest review, including both the good and the bad. Since these reviews were posted anonymously, there were suddenly really good reviews popping up to combat the bad ones. Rather than reviewing the company, the good fake reviews just countered the bad reviews, calling them ‘fake’ and ‘written by one disgruntled employee’. I was later told by someone who still worked there, that the boss was asking all of them to write positive reviews. 

This is pretty much how the story ends. The good news is that this shitty job really lit the fire under me, so to speak. I never wanted to be stuck in such a position anymore, so I worked my way up and have found decent financial success. 

**TLDR** Worked an unpaid job with lots of requests and expectations. Working with the boss was like being in an abusive relationship. "
89xbrf,1,2018-04-05,Leaving college town for a job but my girlfriend doesnt have the resources to join me.,jtguthrie12,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/89xbrf/leaving_college_town_for_a_job_but_my_girlfriend/,"Basically to start it off, my girlfriend and I have been together for about a year a half we truly love each other and we have both sacrificed alot. 
In the past she had bills she couldnt pay so I introduced her to an exotic dancer. Long story short she didnt that for about 6 months when I said I couldnt handle it anymore. My parents noticed I was depressed and said they would pay for her biggest bills if she just got a normal job to pay for the rest. They saved us and my sanity. Before you say she is lazy and shouldnt rely on other peoples money. She denied it very hard and rejected it because she has never gotten help. She used her financial aid but that ran out because of what her parents make but refuse to help her. She had a job but the job let her go and it was getting in the way of her studies anyways. She picked up an uber job and does that frequently but the bills cant be paid just by that.

Fast forward we are both studying and coming up on graduation. I have a few job opportunities down in the bay which Im planning on taking. They would set me up and give me great experience out of the box so I think its a smart idea.

The hospital she is interning with is not hiring which she thought would be a forsure thing since most other hospitals that took interns, hired those interns. They did not inform her of this information in the very beginning.My parents are cutting the help now that she is graduating. So now she is at odds with finding a job that will pay the bills as well as the 30k student loans she has over her head. She is starting to say she might have to go back to dancing where she could probably pay that off in a year. 

But Im asking then what? She said she will continue to apply to hospitals and jobs but has to work there in order to feel secure financially. Im telling her I cant handle her doing that. I do feel a bit selfish since it would be what is best for her bills I suppose. Not for our relationship.

We have come to terms that the relationship probably will not last because of my lack of ability to handle her working there, and her not being able to find a job where I am working. I offered long distance. I figure what the hell if I can handle it and we stay in contact cool and if it dies out.. So be it. 

Im at odds with what to do. She sees me as abandoning her in the hardest times. Im.just trying to get a leg up on life. Its sucks no one has tried to hire her but I dont know if I can stay here and do that. I do love her and she is using that against me. If the guy who ""supposively loves me is walking away I guess its better in the hard than the good"". 

What should I do? Stay and try to find a culpable job or leave and see where the wind takes me?  I feel terrible leaving her and imagining my life without her but I dont want to stay lose an oppurtunity and regret it for a long time. "

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

Advice needed.",DogDealBreaker,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/89yqy7/was_planning_on_moving_out_with_my_boyfriend_of/,"Hello everyone! In advance I would like to thank you for reading my dilemma. All advice is much appreciated. I need a bit of clarity. If I am being irrational someone needs to lay it on me! 🙂
______________________________________

My boyfriend and I are planning on moving out together. I have been on my own for awhile and he lives at home with his mom.

At one period of time I was a tad annoyed that he chooses to live at home with herd despite making well over 200k a year. He doesn't pay rent, does not do his own laundry, does not cut his own toe nails, and leaves his dishes in the sink. 

I felt as though he was taking advantage of her generosity, but it turns out that she was encouraging him to stay because, ""It's too expensive to live alone!"" He is 24 years old.

She and I get along really well. There are just certain things that I do not agree with. BUT that's another story.

I have wanted to live together for a while just so that we can take the next step together. However, he always gave me the same excuse, ""It's too expensive.""

The place I was looking into is only 1,200 a month. Which I am more than happy to pay half of including utilities. I will also be providing all of my furniture/appliances since he doesn't have any of his own. 

Frankly, I felt as though our relationship wasn't taken seriously or as though he wasn't as invested as I am. To be completely honest, he is far more invested in himself. Which is fair given our age. 

I won't take that away from him.
___________________________________________

With age, sometimes the dynamic between a man and his mother changes.. and when that happens it may be tough to live together in close quarters.

They started rubbing each other the wrong way. She encouraged him to take advantage of her, but also became annoyed by his behavior.
He wants her to dote on him, but became increasingly more annoyed when she'd start calling him home for dinner.

She also demands that he contacts her if he's staying out past 10PM, or if hes spending the night at my place. Which by the way, is something she isn't alright with him doing for more than two nights in a row.

**Eye Roll**

Anyway, eventually things BLEW UP.
And when I say ""BLEW UP""... I mean that she literally drove to his office and yelled/screamed at him in front of our staff. AND HE threatened to call the cops. She locked up all of his car keys, and he threatened to never speak to her again.

It was un-f*cking-believable.

Things have since been resolved. They've spoken and exchanged apologies- but he's still looking to move out. This was on February 23rd. 

_________________________________________

He has 5 sports cars. Which had quickly become an issue... as most apartments only have two car garages or just a few parking spaces. If that.

We could rent a house, but I cannot afford anything over 1,300 a month. Which leaves us without many options. 

We found a place that happens to be perfect.
I am completely fine with compromising and will park out on the street. He will also claim the office, the larger restroom, and the right side of the bed (lol). In the scheme of things this stuff doesn't really matter to me. So, I'll let it all slide. No need to argue over it. 

UNTIL. He started in on my dogs.
I have two 2 POUND chihuahuas. He adores them but has started complaining out of no where. They currently have to use a pee-wee pad because I don't have a yard. My senior rescue doesn't always make it in time. I can't fault her for that. I clean up the mess immediately. I do not expect him to take care of them. He never has.

Lately he's been making snarky comments about the pee-wee pad, how expensive they are, and about how they'll need to be boarded or come with us on trips (LOL We never go on trips)! This frustrates me because he loves them, and told me not to get rid of them (which I would NEVER do). So WHY the continuous comments? I'm tired of it. 

Finally I had enough, and calmly told him that I have compromised quite a bit for him. So, if he cannot do the same- I don't expect him to live with me. He went on to tell me how the cars were different. They're ""not expensive or living."" Last I checked, this last project cost him nearly 30k?... that's not expensive?

He told me that I was being selfish.
Again. **Not a good choice of words.**
I haven't had said a word about his cars or his picky behavior.
_____________________________________

By picky behavior I am referring to him deciding against several apartments at the complex that we have decided on because his cars would be in direct sunlight... or the water spicket was too far away for him to detail his cars comfortably. Meanwhile, my lease is coming to an end shortly. I have to decide if I am going to renew or not.

This is something that he is aware of.
Basically. Everything has been his way or the highway. I don't have a say in anything. He has been extremely self-centered. 
I tried to explain to him that we likely won't find everything that we have always wanted in an apartment. That's a rarity.
That doesn't seem to stop him from complaining about the color of the stucco either.

I made the mistake of getting frustrated and saying that aside from the compromises that I don't necessarily mind making. I'll be picking up after two people. Doing his laundry, cooking, and cleaning up after him.

Again, I don't really mind doing this either.
So I don't know why I mentioned it. I guess I just felt attacked. He had been commenting negatively about my dogs, saying my place was a mess, and complaining so often that I finally snapped.

His response to my snarky comment was that he has to pick up after me at my own place.
Which is FAR from true. There's a better chance of aliens landing on my porch right now than there is for him to ever come close to having to pick up after me. I take pride in my place and clean the absolute crap out of it daily. I have been featured locally in several blogs and advertisements around town for my decor. -Just tooting my own horn right now. 

______________________________________________


Not to mention, he never comes over. Probably once every two weeks. Because it's a ""waste of time and he could be working."" 
______________________________________

I have also noticed that he has been trying to take over my job recently. Leaving me less to do and a smaller paycheck. I go to school full time, work full time, and I am currently saving to pursue my masters. He told me that I need to stop taking so many classes so that I can work more. I believe that this is his way of trying to enforce that I ""need him."" I wear several hats at the office. My primary role is marketing for our global online retail store. I love my job and I enjoy watching the company grow. Seeing him become even more successful motivates me, and makes me really happy for him. 
____________________________________________
My parents believe that he's threatened by my education, as he dropped out of college to pursue work full time. The more time I spend in class, the less time I am directly benefiting him. They love him, but think that he has ""only child syndrome"" lol. My mom thinks he's a complete narcissist. Which worries her. They're also very old school, so my dad doesn't agree with us splitting things 50/50 since he makes far more money than I do. He also thinks that he should have jumped on living together a long time ago.
__________________________________________
I was offered an internship that will be paid 70k starting out. If I am able to successfully help and market for a local non-profit. I intend on taking the internship if I am fortunate enough to make the cut. 
He wasn't happy for me.
________________________________________

This is the end of my rant. He's starting to behave more like his father. Who is nearly impossible to deal with.
His mom is going to likely lose her absolute mind when he moves out. AND.. in my opinion, we really do not see eye to eye on things. These are all new developments. I don't feel cared for at this point.
_________________________________________

I enjoy taking care of the people I love.
BUT. I do not want to be used or taken advantage of. He does not seem to appreciate anything I do for him, and expects me to sit back and let him have his way 24/7.
This should be a happy time. -A time that involves the two of us.
But it is starting to feel more like I am sitting back waiting on him to make the moves and choices that are right for HIMSELF.
______________________________________________

I apologize for the length of this post.
I know that I sound fairly illiterate haha.
I am having difficulties putting my frustrations into words and have left out several key details for the sake of making this post shorter.  It's 4AM, so I am a complete delusional mess.

I've definitely worked myself up again. So please, bring me back down to earth if I am being unrealistic.
I need an outside perspective.

Thank you again everyone. Have a wonderful Thursday! "
89zigq,1,2018-04-05,"Me [35 M] in LDR with my 31 [31 F] fiancée, I feel like all of my relationships end in LDR and cheating, help!?",SufficientBackground,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/89zigq/me_35_m_in_ldr_with_my_31_31_f_fiancée_i_feel/,"I'm really worried and don't know what to do. I feel like I'm unable to break out of this cycle!

Every time I get in a serious relationship, one of us ends up moving away and then we get in an LDR, and then either I end up cheating and breaking up, or she cheats. I don't even miss the sex, just the companionship. I like having someone to cuddle with and watch Netflix or whatever. It's so jealous when I see other people having fun with their SO but I'm alone.

It's been a pattern for 4 relationships now, including my current one. We have been together for 4 years now, 1 year and three months apart. We met and grew our relationship, then she graduated and took an internship position in a different country (her own). The internship changed to a job and I encouraged her at the time to take the job for the experience and so that there's no blank space after the internship, and regretted doing that. But now she seems to be stuck there and doesn't like her job but is afraid of not having the job of her dreams when she comes back. 

I'm in the same city I was when we met, in fact I moved away for about 8-9 months and hated it, hated doing the long-distance thing, then I moved back because I found a job here. At least we were able to see each other 2-3 out of every 4 weekends. But even that is a serious cramp on our lifestyle.

I don't know why I end up in the same situtation every time and need help! I start talking to other girls to keep away my loneliness feelings but I hate myself for that. I just want friends and to be with my fiancée.

I could use advice on how to convince her to move back, she says if I find the perfect job for her and motivate her to apply she will do it but I think the motivation has to come from yourself. HELP!

**TL;DR;** In LDR with fiancée, she wants to only come back if she already has the perfect job, and I am scared one of us will cheat in the interim and cause the relationship to break. On a higher level, I don't know why all my realtionships end up an LDR :("

Especially as you helped me a lot to make sense of my situation and stuff. 

Soooo, I was home for the easter break and it sucked. Like honestly, after three hours I wanted to go home or to my boyfriend again because it was that shitty (my boyfriend actually suggested I do that because I was quite sick, which was completely ignored and was getting worse every day). 
I endured, I grey rocked, it was all kinda okay (my mum cried eventually because she thought I was trans because I wasn't wearing nail polish and keep my hair short. it was hilarious.) 

The real drama began when I went to get some bloodworks done at my fathers practice. He's been my GP for as long as I can think and there was no discussion of me going somewhere else. Screw ethics and rules of conduct I guess. As I was really tired all the time, couldn't concentrate and froze with the heat on high I thought It couldn't do any harm.

When I was at my grandma's a few days later my parents came to pick me up and he announced he'd inject me right now with some vitamins. On the couch of my grandma. Casually. As if it was totally normal to decide whether or not I should get injected with something at that very second without even asking for permission or explaining the results. I study medicine and can interpret lab sheets. All he had to do was show it to me and I'd have understood and accepted the treatment. 

When I refused and he got angry, told me I could go and get myself a new GP because he wouldn't treat me if I was that noncompliant and honestly I was so glad. 
When we got home after two hours of driving in silence shit hit the fan. 
I told him why I didn't want that injection, hoping to clear the air a little and prevent a huge fight  and he just ignored me. Completely. Once I started talking he just left the room to feed the dog or do some other stuff and thought that was completely ok. 
The situation escalated further, he shouted at me for my political views (which are apparently too left wing and gay friendly), threatened to divorce my mum if I didn't start behaving properly and played every angle.

Once my mum came home (she left briefly when the fight started because she can't be bothered stepping in and doesn't want to witness any violence that might go down) he asked whether she'd have any use for me this summer (I work 10-12h shifts in his practice once i'm home to ""Pay"" for my tuition). Because he considered me no longer useful. (I'm quoting here, that shit was so far from normal), she stated that she couldn't give me any kind of work. 
I told them that I wouldn't come then, that it really wasn't that bad for me and I'd gladly do a whole lot of probably even paid internships somewhere else. It was all really exhausting but liberating at the same time. Especially as there were some things I wanted to say for a very very long time. 

My father started crying after a while, he apologised (for the first time ever, according to my mum) for treating me that way and actually asked whether I wanted to come and work with him because I'd be more than welcome. 

I decided against it. Because honestly I don't want to go to my parents house for 8 weeks on the short lived promise that everything will be different this time. It was never any different before so why should it be now? 
So I decided I'd come, work for two weeks, do an internship and then maybe work a little more. No longer than three weeks in hell, the less the better. 
My father agreed (he didn't really have a choice though) and I'm technically free from his bullshit now. I can go and be taught by people who actually lead in their fields and it will be so great. 

He's now throwing money, presents and pleasantries at me and thats ok, but wont change anything. It is how it is. 

When I told my therapist about this argument (today) she was pleasantly surprised and actually used the term narcissistic when describing something my father does. And it felt so fucking good. Hearing from a medical professional, that I'm kinda right in my opinions and not completely out of line definitely made a difference. Even though anyone I talked to shared the same views.

It's just all getting so much better currently and I actually feel great. I've earned so much freedom in these last weeks, it's unbelievable.A few days ago I told, that I don't want to join in on the family vacation in southern France this year (because I'd be on my own and bored) and there was no fight. I expected total chaos, them blowing up my phone, disrespecting boundaries and all of that but it was fine. Nothing but a ""Well, good to know"". 
That's just so awesome. Especially as NC isn't really an option for me currently and I really had to set some firm boundaries sooner or later. "

Lately I’ve just felt so depressed, anxious and tired all the time and I can draw it all up to school. For the longest time, I thought I wanted to go to law school and become a lawyer. So I started down that path and even landed an internship at my state’s department of justice. But I’m not happy with the classes or with the internship and don’t feel like it will get better. I do currently have a job, I’m working part time in a local and at least famous locally Spanish radio station as an ad production manager. It also helps to be Mexican and bilingual. I’ve been there for a year and a half now. I get along great with everyone and feel happy there. I feel like if I drop school, and not only dedicate my full time to the station, try to work and get hours with some of the other English stations that work in the same building (I talk and get along with them too), but also make time to learn and work with some of the sales team that I also get along with, I could get a full time radio sales executive job. I feel like that’s what I want to do, I would just need to make sure my Spanish is better and learn on the job how to do it. I should mention I did land this part time job with no prior communications experience, only worked in restaurants before. But they still hired and kept me around. The idea of having more work experience, more networking and not worrying as much about education or GPA or things like that to get a job seems to spreading a lot these days. Plus with how expensive college is, it’d be nice to get rid of that cost. With me not only being in the door, but have put time in, I feel like this would land me a good job where I’ll be happy with the people around me. I’m just scared to tell my parents cause I’m their first born son and always put the idea that college is vital and feel without college, you can’t succeed. Any advice would be appreciated."

From your personal view/experience, what is a reasonable &amp; feasible career move from here towards that direction? Should I pursue a particular degree, or seek a job in a VR/simulation company. Do you have any recommendations? 

Ideally I want to be among a team of really brilliant people working/researching on some sort of advanced VR simulation project. I'm perfectly happy to be an intern. I'm not really looking for a high paying job (I can make money as a freelancer). "

Just a few things I want to go over. First, the tailgate. We have gotten only two more people to sign up to bring things. There are around 20 groups who have not signed up at all. I don't need everyone to sign up to bring something, but I ask those who can bring something to bring something. Whether that's a table, burgers, hot dogs, cheese, I'd be thankful. Sign up here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxNdnrhGpQlyGtdnyL-s-3CmKGV5SDBRw0Idp5u3OCtYuJPQ/viewform

Also, here is the current tailgate list: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2DRwgtEHbuGMdxb53ySPH9SgEzAvj3vukfltz0Dpdo/edit?usp=sharing

Second: Due to the fact that there is a 100% chance of snow on Saturday in Reading, we are moving the tailgate to the second-to-top level of the South Penn Garage. Last year, we tailgated on the top (and had some fantastic parkour entertainment), but the weather is forcing us to need a roof. Hopefully we won't have any issues tailgating on the second level.

Third: If there is someone in a suit coming on the bench with a camera, that's either the current Royals broadcast intern or Broadcaster. I believe the broadcast intern (Mike) will come down and do on-bench interviews with the players. I will put this in the game video if it happens. Just be prepared!

I will hand out your tickets before the actual game that night. We will all be in the same section, so it won't really matter where we all sit in terms of seat numbers. We will be getting free Royals t-shirts, too. Also, the first 2,500 fans get Royals rally towels.

If you still want to sign up for the Royal Takeover on Saturday, please sign up here (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIWPjWt8UhSfjBE2rmErB47Cg3TJfmeGU88ia72j2Ecf1n1A/viewform) and contact me ASAP!

Alright, that's all I have. I'll see you guys in Reading on Saturday. Make sure you are in the garage by 1 at the latest!

Thanks,

8a0ogy,97,2018-04-05,A Dutch birth story,murpahurp,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/8a0ogy/a_dutch_birth_story/,"I had my baby boy March 1st and I finally found the time to write up his birth story. I've always enjoyed reading birth stories and I hope you'll find it interesting to read how things are done here. 
It's long, but there's a TLDR in the end. 

**Dutch healthcare regarding pregnacy and labour:**

I'll start by telling you a bit about how healtcare for pregnant women is organized here. First off, healthcare insurance here is mandatory. That means that there are no costs apart from your monthly premium (somewhere around €90, if you have a low income the state compensates you for €80-ish). All women see midwifes during their prenatal appointments and they also do the births and you only get referred to an OB if you are considered high risk. I'm not high risk so I saw a team of midwifes at a local practice and they arrange the appointments in a way that you've seen every midwife in the practice before you give birth. 
Home births have been the standard here since basically forever, but in the last few years this has shifted to mostly hospital births. I too didn't want to give birth at home so the arrangement is that the midwife accompanies you to the hospital for the birth (so still no OB unless the midwife deems it necessary and then she will transfer care onto the OB on call)

**Actual birth story**

Now on to the actual birth story. At 38 weeks I had a day of false labour with contractions that eventually ended after taking a shower. During the days after I gradually started losing my mucus plug (which looks like snot really, but then really really wet). At 38+6 I woke up in the morning and felt wet in my crotch area. I decided to first go pee and check if I had finally become incontinent or if this was my water breaking. My pants definitely didn't smell like pee, it was a weird sweet smell that I didn't recognize. Then I went to sit on the bed on the mattress protector to see of I was actually leaking. I was. So I got dressed, had breakfast and called the midwife. 

Since I wasn't having any contractions and you don't go to the hospital unless you are in active labour she told me she'd be over later that morning. When she came over later that morning the contractions had started (at 11-ish) and I still felt fine. I was instructed to call again if they were at the famous 5-1-1 and that she would be back later that afternoon. As soon as the front door closed behind her the contractions started ramping up and I got to 5-1-1 at about 4 PM. At that point I could still handle them pretty well and I was about 2 cm dilated and fully effaced. I was instructed to call again when the contractions were becoming unbearable. So we continued watching the making of the Hobbit (we had done a LOTR and the Hobbit marathon in the week leading up to labour and were now down to the last disc of the extra material)

Again, as soon as the door closed behind her, contractions started ramping up. This is when the horrible leg labour started. There was no way to get through them other than having my husband rubbing my legs hard during each contraction. It felt like someone was stabbing my quadriceps during every contraction, and in between my legs were shaking like crazy. 
At this point it was around 5.30 pm and my husband started feeding me slices of pizza in between the contractions because he knew I would need my strength later. 
I started thinking what the definition of unbearable contractions are. Was this it? Or was I being a pussy? After a few more contractions I decided that this feeling of ""I'm not sure I'll be able to handle these contractions much longer"" enough to warrant another call to the midwife, especially since it was a 20 minute drive to the hospital and any type of painkiller could easily take another hour. 

Husband called, midwife came: 5 cm. As soon as she heard I was having leg labour she suggested gong to the hospital for painkillers. Getting painkillers also meant she would have to transfer my care to the OB on all. I didn't care, I just wanted the pain to end at that point. So on to the hospital we went and it was horrible. It was the coldest night of the year (-10 C) and having contractions while shivering in a car that is going around a corner is hell. They also made us wait ridiculously long before opening the gate to the special parking area next to L&amp;D. 
I was admitted somewhere around 6.30 pm and was offered fentanyl (which would have to be turned off for pushing) or an epidural which would last all the way through the end. I opted for the epidural and it was heaven. Getting it placed sucked because I had to sit through 2 contractions sitting upright with an arched back but after that it was wonderful. The leg contractions were gone and though I could still feel the contractions in my stomach it was nothing I couldnt handle. I also still had full feeling and control of my legs. We got back to L&amp;D somewhere around 9 pm and by then I started to feel some serious pressure in my pelvis. They checked me and I was at 9 cm dilation. Soon afterwards I started getting the urge to push and they made me wait until the urge was unbearable even in between contractions. When it was time to push and I had my legs up (one foot on the OB, one on the intern and my hands behind my knees) I suddenly didn't feel the urge anymore but there was no going back now. In 22 minutes I pushed my son out and I had a second degree tear. I felt the famous ring of fire and exactly at that point I was in between contractions so I couldn't push. That was the longest minute of my life!

Our son was doing fine, and we were released from the hospital at 2.30 am (yes I'm not kidding) when the epidural had worn off and I was able to pee. In hindsight I'm not so happy about this, because it ment I had to go home with a newborn at -10 degrees C. As a result the baby was too cold by the time we got home and it took us a full day to get his temperature right. 

**Post partum**

In the Netherlands you get 8 days of post-partum care at home by a nurse. This is wonderful. She took care of my stitches, took care of the baby while teaching us how to do it ourself and she cleaned, did the laundry and made me breakfast, lunch and snacks. Oh and she taught me how to breastfeed and pump. This was all very necessary because I felt like crap. I had serious baby blues, breastfeading was hard (engorgement sucks!) and the post partum care even got extended to 10 days because we all felt like I wasn't ready to take care of the baby (or myself). 

The first few weeks were so hard. I hardly slept because every little sound the baby made would wake me. And without sleep I can't function and end up as a crying mess. I cried about everything and nothing. So finally 2 weeks ago I started sleeping with earplugs so I wouldn't hear all the little noises the baby made (we did rooming-in) and my husband would wake me up if he needed feeding. In reality I usually woke up before that because I somehow magically know when the baby needs us. Mommy instinct is real. This week we moved him to his own room because he still kept us awake with all the noise he makes in his sleep (he basically mimics a very loud goat at random intervals). Now we're all happier actually because the baby sleeps quieter and longer intervals (and he's really not that far away from us, it's like 5 meters from our bed instead of 1.5 and we don't even close the doors). 

In the meantime the baby is thriving. He breastfeeds like a champ, and I'm expecting his first smile any day now (he's been smiling in his sleep after feeding and after pooping). He's getting big and heavy and now at 5 weeks I finally feel like we'll all be okay and happy. It will be a long time though before I'll ever consider having another one. I used to think I wanted two kids (and in theory I still want to) but this has been the hardest month of my life. My husband and I agreed to evaluate when our son turns 1, and then maybe make the decision to ever do this again. 

TL;DR: water broke first, contractions started a few hours after. Horrible leg labour and wonderful epidural. Had baby boy after 11 hours of contractions and 22 minutes of pushing. Post partum life is hard. "

I graduated college with a degree in TV &amp; Film, but haven't had much luck finding a job.  Recently, though, I got an offer to be an AV Tech at a hotel chain in my city.  The problem is that I also got another job offer for an IT Intern position, and now I have to make a decision on which job to take.

I've always enjoyed working with AV equipment, but I'm uncertain of what type of career path that I can take as an AV Technician.  Like if I start off as an AV Tech for this company, what kind of doors would this open for me in the future?  Also, what kind of salary am I to expect?

IT, on the other hand, has a more straightforward career path that I can plan out.  I've come here seeking out advice for this predicament.

Thank you

8a1hc4,4013,2018-04-05,Will you be a Nuggets fan tonight?,darjman,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8a1hc4/will_you_be_a_nuggets_fan_tonight/,"Dear Friends,

I implore you that on this night, you root for the Nuggets. As we play the Timberwolves tonight, it is the most consequential game for our team in over a decade. A win versus the Timberwolves tonight could put us in a strong position to make the postseason with a decent seed and a loss could put us in danger of missing the playoffs altogether. If there is any compassion in you, send us your positive vibes.

I’m twenty-four and have been a Nuggets fan my entire life. It means I can remember the excitement I had the team made the Western Conference Finals and promptly got shat on by Kobe, Kobe and Kobe. My friend and I rebelliously stayed up hours after after our curfew and past midnight on a sleepover to watch the Nuggets play the Jazz in Utah on a 10inch tv screen the year after. I remember the elation of Melo winning the Rookie Challenge MVP and the heartbreak of them losing to Kobe and Pau in what was supposed to be our year.

There is nothing as sweet as playoff basketball and us Denvernites have been denied it for too long. For those of still hanging around since the first time Billups was here, we’ve endured 5 years of being in the snow. 5 years of watching scrubs like Wilson chandler, Wilson Chandler, and Michael Malone log heavy minutes for us. 14 years of mismanagement by Kronke and Kronke jr. 14 years of draft blunders like trading the 13th pick (Donovan Mitchell) for the 24th and Trey Lyes and drafting two point guards in the lottery and neither of them being Steph Curry. 14 years of optimism dashed by Carmelos trade or Kenyon Martins broken knees.

We need this. If there is any mercy in you, root for us to end the drought.

Sincerely, Nuggets fan. 

Edit: Now that I got everyone's attention, anyone hiring a Finance Intern? 

PS: If you vote Nuggets, Jokic will average a triple-double in the playoffs.

EDIT: THE GAME IS ABOUT TO START BABY. LETS GO NUGGETS.

I’m a senior in college in NYC graduating this May, major in finance with a pretty dense resume (I’ve held about 7 internships throughout my college career). And one of the more recent internships I’ve had was an operations intern at another investment fund. 

I’ve completed 9 weeks of an internship at a pretty awesome hedge fund full of geniuses and growing at a fast rate. They’re expected to continue to expand. The internship ended yesterday and I got an e-mail this morning stating they would like to offer me a position but they wanted to call and hash out some details. 

Here’s how the selection process worked - not sure if this helps. 
1. Received about 800 resumes interviewed 75
2. Accepted 13 (originally supposed to be 12 but I interviewed very late and they admitted I was the 13th intern) 
3. Accepted 4 interns as full time (they told us early on they would only ask 4 interns max)

I know this isn’t an offer yet, and it’ll also be a call to negotiate salary. I’ve never done this and I’m worried I’ll be underpaid. I worked extremely hard to be where I am today. I ran away from home two years ago and have been fighting to live paycheck to paycheck and the last thing I want is to not get paid how much I deserve. I also know out of everyone they hired I am the only one with any operations experience. 

The hourly salary they paid all the interns would amount to about 60,000 a year so I know I can go above that but I’m not sure by how much. I don’t want to go too high but I also want to make sure I get as close to the highest they can offer as possible. 

Any advice on what to do? And how to maneuver this call tomorrow? "
8a23bs,0,2018-04-05,M4M/M4A/M4T - The Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,GayRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayRP/comments/8a23bs/m4mm4am4t_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Usual disclaimer of course - we're all adults here, right? This is just a fantasy, and if you're not old enough to be on this page I don't want to hear from you

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

a) an infatuation with drugs and alcohol, which i’ve always had, but have always kept myself under control with it. 

b) mom and pops split up last year, pops went pretty mad and threatened vicious, unmentionable things toward me, my brother, and my mother. i remained apathetic throughout all this.

c) my ex-girlfriend began seeing one of my other friends, with the help of two of my other friends. they’ve since broken up, i no longer talk to her, or the two friends who set her up.

d) toward the beginning of the year, i noticed the correlation between my weed smoking and my ability to create things. whenever i smoked with some of my friends, we’d sit in a room and make beats and freestyle on them non-stop. i think, all things considered, i wanted to tap into that spot since i started taking music a bit more seriously, as well as this internship i’m currently at which has me doing cool video editing things.

e) i was diagnosed with depression @ 18, and have had bouts of anxiety since october of 2016, when i had a bit of a coke phase. neither ever subsided, and neither were ever treated for. i just know how to cope with them.

f) i’m a pretty heavy drinker. i never crave a drink, but i do have a habit of drinking when i’m out with my friends, or going on a date. i’d say i drink about 4-6 times a week, with most of those times being a 6/10 on the drunk scale. i hardly get sloppy unless i’m partying.

things were going phenomenal. i was seeping into the person i was aiming to be for so long. i had a healthy social and romantic life, i was cool with my mom, i was confident. then, last tuesday, while closing out at my retail job, i was offered a dab. while high off it, i was told some stuff about a really close friend of mine that broke my heart- in short, he was slandering me. after sending him a viciously worded text, the next few days i was experiencing the absolute worst depersonalization- something that’s never happened before. i felt like i was watching myself. i felt suspicious of myself. i would look at pictures i took the week prior and legitimately not feel a sense of connection to the person in the pictures- as if it were someone else. i had bouts of nausea and fear on the bus. i thought i was going crazy. i had really insane, grotesque thoughts i’d rather not share. so i stopped taking the bus and began ubering everywhere (started eating away at my bank account, duh!) i had two dates that week, with both making me immensely uncomfortable and completely unsociable that i cut out of both early. i took a day’s break from all drugs i regularly consumed (so no caffeine, which i actually ended up quitting entirely, no weed, no alcohol). when the weekend came though, i relapsed and was back on my bullshit. 

it’s wild though because i still don’t feel like the person i was prior to that dab hit at my job. i feel in this constant limbo state, and sometimes i become this exaggerated version of who i used to be (just really overly confident and very apathetic) or i slip into this numb depression, the heaviest i’ve felt in a while. i went through with plans to buy a dab pen (which i was planning on doing for about a month now). and started taking hits of that at the beginning of the week. the dab hits are always a toss up- i either feel somewhat alright, with my anxiety posted up and ready to be dominant, or i just become totally off the walls- all your standard symptoms of psychosis present. weird, arbitrary epiphanies, anxiety about the barber cutting my hair, nightmares that seem like they last forever but in reality i’ve only been sleeping for half an hour, etcetc.

i just wanna be back to the person i am, or at least be on the path to being a better person than i was before. i wholeheartedly believe this is possible. i just wanted to share this somewhere, and maybe get some advice moving forward ((i plan on not smoking anymore, don’t worry)). i started drinking tea (fucking amazing by the way), meditating, running, listening to calmer music, stopped going on dates (for now), and started spending more time with my close friends (of which i have about three). i’m chilling on my bed after one of said nightmares. i’m coolin’ for right now."

Should the Jim and Sam Show be renewed?,BeerCanThick,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/8a2ric/covino_and_rich_just_got_renewed_for_2_years/,"So what is the purpose of Jim and Sam now that Covino and Rich got renewed? You know, if you're Jim and Sam you might be thinking, ""If they'll renew Covino and Rich, they'll renew anything. This show isn't any good, but its at least as good as NUSSIE RADIO.""

From the SXM standpoint, is it? For whatever reason, perhaps just ego keeping them from admitting they made a very poor judgment on talent with Covino and Rich, they're still on the air. They exist as their own show. Its not Third Mic and the Intern in the Morning. I can see this show having a reason to be on the air 6 years from now. Does Jim and Sam have that reason? Opie and Anthony fan retention when that show went off the air when Obama was president? I don't think that is very compelling. 

You can get them to start at 6 instead of 8. I'm sure the DUDEBROS won't act like the Sleep Apnea kid and bullshit about the west coast. They'll just do those hours. They'll give you 6 to 10 for a lower price and won't bitch about it. 

I wouldn't be surprised at all if Jimmy got the Opie treatment and got shanghai'd to a later timeslot. He's adamant about mornings and if they say, ""Middays or beat it, your pick,"" the WB Vulture will fly the coop. Then you have Sam Roberts doing his scintillating combo of Entertainment Weekly, WWE shit in kayfabe like its 1993 and cornball-brotha mainstream wiggerism that would shame Michael Rappaport.

This show might be off the air sooner than you think.

8a2ue4,50,2018-04-05,[Discussion] Retail vs Rep Comparison - Balenciaga Homme Sweatshirt,Dalishibababa,DesignerReps,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignerReps/comments/8a2ue4/discussion_retail_vs_rep_comparison_balenciaga/,"Hey guys, had some free time today so decided to post a retail vs rep comparison of the Balenciaga Homme sweatshirt for any of you guys still interested. 



Backstory: Purchased the Kappler rep version when I was in China doing an internship last summer, the guy is incredibly famous amongst Chinese rep purchasers, hence why most of his stuff sells out pretty fast. I've bought stuff from him for ages and he's 99% of the time delivered quality products for pretty good prices. The one I originally got was one of the poorer embroidery ones, so I wechatted Kappler again detailing the situation, and since he knew me from buying from him for years, he told me to send it back and he sent me a better one. I wore it a couple of times but because of the weather in China I ended up not wearing it much at all. I'm now in the UK doing uni and got notified on one of the balenciaga facebook groups that ssense had done a restock of these sweatshirts so I sorta hastily purchased one cause I was curious to the accuracy. I've decided to keep the retail one and I'll explain why later. I've attached comments comparing the two in the album, sorry for the bad camera, really not many places to take good pics in my house. 

Photos: https://imgur.com/a/hQcq7

Quality: The quality of the material one on the Kappler one is the exact same as the retail, just from material alone there is no difference other than maybe Kappler's being a millimeter thicker cotton. It's actually ridiculous, can't believe how much retail makes out of these products. In terms of the embroidery, Kappler's is a bit wonky in certain areas, notably around the cities, the Homme is on point, but interestingly enough some of the crooked parts people mentioned on the rep reviews were actually all on retail as well, however with the reps the makers slightly overdid them like half a millimeter. 


Sizing: Now this is the part that influenced me kinda to buy retail just to see. One of the primary reasons this sweatshirt blew up in the first place was because Asap rocky wore it in that famous picture. I remember seeing it and really liked how oversized it was. I purchased Kappler's version in size L (the largest he had) and purchased retail in size M (everyone on the facebook group mentioned how large these fit), and compared these 2 look exactly the same size when hung up. However, Kappler's one actually has a slightly tighter waistband, and thus when I wear the retail since I put on quite a bit of muscle it crunches up higher than I would like it to, making it a bit more cropped than I would like it, whereas with the retail it drapes lower, more like the asap rocky fit. I wish I could take fit pics of it but there arent really any good mirrors in this student house haha


Overall: Quality is exactly the same, embroidery is the weaker part but still pretty good. I'm planning on selling both since leaving UK soon so not gonna be able to carry that much. If interested I'm looking for around 60 pounds for the Kappler rep, primarily interested in buyers from UK. I'll also be doing more of these reviews+selling some reps I've accumulated for the wardrobe clear out soon so keep an eye out guys if interested. Thanks for reading and ask if you guys have any questions

I'm an undergrad CS student currently in my last semester. I landed an internship for this summer with a very good company and I got assigned to do some research about web crawlers and which one would fit our needs of crawling news sites for the project I'm going to work on.  
Some basic prerequisites are that the crawler should be open source, scalable, support delta crawling.  
After doing the initial research I narrowed it down to Scrapy and Apatche Nutch. Having some small experience with Scrapy, I'm leaning towards using it.  
I got asked to take a look at scaling with Scrapy and [Apache NiFi](https://nifi.apache.org/). To be completely honest, I'm a bit at a loss here and overwhelmed. I can't quite understand how this could work.
    
So my questions are the following:  
1. Is it possible to make a single universal crawler that could crawl news sites and correctly parse the news articles, authors, media, etc. (even though every site has a different structure)?  
2. Has anyone any experience with Apache NiFi and how to use it to scale crawling with Scrapy?  
3. Are there any other ways to scale (delta-)crawling with scrappy I should consider?


Any input is really appreciated."

I don't like jumping to conclusions without hearing both sides, so I tried to email the politician's office with a couple of clarifying questions. When I reached their ""contact me"" page, they said they only receive email from constituents in their district (I was in an area code next to theirs). I could have simply put in an address that is inaccurate, but I don't like to lie.

I absolutely understand that these people are very busy (giving them the benefit of the doubt) and it is impossible to answer everyone. However, they must have a bunch of interns who have the job to specifically answer basic questions for their boss. Moreover, I hate the whole ""fake news"" epidemic that everyone is aware of. I feel like I did the most responsible thing possible. I read an article, did some background research, and then attempted to get the other side. Is it unreasonable of me to think that anyone should be able to contact an elected official, even if they aren't in your district? Is there a better way to get my questions through to them? "
8a4b5e,1,2018-04-05,Moving out of parents' house next year: Emergency fund vs. paying off student loan?,chief343,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8a4b5e/moving_out_of_parents_house_next_year_emergency/,"Hey everyone, I'm currently a master's student approaching the end of the first year of a two-year program. My wife and I live with my parents, which cuts living expenses down to virtually zero. We plan to live with them until June of next year, when I graduate. At that point we'll move out and rent an apartment wherever I end up working after graduation. Groceries and housing are covered by them, they let me use the car to commute to school, and even pay for the gas. After scholarships, my total education expenses for the first year of the program come out to $20,500, which I have covered with a Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan at 6%. The loan has been disbursed in three equal payments, each at the start of each academic quarter, starting back in October 2017. The loan covers any remaining tuition costs, books, and health insurance for my wife and me.

I haven't worked for the first couple quarters of my program to allow me to focus full-time on my studies, but as a result I currently have $0 in savings. Thankfully, I'm starting a part-time paid internship at a large software development company close to home next week. The internship switches to full time at the end of the academic quarter in June 2018, and is set to end the first week of September 2018. There is the possibility the company keeps me on after the end of the internship on a part-time basis for the whole second year of my program (Sept. 2018 - June 2019). My understanding is it's common for them to retain their graduate student interns on into the school year, and on to full-time in the best-case scenario.

As part of my admission offer to this program, on top of the scholarships, I was awarded a TA fellowship for the whole second year of my program, which offers a nice TA salary. The second year of the program would have ended up costing me another $20,500 however TA's have their tuition and insurance covered on top of the salary, so I would just be paying out of my paycheck my wife's insurance, books, and other academic expenses totaling $5,000 for the second year of the program, which I will detail in the next paragraph.

With the job offers I have in writing, and assuming the internship ends in September 2018 and doesn't continue into the second year of my program, I earn about $10,000 total in take-home pay from the internship. The TA position will come out to around $18,000 in take-home pay total by the time I graduate. Health insurance for my wife is $3300/year, books are around $200/quarter (I rent off Amazon for cheap whenever possible, but sometimes there are eBooks that have to be purchased at around $100, so $200/quarter for books is a conservative estimate), $111/quarter for parking, and campus fees of around $328 per quarter comes out to roughly $5,000 total in expenses for the second academic year, as I mentioned previously. $28,000 total take-home pay minus the $5,000 expenses brings me to $23,000. If the internship extends for the whole second year of the program, that's roughly $10,000 on top of those $23,000 for a total of $33,000. So for right now, only the $23,000 can be assumed, with the $33,000 as a best-case scenario.

Now that you have a fairly descriptive picture of my financial situation, what would be the best option financially for me? I want to make sure we have enough to be able to move out comfortably once I graduate and start my career. At the same time, it would be nice to take out a large chunk of that student loan to minimize total interest paid so we can start saving for a house once we move into our apartment. I feel like I would need to balance somewhere in between, saving up a sufficient emergency fund to move out and start renting an apartment/purchase a car, etc. and making a huge dent in my student loan with whatever is left over. Any guidance/suggestions for helping me plan?"

Original email from Jim St. Ledger. 

Several of you have already heard the very sad news of the passing of our dear friend and colleague Venky.  He was ""Mr. DPDK"" to many, a nod to his invention and creation of DPDK about ten years ago (before it was called DPDK.)  Of course his footprints across the industry and literally across the globe are everywhere. If you know what ATCA is, well, Venky had his hands and inventions deeply into the creation of that PICMG spec and many of the first revision products. He touched on and gave guidance to projects spanning Linux/netdev, DPDK, Intel QuickAssist Technology, BSD stacks, OVS, OPNFV, FD.io, all-things-virtualization (KVM, Xen, VMware, Hyper-V, etc.), ETSI, IETF, containers, and so many other arenas that my brain can't remember at this dark moment.

If you knew him and engaged him, especially on deep technical discussions, you knew you were talking to someone with the rare combination of skills that went incredibly deep both on the hardware, silicon side of platforms but also on the software, networking side of the platforms.  Rarely did I find a topic that Venky wasn't well versed on. And by ""topic"" I mean everything from football to photography to history to politics and many other subjects well beyond the technical realm our day jobs find us in. Conversations with Venky were a treat. Traveling with him was an adventure. Debating with him was a lesson. I will so miss all of him.

Below are some details on a memorial service this Sunday in Oregon and also a GoFundMe page. If you're in Oregon or close by please join the service. Venky left behind a wife, Priya, and two young girls, Adhiti and Namrata. While I'm sure they are overwhelmed with sadness and grief at the moment they can use our support. Please consider supporting the GoFundMe memorial fund for his family.

Lastly, my network extends through this distribution list.  But Venky's network was one hundred times broader. Please share this sad news through your own networks.

Thanks,
Jim

To All,
Today is a very sad day for our NPG team and Intel.  Our dear friend and colleague, Venky Venkatesan, passed away early morning today after a tough battle with cancer.

Aside from his deep contributions to the organization, Venky provided technical mentorship to many employees and greatly impacted our technical leadership pipeline.

On a personal level, Venky was very dedicated to his family and also cared deeply about mentoring the next generation of engineers and scientists through efforts like coaching robotics teams and providing guidance to many interns and Intel employees. His passion, dedication and commitment to this organization, Intel, and the external community will be greatly missed.

We will let you know as soon as more information is available for Venky's memorial/celebration service.

Seems legit for a summer internship... but do the numbers. 

They make you pay to get across the country, which can vary in cost depending on whether they drive or fly.  They have to pay for rent and food as well. 

When I interviewed with them, they told me that they'd work for 12 weeks, from 8 am to 9 pm, SIX DAYS A WEEK.  

13 hours a day x 6 days a week x 12 weeks = 936 hours 

If they worked MINIMUM wage in AZ over the summer, they'd make at least $10.50 an hour. 

936 hours * 10.50/ hour = $9828. 

They'd literally make more money staying at school and working minimum wage, and the difference between the two is significantly higher when you consider all of the costs that go along with the ""internship."" 

In addition to that, they said that the average student makes $8,000, but that includes all of the lucky students who make $15,000-20,000. The actually amount that the average student makes is a lot lower than $8,000, probably in the ballpark of $4,000-6,000.

8a7qah,2,2018-04-06,"My lengthy, spoiler-free review of Offerings (1989)",jennycdgurl,horror,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/8a7qah/my_lengthy_spoilerfree_review_of_offerings_1989/,"(Note: this movie is NOT Burnt Offerings with Karen Black, Oliver Reed, and Bette Davis)  
     
I've had the VHS of Offerings for a while. It's got a pretty cool cover. A guy is holding a wrapped present...and it's dripping blood! Kind of makes me think of My Bloody Valentine. But like most awesome horror VHS cover art, this scene as depicted never happens in the movie.  
   
The tagline reads ""Remember him before he dismembers you!"" It's catchy, but perhaps more fitting of National Lampoon's Class Reunion where the killer actually desperately wants to be remembered iirc. NLCR's actual tagline is ""No class has less class than this class,"" which is very true. The people in NLCR make the Bundys look like the Waltons.  
      
Anyway, back to Offerings. If you look up this movie, everything you will see is people calling it a Halloween ripoff. I'm not here to dissuade you of this notion. The killer. The music. It's similar. But it's still its own movie and, while not an all time classic like Halloween, I think it's pretty good. This might be hard to explain, but the thing I like about it is the charm.  
     
Yeah, it's a horror movie, but it's a low budget film made back in the days when low budget still meant you had to know what you are doing. You didn't just pick up a camcorder and say ""Action!"" you had to set up shots. Although, true, there were shot-on-tape movies back then, but this movie is shot-on-16mm film and has some very creative shots. Including one shot that is a great use of shadows on a wall. As a negative, I will say during one scene the camera did get wobbly af and it was weird and noticeable, but brief.  
         
Another negative was the sound quality for most scenes. Sometimes I couldn't hear what the actors were saying! If I ever make a movie, I think I'll expend some of my low budget on sound people (or at least one sound person) because sound quality often seems to be a problem on low budget movies.  
   
One last negative and this might be because of when it came out, but you know how the 80's were like the age of excess, and how in horror movies, that manifested into large amounts of blood, gore, big boobs, loud music, etc? This movie is kind of restrained, which isn't bad, it's just...don't expect Evil Dead 2 or Friday the 13th.  
          
Going back to charm, when I could hear the actors, I liked them. The lead actress' looks reminded me of one of the main actresses from One Dark Night (another good movie). The sheriff was great, likable. The mortician intern (yes) and the Deputy both had brief, but hilarious parts.  
  
The cool thing about all the actors was they were Oklahoma City locals and you could tell with their accents. That was really cool because these are people you don't always see in films. I think they all gave their best possible performances. Like, nobody is going to challenge Jamie Lee Curtis or Donald Pleasence for best acting in a Halloween or Halloween-like film, but they don't sound like they're reading off cue cards either.  
         
Hey, do you happen to know how much it cost to enroll in the Graduate film program at University of Oklahoma in the 1980's? Because that's where a lot of the budget of this movie went! The writer/director/producer Christopher Reynolds got to borrow the 16mm camera (as well as the crew) used to make this movie from University of Oklahoma, where he enrolled as a film grad student and made this film as his master's thesis.  
     
I read that in an article and thought it was a cool anecdote. This is one of those movies where I wish there was a documentary about it because it'd be awesome to hear more stories like this about the making of it.  
     
Anyway, now a little comparison on budgets with screenshots from each film's respective blu rays. Here is a (blu-ray.com) screenshot from the aforementioned One Dark Night, 1983 budget of $800,000:     
http://images3.static-bluray.com/reviews/15464_7_large.jpg  
    
And here is Offerings, 198?-1989 budget of ?:  
http://images2.static-bluray.com/reviews/16756_14_large.jpg  
     
Doesn't the actress from One Dark Night look almost exactly like the actress from Offerings, but in higher resolution/in better lighting/and with more stylized hair? Man what a difference $800,000 makes! Ironically, One Dark Night has its own sound problems, so yeah, I guess a lot of the $800,000 went to hair.  
    
It's true that the 1989 film Offerings does owe a lot to Halloween...but to be fair, Halloween owes a lot to Black Christmas. And Black Christmas owes a lot to Psycho. And so on. Offerings isn't an all time classic, but that's OK because it's still pretty good.  
   
I only have the VHS, but as previously stated, it's available on blu ray, so it's cool that new audiences will be able to see it without having to wait until they can find a VCR that isn't broken to watch it. The new VCR worked good, by the way, so I'm glad!

The gist of the story is that my adult personality is more confident, better looking, and more liked by people in my life but it’s come at the cost of me not having a good work ethic anymore, loosing my ability to pick up new information, and my overall optimism in life. This is sort of the story of love, religion, education, and work...

It started happening 2.5 years ago. I’m now 23, so at the time I was 21 at the time. I had grown up in an evangelical home and considered myself a Christian. I was going into the biological science field but had no issues assimilating evolution and climate change into my Christian view. But then in July of 2015 things started changing. I got in contact with an old ex from high school after 3 years apart and we hit it off well. But I started having these empty feelings. 

I had always been a family guy but starting in August 2015 my family stopped interacting as much. It used to be every weekend we’d have dinner and a game night at my grandparents but this stopped sort of mysteriously. I had been grappling with my faith at the time but I was going to college so I wasn’t really communicating with anyone. I was a commuter and didn’t have many friends at the college because I had switched from three different campuses over my college career and being a commuter I wasn’t saturated in college social life. Instead I had always relied on family as my social life. 

In June 2016 the ex that I had got in contact with ended up cheating on me and ended up with the other guy. I went to a close friend and asked her for a rebound. She obliged and set me up with her evangelical BFF. I was sort of in bad terms with Christianity but I was cool with it if she was. We talked and everything and she was cool, liked her a lot. Went to church with her for the first time and sort of got the creeps from her pastor. Sort of guy that asked for money for the church because it was what God wanted sort of thing. Still was like whatever. I was lonely and willing to put up with it. Went to her baptism and stuff. But she broke it off in September. We were having a random conversation about what our respective dream houses would look like. Well it came out that I favored environmentalism. She immediately dumped me. No questions asked.

Well September 2016 I ended up getting an unpaid internship. I loved what I was doing with the company but it was hard because I was commuting halfway across the state every two days. Spending over $100 in gas a week. I was always tired, working my butt off in school and at the internship. Leaving for school at 6am getting home at 10pm going to the internship at 4am the next day and not getting home til 6pm. Doing this 6 days a week. Now a little bit of background I’ve always been the person to excel. I’ve never had a job where my employer was unhappy with my work and I always was willing to put in long hours for little pay. But here at the internship I was working hard but they would nitpick everything I did. It was sort of ritualistic the coworkers admitted but at the same time when I left the company my exit interview was less than stellar and they basically asked me not to ask for a reference. I was sort of heartbroken tbh. Here I had invested all my time and over $1,000 and I was told I was subpar because of ‘time management’. Yet I was always able to finish the lists given to me each day and then some. I was the kicking bag the entire time because I was working with people I respected. I mean I get it that not everyone is going to like you and that not everyone can do all jobs. But literally half my job as an intern was cleaning work stations and prepping for staff; it wasn’t rocket science.

January 2017: So having spent all this money I had to get a job during the school year because my savings account had been bled dry.  I got a retail job. I just needed to make it one more semester until I graduated. So I started working as a part time employee and asked for 20-30 hrs a week. But because of my work ethic I was quickly bumped up to 40 hrs a week. I didn’t like it since I was going to school two days a week it meant I was busy seven days a week. Went to my manager and asked for less time. Was given it for like 2 weeks. Then it went back up to 40 hours. Called off a few times to keep my hours low, still bounced up. So I was like whatever and I just continued working full time. 

Also at this time I met someone new. We were both super awkward and everything. She was my age but had never dated so I kept things simple. We ended up doing stuff together a few times but she ended up dumping me because I wasn’t attractive to her. Her words not mine. She ended up getting a boyfriend a month later with a guy I’d say was less attractive than I but who am I to say I guess right?

May 2017 I get my first job in my field. It’s nothing exciting but it’s close to home. I quit the retail job... or try to at least. They take my words out of context and keep me on the schedule one day a week. So I put a more articulated 2 weeks in and quit. The new job is only a summer gig but I figure I’ll swing another job by September. September comes and goes. No new job. By November I’m forced to go back to the retail job.

November 2017 I go completely atheist. I come out to my family as being actively non-Christian. It causes issues of course. I still have issues with it. Because I don’t completely not believe in the Abrahamic God but I logically can’t get my head around it anymore.

December 2017 I get rid of all social media that uses my real world persona because the unbearable rhetoric of evangelicals and conservatives. I’ve always been a moderate in the past, always an environmentalist but I’ve had fairly fiscally and socially conservative ideologies. I still do kind of. But in the past I was more conservative leaning but in the past few months I’ve been leaning further and further left. To the point where I’m seriously considering Marxism as a viable economic system. It bothers me honestly because I like being the moderate in the room. My beliefs fall more in line with moderatism but here I am moving more and more left. While at the same time people like my dad whom have been moderate leaning conservatives have become more right leaning. To the point I find it difficult to even talk with him because he will take it straight to religion and use it as his shield. It’s a positive feedback loop.

Also I want to note that the two most important friends in my life sort of faded out during this time too. My bff girl friend got married and we went from talking on a daily basis to not even every three months anymore. My bff boy friend got engaged, he ended up getting dumped and reclusive and he and I haven’t connected the same since. I’ve never been one to have a bunch of friends, but everyone I’ve tried to get friendly with has really just been not what I want in my life. 

But on the other hand I’ve been the most eligible I’ve ever been. At least six girls have been interested in me in the last six months. I turned down each one because I’m pretty confident what I want in a relationship going forward in life. This is partly because I hold onto many of my evangelical beliefs. That marriage should be once in a lifetime is the big one for me; but also not a fan of cohabitation or premarital sex. I know I would not cope well if my nonexistent wife left me which is why I’m so stringent in deciding. 

I’d still probably refuse just because of work. Like I said I went back to an old job that I don’t care about but need to pay my student and car loans. I used to work solely second shift (4p-12a) but at work we’re so short staffed and working on a skeleton crew that I’m working a lot of 8p-4a. But the way scheduling has worked a lot of times I get no free time either from work. I started covering thirds as a favor to the manager but it’s turned into me working a lot of weird shifts. I once worked a week where each day I started an hour earlier than the day before. You get the same amount of time off but the way you a lot your time stays the same so you end up having a week where you did nothing but go to work. Or like I’ll work til 4am but by the time I get home and get settled in and relax enough to fall asleep it’s 8am. It turns a day off into no day off. Or what will happen is I go to sleep at 8am but have to be back at work at 4pm. This week I work two night shifts, two days shifts, and a tweener shift with first and second. My sleep schedule will be all over the place, I’m never well rested, and I’m always tense. On top of it I get paid just above poverty level so all of my money goes to bills right now. 

In other ways I sort of feel like I’m “in the closet”. I don’t discuss my support of evolution, climate change, or socialism to anyone because no one I know supports it. I don’t go into relationships because I’m stringent but also because I’m not super sexual to start with, and I don’t make too many friends because most are either directly opposed to every aspect of life I find enjoyable or are too immature for me. Like I’m beyond the point of wanting to get drunk and talk about genitalia it’s boring and pedantic. Let’s talk about emotions, dreams, and ambitions... fears and sorrows. Let’s not drink vodka or beer every night, let’s drink red wine or coffee. I’ve played around with the idea that I may be greysexual or demisexual lately here too but I don’t know it somehow doesn’t feel completely right. And I feel odd about applying a orientation to myself. 

Here lately I’ve been thinking about getting rid of my phone and the internet altogether. Social media is gone. Why don’t I try and get rid of every superfluous thing in my life? But the internet and my phone are such good resources for knowledge.

Right now I’m the loneliest, the poorest, the most melancholic, the most dispassionate, and most pessimistic I’ve been in my life. I don’t want sympathy or pity. I just wanted to tell someone because right now no one in my life is in the place I am and thereon don’t empathize well. I just want to know someone else is in a spot I am, that I’m not completely alone in life."
8a7wzx,86,2018-04-06,"Been job hunting for 9 months, unemployed for 6...",CrocodilesWhoDraw,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/8a7wzx/been_job_hunting_for_9_months_unemployed_for_6/,"And I just got another rejection letter.

**TL;DR:** Another one bites the dust.

I was fucking qualified for that job. I met all the requirements, flaunted my knowledge a bit, showed off my portfolio that they liked, got along well with everybody I met with, did my research on the work and the company. I fucking wanted to be there and work, and I made sure it showed.

I was qualified for the last job I interviewed for too. They rejected me because “they think you'll be bored.” The fuck? Honestly, I don't give a shit at this point. If i did, I wouldn't have shown up for the interview. And it's not like I work for fun. With a salary like that (unusually high for the area), I can afford to be bored at work and then do whatever the fuck I want in my free time. That's why I want a job in the first place.

But you know who is getting a graphic design job? That kid who *still* can't figure out how to package files or run a spell check and that ""experienced"" designer who hasn't upgraded her software since she graduated in the 90s.

And what the fuck is with all these contracts looking for “specifically Catalog Designers” or “Designers who work in automotive”? I can do catalogs. I can design for automotive. But I also happen to do logos and ads and websites and illustrations for other clients because I'm a goddamn graphic designer. I have to be able to do more than one fucking thing!

But on the flip side, I hate it when employers try to roll the jobs of several people into one and try to pass it off as an “exciting entry level opportunity.” Oh yes, you need to be a “photoshop ninja” who is also a “rockstar with film production” and a “flawless UX/UI designer” and “master coder” with a “love for animation and copywriting.” Sure! Can I file your taxes for you while I'm at it? Which brings me to my final point...

The pay! It's like everyone wants to pay you in dirt! I live near a big city with lots of big agencies and design jobs, but the best salaries I've seen for this level are in the distant suburbs. I'm not kidding when I say that the “competitive” salary out here is not much more than what a receptionist can make. I've seen too many design postings that pay *less* than what your standard receptionist makes. It's pathetic!

It was not my intention to quit my job before having something else lined up. But after five and a half years trying to work my way up this company and still getting garbage clients and “opportunities” all while dealing with extreme levels of unprofessionalism and useless HR, I knew it was high time to quit when I started googling whether or not your job should make you want to kill yourself. So with my bank account’s permission, I quit.

I've applied and interviewed for all kinds of jobs and contracts and fucking internships, only for the company to scrap the position, go with another candidate (like that goddam kid who kerns poorly and doesn't know how to talk to clients), or just never hear from them again. I had some stable contract work for about a month, but otherwise, I've only gotten 1 job offer and it was from a company with an absurdly high turnover rate and an awful reputation.

So here I am. I worked an entry level design/production job while I went to design school, and I excelled at both at the same time. I worked hard to be here. I always made a point to be the best I could be at everything I tried, and everyone I have ever worked with all loved working with me. I've got great references from everyone. But I'm unemployable apparently. This is the career path that I chose so I could take care of myself, but it's just not gonna happen. So I threw together a more generic, less graphic design-focused resumé, and I'm going to start applying for those receptionist jobs. Less stress, similar pay, and maybe I can go back to school, get on a better career path, and just paint in my spare time. Fuck this...

**EDIT:** ~~Here it is.~~ A combination of student work, client work, and a WIP passion project or two. Depending on the employer, I will take certain pieces out and replace them with something more relevant, but this is gist of what I do. Burn it alive, reddit.

Most of my career thus far has mainly been in a fast-paced print environment. I do digital work as well, but I've yet to do it extensively in a professional setting. I consider myself to be a strong typographer, layout designer, and production artist with an interest in all things related to logos and branding.

If this is just the worst you've ever seen and you don't think I have anything to offer, please be more honest than my professors and just fucking tell me so I can stop wasting everyone's time.

My last job paid about $16.50/hr. I'm looking for $18-20/hr as an employee or $25-$30/hr for contract/freelance work. Yes, I've been in touch with my contacts. Yes, I'm working with recruiters. Sometimes my email is spammed with all their stuff, and other times I don't hear from them for weeks. I show up on time to all my interviews dressed anywhere from business casual to business professional, and I send ""thank you"" and follow up emails.

**EDIT 2** Thank you for your feedback. I appreciate your honesty. "
8a80ao,0,2018-04-06,M4M - the Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8a80ao/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"I hope you can tell from my sparkling prose that I'm an adult. I'm also only looking for adult partners for roleplay - its like let's pretend only stickier

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

Other kinks! https://m.imgur.com/MTINyO2"
8a8jyu,3,2018-04-06,College Coursework HELP!,abirchler3,CFP,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFP/comments/8a8jyu/college_coursework_help/,"So, I am a second-year college student who is very passionate about a future career in financial planning. I am currently a finance major at a very very reputable business school, but upon interviewing at a few financial firms for internships and speaking with some local financial advisors, several mentioned a degree program through another department at my university that is financial planning specific and fills the CFP education requirement (my current major does not). 

I would like to graduate on-time as I have already pushed my education back a full year for military service and do not wish to be in school longer than I have to. 

My current options the way I see it are to either switch to this program that offers completion of CFP education requirement and minor in business (which will allow me to graduate on time) OR remain a Finance major and minor in this alternative program which would allow me to complete the classes needed for CFP (but add another full semester to my education, plus it can’t be completed in the Summer term so I would be prolonging my inability to work a full-time job essentially another full year).

PROS to switching:
- Complete CFP with no additional coursework
- Graduate when I plan to

CONS to switching:
- Graduate from a much much less reputable program
- Lose many of the benefits from being in this reputable college (ie. Networking events, programs, employment opportunities, career resources, etc.) 

More context: 
- I am 99.9% dead set on becoming a financial planner in the future so no excessive need to pursue the broader finance degree just to keep different options open
- I have received many recommendations to look into this alternative program from local firms
- I plan to eventually get my MBA (hopefully from this reputable business school)

I apologize for the excessively long post but I hope some of you here can provide some guidance and insight. TIA!!!"

8a8ni3,150,2018-04-06,Divorce is like chemotherapy. It's the worst thing ever... but it beats the alternative.,madcowbomber,malementalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/8a8ni3/divorce_is_like_chemotherapy_its_the_worst_thing/,"**So, my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/malementalhealth/comments/89ycq3/red_flags_in_the_rearview_mirror_my_marriage_post/) on red flags in relationships got more traction than I expected**, so I thought I'd put together something about how I survived my divorce - something which I was against and did not want.  This all happened about four and a half years ago now.  This is going to be a wall of text so I'm trying to break it up with formatting to make it a little more readable and interesting.  This will either work or be a disaster. Let's find out together!

Edit: Obligatory thanks for the gold! 

**I was not a very emotional person** growing up, and didn't know how to handle feelings. Though I was pretty friendly and sociable for an introvert, I had a lot of junk pushed down, and barely even knew it was there.  As my marriage deteriorated, I was storing up more and more negative emotions - frustration, grief, anger, sadness, all that stuff.  I had no real outlet for it, and it got to a point where I was imagining driving into oncoming traffic or off a bridge, because that was the only escape I could conceive of.  Anyway, things reached a breaking point where I had to leave to get healthy and safe.  My family invited me to stay with them back in my home state, and after my wife made it clear she didn't care what I did, I went.

**I was a wreck those first couple weeks**.  All the junk that I'd been bottling up for the last year or two came spurting out in bouts of grief and rage.  Every time I thought about her or anything we had had together, it was like dropping Mentos into Coke.  Instead of having panic attacks, I had grief attacks - and that was in between just total emotional deadzones of depression.  

#I was like a bad cross between a *Shaun of the Dead* zombie and a *28 Days Later* zombie.  

I tried to talk with my folks about it, but I would also bring up stuff from my childhood (which, apart from some relatively minor stuff, was pretty good) and stuff I'd wish they'd done better.  I lashed out at them and even if some of what I said was valid, I was doing it in a toxic, unfair way.  To their eternal credit, they handled it with a ton of grace and told me when I was stepping over some lines.  

**Over time the grief attacks spaced out more and more.**  Instead of being multiple times a day, it was just daily.  Then it was a few times a week, then weekly.  Then a few times a month, and so on.  I was fortunate to find my own place to live during this time, and I found a job that I liked pretty well, paid pretty well, and I had pretty good coworkers.  I got into a regular pattern of going to work, not bursting out into tears or screaming, going home, and watching TV till I fell asleep, with little bouts of choking up and crying at *Legend of Korra* for no apparent reason.  Super healthy, right?  Also, I saved enough for a secondhand XBox 360 and played a ton of video games.

**My wife and I continued to talk** on the phone and over email, but it became progressively clearer that there was no scenario where we would successfully get back together.  About five months after I moved, we signed divorce papers and that was that.  I took off my wedding ring that day, put it in my wallet, and tried to forget about it.  

**My healing process started with a terrible toothache.**  I developed a really bad infection in the roof of my mouth that ended up needing two teeth pulled.  The dentist told me later that if I had let it go much longer, I could have ended up in the emergency room with the infection spreading through my head and even into my brain through my bloodstream.  That revelation and what felt like almost a brush with death forced me to confront the emotion of fear - of sickness, hospitalization, and even death.  

#But instead of pushing the fear down like so many other emotions, I let myself sit with it and experience it without judgment or rejection.

And sure enough, the fear passed, and I felt a little bit better.  That approach was revelatory.  I had known intellectually that you should feel your emotions instead of suppressing them, but I'd never really been able to put it into practice - and now I had plenty of opportunity to practice.  Whenever I felt those grief attacks coming on, I would encourage them (as long as I wasn't at work).  I would dig deep and ugly cry and sob and let it wash over me - and then pass through me and be gone.  It was okay.  I was still alive.  

**Being able to cry was a good way of dealing with the pain**, but it was only the first stage of recovering for me.  I was getting rid of all the negative stuff, but I had to put something more positive in its place.  Although I wasn't really realizing it at the time, I began subconsciously putting some strategies into place that helped me feel less shitty and a little more positive.  

#**Here's some of the approaches I used to start rebuilding**.

* **I identified what I was feeling and the reasons behind it.**  This is the building blocks of emotional intelligence.  I learned to say something like, ""This is what I'm feeling, and it reminds me of this situation or this memory. I accept that that is what happened and this is how it made me feel, and it's okay to feel that way.""   Although emotions flare up in the moment, they are often tied to things that happened weeks or months or years ago, and unless those things are acknowledged, they will come back again and again.  If you don't think you can name many emotions, a tool like [The Feeling Wheel](http://type-a-lifestyle.com/the-feeling-wheel/) can be helpful, even just to put a name on it.

* **I leaned on whoever would let me.**  My family stepped up in amazing ways to help me and listen to me, even though most of the time they weren't close by.  I developed a really close friendship with an old friend in another state who was going through her own *legendarily* awful time (she is genuinely a personal hero of mine for her strength and perseverance, and her memoir will sell by the millions someday.)  There were times where we were on the phone for hours every night talking through our shit and commiserating.

* **I watched good examples of male relationships.**  Even though I didn't have close friends nearby, it was really nice to watch Turk and JD on Scrubs, or Troy and Abed on Community, or pretty much everyone on Parks and Recreation.  I think strong, healthy friendships, especially expressive male friendships, are incredibly important to depict on TV, because that's how so many boys are learning. 

* **I found reasons - even silly, minor reasons - to feel something positive during the day.**  Appreciation and gratitude go a long way.  I am lucky to live in a very scenic area, and I appreciated getting to watch the sun rise and set on the mountains every day.  I was thankful for the dumb jokes I had with coworkers during the day.  My job is in customer service, which is notoriously soul-sucking, but I found little ways to make it better.  I got to teach a grandmother how to watch cat videos on her smartphone for the first time.  I fixed a phone for a customer while their loved one was in the hospital, so they could stay in touch.  I got to help customers lower their rates and improve their service.  I got to meet all kinds of people from all kinds of jobs and walks of life and talk with them for a few minutes.  

* **I started asking two questions:** What can I learn and how can I help? Asking why something happened isn't always helpful. But ongoing reflection about yourself and your situation can help develop a better perspective, and equip you to be more successful down the road. Plus, there is always something you can be doing. It is easy to get stuck in your own head always analyzing and reframing, but it doesn't matter very much if that doesn't impact the world around you. 

* **I had to reframe my conception of what the future looked like without a wife**.  This was probably the most difficult thing, and took me forever to do.  When I was married, I was in seminary to be a chaplain (like a pastor, but not just for Christians, and who works outside a church).  It felt like something God was calling me to do.I knew I had the natural skills, talents, and abilities for it - and when I dropped out and got divorced, that all went in the toilet.  I didn't know what to do with myself.  I felt like I had failed God and myself, and like I was useless.  It took me a long time to realize that I was still using that same skillset - listening, empathy, and helpfulness - to help people in my regular job.  Even coworkers occasionally reached out to me for a listening ear.  I was still doing ministry - just in a very different context.  I was making the choice every day (and still am) to change my life into a new shape - something better than it was the day before.  

* **I expressed my thoughts externally.**  Crying is good, but it doesn't get you far by itself.  Talking about my thoughts and feelings helped more. I saw a therapist for a little bit, but the major part was talking over my grief and anger with my friend on the phone.  I did a little bit of journaling.  I told bits and pieces here and there to friends as I was ready and as it felt appropriate. A lot of what you're reading I have been going over and over in my head in bits and pieces, and setting it down like this is helpful and therapeutic for me.  This is probably the most exhaustive account of my experience that I've ever put together.  More importantly, I chose not to suppress my emotions again with habits I knew were unhealthy - drinking especially.  I believe that drinking as a response to stress or negativity is a pretty surefire way to develop alcoholism.  I also found over time that when I was feeling better, I was less interested in video games - it's very easy for me to play them to avoid feeling difficult emotions.  I'm a pretty verbal person, so writing is how I let this stuff out.  If you're creative at all, let it out that way, whether it's making music, art, dancing, writing, whatever.  *Just get it out*.  

# I also recognized three themes that came up over and over again.  

* **Process** - Healing is a process.  It's not something you can hurry.  It's not a competition against anyone else, and it's not something you win.  It's just something you go through.  Change in life will always be two of three things: fast, long-term, and good, but never all three.  You have to choose, every day.

* **Relationship** - None of us can make it alone.  We have to rely on the people around us.  If you don't have anyone, become the person for someone else. It's not hard.  All you have to do is listen and give a shit.  You don't have to have all the answers, most of the time just saying, ""That sucks, I'm sorry"", helps.  Just listening, acknowledging, and validating someone else's experience is healing for them.  As a Christian, I believe the entirety of my faith and practice revolves around the two greatest commandments - love God, love your neighbor, love yourself.  I'm not trying to preach or proselytize, but this is the truest thing I know and the best thing I can practice.  You can do it too, even if you're Jewish or Buddhist or atheist or Pastafarian - you can invest in the relationships around you and build someone else up.

* **Hope** - Things suck.  There's no denying it.  It sucks today and it'll probably suck tomorrow.  Hope is believing and making the decision to make tomorrow suck a little less, in some small way, and that maybe next week or next month or next year, things might not completely suck at all.  It can and will get better, because you can make it better.

**It's been just over four years since I signed those divorce papers.**  It's hard to believe how different life is now than it was then.  I still grieve sometimes the pain I experienced (and caused), but I'm more at peace with myself and more optimistic about the future.  I still have a long ways to go and I'm finding new issues in my heart and mind that I need to address, but I know now that I have the tools to deal with them and the ability to overcome them.  I know you do too.

****

There was a ton more stuff I wanted to include but couldn't really fit. I read a lot of stuff, listened to a lot of stuff, and watched a lot of stuff that helped me along the way.  Maybe it'll help you as well. 

* The absolute most important and influential thing I've read, and which I've posted here before, is Miriam Greenspan's [Healing Through the Dark Emotions](https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/385/through-a-glass-darkly).  She talks about how American culture tends to minimize and avoid negativity, but when we engage with those ""dark emotions"", we can have transformative experiences.

* A great real life example of good male friendships is the amazing /u/ChrisHardwick and his podcast ID10T, formerly known as Nerdist.  He went through some shit between Singled Out on MTV back in the day and Talking Dead, and he's been pretty up front and honest about it.  Him and his cohosts Matt Mira and Jonah Ray are great models for friendship, perseverance, and success.  He also does a great job of getting life advice from his guests; his interviews are far more than just plugs for someone's latest project.  The episodes [Honestly 2013,](https://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-honestly-2013/) [V-Cards,](https://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-v-cards/) and [Pete Holmes](https://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-pete-holmes/) were tremendously helpful for me, listening to them talk about grief, setbacks, conflict, and failure.  Other notable guests include his dad, professional bowler [Billy Hardwick](https://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-billy-hardwick/), as well as Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman (recorded right after his friend David Bowie died).  Marc Maron's podcast WTF is another good example of guys diving deep into their shit. 

* Tom Waits' first album, [Closing Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1eDuFlOl-c), was the soundtrack for the darkest part of my depression.  It was playing pretty much every night.  Colin Hay of Men at Work fame has a trio of songs that encompass the theme of process for me: [Overkill,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrGmcuj44DQ) [Waiting For My Real Life To Begin,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQBHPn9sDfY) and [Beautiful World.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe3RqgnXaT4)  Tom Turrican's song [When the Light Gets In](https://soundcloud.com/tomturrican/when-the-light-gets-in-2) is my personal favorite song about male friendship.

* [Postsecret](http://www.postsecret.com) is a website where people anonymously send in personal secrets on postcards.  New secrets every Sunday, along with a traveling show and several published books of postcards.

* Kahlil Gibran was a poet I discovered while doing my chaplaincy internship at a hospital in Atlanta.  His anthology *The Prophet* has poems on many topics, but *On Pain* is his most relevant:

&gt;Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.

&gt;Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.

&gt;And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;

&gt;And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.

&gt;And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.

&gt;Much of your pain is self-chosen.

&gt;It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.

&gt;Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity:

&gt;For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,

&gt;And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.

Finally, a couple things from *Lord of the Rings.*  I was a huge nerd as a kid and read the trilogy seven times in high school.  One of the things I picked up on [and that Stephen Colbert had to remind me of](https://youtu.be/dFRIjR-yimI?t=61) is that Gandalf's patron ""deity"", Nienna, has a power not found in any other culture in the world.  *She weeps - and by doing so, turns grief into wisdom*.  I think that's a powerful lesson for those who can learn it.

Sam Gamgee was always my favorite character.  I've reflected on and learned from him in many different ways over the years, and he is the best expression of hope that I know of.  There is a scene after Frodo is captured by the orcs and Sam thinks he is dead, and that he himself must carry the Ring into Mordor and throw it into Mount Doom.  Overwhelmed by the darkness and despair, he sings a little song.  The last two lines deserve to be a tattoo:

&gt;In western lands beneath the Sun

&gt;the flowers may rise in Spring,

&gt;the trees may bud, the waters run,

&gt;the merry finches sing.

&gt;Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night

&gt;and swaying beeches bear

&gt;the Elven-stars as jewels white

&gt;amid their branching hair.
 
&gt;Though here at journey's end I lie

&gt;in darkness buried deep,

&gt;beyond all towers strong and high,

&gt;beyond all mountains steep,

&gt;above all shadows rides the Sun

&gt;and Stars for ever dwell:

&gt;I will not say the Day is done,

&gt;nor bid the Stars farewell.

So, I am a second-year college student who is very passionate about a future career in financial planning. I am currently a finance major at a very very reputable business school, but upon interviewing at a few financial firms for internships and speaking with some local financial advisors, several mentioned a degree program through another department at my university that is financial planning specific and fills the CFP education requirement (my current major does not). 

I would like to graduate on-time as I have already pushed my education back a full year for military service and do not wish to be in school longer than I have to. 

My current options the way I see it are to either switch to this program that offers completion of CFP education requirement and minor in business (which will allow me to graduate on time) OR remain a Finance major and minor in this alternative program which would allow me to complete the classes needed for CFP (but add another full semester to my education, plus it can’t be completed in the Summer term so I would be prolonging my inability to work a full-time job essentially another full year).

PROS to switching:
- Complete CFP with no additional coursework
- Graduate when I plan to

CONS to switching:
- Graduate from a much much less reputable program
- Lose many of the benefits from being in this reputable college (ie. Networking events, programs, employment opportunities, career resources, etc.) 

More context: 
- I am 99.9% dead set on becoming a financial planner in the future so no excessive need to pursue the broader finance degree just to keep different options open
- I have received many recommendations to look into this alternative program from local firms
- I plan to eventually get my MBA (hopefully from this reputable business school)

I apologize for the excessively long post but I hope some of you here can provide some guidance and insight. TIA!!!"

I angrily tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves. For a moment I’m reminded of some Asian girl whose name I’d already forgotten. She was prettier when she cried.

I sigh loudly – more of a growl – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns arriving any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up**.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing when guests arrive is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one.

Drs. B. Visser  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden op vragen van het lid Ploumen &amp;#40;PvdA&amp;#41; aan de Staatssecretaris van Defensie over het bericht ‘Luchtmachtbaas wil extra aandacht voor veiligheidscultuur na lekken’ &amp;#40;ingezonden op 14 maart 2018 met kenmerk 2018Z04616&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het bericht Luchtmacht baas wil extra aandacht voor veiligheidscultuur na lekken’?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u vooraf in kennis gesteld van het voornemen van de commandant Luchtstrijdkrachten om per mail zijn militairen te laten weten meer aandacht en bekendheid te willen geven aan de ""veiligheidscultuur"" bij de Luchtmacht? Zo ja, heeft u hierbij nog specifieke instructies gegeven? Zo nee, is het gebruikelijk dat militairen op deze wijze geïnstrueerd worden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee. Commandanten van Operationele Commando’s, zoals de Commandant Luchtstrijdkrachten &amp;#40;C-LSK&amp;#41;, zijn zelf verantwoordelijk voor de communicatie met hun medewerkers. C-LSK publiceert op het intranet van het Commando Luchtstrijdkrachten periodiek berichten &amp;#40;weblogs&amp;#41;, waarin hij de aandacht vraagt voor uiteenlopende onderwerpen. De berichten worden naast publicatie op het intranet van tijd tot tijd, zoals in dit geval, ook per e-mail aan CLSK-medewerkers verzonden. In het laatste geval, zoals door C-LSK is gedaan, is de mail verzonden als ‘dagorder’. In een ‘dagorder’ richt de commandant zich tot de medewerkers om persoonlijk een boodschap over te brengen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wanneer de veiligheidscultuur een groot goed is en bovenaan staat, hoe oordeelt u in dat opzicht over de uitspraak ‘.. medewerkers voelden de noodzaak om naar de pers te stappen in plaats van het gesprek aan te gaan met collega's. Zo ontstaat intern en extern het beeld dat wij een onveilige organisatie zijn en niet veilig werken .’?  
&amp;nbsp;    
De Commandant Luchtstrijdkrachten heeft met zijn dagorder actief en persoonlijk medewerkers opgeroepen problemen te melden via daarvoor ingerichte systemen, meldpunt en standaard procedures. In het vervolg van de dagorder benadrukt hij dat onze veiligheidscultuur is gebaat bij een omgeving waarin mensen open en eerlijk hun zorgen kunnen uiten en hun verhaal kunnen doen als iets is misgegaan. In het op 28 maart jongstleden aan uw Kamer verstuurde plan van aanpak ‘Een veilige defensieorganisatie’ nemen we als Defensie maatregelen om de meldingsbereidheid bij medewerkers te verhogen en het lerend vermogen te vergroten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u begrijpen dat door de wijze waarop de mail is opgesteld juist een onveilig gevoel bij medewerkers ontstaat om hun zorgen te uiten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het mogelijk dat juist medewerkers de noodzaak voelden om naar de pers te stappen in plaats van het gesprek aan te gaan met collega- medewerkers, omdat het gevoel ontbreekt dat ze zich in een omgeving bevinden waarin mensen open en eerlijk hun zorgen kunnen uiten en hun verhaal kunnen doen als er iets is misgegaan? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de mail wordt het belang benadrukt van het bespreken van problematiek met elkaar en wordt opgeroepen hiervoor het meldings- en rapportagesysteem te gebruiken. Daarbij bestaat ook de mogelijkheid om rechtstreeks en anoniem binnen Defensie te melden. Het zou spijtig zijn indien er bij medewerkers een onveilig gevoel is ontstaan. Zoals u weet, hecht ik veel waarde aan het veilig kunnen melden. Defensie moet een organisatie zijn waarin het niet alleen veilig is om vergissingen en veiligheidsincidenten te melden, maar waarin dat wordt gewaardeerd, er geen negatieve gevolgen zijn voor de melder, zodat kan worden onderzocht wat eraan moet worden gedaan. Momenteel wordt juist veel geïnvesteerd in het verhogen van de meldingsbereidheid, onder andere doordat commandanten hiertoe oproepen, er bekendheid wordt gegeven aan de procedures voor het melden en nieuwe klachtregistratieformulieren worden uitgegeven. Dit naast de maatregelen die in het plan van aanpak ‘Een veilige defensieorganisatie’ zijn beschreven waarin de aanbevelingen uit de tussentijdse rapportage van de commissie-Giebels, die onderzoek doet naar de sociale werkomgeving en de meldingsbereidheid, voor zo ver als mogelijk zijn verwerkt.   
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zijn er na de recente veiligheidsincidenten - ook buiten de luchtmacht - maatregelen genomen ter verbetering van het oppakken van de interne meldingen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de afgelopen maanden hebben alle leidinggevenden binnen de defensieonderdelen het belang van het melden van voorvallen benadrukt. Dit gebeurt op momenten waarbij commandanten met hun personeel spreken, middels nieuwsbrieven en in directe communicatie naar iedere defensiemedewerker. Daarnaast is één van de maatregelen in het plan van aanpak ‘Een veilige defensieorganisatie’ dat het onderwerp veiligheid besproken wordt tijdens werkoverleggen, commandantenvergaderingen en beraden tot op het hoogste niveau van de defensieorganisatie. De maatregelen zoals geïntroduceerd in het plan van aanpak hebben hun weerslag in de strategie, structuur, systeem en cultuur van de defensieorganisatie.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het Commando Luchtstrijdkrachten implementeert op dit moment een Safety Management Systeem &amp;#40;SMS&amp;#41;. Het doel van het SMS is dat onderdeelsoverstijgende veiligheidsgerelateerde problemen centraal in behandeling worden genomen. Een belangrijk onderdeel van het SMS is een werkende en sluitende planning- en controlcyclus, zodat volledige afhandeling van interne meldingen wordt gewaarborgd.   
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is het ook mogelijk om eventuele veiligheidsincidenten wel intern, maar niet bij de direct leidinggevende, te melden in geval deze daar direct of indirect te zeer bij betrokken is?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Voor het op uniforme wijze melden van voorvallen waaronder veiligheidsincidenten beschikt Defensie over het IT-systeem ‘Melden van Voorvallen &amp;#40;MVV&amp;#41;’. Iedere medewerker van Defensie dient een voorval te melden waarvan hij kennis draagt. De melding gaat via het MVV door naar het zogenoemde bevoegd gezag. Dat bevoegd gezag is een commandant of leidinggevende die binnen Defensie geautoriseerd is een initiële melding van een melder te registreren, waarmee de melding wordt doorgezet in de lijn en/of buiten het eigen defensieonderdeel. Indien een melder een voorval anoniem wil melden, kan het voorval via een derde in MVV worden gezet. Dit kan bijvoorbeeld door de vertrouwenspersoon of veiligheidsfunctionaris van de eenheid geschieden. Daarnaast kan elke defensiemedewerker elke andere leidinggevende ofwel het meldpunt van de Centrale Organisatie Integriteit Defensie &amp;#40;COID&amp;#41; via e-mail of telefonisch benaderen.  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Is het mogelijk dat juist medewerkers de noodzaak voelden om naar de pers te stappen in plaats van het gesprek aan te gaan met collega- medewerkers, omdat het gevoel ontbreekt dat ze zich in een omgeving bevinden waarin mensen open en eerlijk hun zorgen kunnen uiten en hun verhaal kunnen doen als er iets is misgegaan? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie het antwoord op vraag 4.  
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe beoordeelt u de veiligheidscultuur binnen de defensieorganisatie na de verschillende incidenten waar de commandant Luchtstrijdkrachten naar verwijst?  
&amp;nbsp;    
We zijn de afgelopen periode door verscheidene tragische ongevallen hard met onze neus op de feiten gedrukt. Deze ongevallen kunnen we helaas niet meer ongedaan maken, maar we moeten er wel alles aan doen om herhaling te voorkomen door ervan te leren. Er mag dan ook geen misverstand over bestaan: werken bij Defensie moet en kan veiliger. Het veiliger maken van de werkomgeving is daarom topprioriteit voor de komende jaren.

8aa441,31,2018-04-06,Timely job offers...?,bigdaveyl,recruitinghell,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/8aa441/timely_job_offers/,"Something happened at work this week, that got me thinking.

I was hired along with someone else less than a month ago at a community college in the computing/IT department.  We started on the same day (so they could train us at the same time) and she was a newer grad with a decent amount of internship experience.

Earlier this week, she apparently came in before most everyone else, cleaned out her desk, and submitted her resignation effective immediately.  We are guessing she was interviewing elsewhere before she started here and got another offer.

Don't get me wrong, you got to do what's best for you because it is rare to spend decades at the same company and so on.

However, it does seem like companies take their merry time making a decision and sometimes don't take kindly to what they feel like blackmail (i.e. ""I have another job offer..."") or people wanting to take their time to make a decision.  The irony is that employers say they want top talent, but move too slowly or don't understand the people may have other interviews/offers on the table.

I do think it's kind of scummy to quit after less than a month especially if you're at a more respected employer unless there is some compelling reason to move on - i.e. Google offers you a job at 3x your current salary.  It also screams that the person didn't do their due diligence and at least tell other employers that an offer was on the table and ask for an update."

I’m currently an International Student finishing up my undergrad in IT Management at Illinois Tech. I won’t lie but 45’s stance on immigration (especially as it pertains to immigrants of color; I’m a black African) has led me to want to explore Canada as a viable post-college option. I’m particularly interested in the Express Entry program. I’m 21, have pretty decent experience in Software Development (I was an intern twice at Dell in the past couple years). Je suis aussi parfaitement bilingue en Français et en Anglais (ou polyglotte, je devrais dire, vu que je parle plus de 2 langues).

Here’s where I need y’all’s help:

Is it worth trying for the Express Entry?
I’m traveling to Toronto sometime this summer to see distant family there. While I’m there, I want to seek legal advice from either a nonprofit organization or a pro-Bono immigration attorney. Where do I find either one?

Thank you"

I am recent admit to CS program.  I have been reading the forum and I wanted to get your thoughts on the following.

1. Are the Freshman / Sophomore classes still very big (~150)?   One student on reddit was saying some of the assignments are not returned back until finals.  Is this still the case and common in computer science courses?  

2. How common / difficult is to gain internship after freshman year?  Are these placed local to Houston in O&amp;G industry or in Austin/Bayarea?

3. Considering the demand for CS major, how recheable are professors and TA's.  I assume we have to depend a lot of TA's (esp from what I read about Code of conduct)?  I say this not knowing if you all work together on the pset's.

Thanks a lot and look forward to meeting some of you next week!

I have hope that the last scene of Grey's will be of Christina, Meredith, Izzie and Alex on that hallway bed they hangout on their first day as interns.

8abax5,1,2018-04-06,"My [21/F] relationship with my mother [47/F] and stepfather [49/M] has been strained since I was a teenager, and I don't know how to deal with the emotional fallout",moonbox-5,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8abax5/my_21f_relationship_with_my_mother_47f_and/,"The situation with my parents is very complicated and less than ideal in lots of ways. It's really affecting me at the moment and I'm desperate to finally be free of the situation &amp; the damage it's all caused. If anyone cares to make it through this v. long and complicated story I will be surprised &amp; grateful... 

CONTEXT: 
My mother [47/F] divorced my father [65/M] when I was 8 - the divorce was extremely messy and they haven't spoken to each other since. She began a relationship with my stepfather, her now-husband, before the divorce/moving out of the house she shared with my dad, and I only realised very recently (retrospect can be a wild thing) that the time between moving to the country where we currently live (a trans-atlantic move), them divorcing &amp; her moving in with stepdad was less than a year. 

After they divorced, the main parent that I lived with was my mother (&amp; her husband). They had a son together in 2008, who is now 9. I stayed with them during the weeks and stayed with my dad 2/3 weekends, more in the holidays. He's not from the UK and in his heart of hearts I don't think he wanted to stay here, but stayed close because he cared about maintaining a relationship with me, and would have had more time with me if he could have. For a while, things were relatively stable. A couple of little things: my relationship with my father wasn't always perfect. He's an old-school kind of guy and was very strict with all of his children from a previous marriage when they were small (big age gap between them &amp; me), and now that I'm older I realise that he had a lot of emotional hangups which meant that sometimes it was assumed that anger/intimidation (shouting etc.) were the most important elements in disciplining a child -- obviously this was not popular with me at the time. Also, my relationship with my mother was mostly fine at the time but she was never very 'maternal'/emotionally intimate so I can remember that as early as maybe 9-10 I would feel very deeply upset/unworthy because I couldn't shake the feeling that she LOVED (in the biologically-imperative way that most mothers do) me but didn't LIKE me. She wasn't unaware of this at all - once, when I was 11, I came home to her sitting on the sofa. ""Our relationship has never been like it's supposed to be,"" she tells me - ""why do you think that is?"" 11yo me obvious had no idea what response to give to the mother whose love I was desperate for. Neither parent was reluctant to bad-mouth the other to me, and I very much became a middle-man between them. At first, I very much did not like mum's new husband because he was some new guy, symbolic of my family falling apart &amp; very much not always perfect (big temper issues, although those didn't materialise until later) but he made an effort and I grew to like him. 

But then my teenage years happened, and they were a clusterfuck... When I was 14, I got a boyfriend [then 16/M] who my parents (mother &amp; stepdad - biological father wasn't aware at the time) very much didn't like. I was with him on-and-off for maybe a year and a half. The relationship was rocky/shitty (at the beginning it was fine but in retrospect, it's obvious he didn't really care about me) but I don't think anything too far outside the realm of standard bad-teenage-choices; the key factors with regards to this narrative were the fact that we had sex (which I *still* don't have an issue with, even in retrospect, but that's a matter of my personal views) and experimented w/ alcohol (nothing too frequent/extreme because I've never been someone capable of particularly heavy drinking) and weed. Honestly, though, we lived in a very suburban, middle-class area and nothing was ever as *extreme* as we thought it was at the time. For instance; I, a total nerd at heart, literally never missed a day of school (or art club lol), got straight As in all of my exams, never sneaked out of the house at night, etc. I was not as hardcore as I thought I was, basically. 

I will be the first to admit that my behaviour wasn't exactly poster-child ideal at that time, and now that I'm older I can recognise that it was absolutely textbook teenage asshole behaviour. I was moody and I thought I knew it all. But I still believe that the way my parents reacted was extreme - totally blocking off all contact with the outside world, restricting the time I was allowed to leave the house for socialising, blocking internet access, putting security cameras on the house to track my comings and goings, overall just treating me like I was a terrible person rather than expressing concern about my behaviour potentially being unsafe/inappropriate... any one of these things might have been effective/justifiable if they had been proportionate or compassionately administered, but in conjunction w/ dealing for the first time with a romantic relationship where I felt totally rejected and unloved (which felt like the end of the world for me at the time) this ended up making me feel totally isolated and depressed. Predictably, it also made me latch onto the 'love' I thought I had with this guy even more (I genuinely think I would have been so over him much sooner than I was, had this not been the case). I ended up in a really bad place for the better part of over a year, self-harming, etc. This relationship would no longer be relevant to me at all now (older &amp; wiser I literally never think about the guy anymore, it was just a typical teenage thing of thinking I was SO in love with a v. mediocre boy), except that I now know it marked the beginning of the descent of my relationship with my parents into what it is now.  

Around the same time, a much more significant thing happened. My stepfather got made redundant and spent a couple of months unemployed. This resulted in almost no material change to our quality of life re. money and things like that, but it meant he was at home all the time (specifically, when I got home from school every day before mum got home from work). Our relationship really 'blossomed' - I was a pretentious, moody teen and he was the (pseudo-)intellectual type and made me feel like he really 'got' me &amp; how I was different to other people. I was already isolated, bored, understimulated (couldn't go out and see friends, felt like shit all the time) so every day I'd come home &amp; rant to him about whatever - everybody else in my year is so stupid, etc. etc. I confided in him about things to do with my relationship, and I took his advice when he gave it. I thought he was really smart and cool. 

Of course, most people can probably see where this was going. One day I come home and he's crying on the sofa. Tells me he had a sex dream about me and feels horribly guilty. I feel v. uncomfortable but end up comforting him, telling him that it's only a dream and doesn't matter. He says that usually, people dream about having sex with people they admire &amp; want to emulate in some way - I take that as a compliment. Of course, this escalates - luckily, never to anything physical, bar one incident involving him 'jokingly' chasing me around the house that scared me so much I ended up grabbing a knife to put distance between us. Honestly, I can't remember how long it went on for. Comments like ""You don't have to be afraid of me, I wouldn't rape you because I want to make you cum,"" or ""I didn't know I'd turned you on so much"" (when I came upstairs having removed my tights after a day at school in the height of British summer). Occasionally, I'd wake up with him watching me sleep from my doorway. I know that to many none of this will sound serious, and many people deal with much worse things every day, so sometimes I feel like it's so stupid of me to have let something so comparatively trivial affect me so much. But, I was terrified of him, and I was forced to live with him, and it only made my emotional situation 1000x worse. 

Eventually - I don't know why - this behaviour seemed to phase out. I avoided him, or ever being alone with him. His treatment of me turned instead into extreme coldness - never acknowledging or even looking at me - and, occasionally, huge outbursts of anger (this is a man who once punched through the kitchen door or, on another occasion, poisoned an entire aquarium full of fish in a fit of rage). My mother also grew much more cold &amp; angry than ever before. Being in the house was like walking on eggshells. I was called defensive, or arrogant, or lazy. Any small mistake I made was grounds for an attack on my character. If I hadn't done something wrong, I was totally ignored. Whenever the wider issue comes up, it always comes down to me: ""you stopped caring about this family when you were with [teenage boyfriend],"" ""you hated your little brother"" (honestly, how unusual is it for a 14yo to be annoyed because their parents insist they let their infant/toddler sibling stick around them when they planned on watching horror movies with their friends/boyfriend? Not saying it was reasonable, but I think standard teenage moodiness - in no world did I ever hate my brother). My mother has even blamed the rift on the fact that I got my first iPhone at 14. 

When I was 18, I went to university. I worked really, really hard - it really is a very good university (consistently in the top 3 in the world), I care a lot about my grades, took internships every summer, took on a pile of extracurriculars. I was and am desperate to earn my independence (and, low-key, probably to try to prove that I am not a terrible person who doesn't care about anything/anyone else). Of course, nothing I do warrants any praise, or anything other than the standard ignore-or-criticise approach. I've long since gotten over not having my praises sung - I can very much live with that. Both of my parents (mother &amp; father) agreed to support me financially throughout university, but my father had a major heart surgery which meant he could no longer work &amp; mother rescinded her financial support without warning (as tacit punishment), so I've ended up financially independent. This is difficult, but fine with me - it's nobody's obligation to give me their money, and the support - when I had it - was a luxury, not a right. 

But, although I thought that university would mean I'd finally escaped, it seemed to be that as soon as I was here all of my feelings about my home life suddenly decompressed. I went through at least one term of being practically immobilised by all of it, and not knowing what to do. Not getting out of bed or seeing anyone, missing work, etc. Every time my mother so much as texts me, I feel physically ill with anxiety, my hands shake, I want to cry (because it is NEVER a positive experience, and she still seems to hold this power over me). At the end of the last summer holiday, my stepfather lost his mind at me out of nowhere and went into a fit of rage, telling me that I was a burden, contributed nothing to the household, and that I wasn't welcome there. As usual, she was on his side until even she could recognise that his behaviour was far beyond acceptable, at which point she shut down like she always does - no defence of me, no standing up to him, ever. At the end of the next term I couldn't bring myself to stay with them over the Christmas holidays, so I decided to stay with my now-boyfriend of 5 years (23/M) and best friend (21/F) in a different city. I knew that if I didn't tell my mother about why this was, I would be left feeling even more bitter about not even having TRIED to not be the one to blame for once (it would have been ""she doesn't care enough to come home for Christmas""), so I finally confessed everything that he'd done when I was a teenager and told her that after his outburst and her passivity, I didn't feel welcome in her home/family. 

At first, she was sort of sympathetic. But she barely reacted to the revelation that her husband had treated her daughter this way, and refused to SAY (when specifically asked to, on multiple occasions) that she didn't think I was to blame, or even to really acknowledge what I had told her in words. I have no idea if he knows that I've told her. All she would say was ""of course what you say he did is wrong."" Any deeper conversation and she'd say ""What would you like me to do? I'm not sure what I'm supposed to figure out. You have said that some things happened that were not right. I've accepted that. You've said you want nothing to do with [stepfather]. That's fine. You've said you don't want to come back here. I'm ok with that. I'm not sure what else?"" As far as I know, she's had no reaction beyond this - no inkling that it might be appropriate to confront him or anything like that. The longer it's been, the worse her reaction has gotten - ""it takes two to tango"" and talking about how blame goes both ways, going back to all of the stuff about how I was so moody and unbearable at the time, and the fact that I was having sex; ""behaviour is behaviour and it doesn't feel fair to put the blame for all on me or others."" Any time I disagree with her or try to defend myself, I'm told that I clearly care more about scoring points and being right than about her or our relationship. I now haven't seen her in 6 months. She insisted that she must see me for my 21st (in December), which I was happy to do - honestly, I want a relationship with my mother, but I'm not willing to do it on terms which hurt and degrade me. She ended up cancelling seeing me for that the day before (the year before, she ignored my birthday altogether - not even a verbal acknowledgement - despite the fact that we were literally in the same house). Most recently, she sent me a message telling me that my little brother asked why I hadn't come home in six months and that she ""hadn't known what to tell him"" except that ""[I] don't want to see them."" Obviously, this really upset me - I love my little brother, he is probably the aspect of not going home anymore that upsets me the most. I know what it's like to be a 9yo in a shitty home environment and they are way more observant than adults think. It breaks my heart to think that he'll feel like I abandoned him or don't care, but I can't contact him except through my mother and simply can't go back to that house. 

THE ADVICE I NEED: 
Really, I need a lot of it. All I want, now, is to be able to live my life without being hurt by people, and without hurting anyone else. I'm tired of being told I'm a bad person, and I can't take it anymore. I don't need their support or even love, just to not be hurt. 

- What can I do about my relationship with my mother? It causes me so much pain and people have told me time and time again that, since I'm financially independent, I should just cut her off. But, I can't shake the deep-rooted feeling that she's still my mother, and there's the additional fact that if I do that I have to give up on any hope whatsoever of a relationship with my little brother. It's unlikely that he'd ever get a real explanation or the truth, and he'll grow up believing that I'm a terrible person who abandoned him and never cared enough to show up or try. Thinking about this breaks my heart. Honestly, I'm not even sure that I'm not totally overreacting to what happened with my stepfather and ruining my family relationships as a result. 

- I graduate in June of this year. I'm really proud of completing my degree, and obviously graduation is usually an event for celebration. But every time I think about it, I want to cry. I definitely want my partner to come, because he has supported me the whole way through without wavering and our relationship is great. But, my mother will expect to be invited, as she has always been the parent who has dealt with academic stuff (parents evenings, university open days, and things like that). It's just kind of the default. What I really want is for my father to come - our relationship has improved hugely over the past couple of years and we've gotten really close. He's really the only source of parental love/validation I have, and I value it hugely. However, if I do invite him, my mother will torture me over it for the rest of time. As I've said, she still brings up things that I did wrong when I was 14/15/16 in the context of present, unrelated conflicts. Last year, when I chose to go with him on a week-long holiday (nothing fancy, just a short drive to the coast with his 'new' (married a year or two after the divorce) wife (57/F) and my friend (21/F)), she punished me with cutting remarks about it for weeks, and really upped her coldness/criticism. I know that this sounds minor but she still has a huge emotional effect on me, so this is significant. This will feed into my next query, but to be honest I'm also still unsure as to whether I'm even in the right with this - I can't shake the feeling that if I didn't invite her it would be a horrible, cruel and selfish thing to do, and I don't want to hurt her. Even if I don't invite her, I know I'll still feel completely illogically sad about what 'could/should' have been. 

- My most broad question, and probably the one that affects me most: am I in the wrong? I'm really not looking for people to just blindly validate me here, if I'm making mistakes. I'm really torn up over the idea that maybe I'm selfishly hurting the people around me, unable to self-reflect enough to see that I really am overly defensive, aggressive, selfish, overreacting, etc. I am at a loss, now, as to how I can handle this situation so as to not be hurt anymore, but also not hurt anybody else. It feels like no matter what I do, nothing gets any better. 

Once again - huge apologies for how long this was. If anyone has the patience to read or give advice, I will be hugely grateful, as I'm feeling totally lost. 

TL;DR: my stepfather spent my teen years making inappropriate sexual advances towards me and now both he and my mother, who I recently confessed this to, treat me with extreme coldness &amp; anger. The emotional fallout is really affecting me and I just want to make the situation better but I have no idea how. Feeling very lost. "

I graduated 2 years ago with a good BS in an engineering field. I wasn't a stellar student but it's not like I was risking failing out of school. I switched into my major my sophomore year and did not have any credits toward it before then. My long term partner was a year ahead of me in school and was planning to move across the country for work (we're in the same field). We didn't want to deal with being 2,500 miles apart longer than needed and so instead of easing my workload and staying an extra year (I'd have done this if I'd been single) I still graduated in 4 years. Thus I averaged about 15 core engineering credits/semester (as high as 19 one semester) to squeeze a 4 year degree into 3 years, having switched so late. 

My grades suffered because of massive workloads and poor time management skills. I made stupid decisions. I should've gotten a research position but my grades usually weren't good enough and I didn't have the time. I still managed to find 2 internships, though. I turned down a full-time return offer at my 2nd internship which would have left me happy and financially comfortable to move in with my partner instead, in a city where I had no jobs lined up in my field. I do not and would never resent her for this. It was my choice. 

After 2 months without a job in new city, I stopped kidding myself and realized I'd burned all my savings and needed to start paying bills. My partner is wonderful and took on a significantly larger portion of the rent, with her high paying job. For this I did envy her, she had my dream job and I couldn't find an entry-level position in a city that's great for my line of work. With student loans looming on the horizon, and empty bank account, and mounting depression, I got a job at a grocery store so I wouldn't sit around the house masturbating all day and so that I could actually contribute something financially. 

My shift started at 5am every day and I'd have to wake up at 4 to make it on time. Eventually my sleep schedule shifted such that I found it almost impossible to stay up past 10, even on my days off. I'd often be in bed at 8 or 9 which means I'd see her for 2 hours after work and then need to crash. All the while I was looking for work. I'd often get to a final round interview only to ""just"" not make the cut. It was like being constantly teased about what I could be doing, having it dangled in front of my face, just to have it snatched away again. After 6 months of this it broke me. I was living paycheck to paycheck, heavily depressed, never not on the verge of sleep. Despite that I sometimes couldn't sleep because I was so stressed and anxious about going into work the next day. I had more than a few complete breakdowns. 

So I stopped even trying to get another job. I've had self-confidence issues regarding my intelligence since my late teens. It's often felt to me that I was smart enough to be aware of and appreciate a lot of these science and math concepts in school but that their details would inevitably be lost on me. I've felt like this on and off for a long time. Sometimes I ""prove"" to myself that it wasn't true and other times (like now) I feel in a rut ""proving"" it to be correct. Smart enough to understand how little I know and how complicated the world is, not smart enough to really understand any of it. I was completely convinced I was just not smart enough to make it in my field, and I'd given up. 

My partner convinced me to give it one last shot and see. I spent a month doing nothing but work for 9 hours, do job applications for the afternoon, and sleep. Same old game, I'd get almost there and then get told at the last stage they weren't moving forward. Finally, though, something happened. I interviewed at a startup company who said they didn't have the budget to hire me on salaried but could pay me as a contractor for 3 days / week. I took it and at that moment it was the happiest I'd been in a very long time. I had my foot in the door at a company, I could finally put some relevant experience on my resume, and I was making above minimum wage. I kept the grocery store job and dropped down to be scheduled 3-4 days/week. I'd incurred a lot of credit card debt and felt very strongly about paying it off. 

More often than not I'd get scheduled for 4 days which meant on top of my 2nd job I'd work a 7 day week. I did this for another 5 months. If I ever had a day off it'd almost never be a weekend. I'd work an entire month without a day off. I was certainly less existentially depressed than before but I was also more drained. I did not have the energy to do anything outside of sleep and work. Our relationship suffered but we stayed together. 

I quit the grocery job the day I'd paid off my credit debt. I finished my 2 weeks there and left. Now I was only working 3 days/week and finally had time to branch back into personal projects and have some time with myself and my partner. As a contractor I did not pay taxes on my wages and looking back I'd have done a lot of things differently. I really had no clue what I'd gotten into. I did, however, estimate what my taxes would be if paid this rate as a salary and set aside money for tax season. 

A few months later our company was acquired and funded. We no longer worried about burn rate and whether or not we'd be able to keep the lights on. I was offered a salaried position now that they could afford me full-time. The offer came in at the lower 10% of starting salaries for my field but I didn't even care. I'd finally gotten full-time technical work. I was no longer embarrassed to tell my friends what I'd been up to since school. I no longer felt like a failure in front of my family. I didn't feel like a drain on my partner anymore. I never had to borrow money from her. We could split rent and expenses equally. I felt like I was contributing something to our relationship for the first time in over a year. 

As time went on though I became disenchanted with the company I'd signed on to. We are terribly disorganized and attempts to change that last a week and then drift off. Our practices are strange and nonsensical. A smaller company will surely do things differently but we blatantly ignore industry best practices. If I bring this up I'm told that other companies ""don't know what they're talking about"" and that'd the end of the discussion. We only have 2 office days/week and work remotely the rest of the time. At first I liked this but it became very alienating, not having any sort of work culture. I'm free to go in any day but why would I commute 45 minutes to sit in an empty office for 8 hours?

Although my work there was not directly related to what I wanted to do within my field it was at least tangent to it. As time went on, though, my duties (and those of my coworkers) drifted further and further away from development and more into what I'd describe as a jumbled pile of glorified IT problems. It's been this way for months now. I honestly don't even know what the fuck I do there anymore. Both of our senior engineers (who started the company) are extremely resistant to change and trying new things. Those of us who have come on more recently agree we are going down a really bad path with our most major project. Bringing up concerns has been met with heated debates and being shut down with seniority/experience cards. My work is no longer really technical, it's boring and un-stimulating, and I again find myself dreading going to sleep and having to wake up the next day to work on it. It does not require critical thinking or expertise; it's simply endless busywork.  

I keep in touch with a lot of friends made in school and again my partner is in my field. I can't help but be jealous when I hear what they're working on. They can't help but be completely baffled when I tell them about my job. ""What? I've never ever heard of anyone doing that."" ""Oh we'd never do that we use &lt;way I want to but am told we can't for some reason&gt;."" ""They're having you do what? Why wouldn't they just hire a non-technical person for less do to that work?"" etc. It makes me feel like I'm further wasting my time and I am not gaining relevant experience for my career moving forward. 

I want to move on to another job. I have been looking actively for months and have gotten very few hits. No one has heard of my current work because we are so small, and so I feel my resume is often discarded without a second thought in favor of candidates who have a well-known company at the top of their resume. I have had a few recent interviews but I am consistently not making the cut. I think my skills have actually gotten worse at this job since I am not using them at all. I can start personal projects, of course, but that can only go so far in lieu of professional experience. I feel completely trapped at this company and it's very suffocating. 

I did my taxes last month. Whatever IRS estimator I'd used was apparently complete bullshit as I ended up owing over twice what I was expecting from my contracting work. Thank fucking god I'd been saving money or I'd be in a lot of debt to the IRS right now in addition to my student loans. It did completely wipe out my savings, though. So now I'm back to square 1 financially (I was getting ready to open an IRA and start getting some index funds). I'll additionally have to carry some credit card debt for the next 2 months so I can make my rent and eat. I won't be going anywhere, doing anything that costs money, or even able to save money until I fix the current situation. Probably a huge fuckup on my part but I genuinely thought I'd accounted for this. 

I was considering quitting this job and taking a month or two off to dedicate to looking for a new job. That's completely impossible right now as I'd be unable to afford my monthly student loan payments or rent without any savings. 

It sometimes feels like the universe is telling me I'm not cut out for what I'm trying to do. And maybe it's right. I have interests outside of work that could potentially work as jobs/careers but I'd take such a major income hit switching out that I can't justify it to myself. I can't go back to making minimum wage and just scraping by, constantly exhausted. I'm trapped at a decently paying job that I absolutely detest because it gives me some level of financial security for the first time in my adult life. Switching out of that ""to make myself happy"" seems both like I've wasted tens of thousands of dollars and 4 years on a technical degree (in a field in which I am genuinely interested) and shooting myself in the foot financially. 

We rent our current home and it was just sold. It turns out we have to move at the end of the summer as it's being demolished to make apartment buildings. Such is life in a growing city but it does add an additional layer of unexpected financial stress. 

We've had a non-existent bedroom the year she was here and I was in school and a dead/dying one since I moved out. We used to be kinky, have a lot of great sex, and were extremely happy together. I'm not sure what happened. I am a very sexual person and I have a high sex drive. She has not been interested like she was in college and before for as long as I can remember. 

I think the fact that we have to move catalyzed all of this but it all came out last night. We've had a ""big talk"" about it every 6 months or so for the past 3 years and it'd always get better for a few weeks and taper off. We'd been dancing around some fundamental issues the entire time, though, and neither of us had truly brought them up. Something was different last night and it really did come out. 

She's not sure why but apparently after school ended and she came out here... she just stopped feeling sexual. For anyone or about anything. I did not. Sex turned into a chore for her and it was painfully obvious. We'd go months without and eventually it became easier to not talk about it than try to fix it. Even when we did have sex it was relegated to a strangely formal and oddly boring thing. None of the passion, fun, and frenzy as before. Otherwise we got along great. It was like living with my best friend with whom I'd occasionally have to have very awkward sex. I'd initiate and she'd reciprocate out of a sense of duty. She'd initiate out of a sense of duty and I'd reciprocate. It was gross and made us both feel awful before, during, and after. 

This had all gone known but unsaid until last night when something broke and we talked late into the night. She feels it's an issue only she can fix with herself. I want to help her but she seems convinced there's nothing I can do short of offering patience. She's not sure why she had no libido but she simply doesn't. I told her I can't keep living like this. I feel stifled and there is a large part of my basic needs going completely unmet. There is no intimacy in our relationship. We used to align perfectly in this regard and now it's totally 180'd. She feels bad, I feel bad. We stopped kidding ourselves though; it's making us both terribly miserable. If we can't work it out by the end of the summer when we need to move we're probably going to split amicably. We've been together 10 years and have grown a lot with each other, in that time. It pained us both greatly to admit it but our individual happiness is worth more to us than holding onto a dream that might never be realized. 

I don't really feel like spellchecking this whole thing so sorry for spelling/grammar mistakes. "

8abydk,121,2018-04-06,PSA: Don't take unpaid internships.,Kinost,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/8abydk/psa_dont_take_unpaid_internships/,"I'm writing this because I've noticed an alarming trend of undergraduate students taking on unpaid internships in the private sector and with foreign governments. *This is a terrible idea 99% of the time.* There are exceptions to this rule, really anything in the non-profit research and non-profit sector (and their social enterprise wings, if they have one) counts.

* Why shouldn't I take an unpaid internship? Short and simple: the employers are exploiting you, and society. You can easily find a paid job if you put some effort into it (our economy is nearing full-employment to begin with and we're experiencing some of the greatest economic advancement in recent history right now). That might sound like a strange concept: BUT YOU CAN WORK AND GET PAID FOR IT. Go to Pacific Centre or walk down a corridor of businesses with your resume and ask if they're hiring over the summer in business casual wear. Go on UBC Symplicity and write a few cover letters. Look up non-profit organizations with Canada Summer Jobs funding!
* But that experience isn't relevant!: All experience is relevant as a student. Your goal should be to develop examples that you can use in interviews (conflict management, time management, innovative thinking), not trying to find the absolute most relevant experience. Many positions hiring undergraduate students are simply expecting a reference and a solid interview/cover letter. Those job listings asking for 3 years of experience for an entry-level position are pipe dreams and most likely will be hiring someone who doesn't meet all the required qualifications.
* Why are non-profits/labs exempt from this rule?: Because non-profits contribute back to the community. When you're volunteering or interning at a non-profit organization, you are advancing the public interest. Handing out food to the homeless is beneficial, helping design a website for a women's shelter is a public service and writing witty tweets for a science education program for kids is advancing education.
* Who are you screwing when you take on an unpaid internship?: Yourself, mostly. You're choosing not to get paid for something that you should be paid for, while making a business some sweet money. But you're also screwing everyone else over, because the income you would generate otherwise would be taxed. You and your employer should be paying your fair share of taxes to contribute back to the social services that you've relied upon for the past 20 something years. Even if you aren't subject to income taxes, you're still subject to sales taxes, family MSP premiums, etc that all go back to making society work. 
* I'm going to take that unpaid internship at the US Consulate and become a diplomat!: By doing that, you'll have worked to advance the interests of a foreign government. Whether or not the US is a friendly government is out of the question. You've just disqualified yourself for a security clearance, or at the very least, added 20 hoops to your security screening.  Have fun becoming a foreign service officer when you're disqualified because you wouldn't be able to start on time or obtain the necessary clearance to work at the political/trade level. I'm not talking about just Canada, but many governments worldwide will automatically disqualify you on that basis alone, like France.
* Where should I volunteer? Will it be relevant?: Think about now many changes to your career path you've had over the past 15 years. How likely is it that your experience will be relevant when you have another career paradigm shift? Volunteer at a cause you like and believe in, don't take a position just because it sounds nice or looks important. Do you like work on climate change? Ecojustice. Poverty alleviation? Homeless shelter. Kids?  Community centre or the library. Spiritualism? Your church, your mosque, your temple, whatever. The arts? Art gallery or an art council. Law Enforcement? RCMP Auxiliary/VPD Community Policing program. 
*  **But I can't find any positions!: I will personally look for volunteer positions that meet your interests if you PM me. I'll reach out through my network to make a placement if there isn't one already that you can qualify for. If you were going to work for free making money for some business, I imagine volunteering will sound even better.**
* What are the alternatives to volunteering/working? Start your own business (entrepreneurship), start a non-profit (working on small tangible change) or start your own [community service project](https://funding.tigweb.org/) with government funding. "

So excited today that I finally got the visa for a funded research internship abroad. Now that I am all done with the visa and everything, I finally feel so excited. Having few friends, I don't have anyone to share my excitement with. So I thought to share this small piece of news with you guys. This excitement however is accompanied by a sense of apprehension.  I am scared about the new environment, the new systems and most of all the complete Independence. At the same time I am looking forward to have a new experience,meet new people and of course, do some interesting research.
Writing this down feels awesome. 
Thanks for reading fellow Redditors.
PS: Any tips about living and managing expenditure (keeping expenditure to a minimum as the funding seems to be just enough) in Germany (that's where I am headed) are welcome.

8acarz,5,2018-04-06,[EVENT] Descendants of the Sun,ElysianDreams,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/8acarz/event_descendants_of_the_sun/,"SABC has concluded filming on **Descendants of the Sun**, a South African adaptation of the hit 2016 Korean television series of the same name. 

Starring Lucian Westwynter as SANDF Special Forces captain Cyrus Strydon and Aisha Nganga-Ismail as trauma surgeon Dr. Ashley Patel, Descendants of the Sun examines conflicting philosophies and outlooks on life, even as fate meddles in the lives of mortals. 

Descendants of the Sun will be airing on SABC2 on Thursdays at 7PM, with simultaneous broadcast in other languages on SABC3-6. Descendants will also be released on Viki and Netflix as episodes are released, and will be available for international markets both subbed and dubbed. 

**Cast**

* Lucian Westwynter as Captain Cyrus Strydon
 * The commanding officer of Alpha Team, a fictional special forces unit of the SANDF 5 Special Forces Regiment. Cyrus followed his father, a retired Warrant Officer, into the South African military and graduated from the SA Military Academy at the top of his class. Strydon cares little for the politics of war and believes in protecting and defending those who need help, his country and his men's honor, even if it means having to question his superiors' orders. His light-hearted approach to life and witty sense of humor made him popular with his team but Patel quickly realizes that it was his way of deflecting her questions about his job and coping with the pain of losing comrades.
* Aisha Nganga-Ismail as Dr. Ashley Patel
 * A trauma surgeon at the Huerta Memorial Hospital in Gauteng, Ashley is an assertive woman who believes that competence overrules connections but is hit by the harsh reality that she still cannot go anywhere without any connections. She stands firmly by her principles and doesn't fall prey easily to her emotions, though she is not afraid to admit her mistakes.
* Xander Nhlapo as Staff Sergeant Alistair Mkhize
 * As Alpha Team's senior NCO, Alistair is a career military man who sticks to his principles and is extremely loyal to Strydon and his comrades. He is notorious amongst recruits and Academy cadets as a strict instructor. His level head and vast experience often come in handy in times of crisis during deployments. Mkhize counters Strydon's happy-go-lucky attitude, and possesses a sharp deadpan sense of humour. He has feelings for Lieutenant Li, but struggles to reconcile his emotions with his military code.
* [Angela Chen](https://redd.it/7h82pm) as Lieutenant Sabrina Li
 * An army lieutenant who is also the daughter of SA Special Forces Brigade commander Major General Li. Sabrina was a junior of Strydon's at the SA Military Academy, and did her internship at Huerta Memorial Hospital. At her first assignment she meets Mkhize, a non-commissioned soldier. Their relationship was considered a taboo as she was an officer, but does not stop her from pursuing Mkhize, despite her father's disapproval.

**Synopsis**

Cyrus Strydon and his second-in-command Alistair Mkhize are off-duty when they stop a thief from stealing a motorcycle and apprehend him. The thief's injuries during his capture mean that he is sent to the hospital, but Mkhize realises that his cellphone had been pickpocketed during the arrest, forcing the two to go to the hospital to retrieve it. 

In the emergency room, Strydon meets Dr. Patel and is instantly smitten. His nickname ""Boss"" leads Patel to assume that Strydon is part of the thief's criminal gang at first, but he manages to prove his identity with the help of army surgeon Sabrina Li. 

Patel and Strydon begin dating, but due to their jobs their dates are often interrupted partway. Eventually, Strydon receives orders to deploy to the fictional East African country of Azania as part of a United Nations peacekeeping mission there. Before leaving, he and Patel come to realise that their lives are too different; Strydon as a soldier kills to protect lives, while Patel is bound by her Hippocratic Oath to save them. They agree to break up, having found that they have too little in common. However, months later, Patel rebuffs the advances of the hospital director and so is ""volunteered"" to lead a medical team to Azania, reuniting her with Strydon. 

Mkhize, meanwhile, has been forced by Li's father to cease his relationship with Sabrina for breaking fraternisation rules, or risk being discharged from the army. But Li is determined to stay with him, and so arranges to be assigned to assist the aid mission in Azania, also reuniting with Mkhize and Strydon. 

While in Azania, a number of disasters and crises (including an earthquake, French mercenaries attempting a royalist coup d'etat, and an epidemic) lead Strydon and Patel to grow closer together. Patel gains an insight into Strydon's job and is forced to confront the stark reality that she may never have full disclosure of his whereabouts due to the highly classified nature of his work and the possibility of him being killed in action. The two eventually resume dating, despite the challenges thrown their way. 

The two continue their relationship after returning to South Africa, until Strydon and Mkhize are sent on a classified mission in which they disappear and are presumed dead. Months pass, and Patel, mourning his loss, commemorates his passing with a volunteer trip to Ethiopia. This is where Strydon, having been rescued from captivity by an Arab soldier who he had helped earlier, finds her. 

Strydon and Patel, along with Li and Mkhize, are happily reunited in the finale. The series ends with a multilingual cover of the original show's theme song ""Everytime"", performed by Angela Chen (Lt. Sabrina Li) and Xander Nhlapo (SSgt. Alistair Mkhize), with backing vocals by Lucian Westwynter (Capt. Cyrus Strydon) and Aisha Nganga-Ismail (Dr. Ashley Patel).

8acebx,11,2018-04-06,Quirk type's distinctions?,DoraMuda,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8acebx/quirk_types_distinctions/,"On the *MHA* wikia, the Quirk types are defined as ""Emitter"" (apparently the most common type of Quirk; e.g. Bakugou's Explosion or Kaminari's Electrification); ""Transformation"" (allowing the Quirk user to temporarily alter their own bodies; e.g. Kirishima's Hardening or Mt. Lady's Gigantification) - although it's apparently also referred to as ""Hybrid""/""Composite""; and ""Mutant"" (basically passive Quirks that change the user's body and are immune to Aizawa's Erasure; e.g. Shiozaki's Vines or Hagakure's Transparency).

OK, so the ""Transformation"" category is a bit iffy, regarding how there are some Quirks that seem like they could fit into either ""Transformation"" or ""Mutant"" (which *may* be why the former can apparently alternatively be referred to as ""Hybrid""/""Composite""), but other than that, these Quirk types seem fairly understandable.

But, in Viz's translation of chapter 14, ""heteromorphic"" types are mentioned as the ones immune to Aizawa's Erasure, which we can assume is ""mutant-type"". The other two types, ""operative"" (presumably ""emitter-type"") and ""transformative"" (presumably ""transformation-type""), are mentioned here too, as the only types that Aizawa's Erasure works on.

But then, in chapter 72, when everyone's training their Quirks during the school trip arc, Vlad King mentions ""heteromorphic"" *and* ""composite types"" across a panel depicting Asui and Shouji respectively, and that they need to ""further train those extra parts and appendages"". Vlad, however, doesn't even mention ""transformative"" types (unless they're included in the category of ""composite"").

So, what's tripping me up is whether or not ""composite"" was perhaps something invented by Viz, or whether we just have certain characters in the series that belong to *two* Quirk types. I mean, for instance, Ojiro's Quirk is simply that he has a ""Tail"", but later in the Internship arc, the notion of a ""Quirk Factor"" is introduced, with Aizawa explaining that his Erasure could cancel out a person with a tail's ability to *move* said tail, but not remove the tail itself (which makes sense). So, what would Ojiro be?

Similarly, take Shouji, for example. His Quirk, ""Dupli-Arms"", *isn't* simply that he has six arms or, to be more accurate, these webbed tentacles on his body (which, if it was his Quirk, may signify it as a mutant or ""heteromorphic"" type), but that he can *replicate* different parts of his body on the tips of said tentacles. I'd presume that Erasure wouldn't take away his tentacles (which are always present), but simply his ability to duplicate his body parts on those tentacles.

Then there's Asui, whose physiology is that of a frog in human form. To be specific, she can jump long distances; stick to walls; extend her tongue up to 20 metres; eject/wash her stomach and secrete slightly stinging liquid; and (more recently) camouflage to her surroundings. I wonder how Aizawa's Quirk would work on her; would it just disable her entirely? Would it only target certain aspects of her frog-like physiology?

So, what are your thoughts? Is the issue that Horikoshi hasn't been clear enough in explaining Quirk types and their distinctions in the world of *MHA*, or have I just not understood things properly?"

The German word Furst means first or prince. The German word burg means a fortified tower or stronghold. The House of Furstenberg are Roman Catholic and are intermarried with Italian and Austrian nobilities like the House of Windisch-Graetz, House of Schwarzenberg, and House of Hohenloe. They are also intermarried with some Jewish bloodlines as well as being involved with the Nazis. Prince Maximilian Egon II of Furstenberg was a friend of Willem II and was a commander of a Nazi paramilitary regiment. Gloria Guinness married Prince Franz Egon of Furstenberg-Herdringen and she was suspected of being a Nazi spy. Adelina von Furstenberg married Gloria Guinness' son Prince Franz Egon von Furstenberg-Herdringen and they reside in Switzerland. Victoria Niarchos parents were from the Guinness and Furstenberg families and she married the Greek billionaire Philip Niarchos. Diane von Furstenberg first married into the Furstenberg family and still uses the name even after getting remarried to the multi-billionaire Barry Diller who is a co-founder of Fox Broadcasting Network along with the Vatican knight of St Gregory Rupert Murdoch who is worth over 13 billion. The family has residences in the United States. The Vatican is controlling Fox Network and Fox News. The Furstenberg family are top members of the Holy Roman Catholic League and many members of the family are Knights of Malta. Talita von Furstenberg is an American fashion model who goes to Jesuit Georgetown and worked for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

Many members of the Furstenberg family are involved in acting, fashion, media, and they receive their education in Switzerland. They have residences in Switzerland because of private Swiss banking which allows them to conceal their wealth. Alexander of Furstenberg is the CEO and founder of Ranger Global Advisors and was CEO of Arrow Capital Management and a board member of W.P. Stewart &amp; Co. which is a subsidiary of AllianceBernstein based in Bermuda. Prince Alexander is also on the board of directors for IAC broadcasting with his step father Barry Diller as the chairman as well as Chelsea Clinton as another board member. IAC also bought out Savoy Pictures which takes its name from the House of Savoy. Savoy Pictures produced the movie a Bronx Tale another Hollywood mafia film that connects back to the Italian Nobility. Prince Antonius of Furstenberg married Princess Matilde Borromeo of the Italian Nobility. Edoardo Agnelli was a major shareholder of Fiat and his daughter Clara Agnelli married Prince Tassilo of Furstenberg and they are the parents of Prince Egon von Furstenberg. The Borromeo family are also intermarried with the Agnelli family. The Furstenberg, Agnelli, and Borromeo families are all closely working together. The Furstenberg family are like a top or first Holy Roman Nobility in authority due to their connections with the Vatican. Peter Freiherr von Furstenberg is Vice President of the German Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Prince Christian von Furstenberg was Jesuit educated from Georgetown and is also a Knight of Malta. Princess Massimiliana von Furstenberg is a Lady of Malta.

The Furstenberg family produced several bishops and priests for the Roman Catholic Church like Cardinal Friedrich Egon of Furstenberg, Archbishop Franz Egon of Furstenberg who was also prime minister for Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, and Cardinal Maximilien de Furstenberg of Belgium. The Furstenberg family incorporate a jester on their coat of arms and this suggests they have a portion of authority over the Masonic Royal Order of Jesters as well as the Juggalo gangs. The Masonic Jesters are the most sadistic and menacing secret society involved with getting intoxicated off adrenaline filled human blood and then terrorizing people with threats, slander, and lies. The Order of Jesters also uses comedy for political manipulation and deflecting from serious issues. Barry Diller owns CollegeHumor with members connected with SNL, John Oliver, Samantha Bee, and the Daily Show. The Furstenberg family also use black and white colors on their coat of arms which is another Masonic symbol. The pearl on their coat of arms symbolizes the shell of Venus. Prince Heinrich of Furstenberg is the current head of the House of Furstenberg and his wife is Princess Maximiliane of Windisch-Graetz Austrian nobility. Prince Antonius of Furstenberg and Prince Alexander of Furstenberg are both menacing and sadistic. Prince Heinrich was educated in Vienna Austria and is a knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Prince Heinrich is a major private landowner with properties all over Germany, Austria, and Canada and the Furstenberg family still own many castles throughout the former Holy Roman Empire. They are the second largest private landowners in Germany. This family is insanely sadistic.

8afgdw,3,2018-04-06,Short 9/10 day trip to Paris and Italy itinerary - Advice?,stonayoung,solotravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/8afgdw/short_910_day_trip_to_paris_and_italy_itinerary/,"Hello everyone,

I am a 22M from Canada who will be doing his first solo-trip this late April to early May. While I know that 8 days is not even close to being enough in getting to know France or Italy, that is the only amount of time I have free as I am an intern who gets no vacation days (this free week comes from moving to a different coop position). Hopefully this trip can be the beginning of bigger things to come (maybe next summer). I was wondering if there were any tips and advice you guys could give to my itinerary as it will be my first solo-trip and first time in Europe.

**Day 1**: Land in Paris and reach city centre around noon. Drop my luggage off at the hostel and try to have a relaxing (if that is even possible in Paris) walk centered around Jardin du Luxembourg. Get a peak of Pantheon, Notre Dame and Pont Neuf. After a nap, go up the Eiffel Tower at night.

**Day 2**: Get in the Louvre and try to stay there as long as I can.  Place de la Concorde and Jardin de Tuileries early evening.

**Day 3**: Get in the Orsay and try to stay there as long as I can. Stroll down the Seine in the early evening.

**Day 4**: Go to the west side of Paris in the morning to see the Eiffel Tower in day light. Arc de Triomphe glance and Champs-Elysees. In the afternoon, get a tour of the Notre Dame. Take a 7PM sleeper train to Milan.

**Day 5**: Wake up at 6AM in Milan. Leave baggage at station and do a quick morning tour of the city. Take a train around noon to Florence. Walking tour of historical monuments in Florence for the afternoon.

**Day 6**: Get in the Uffizi and try to stay there as long as I can. Take a train around 5 to Pisa just to get a picture of the Leaning Tower (I know it's not reddit's favourite destination but might as well visit it if I'm so close to it). Take an evening/night train to Rome.

**Day 7**: Roman monuments tour. Colosseum, Circus Maximus, Forum and Roman baths.

**Day 8**: Vatican tour. St. Peter Basillica, Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums.

**Day 9**: Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Piazza Venezia and Roman architectures.

**Day 10**: See anything I might have missed in the morning and fly back home at noon.

So something to note:

- ""Day 6"" of the schedule in Uffizi may not be available if I decide to cut the trip a day short because I my first day at work will be right after I return home. As a big fan of history and art, missing the Uffizi would be a big blow though. I will definitely try to get there in a bigger trip next summer.

- Being an immersion student in Canada, I have a decent grasp of French. So hopefully that will come in handy sometime.

- I know that I will be missing a lot including the Versailles, Borghese, Invalides and Bologna but extending the trip is likely not possible for me. 

- Budget should not be THAT big of an issue for me as I will only be away for a relatively short amount of time and I have been saving up for almost a year. 

If there are any suggestions or advice, I would really appreciate it!"
8ag1ct,10,2018-04-07,I posted my first ever stand up video here about a year ago. Here's what's changed.,Jlopiwens,StandUpComedy,https://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/8ag1ct/i_posted_my_first_ever_stand_up_video_here_about/,"I joined the Ithaca College stand up club back in fall 2016, and after that started doing school shows/local events. 
(first performance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eucbP-CGhtM) 

I was incredibly nervous and often talked over laughter because I didn't know how to react other than to push through to my joke since I'd already started saying it. I didn't understand laugh/applause breaks at all, and I powered through my sets as fast as possible. It got easier the more and more I did it, but when you're doing local shows in a small town like Ithaca, there's only so much you can do to learn audience dynamics since it's usually the same people coming. So when I got into the Los Angeles program for the semester, I saw it as an opportunity to crack into a whole new frontier? if that makes sense. 

I was staying in Burbank and was working 10 hour days at my internship, so I couldn't go to any early mics (6-8) but I did eventually end up going to Flappers Comedy Club. I was scared shitless. I'd never been to a *real* comedy club before, so I was stepping out onto new ice so to speak. I ended up doing a Tuesday night bar mic there and it was the single greatest moment of my life. I was shaking, sweating, heart pounding, and on top of all of that, I also nervous. Then I got my name pulled from the bucket and I grabbed the mic. I don't know what came over me after that, but it was like I became a whole new person. I delivered my set to roaring laughter and any nervousness went out the window. So after my set, I went back, and back again. Then I discovered the weekend mics in the Yoohoo room, and it was even better. I developed a ton of confidence on stage, and using the critiques I got from you guys here I slowed down my pacing, gave laugh breaks, and I just killed it. 

I'm back in Ithaca finishing up my Senior year in college, but I can't wait to get back to LA. When I do shows here, I don't even get nervous anymore. Going and being before a wide range of audiences was an invaluable tool for me to get better and all it took was that one plunge into the unknown. 

(This is the latest set I did. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4jzLtCEEXw)

When you look at both of the sets, one thing I noticed is the body language. I'm not just standing in one spot ""reciting"" lines. Yeah, I fucked up the delivery of some things but that's because I'm a mush mouth and wrote the set 5 minutes before I went on. Didn't get to memorize it. (I wasn't originally going to be in this show, but ended up doing it.)

TL;DR It gets better.

I also just wanna say thanks to all of yall who took your time to watch and critique my last sets when i posted here. It definitely helped. 

Also, shout out to Flappers Burbank. They're great over there, definitely check it out if you're in the area. "

Why? Because you're its main reporter, gathering news from alternate realities.

***
""Look, kid, I don't want you along, I don't want to teach you, you're an inconvenience,"" I said a bit unkindly perhaps. ""But I have to teach you the job, and by God I'm going to teach you the damn job.""

""Are you aware this is not *Full Meta Jacket,* Ms. Seraph?"" Mark said with an idiotic grin. The kid was in his early twenties, tall, blond - a sharp contrast to my short stature and jet black hair - and thought, like every 20 and change kid, that he was the king of the damn world. Or worlds as it may be. He kind of reminded me of me actually. 

Which was why I hated him. 

""Do you know the mortality rate of our trainees, kid?"" I asked, pretending I hadn't heard him. 

""Wow you really think it *is*-""

Christ, this kid. I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him off his feet until he was inches from my face.  
	
""75 percent. Got it?"" I said, his wide blue eyes staring into the depths of my opal irises. ""Three out of four die, of the remaining 25 percent, most are missing in action, stranded in some hell, and what few are left drop out. There's a reason there have been five reporters in he Onion since 1988."" I let him go and kid practically fell to the floor. His eyes were wide and his face was bloodless. ""Do you understand now?"" I said, keeping my voice low. 

The kid opened his mouth to say something then decided against it. Instead, he just swallowed and nodded. 

""Good,"" I said. ""Follow my instructions and you might not die."" Without waiting for a response I laid my hand across his forearm and with my other hand activated the TransTemporal-Relocator, or the TTR. 

I'd been doing the job for just about two decades and I still wasn't used to the sensation. It was as if my center of gravity shifted *out of my body* and I stumbled as I lost my balance. But the feeling fades and we're there. Wherever that might be.  

Decades of experience saved us. I'd once dropped into a a nuclear test site, and another time in the middle of a horde of demons. The first few seconds of any Stumble as well called it were the most dangerous. 

So when I landed in the driver's seat I immediately slammed the breaks as a car tried to ram us from the left. The car careened, and since it didn't hit us, hit another car on the left. They both spun out and hit the divider in the middle of the - I looked around - twelve lane highway. 

""What the fuck!"" the kid shouted next to me. 

I briefly glanced at him - he was holding a box of pizza. We were in a sleek, red sports car. There was a GPS in front of the car and a timer in the bottom left. Five minutes, three miles away. Got it. The TTR always did this, put us in fantastical scenarios or events, and we had to play them through. Rarely longer than an hour, they were the stories I wrote for every Onion piece. 

“In the next one half mile, take the exit 27,” the GPS said in that infuriatingly kind voice. Some things stay constant across dimensions. 

“Th-that’s impossible,” the kid said. “You’re on like the tenth lane, how’re you gonna make this exit?”

“Recklessly,” I replied. “Hold on to something.” I flung the steering wheel left and crossed two lanes immediately. A couple of people honked on their horns as I cut them off but I paid them no mind. I slammed the breaks to get behind a car on the right lane and swung left again. Four lanes to go, and the exit was in sight.

“We aren’t gonna make it,” the kid said, practically in tears. Christ, I would take overly eager over useless downer any day.  

I looked in the rear view mirror and saw another one of those black cars who had tried to ram us before. In seconds he was in parallel with us to my right. I could break or speed up, forcing him t miss. 

Or I could be insane. 

“Sorry kid,” I said, as the car slammed into our right. I’d relaxed already though every muscle in my body screamed at me to tense up, and so all I suffered was some seatbelt burn and ear damage when the car slammed into us. I timed a sharp left as it did and we flew across the last some lanes, directly into the exit. The car tried to follow but was T-boned by a white minivan. I let out a whoop of joy as we rattled through the road.

I spared a glance at the kid. The door had dented inwards, and his arm was at an impossible angle. I checked his pulse with my hand – still alive. Small favors, I suppose.  

The rest of the trip was relatively uneventful. I drove into a suburban neighborhood until the GPS indicated I’d arrived. With ten seconds left I practically ran to the doorbell and rung it, breathing heavy. 

A dejected looking man who reeked of vodka opened the door. “Aw, fuck you, bitch. Would it have killed you to arrive four seconds later?! Is free pizza really that much of a fucking loss?”

I pointed to my car ad the dying intern. “yeah, douchebag, it is.”

The TTR beeped, the end of the experience. Once more I “Stumbled,” and we were back in my office. I didn’t have to be in contact with the kid on the return trip, and so he was there to, landing on his broken arm. He let out a strangled scream of pain.   

The medics were already on standby and rushed to help the kid. I watched as they put him on a stretcher and escorted him out. I shook my head. Idiot. Should never have signed up for this. 

I sighed and went over to my computer to start the article. “Pizza Corporatism: The Lengths Pizza companies will go to make sure you don’t get free pizza.”

I have to make a series of decisions in the next couple weeks:

1.)	Do I go to Champaign or UIC? I pretty much know the answer to this one. I’m just worried about what happens should the worst come out of this semester. 

2.)	Do I take Vector Calc. at COD now or over the summer?
 Pros to now: Good teacher, once it’s over, I won’t have to worry about it. 
Cons to now: It’ll be added at the worst possible time during the semester. Also, it’ll cut into the marathon exams and it could jeopardize my admission to Champaign. 
Pros to Summer: It’s the only class I’ll have to worry about; I can devote most of my time to it. 
Cons to summer: Bad teacher, and it could also jeopardize admission to Champaign. I need to ask Dave and Scott about this.

3.)	Do I live with Colin and Mark, or by myself?
a.	Pros to living together:
i.	Rent is lower.
ii.	I can ask Mark and/or Colin for help if they’ve taken a class I’ve taken.
iii.	It could be fun.
iv.	You’ll probably be more aware of your health (i.e. take care of yourself better).
b.	Cons to living together:
i.	We’ll be spending more on personal expenses.
ii.	House is old and requires a decent amount of maintenance.
iii.	They will both find out how much of a lazy bum I am and (unless I learn to change that), I’ll be the “asshole” of the group.
iv.	It’s farther from campus.
v.	Friendships could become strained. (You haven’t lived with them before, so you might learn some things (and they might learn some things about you)).
c.	Pros to living alone:
i.	No worrying about someone else judging you for little (or big) stuff you do.
ii.	No need to share the bathroom.
iii.	You get to learn how to do household stuff at your own pace.
iv.	Your friends will still visit you periodically.
d.	Cons to living alone:
i.	Rent is higher. Much higher.
ii.	You have no one to go to for help when you need it.
iii.	Living alone at Loyola was a bit depressing.
iv.	Finding a place by myself may be difficult.


4.)	What to do over the summer?
a.	Internship (if someone replies back and I nail the interview)
b.	Job (probably some place with a help wanted sign, or maybe something related to the Civil Engineering field if I’m lucky).
c.	Doing nothing is NOT an option.

Overall, I’m feeling overwhelmed, and I’m worried that the semester is 2/3 of the way over. I wish I had more time for everything. By this time one month from now, EVERYTHING mentioned above needs to be planned out. To be honest, I kind of miss last semester now. Sure, it was stressful, but I felt better then than I do now (even after getting into Champaign).

Prologue: Just a dude looking to get better at reviewing/analyzing anime. I hope you enjoy the review and the discussion that follows! Critiques are welcome.

***

While my parents are my greatest heroes, I wouldn’t be where I am today without a couple of *other* heroes in my life: my younger brother and my older sister.

My parents taught me how to be a good person and looked out for me as I grew up, but my siblings have been the ones that I could rely on and confide in indefinitely. My brother and I have shared the same interests, played the same games, and supported one another in our endeavors. As for my sister, she has been my role model my whole life, her hard work and her stalwart determination inspiring me to achieve my own dreams.

To me, they’re heroes, too. Heroes in their own way. And, much like its first season, *Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season* would back me up in this claim once more.

**STORY**

*Boku no Hero* gets right back into the series after the conclusion of the craziness at USJ with the terror plot by the League of Villains. Deku, Ochako, Bakugo, Tsu, and the many other students of UA academy have zero chances to rest, however, for they find themselves embroiled in events once again.

Since the first season established the premise, the elements, and the direction of the anime, this second season targets beyond these foundational items. *Boku no Hero* now turns its attention towards building on its core, empowering it through three distinct arcs that each have a particular goal in mind: the Tournament Arc, the Hero-Killer-Internship Arc, and the Final-Exam Arc.

First up, the classic Tournament Arc requires the entire first half of the season, calling forth the teenagers to duke it out as close friends and worthwhile rivals. Therein, the anime showcases much of what makes the series a blast to begin with. Meaningful duels. Nice comedic segments for a lighthearted feel. An awesome display of the numerous Quirks both on their own and in unison.

This arc also serves a secondary function. Inherently, it forces most (if not all) of its side characters into the spotlight. Again, the first season was typically about the beginning of Deku’s journey, so it makes sense that the story would divvy up its focus by peering into the other people that surround him. What better way to do that than with a set of events designed to get everyone involved?

The second arc, the Hero-Killer-Internship Arc, is arguably the most interesting of the three. The students solidify their hero names, learn the ropes from on-site professionals, and some even square off against a high-profile villain for the first official time. Better yet, this arc places the most emphasis on the underlying plot when it highlights the *aftermath* of these events.

Normally, and especially with an anime like *Boku no Hero*, people understand that goodness creates goodness. That’s why All Might exists as the Symbol of Peace: to inspire others in the unending quest for what is right. However, the *opposite* direction also holds true. Evilness spawns evilness, and Stain’s influence (and by proxy the League of Villains) instill in the baddies a renewed vigor for hate. Forming this important parallel and exploring it in this fashion demonstrates strong writing chops on the show’s part both now and when these two sides ultimately clash.

Lastly, the Final-Exam Arc acts as a culmination of the first *and* the second seasons combined. It takes what Deku and his friends learned and experienced, applying their knowledge in the faux-villain battles with the professors they have come to know and love.

Where the first arc struts the show’s stuff and the second arc explores its ideas on good versus evil, this arc primes the series for its next iteration. Potential romance subplots surface, vital background information reveals itself, and the conclusion marks a definitive stopping point between the opening portion of this tale across almost forty episodes and what will appear in the seasons to come.

All the while, *Boku no Hero* improves its weaknesses or at least maintains its strengths. The dramatic sequences no longer encroach on out-of-place or over-the-top territory, Bakugou's dialogue (while still incessant) now has a realistic foundation, and its vital message about what it means to be a hero doesn’t get lost among the many additions to this story. Combined with the purposeful arcs, the new ideas, and the higher execution overall, this sequel deserves a lot of praise.

**ART &amp; ANIMATION**

*Boku no Hero* does not deviate much from the presentation of its previous visuals. That’s both a good thing and a bad thing.

Per usual, the anime doesn’t lose sight of its very nice character designs. Returning cast members sport the same looks and heroic outfits which still express their personalities and their capabilities. Moreover, the new designs rock, too. Stain, the other new villains, Mei the sidekick, and some new heroes each go about wearing their own distinct getups, fitting right alongside the veterans of the series. They’re all so creative and interesting and neat that it’s hard to *not* appreciate them in some form.

Unfortunately, the artistic direction also once again toes that average line. Lighting and background artistry still remain rather underwhelming throughout the show, but better cinematography and advanced (relative to the first season) fight choreography push back against these woes. Plus, the continued finesses with its expressive reactions and minor details (usually during comedic bits) demonstrate extra care in the visuals.

As for actual animation, *Boku no Hero* earns those high marks again. Deku, All Might, Todoroki, Iida, and everyone else constantly find themselves duking it out with somebody, and the movement from their different actions, powers, and strategies almost never lets up. *Especially* for some of its stand-out scenes at key points in their battles.

To be absolutely fair, however, the anime noticeably tries to avoid animation throughout the Tournament Arc. Specifically, it reuses many minutes’ worth of previous content and the same tiresome opening spiel at the beginning of each episode of this twelve-episode span. But, given that the tradeoff is several awesome instances in the animation both then and afterwards, it’s not too much of a price to pay.

On top of the fun RPG motif for the second ED’s visuals, the art and the animation within the show once again earn high marks for the majority of its presentation.

**CHARACTERS**

In this second season, *Boku no Hero* follows the logical next step. Where before it mostly focused on setting up its bigger players (e.g., Deku, All Might) it now turns its attention to its supporting cast. Not that the show ignores these three or anything like that, of course. Rather, it now aims to round out the experience by bringing everyone else along for this superpowered ride.

Much of this rounding affects fringe characters such as Mineta. Normally reserved for ecchi, comedic asides, he has his own time to shine when it counts. Or even Anima, who has basically not said a single word for almost forty episodes, likewise receives (however slight) some backstory all his own.

The anime goes a step further with some of its other side characters. Fan-favorite Ochako finally reveals her major motivation for enrolling as a hero, granting her more respect than just the cute girl of the group. Yaoyorozu finds herself conflicted over lowered confidence which then explores a different side to her seemingly perfect self. And Fumikage gives the audience better insight as to the strengths and weaknesses that *every* hero must contend with personally.

None of the supporting cast thus far explode forth with the strongest writing imaginable. Yet, again, even taking the time to build their foundation in this manner really goes a long way towards making *Boku no Hero* feel less like a Deku-and-random-people story and more like a Deku-and-*friends* story. Nowhere does this sentiment become apparent better than with the heavy exploration of two characters this season: Todoroki and Iida. 

Todoroki wields flames and ice in a half-and-half manner, and those same emotions erupt within him. Before, his cold, distant behavior painted him as an angsty teenager rather than a troubled person. However, as the anime depicts, that’s certainly not the case. His controlled upbringing, his estrangement with his own mother, and his fierce determination force (or perhaps *doesn’t* force) his hand.

As for Iida, he has always been the straight-laced character, taking up the mantle as class representative and championing the righteous path. It makes his fall from grace of sorts this season that much more powerful. Having looked up to his older brother his entire life, he struggles upholding the ideals that have shaped him as a person as he succumbs to a vengeance that no hero would deem acceptable.

Thankfully, they have Deku nearby. Yes, it’s nice to *finally* see him make noticeable strides in commanding the ultimate Quirk (for his previous attempts, while important, were quite miniscule). But his greatest contribution has always been how he puts himself out there for his dear companions, and that does not stop in this season either.

In Todoroki’s case, Deku pushes the limits on his own body to their extreme to get this troubled guy to realize that he isn’t a product of genetic mutation but instead his very own self. In Iida’s case, he, alongside Todoroki, boost that heroic passion within him, standing as the very examples of the tenets he lost sight of momentarily.

Taking everyone in the cast together, they also happen to expand on *Boku no Hero*’s original theme. The first season asked the question, “What is a hero?” Within this second season, it gets more specific when it now asks the questions, “What is a hero *to them*?”

Ignoring apparent danger to save another person or fighting for a peaceful world certainly make these characters heroes. Yet, they are not all the same. Some wish to give their parents a better lifestyle. Some wish to prove their worth. Some wish to be the best. Some wish to put a smile on their face. No matter the circumstances, these characters have their goals, their hardships, and their characterizations that guide their *own* takes on what it truly means to be a hero. Progression on this theme demonstrates maturity in the writing and therefore a stronger direction for the anime overall.

Not everything goes smoothly for the characters this season. Shigaraki, the main villain of the series, is still not a very interesting adversary despite his importance within the story. Learning about All Might’s counterpart and that guy’s involvement in these proceedings, however, introduces an interesting twist that will benefit the evil side in the long run (just not any time soon).

Bakugou also receives the short end of the stick this season. His small improvements in the first season counted as big milestones for him as a person, but, over these twenty-five episodes, he doesn’t budge much from his charged, arrogant attitude. Granted, he wouldn’t be Bakugou if he didn’t yell about being number one all the time, but it seems as if *Boku no Hero* wastes many of its chances on him to start turning over a new leaf in favor of keeping as close to his status quo as possible.

One could *also, maybe* harp on the anime for forgetting about specific characters after their arrival. Hitoshi, the mind-controlling boy, and Grandtorino, Deku’s mentor during his internship, are the two names that come to mind who basically disappear after they do what they need to. But that would be overly nitpicky. The anime already does a very nice job of providing its non-main characters the attention they deserve, and it expands on its main theme in a notable manner. Two traits which bolster the series to a greater degree.

**MUSIC &amp; SOUND**

[The first OP for *Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season* can be heard here.](https://animethemes.moe/video/BokuNoHeroAcademiaS2-OP1-NCBD1080.webm)

[The second OP for *Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season* can be heard here.](https://animethemes.moe/video/BokuNoHeroAcademiaS2-OP2-NCBD1080.webm)

[The first ED for *Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season* can be heard here.](https://animethemes.moe/video/BokuNoHeroAcademiaS2-ED1-NCBD1080.webm)

[The second ED for *Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season* can be heard here.](https://animethemes.moe/video/BokuNoHeroAcademiaS2-ED2-NCBD1080.webm)

Much like the visuals, *Boku no Hero*’s musical choices and audio direction carry over from its first season and into this second season. The voice-acting performances persist in their range, emotion, and strength. The different sound effects for the different abilities induce variety and intrigue. And the original soundtrack relies most on its triumphant, heroic tracks when otherwise it presents an okay set of songs.

The biggest change, of course, comes from the opening tracks and the ending tracks. In terms of execution, they’re unfortunately a small downgrade. However, they still bring the fun and the hype that the anime thrives on.

“Peace Sign”, the first OP, meanders along with competent guitar strings, a simple drum beat, and some clapping in the background, yet the nice vocal work keeps the track from falling behind. The second OP “Sora ni Utaeba” stands as the stronger of the two. The infrequent female singer contrasts with the passionate male vocalist with her peaceful delivery, and the piano keys throughout infuse melody into the piece itself.

The EDs are roughly the same. The first ED “Dakara, Hitori Janai” takes on a slightly more whimsical feel with its daintier instrumentation, multiple vocalists, calmer pace, and optimistic tone. And that last lyrical triplet before the piece concludes cannot be denied its catchiness. As for the second ED, titled “Datte Atashi no Hero.”, it ends up as the weakest of the four tracks, lagging in its song structure and general creativity.

Despite these OP-and-ED combos not living up to the first season’s, a couple of the individual tracks still have their own quality aspects. Furthermore, the VA performances, the sound-effects, and the OST make up for whatever small misgivings they may incur.

**ENJOYMENT**

I must admit, the show has proved me wrong.

In my review of the first season, I wrote how the supporting cast weren’t the most interesting, that “I simply don’t see them as characters that I will be remembering once the series inevitably concludes.” After watching *this* season, I need take back some of my words.

I have always liked Ochako and Tsu, and that sentiment hasn’t changed, for the former’s kindness and the latter’s honesty usually gets me smiling. Yet a lot of the other cast members have started to win me over. Yaoyorozu is a cute, sincere girl who worries about her friends and holds a lot of pride. Iida is a respectable dude for his unending sense of justice. Todoroki is an interesting fella who now feels like one of the team. Mina is ecstatic, and Fumikage is a cool guy. Even Mei, the sidekick inventor extraordinaire, had me smiling at her passion and her love for her “babies.”

Returning favorite All Might is a blast to watch as well as he goes (mostly) all out during the last arc of the season. Moreover, the Mickey Mouse president finally reveals his genius-esque Quirk (while also going slightly insane as he gets caught up in the moment). I was also happy to see Deku stop maiming himself constantly, and the budding, romantic feelings Ochako shares for him got me as giddy as giddy could be.

Not to mention Midnight’s sexiness, the running joke between the granite-and-metal duo Kirishima and Tetsutetsu, and the crazy action scenes that occur with almost every single episode. To be fair, I now find Bakugou more annoying than ever (which I didn’t think was possible), and I cannot say that I have been swept up by the fervor that surrounds this anime quite yet.

Even so, color me impressed.

*Boku no Hero Academia 2nd Season* flies a tad farther than its predecessor. Worthwhile continuations to the narrative, continued success in its audiovisual direction, larger exploration of the supporting cast, and even more entertaining traits form a sequel whose popularity clearly does not go unwarranted. Indeed, the show is a heroic sibling all its own.

**SUMMARY**

Story: *Great*, this second season carries the torch forward, bringing back the cool elements, expanding on the hero-versus-villain motif, and following through on what has and what has yet to come

Art &amp; Animation: *Good*, while the core artistry still feels underwhelming, the creative designs, the awesome fight scenes, and the smaller details keep the presentation in high spirits

Characters: *Good*, Todoroki, Iida, and many other side characters earn a ton of focus to round out the experience, they investigate what a hero means to them, but Shigaraki and Bakugou feel like wasted opportunities at this point in time

Music &amp; Sound: *Good*, the OPs and the EDs are a minimal downgrade from the first season, but the strong VA performances, the intriguing sound-effects, and the okay OST return without fault

Enjoyment: *Good*, it’s nice to be proven wrong now and again

Final Score: 8/10

Update: Just solved a challenge for an internship. Despite the painful flashbacks, I was able to sit down and ace the goddamn challenge."

8ahdit,1,2018-04-07,M4F - Secret Celeb Romance,lost_in_vegas_17,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ahdit/m4f_secret_celeb_romance/,"Wanting to play the secret lover of a famously beautiful woman today, in a fairly vanilla/romantic roleplay. The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
 
Open to either short or long-term scenes, so feel free to PM me anytime you see this."

I’m new to reddit and this my first post. So sincere apologies if I’m breaking any rules. I’ve got an admit from NCSU, for (graduate) masters in computer science program, and also from BU’s computer science program. Now I’m really confused between selecting one of the two because of several reasons and I’m hoping maybe you guys can help me out. 

1. I’m an international student and I would like know what the average living expenses for the city are, preferably the rent and other overheads. I don’t expect you to go into the details, but some information would really help out. 

2. What are your views about the university? Is the university good from academic and industrial opportunities point of view? If you could also help me with knowing how the faculty at NCSU is , it’ll be of great help!(preferably from the Computer science department) I’m assuming that people in this community are/have been a part of NCSU, hence the question. 

3.  How’s the transportation in the area? Is it cheaper to buy a bike and roam around the city? Or public transportation good enough for basic travels? 

4. How’s the course of CS at NCSU? I’m really interested in Data analytics and machine learning area of CS, it’ll be of great help if you could give me an insiders view of the prospects I could pursue at the university! Also, your views or experience from the point of view of internships and job opportunities would be of GREAT help. 

5. Finally, I’ve also got an admit from BU, and given the far cheaper tuition fees, I need help selecting a university between the two. Hence the post itself. I do understand that you might not able to give your views on Boston University, but if by any chance you have some experience about it I would love to know that. "
8ai6ez,2,2018-04-07,[Repost] My grandfather is offering me a $10k practically interest-free loan. Would I benefit or suffer given my current situation?,thricethagr8est,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8ai6ez/repost_my_grandfather_is_offering_me_a_10k/,"**TL;DR** - This loan isn't something I necessarily need.  
My question(s) is basically: Will the advantage of this loan, if any, provide any considerable benefits I am not seeing? Or will the benefits be negligible and I should just buckle down harder?

### Quick Background ###


**Myself** 

25(M) IT professional (2 years full-time experience, IT for 5). Pretty poor growing up, single mother raising the hellion myself and sister were. First in family to go to college.  
I try my best to make financially responsible decisions and to live humbly within my means.  
I nearly fainted when I got my first paycheck as an intern in college.

I spent my college years being extremely cheap (read: cheap, not frugal). It was, and still is, hard to shake certain behaviours and perspectives when I was poor for so long. I suffered quite literally mentally and physically at the result of my penny pinching. 

I've since adapted a much more balanced lifestyle. But indeed it still remains difficult to tote the line between enjoying this ride of life knowing I could not wake up tomorrow morning versus long-term retirment planning knowing I'll likely live for another 60-70 years.

**The $10,000:** My grandfather has been retired for several years now. He owned and operated several photography/camera stores for close to 40 years. Has some residential properties, etc, etc.  
He's offered, or rather I've asked and he accepted, to loan me a bit of money in an attempt to help me get ahead. 


I've come up with what follows, but I'm not sure if it's the wisest approach.

By ""practically interest free"", I mean 2.3%. The rough terms I will drew up:

* Initial Loan: $10,000  
* Monthly Payment: $700 ($345 direct-deposited every two weeks)  
* Repayment Period + Interest: 14 months = $10,230.  

***

### Current Holdings/Income ###

##### Full-time job #####


* $70,000 pre-tax. I've been working in IT full-time for 2 years.  
* My take home pay is pretty close to $3,600/month ($1,800 every two weeks).

##### 401k ##### 


* $17,000 contributing 3%. Employer matches 100% of first 3%, 50% of the next 2%.  
* I have only recently reduced my contribution amount. It was at 5% for basically 2 years, but I figured that extra 2% wasn't worth it and could enjoy the extra income, albeit tiny amount.

##### Betterment #####

* $885. 90% stock/10% bond. 
* I know I should be contributing more, but right now this basically serves as my emergency fund.

##### Teaching ##### 

* $500/month.
* I've been teaching part-time since August '17. I'll receive $1,000 before June. I don't teach during the summer, so these payments will stop until August. I basically treat this money as a discretionary fund.

***

### Current Expenses ###

I live in the Midwest in a 1 bedroom apartment I love. Great neighboorhood, tons of resturants, bars, night-life, etc within walking distance. 
	
##### Rent #####


* $825/month. There is a massive amount of renovation/construction underway in my neighborhood and the adjacent city. I'd guess once it's complete, the area will be in much higher demand, possibly increasing my rent?

##### Electric/Heat #####


* ~$130 average. Accidentally spent two winter months on ""EM Heat"". Had no clue what that was until I did my own research :x

##### Car Payment #####

* $400/month. 
* I bought a new 2017 Mazda 6 after driving my first car ('99 Cavalier) for 9 years. I plan to on getting +2x years on this. Totally happy (though perhaps not the most frugal) with my decision. I'm not a car guy so I won't want to switch/upgrade likely ever.  It's just a car to me.

    * Full loan = $25,700 @ 5.99%. 
    * Remaining = $23,000
    * Insurance = $80/month ($470 6-month premium)

* ^ This is where I think I should be primarily attacking if I take the loan ^


##### Student Loans #####

* $16,800.
* I attacked these extremely hard from '16-'17. Down from $36,000. This means I don't ""need"" to make a payment until 2/2021.

Type | Amount | Rate
---------|----------|----------
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $4,650 | 3.860% fixed
Federal Perkins | $3,900 | 5.000%
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $3,500 | 3.400% fixed
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $3,500 | 3.400% fixed
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $2,800 | 4.290% fixed
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $2,200 | 3.860% fixed


##### Life Things #####

* $380 
    * Groceries = ~$100/month. I generally try to stick to this per month. Rough estimate.
    * Internet/Netflix = $60/month
    * Cell phone = ~$60/month. Two lines through Ting. 
    * Nightlife = ~$60/month. Usually go out one night a weekend. Again a rough estimate.
    * Eating out = ~$50/month. I don't eat out much, but when I'm suffering on my couch Saturday morning, having Chinese delivered is a miracle. 
    * Error = $50. Accounting for a likely error/omission

** Estimated Total Monthly Expenses = $1,850 **

### My Ideal Breakdown ###

1. My ""plan"" is to take around $4k of the 10, and dump it towards my car loan. This would stave off my $400 monthly payments for 10 months. But then again, I'm essentially just doubling and replacing this with my repayments towards the $10k loan, right? 

2. I could takes an additional $2,000 to bolster my emergency fund. 

3. The remaining to attack that Perkins Loan @ 5.00%?

### My Reservations ###

Even after typing all this out, I'm not sure if there is any inherent long-term benefit (apart from the avoided interest payments?) from gaining $10k now.  
    
1. Am I seeing things clearly? Perhaps I'm just being blinded by the overall lump sum of $10,000.

2. I'm assuming I'd have to pay taxes on the $10k? 

3. What does /r/personalfinance think?

I got accepted into an internship in Florida for over the summer working with sea turtles. Working with sea turtles would be my dream job and while this internship most likely doesn’t guarantee employment following it will still be beneficial to my experience and resume. This internship would involve living away from home, family, and my boyfriend for 12 weeks (someone I’ve never done before).My boyfriend and I see ourselves in Florida in our near future anyways. Now all of a sudden I have a state government job interview where I am from that would be full time work, benefits, and get my foot in the door to a great future. (More anxiety for a job interview now yay) Someone I know involved with this line of work mentioned it often takes months to hear if you got the job so I’m hoping I can do the internship and maybe come home to this job but then I’m stuck back in Home town. I can’t stop thinking about the future and just want to find my career to start a family sooner than later. Also something at work happened last night where someone complained (I think about me) and how I do not greet them just sit on my “gadget” and not smile at them which got me so annoyed I went to bed so early last night just to avoid my anxiety and anger.

8ajm77,19,2018-04-07,"Failed A Hair Drug Screen, My Experience",OneBitterBerry,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/8ajm77/failed_a_hair_drug_screen_my_experience/,"Hi all,

I just got through the process of taking a hair drug screen, and thought I would share my experience as I read several Reddit threads before I took my test. 


**Background**

After going through 3 interviews for an IT internship position I got a very good offer both experience and pay wise. I was expecting them to urine drug test, if any, but weeks after accepting I received an email stating I needed to have my hair sampled in the next 48 hours after submitting my info.  

I am a college student from the states with fine/thin brown hair, workout 5 times a week, and usually vape a ""bowl"" every other night or so before bed to wind down. 


**What I Tried** 

I received the email that I would need to submit a hair test on spring break so I delay submitting my information until the week was finished, but I had smoked the night before and knew I was screwed anyway.

There are SEVERAL Reddit posts detailing how they passed, and little to no posts on failures except some comments.

* [Paychmedics Hair Test. What I wished I had known.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/4884jh/paychmedics_hair_test_what_i_wished_i_had_known/)

* [I have a proven way to pass a hair test... I've passed 4 hair follicle tests thanks to it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/5ft0k0/i_have_a_proven_way_to_pass_a_hair_test_ive/)

* [I passed a hair test: What I did and what I learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/361bno/i_passed_a_hair_test_what_i_did_and_what_i_learned/)

* [How to pass the hair follicle drug test](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/606hh1/how_to_pass_the_hair_follicle_drug_test/)

* [I passed a hair follicle test and so can you!](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2mtrfh/serious_i_passed_a_hair_follicle_test_and_so_can/)


Most of them have some variation of the Macujo and Jerry G method of cleaning your hair, which I am not going to describe here as you can look at the other posts.  I was able to find *some* science to back these methods up. 

Jerry G:

[Influence of the cosmetic treatment of hair on drug testing.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9228567)
""In all cases the drug content in hair that had undergone cosmetic treatment decreased in comparison to untreated hair. The majority of the mean differences were in the range of 40%-60%"" 

Macujo:

[New extraction method of THC and its metabolites](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c2af/fc988a020d6f46efe64d19ca0ff3e62373f2.pdf)
This source is a stretch, but they used acetic acid (vinegar) in the process of extracting THC and its metabolites. 


**Timeline**

I was given way more time then I was supposed to because I series of slow responses in emails.

Days 1-4 - On spring break. Couldn't do anything but stop smoking, sit, and sulk. Gave my friend my edibles.

Day 5 - Macujo method, didn't hurt or ruin my hair, but stripped all the oils from it. 

Day 6 - Macujo again, started to hurt

Day 7 - Macujo, hair still didn't seem that bad. That's why I wouldn't rely on the macujo method alone. If you've been smoking, you need to really fuck your shit up.

Day 8 - Interviewed with another company

Day 9 - Bleached my hair, left it in for over two hours, hair looked dumb.

Day 10 - Bleached my hair again, noticeably damaged, then redyed it to look presentable, then let the vinegar and salycilic acid sit.

Day 11 - My hair was garbage, I was confident I would pass and started to focus on reviving it.

Day 12 - Got my hair collected, clipping two spots on the back of my head a little more than 1 inch long. The collector was very nice saying the company was great, and it would be awesome to work for them forever, I laughed nervously. 

Day 21 - Got a call from the drug screen company that they had found marijuana in my sample and were forwarding it on to the employer

Day 23 - Received an equally/better offer from the company I interviewed with earlier, pending a urine test. I have never been so relieved in my life. 


**Conclusion**

The whole process was extremely stressful and my hair is wrecked. I understand that I brought it on myself by smoking while knowing that several companies drug test. I just think its ridiculous that they wouldn't want me as an intern/employee only because I smoke sometimes in my free time. They had already invested several hundred of dollars into recruiting me, and now that money is just wasted. I honestly don't understand this. However, I am beyond excited to start with the other company, and hope I can continue to succeed in the future.

8ak7kd,4,2018-04-07,Extreme boredom,InAMotelRoom,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8ak7kd/extreme_boredom/,"Hi,
I've been feeling depressed for a couple of years, with ups and downs. It happened after a breakup with my gf I've been living with 3 years. I've never seeked professional help as it's expensive and my condition isn't life threatening. I just feel bored all the time and don't get any interest in anything, new or that I enjoyed, nor anyone, friends or family. I don't feel particularly sad, though I do get melancholic sometimes, for no reason. I can't find enjoyable videogames anymore, or good series. I exercise regularly, eat healthily (which might be the only thing I still enjoy), got a full checkup with doctors. I have some chronic medical conditions that are just discomforting (tinnitus, headaches, jaw and back muscle tension pain).

I'm soon to be graduated as a software engineer (currently carrying out my last internship). I fight to go through every day and come home to feel exhausted, with nothing interesting to do. I'm an ENTP personality and usually get energized by being with people so I've been thinking of getting a room mate. I've given guitar lessons during my studies to make some money but I don't feel like I can get any better now.

 I have lots of ideas of projects (apps, games, songs, ...) but I lack the motivation to realize them. I'm thinking of just dumping them somewhere on the internet in case someone else has the opportunity to make them come true.  

I've been travelling abroad for 10 months and got home 2 months ago. I'm thinking of leaving again after I get my diploma. 

Anyway I guess lots of people here have been/are feeling the same, so how do you cope with it?"

Since I already have several intern and project experience, I’m no longer satisfied with just delivering the mockups. What I’m shooting for is the opportunity to work closely with engineers and get my products shipped. That’s how I get my sense of accomplishment. 

However, I fail to do it.

It’s hard to find a design problem that will be implemented on the roadmap in the near term, because the engineers have so many stuff on their plates.

It’s hard to motivate myself because I am not involved in the decision making process even though I tried to talk to my PM so many times.

It’s hard to get help from my mentor because she knows what situation designers are facing but she just keeps saying “don’t feel demotivated and your design will be implemented in the future”.

I just keep wondering what impact I can make, even a tiny little bit,  to improve user experience.

Yes, I took the courage to have hard conversations with my mentor on the issues I’m facing.

Yes, I brainstormed some pages in collaboration with an engineers enthusiastically.

Yes, I talked to the salespeople and project manager to understand what value designers can provide for our clients.

You know there’s a psychology concept called Learned Helplessness? 

The more I tried, the more powerless I feel.

I’m not sure what the next step is. Stop shooting for the impact and start to polish the mockups?

I feel there’s a misalignment of my expectation for my role and the company’s expectation for me.

Any advice?"

I won't go into too much of my background unless you all think it would help. Long story short, I'm a junior and an economics major who did a summer internship out of high school in risk management for a top 20 US private company. I was offered the opportunity to work for them part time while going to school and flash forward almost 4 years and I'm still working for them. I dropped out of college for two years since I was struggling trying to figure out what I wanted to do which is why I'm still working and haven't graduated. I have seen lots of threads talking about internships and was wondering how employers would look at my job experience compared to someone who did a more actuarial internship. 

I'm just trying to find out if it would be better for me to continue my job or try to find an internship.

Thanks for the help!

Had a hellish busy season as turnover has been immense and senior shortage is acute. Senior and manager postings at my firm have been open for almost half a year with no one filling positions until I came. Word around town is no senior wants to work at my firm. 

Was basically moved from client to client to fill deficiencies while having to do both manager and senior work with interns as staff on multiple engagements. Many engagements were absolute shit shows where the client hated us because of the constant turnover and workpapers were in disarray. 

Near the end of busy season - I could not work more considering the sheer amount of hours and lack of support. Began to have anxiety attacks and struggled to bring myself into the office and would start to come in around 10 or 11. 

I expressed to management that I was burnt out on multiple occasions verbally and in email but they still are assigning me more clients on top of my current load (probably because they have no concern and mostly because they have no one else). 

Now we have come to a juncture. I basically told management that I was going to leave if this continued and spoke with my old firm. Old firm which I have a good reputation with, said they would take me back and could work remote from current city (had multiple years of very good reviews and managing partner likes me).

Issue is, I am too burnt out to go back and am now stuck in this position - advice?"

8amxzm,11,2018-04-07,[S14E18 Spoilers] Grey's Anatomy Recovery Plan,mattisnotvegan,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/8amxzm/s14e18_spoilers_greys_anatomy_recovery_plan/,"Okay, lets be honest - Grey's Anatomy is going downhill. These last two seasons haven't been particularly strong (I personally like this season but its nothing special) and this brings the risk of it being canceled, especially now that Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw have been fired. This therefore is a plan on how Grey's Anatomy could be saved and be strong. So here are some ground rules:
* No saying 'Sarah and Jessica shouldn't have been fired and they should come back'. I agree, I'm sad that they've been fired but their storylines have already been filmed and concluded.

* Lets not compare it to older seasons; if the newer seasons are the same or similar then the show would be repetitive and boring.

**So without further ado, here is how the next season should unfold (in my personal opinion):**

* **Meredith should be with Dr. Marsh**
Okay so don't hate on me all you MerDer shippers, Derek is dead and Mer deserves happiness.
They clearly had chemistry ~~unlike Jaggie~~ .

* **Jo should become more of a central character**
Okay, I know the season nine interns aren't the most popular interns out there but to be honest, I find Jo to be one of the most interesting characters remaining on the show. I want her to specialize in Ortho and become even more badass. However, I think the way that she can get more of a spotlight is if she is involved in the next tragedy (on par with the shooting and plane crash). This might give her PTSD which gives her a close friendship with Owen and, *concept*, he could set up a video call with Christina so that they could talk about their mental health - this would satisfy everyone missing Sandra Oh and it would also make for a really interesting storyline (yes I know PTSD has been done before but that was to a completely different demographic and I feel that in a time where tragedies befall us almost daily it could be pretty powerful and informative to a different audience).

* **Chill with the sex talk for goodness sake**
I know that this show is a romantic drama/medical drama but oh my god, the last few episodes haven't stopped talking about sex. We want more casualties, mass traumas and just genuinely interesting cases. The only recent cases I've really cared for are Kimmy (Alex's current patient), the boy who was shot in the neck in *Personal Jesus* and Eli (April's patient, the Rabbi) and thats because Kimmy's case is tied to medical innovation and Eli's was to with April's crisis of faith. The boy's case in *Personal Jesus* was very relevant in today's society and was particularly eye-opening.

* **Give some male characters interesting storylines**
So I know that when a show has been going for this many years that it can be hard to think of good storylines but for the men have seriously taken a backseat for so many seasons now. Owen hasn't really had a good storyline for so long (I do think that he is getting one now with the fraudulent doctor who intentionally falsely diagnosed his patients to take their money so I am very excited for that, I hope it's not concluded badly though).

* **End Jaggie**
This is a very common complaint amongst Grey's viewers. Jackson and Maggie have just been forced together and its just uncomfortable to watch and borderline-incestuous. They have zero chemistry too.

* **End the DeLuca and that intern's relationship**
I can't remember her name tbh. The only time that DeLuca is really on screen is when they are having sex and its just not interesting. I assume that they are strapped for storylines for him as he wasn't introduced with much but I think that he could be involved in the aforementioned tragedy and perhaps he could lose several fingers be badly burnt. This could also give Jo a strong storyline where she tries to build him new fingers and reconstruct his nerves. Also, she's leaving anyway as she's starring in that revival show.

* **Alex rekindles his Africa Project**
This is sort of an exception to the rule about not comparing to old seasons but I have a plan for it. He finds out about a child with Spina Bifida there and he thinks its a good idea for them to see his ortho-enthused fiance, Jo. As he reviews the paperwork as the child is being transported over, he notices the surname Limbani and he realises that the child is the older sibling of Zola (her birth-surname was Limbani). I think that this is a great opportunity for more Zola screentime as well as some cute Jolex moments.

* **Teddy becomes a main character again**
So we've seen a little of Teddy this season but I really think it'd be a great idea as she has so much potential. Also, she's a fan favourite so it would undoubtedly boost the ratings.

* **Jackson dates his current transgender patient**
Before anyone says anything dumb like 'OmG nO #jApRiL fOr LiFe', calm down. I liked Japril too but Sarah was fired and Jaggie is trash. Correct me if I'm wrong but there are not many couples on TV where one of them is transgender and the other is straight (personally I want Jackson to be bisexual but thats not the point). An alternative to this which would satisfy the bisexual thing as well as the transgender thing is that he dates the transgender intern who hasn't gotten much of a storyline yet.

* **Amelia and Maggie**
I'm not sure what to do with Maggie and Amelia tbh, they have potential for good storylines. I'm open to suggestions. Please leave out Private Practice spoilers I haven't gotten around to watching it yet.

* **Carina gets some spotlight**
I think she has a lot of potential too, I'm not sure what she could do but she seems really interesting.

I'm open to comments and input and I will update this as I receive it.
Please be respectful of my opinions, don't be an ass.

8amzz0,6,2018-04-07,Should I continue sitting for exams?,3418,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/8amzz0/should_i_continue_sitting_for_exams/,"Hi /r/actuary!

I'm bothered by a few things:

- Sitting for each exam has a greater opportunity cost than the last. Instead of spending 150 hours prepping for MLC or MAS-I, I could instead hone my CS skills by contributing to some open source projects as part of Google summer of code, or spend it on Hackerrank/Leetcode preparing for software engineering interviews.

- Exams no longer count towards both societies. I've worked in both P&amp;C and Life, both have a different set of problems to solve but are just as interesting.

- I find studying for exams fun. I'm a good test-taker. If I were to forget about all the CS stuff, I like to think I could have my ASA or my ACAS by graduation. I also feel really productive when it comes to the exam grind, more so than when I do any other work.

- I really really like to spend time outside and be with my friends.

Up to now, it's been easy. I've been working in actuarial roles so it's a no brainer to write exams while I'm at it. However, this past internship I've been in a product development role which:

- paid far more than any actuarial internship I've heard of.

- was just as interesting as traditional actuarial pricing work (I have not worked in reserving).

Combining all of the above, I'm really conflicted. Should I continue to sit for exams if I don't know if I'll even end up using them?

I heard the news when I got back to my apartment after coming from work. A small part of me was sad, but for the most part, I felt relieved. I didn't really like my grandfather that much, not only because were we not that close, but mainly because of how he treated my grandmother, aunts, uncles, my parents, and sometimes me and my siblings and cousins. He was a my-way-or-highway type of guy, always had to be right about everything. He often talked down to others, including his wife and children. He would constantly bark orders, even in front of visitors. My dad told me when he was a child, he either went to his friends house across the street or would lock himself in his room to get away from his father's constant screaming and anger. Everyday when he came home from work he would often find something to yell his wife and children about. No one should ever have live to live in fear in their own home. Before my siblings and I were born, my father vowed to be a much different parent than his father and he kept his word. He is the most fun-loving, patient, and caring father that anyone could ever ask for. My mother is the same. I couldn't imagine growing up in a household like the one my father grew up in. A 15-16 year old shouldn't have to stand up for his 43 year old father in an argument, nor break up a fight. He would shout insults without regarding other people's feelings and would bark orders at us. When my siblings and I were kids, my grandpa would bark orders at us when we'd go to visit his house. He made us do chores and would berate us for not doing them right. He would often tell my dad what an awful job we did and how lazy and bad behaved we were. The first few times my dad believed him and would reprimand us, but later on he could tell that he was just making up bullshit. When my brother accidentally broke a glass (he was only 8), my grandfather pulled him into another room and spanked him until he cried. My grandmother took him to a room in the house and put him to sleep. Another time, my grandfather called me stupid for forgetting to do a chore. I nearly burst into tears when that happened.  I once overheard him insulting my mother when she wasn't there. I didn't tell my mother what happened, but I bet she would have wanted to know. He once drove home while sipping a beer while my siblings, two other cousins and I were in the car with my grandmother while coming home from the Russian day celebration. I tried to tell him that it was illegal, but he ignored me. Then grandma, who sat next to him, intervened and told him to stop. Luckily we made it back safely. None of us told our parents or our aunt what had happened because we wanted to keep the peace. Two years later, just a few days after my high school graduation party, my dad and grandpa were arguing and he called my dad stupid in front of his own wife and children. Seriously, a 75 year old man did that. For my dad, that was the straw that broke the camels back. He stood up to him, and ceased all contact with him. I could list more incidents, but for this post I'm going to keep it short. In fairness, my grandfather could be kind when he wanted to, but it was the lack of empathy, patience, and emotional connection as well as his constant abrasiveness that I found hurtful. My grandmother was a much kinder person altogether but she was unable to stand up to her husband even on occasion when I went to her for help. After his death, the following thanksgiving my grandmother, whom surprisingly wasn't upset at my non-attendance of the funeral, sat down with me and told me an hour and a half long story, something that I wish I had known more in detail before. Well, okay, my father told me this many times. But not in any great detail. I forgive my grandfather and am proud of the hard work and sacrifices he made to come to this country. I also know that he had a difficult childhood back in Ukraine whereby he was poor and was constantly treated badly by his parents. That makes me feel really sorry for him. However, I cannot forgive or excuse the rudeness and abuse. He seemed to channel his frustrations onto us. If he had the ability to just talk to us, but he didn't, and we've have had to live with the results ever since. During one of my internships, I went to that school counselor for therapy and have been doing on-and-off therapy since then without ever lasting positive results. My girlfriend felt that I was being insensitive for not going to my grandfathers funeral. She probably wouldn't understand because she had loving grandparents. But I kept my thoughts to myself. Nonetheless, I have been grateful for her understanding and support. However, despite my good upbringing, I'm questioning whether or not to have children, or even grandchildren, for that matter lol, because I'm afraid I might treat my children the way my grandpa treated me, even though my parents treated me the exact opposite. To this day, I still do not understand why my grandmother stayed with him. She deserved so much better. Anyway, am I a cold heartless person for not going to my grandfathers funeral?"

My girlfriend felt that I was being insensitive for not going to my grandfathers funeral. She probably wouldn't understand because she had loving grandparents. But I kept my thoughts to myself. Nonetheless, I have been grateful for her understanding and support. However, despite my good upbringing, I'm questioning whether or not to have children, or even grandchildren, for that matter lol, because I'm afraid I might treat my children the way my grandpa treated me, even though my parents treated me the exact opposite. To this day, I still do not understand why my grandmother stayed with him. She deserved so much better. Anyway, am I a cold heartless person for not going to my grandfathers funeral?"

I just wanted to know how easy it is to get internships here. How about getting job offers after graduation? What kind of salary are we looking at? Also, how is the atmosphere at SJSU? If I do not go to SJSU, I might just stay another year at my community college and aim at the upper end UC's. 
Thanks everyone. "

For the TD1, it was just simply the tuition amount I will pay for the summer, fall, and winter term. As for the TD1BC, it says I should add $200 or $60 for the months I'll be enrolled full-time or part-time. Which would be Summer and Fall being part-time (internship) and Winter being Full-time. My dilemma is, I pay for my tuition for Winter in 2018 but i go to school in 2019. Do I add the $200/month for Winter (2019)?

The reason I am asking is that if the add the $200/month ($800), I can safely check off the no paying tax box at the back."

Pretty casual, we were friends in school and I hadn't seen her in a while. Ran into her in a corner store and asked for her number.

I've taken her out for dinner a couple times, and we were slated for a third time this past Tuesday. She ended up cancelling and offered up this Tuesday instead, on account of an internship she just got.

She is really busy, has a job, college, and now an internship. She also helps around her house with her younger brothers.

I'm hoping to tell her I really like her on our meetup this Tuesday. That said, everything until now has been very casual, and I'm not sure how exactly to play the whole thing.

This is mainly because I want to see her more. As it is, we're waiting for breaks in her (packed) schedule, and there aren't a lot of opportunities to see each other. I'd like to be closer to her, but I don't really know of a way to say that without sounding creepy/stalkerish."

Nothing has ever turned me on more than power. If that's a kink, then I have it. There is nothing in this world more sexy than the feeling of a man having complete and utter control over you in every way of life.

Today is the day Opulence Magazine, my place of work for over 5 years was to be taken over by the prominent Fabreau Publishing Corporation. One of many business ventures of the mysterious billionaire behind it all. Fabreau is a household name, manufacturing everything from computers to coffee cups, and now they've decided to expand into lifestyle magazines. It was a sudden yet non-hostile takeover, and so far there have been no firings. I hold out hope that my job will be spared, but in the week since the company was purchased nothing significant has happened.

Opulence Magazine is the city's most popular home and lifestyle magazine, despite being relatively new. Opulence was founded a mere six years ago, and since then has gained over 250,000 monthly subscribers. I work as a photographer and columnist and am one of the most well-known writers of the magazine, due to my recurring and popular section titled 'What's Hot And What's Not: A Glimpse Into The Homes Of The Elite' in which I simply detail whatever overpriced garbage is trending that month. By far my favourite section is the 'Self-Help Corner', in which I adopt a fake name and answer people's problems, be they personal, financial, decor or otherwise. It would be safe to say my job is no more than a pastime, while I work my way up to something more...substantial. I have no fondness for the vapid lifestyle these people live, and even less taste for traipsing about their homes listening to them ramble about their pink marble bench-tops. Unfortunately, this is what my life has come to. I wear a pencil skirt each day for a decent wage and a part of my soul to be ripped out.

I reflect on my next article on the short walk from the taxi to the front of Opulence's main office. It's an intimidating red brick building, reaching 5 floors and casting an angry shadow across the sidewalk. I open the heavy, frosted glass main door and...walk face-first into a business suit. Inside the business suit is a man who would make Brad Pitt feel bad about himself. His chiseled jaw was dusted with the perfect amount of facial hair, and his eyes were the most entrancing deep brown I'd ever seen. I could've gotten lost in them for hours without even knowing time had passed. After a moment I realise I've fallen to the floor, and the godly figure above me is reaching out a large hand, complete with long, beautiful fingers. ""Are you alright?"" I take his hand and he lifts me up. ""Wow,"" he continues, voice like melted chocolate. ""What a way to make an entrance."" I giggle, unable to resist his charm. He flashes me a grin with perfect, white teeth. ""And who am I speaking to?"" He asks, as I melt.

""My name is Delilah. Delilah Salace. And who might you be?"" The man chuckles, a cheeky glint in his eye.

""I'm Dominic Fabreau, owner and CEO of Fabreau Publishing. I guess that makes me your new boss."" I feel the blood leave my face. Of course, how could I have not realised that the man in front of me was the man, full stop. Dominic Fabreau. Business mastermind. Mysterious philanthropist. Bachelor of the year five years running. I muster up a smile and turn our grasp into a handshake.

""Pleased to meet you sir, I hope I have the honour of seeing you again."" His expression changes at the word sir, but I choose to believe it's because he feels too young for the title. After all, he's all but 29 years old.

""Yes. I think you will be seeing more of me."" With that, he's gone. behind him hurries a short, middle aged woman with a clipboard and an important air about her, His assistant. I continue on to the elevator and make my way to my cubicle.

""Delilah. Delilah!"" I'm broken from my trance by Kathy, former intern, now she writes the houseplant section, and shares a small two-bedroom apartment with me.

""Sorry...what were you saying?"" I was distracted for god knows how long, thinking about that man...that wonderful man. More than anything, I wanted to see Dominic Fabreau again.

""I was saying we should go out for drinks tonight. It's Friday, the company is part of Fabreau Publishing of all things, and I think we deserve a celebration!"" She throws up her hands, grinning.

""I'm not sure, Kath."" Her face falls. ""You know I don't really like to drink."" Kathy pouts, poking my arm.

""Come on, Dee. I bet we can get into the Insub, now that we're Fabreau girls!"" The Insub is a really high end nightclub notorious for it's underground level, devoted to the sexual arts. No one gets in unless they're on the list, or very, very important.

""There's absolutely no way, but if it'll get you to leave me to my work, then I'll go,"" I say with a grin. Kathy blows me a kiss and hurries away, back to whatever column she was completing before. I didn't really want to go out, but after meeting Dominic, I needed a distraction. My quality of work was suffering.

__________

The line for Insub was shorter than I expected, although Kathy still made us skip it. I stood a few steps back as she argued with the bouncer. ""You have to let us in, we work for Dominic Fabreau!"" Namedropping seemed to be her tactic.

""Listen, lady, we can't just let people in here. You call Mr. Fabreau, get him to come down here and tell me directly that you're his girls and then maybe I'll consider letting you in."" He was a beefy man, six foot seven inches of muscle in a bulletproof black jacket. There'd be no fighting our way in, that's for sure.

""They are most certainly my girls, and we're all going to be entering the club now."" An arm made its way around my waist and with a jump I realised it was Mr. Fabreau.

""Mr. Fabreau. I...yes, of course."" The bouncer stepped aside as Kathy and I stood frozen in shock. Dominic simply took our arms and pulled us gently yet firmly into the club, sitting us down in a booth.

""Now, ladies. Don't try to take advantage of my status, he said over the music. ""Luckily for you, I'm a kind man, and I'd be honoured to buy your drinks for the night."" He said this while making intense eye contact with me, and I felt my mouth dry. A drink would be fantastic.

Six drinks later, Kathy was on the dance floor with a handsome Hispanic man, who was probably also very rich. Dominic had moved us to a private booth, away from all the noise. I sat awkwardly sipping my tequila sunrise, Dominic watching me intently. ""Mr. Fabreau,"" I began, but he pressed a finger to my mouth.

""You are to call me Dominic."" The tone of his voice...he wasn't asking, he was commanding.

""Dominic...I was wondering, why did you buy Opulence?"" Dominic's mouth morphed into a grin, and I felt my panties moisten. He was, with a doubt, the sexiest man I'd ever seen.

""I often find myself unsure what to do with my money, and so I often invest in smaller businesses. Yours had potential."" Mine. It wasn't mine. Far from it, actually. But I didn't dare to point that out.

""Thank you for buying my drinks,"" I said, realising I'd not said so. Dominic continued to stare into my soul with those fantastic eyes.

""What can I say, you've made quite the impression on me."" He stands up, placing three one hundred dollar bills on the table. ""I have to leave. Use this for anything else you'd like. I'll see you at work tomorrow, Delilah."" The way he said my name made me shiver. He said it almost as if it was a threat, and yet I couldn't help but feel insanely turned on.

I'm lying on a silk sheet, on my stomach. I'm blindfolded. My wrists are shackled to the bed. The leather cuffs have a soft, cushioned inside. The bed is in the middle of the room and a man paces around it, occasionally brushing his hand along my naked body. Where his fingers touch, I erupt into goosebumps. The feeling of his skin on mine sends shudders up my spine. ""Delilah,"" he says, almost like a threat. ""You haven't been a good girl, and we must correct bad behaviour."" There's a light slap as a cat of nine tails hits my upper thigh. I shiver as the tingles rush up my body. I can feel my nipples erect and my toes curl. ""Delilah."" Again, he threatens. Fingers brush up the small of my back, followed by another burst of tingles. I moan into the mattress. A hand lightly slaps my buttock. ""Don't make a sound, Delilah. You mustn't interrupt."" Another burst of tingles on my other buttock. It takes all my willpower not to explode into a satisfied moan. Dominic runs his hand down my leg before spanking me again, this time a little harder. ""You must be a good girl, Delilah."" Another spank. ""If you misbehave again I'll have to think up a new punishment."" Three more consecutive spanks, each one harder than the last. He runs his hands up my body before bringing down the cat of nine tails once more, hitting both my thighs and following it with a forceful spank. I can't help it. I moan.

Just before noon the next day, Kathy, hungover as all hell bursts into my room. ""Dee, you've got a package. I don't know where it's from and it wasn't mailed, but here."" She slams a large box onto my bed, grinning through her hangover. I rip the packing tape off and open the box. It contains what looks like a designer dress, and on top is a note. On the note, in beautiful cursive handwriting, I read 'Delilah. You are to wear this tonight at the Fabreau Charity Gala. You're representing your company, so play nice."" Underneath is Dominic's neatly scrawled signature. I think back to the dream I had about him last night. Hopefully I can look him in the eyes. ""This is fantastic!"" Exclaims Kathy, clapping her hands together. ""Maybe he'll make you the new Admin Officer. Gregory was fired five days ago because the Fabreau PI's found out he was lying on his resume."" I knew Gregory had been fired, but I hadn't known why.

""I doubt it. He just...took a liking to me, when I ran into him."" I told Kathy about the incident, but she'd just laughed it off. Apparently though, that was the wrong move, because Dominic really had taken a liking to me. If it progressed the way that dream had gone, I can't say I'd be disappointed, but at the same time I knew I had to be wary. ""What time does the Gala start?""

The Fabreau Charity Gala was started in 2009, when Dominic had made his first million dollars. After gaining a rapport with the local aristocracy, he decided to put his connections to good use. He provides them with an upscale networking opportunity with guaranteed press coverage, and in turn they donate to whatever charity Dominic likes best that year through the auctioning of frivolous goods. Ironically, Dominic himself had never been seen at one of these events, something that added to his mysterious reputation. This year, money raised was to go towards providing vaccinations, medications and sexual education to people in remote African villages in an attempt to stop the spread of preventable diseases such as malaria and HIV. It was a cause I have a small amount of passion for, yet one I didn't have the funds to help. At 9pm sharp, a limousine arrives at my building, and I hesitantly get in. I find myself alone aside from a bottle of ridiculously expensive champagne, and a crisp white envelope. First, I pour myself a glass of champagne to help cope with the night, and then I open the envelope.

Delilah.

Welcome to your new position as Administrative Officer of Opulence. Inside you will find an AmEx Black Card. This is for both business and personal use, and is personally funded by me. There is no spending limit, and my only condition is that you bid generously on tonight's auction.

Dominic.

Again, his signature. I tip the envelope upside down, and the elusive AmEx Black Card falls into my lap. I pick it up and quickly place it into my purse before feeling the limousine come to a stop. I exit the car after the chauffeur opens my door, and I'm met with the blinding flashes of the paparazzi. I put on my most winning smile, strut up the red carpet laid out, and enter the building. In the foyer stands a large mirror, in which I see myself. The dress I wear is tailored perfectly, despite Dominic never measuring me. It's a deep shade of red, coming down almost to the floor. The top is a fitted, beaded bodice and the bottom flares out in beautiful waves. My auburn hair is in a classy updo, and my makeup was expertly done by Kathy, an ex-MUA. She's given me a soft brown smokey eye to highlight my green eyes, and lipstick to match my dress. my shoes are strappy heels, expensive enough to look like they belong, but black to stand out. I walk along the tall hallway into an even taller ballroom. I'm not sure where I am, but it's beautiful. Everywhere, rich celebrities and entrepreneurs flit about, holding flutes of champagne and laughing together. A waiter hands me some champagne and I force myself to walk into the crowd, desperate for a friendly face. Within seconds, a young woman in a stunning black v-neck dress taps over to me. ""Darling, you look absolutely wonderful! I can't say I've ever seen you around. My name is Grace White, I'm the owner of Insub, as well as a few other clubs here and there."" I shake her outstretched hand and smile.

""Hi, I'm Delilah Salace, I'm Admin Officer at Opulence."" Grace sharply gasps.

""Oh, my dear, you're from Dominic's new company! Oh, I should've known. He's such an inconsistent man, buying all of these businesses for fun. Well, I hope you have a lovely night. You're a little late, but I'd venture to guess you're Dominic's representative. That man loves to make us wait. Come come, the auction is about to start!"" She drags me into the middle of the room with everyone else, and an auctioneer walks out, followed by a podium and a cart full of fancy-looking items. The bidding is tough, and I see nothing I'd want in my home until the final item.

""Here we have our final item, number 47, a beautiful painting by Dominic Fabreau himself, entitled 'Lilacs'. Mr. Fabreau painted this only yesterday, and measuring in at five square inches, we'll start the bidding at $700,000."" The painting is the most exquisite thing I've ever seen. So small and delicate, yet it manages to fit an ornate vase of lilac, painted to the smallest detail. I come out of my trance after someone bids a million.

""Three million!"" I shout before I can stop myself.

""Four million!"" I look over, and the source of my opponent is a middle aged lady who looks like she could buy my entire street without a second thought. I thank the heavens that I'm armed with Dominic's limitless card.

""Eleven million!"" I shout. The woman frowns.

""Thirty million dollars."" Gasps spread through the room. I'm not sure what her end game is, as from her expression I can see she doesn't believe the painting is worth that much. It's on, lady.

""One hundred million dollars."" People start to shout, and the woman gives me a look that would melt butter. The gable slams on the podium.

""Sold,"" shouts the auctioneer, ""for one hundred million dollars. Ladies and gentlemen that amount alone is more than we've made this entire auction. Thank you for coming."" Everybody spreads out, and I can feel their eyes on me as they whisper. Who is this girl? How is she so rich? They'll never know. I make my way out to the back of the ballroom to pay for my item, and when I look up at the ceiling I see a moving camera, and it's following me.

At midnight, I get back into the limo, expecting the driver to take me home. Instead, he drives through a large, ornate gate and up the most exquisite driveway I've ever seen. I know even before I see the magnificent modern mansion that this is the home of Dominic Fabreau. I step out of the car, and before I can reach the large wooden door, it opens. Standing behind it is Dominic himself. ""Delilah. Please, come in.""

The inside of Dominic's house is a classy mixture of antique and modern. Everything is pristine perfect, with little to no sign of anybody living there. The foyer was an art display, with countless beautiful works display for viewing. I wonder to myself how many of them were painted by Dominic himself. After seeing the beautiful works he's capable of I find myself wondering what other secrets this man holds. He takes me by the hand and leads me down the corridor, in which I see more and more expensive items. We take a left into a beautiful cosy room with fluffy royal blue carpet, a large fireplace and three beautiful couches surrounding a coffee table that looks like it costs more than my yearly rent. ""You bid a lot of money on that painting, Delilah."" I shiver when he says my name. We sit, and I quietly clear my throat.

""I, uh, really enjoyed the artwork, and I'm not sure, something just came over me. I'm sorry..."" I trail off, expecting for him to take away the AmEx card and fire me on the spot, but instead I'm met with that smile. Dominic laughs lightly, putting his hand on my knee.

""No, don't fret. I'm not mad, I'm impressed. Typically my representatives are too afraid of me to spend my money, but you went above and beyond my expectations. Good girl."" I hold in a gasp. Those words, those two little words send shudders down my spine, reminding me of the dream I had the previous night. I swallow a lump in my throat and manage a small smile. ""I'll pour you a drink, Delilah,"" he says, getting up and striding over to the bar in the corner. He wasn't asking me, but commanding. Always commanding. Here was a man who was not unfamiliar to authority and how to use it. He pours me a complicated looking cocktail, and himself a glass of whiskey. He sits back down and stares at me as I sip. I'm reminded of the night at the club, and I think to the three hundred dollar bills in my purse. I'd not spent it at the club, and wasn't sure what to do with it. While I'm uncomfortable with taking money from people, a mere few hundred dollars can't mean much to a man who makes billions of dollars every year. Dominic Fabreau would be the richest man in the world if it weren't for his numerous charity projects and excessive donations, and as it stands he sits at 6th in the world.

""Dominic...I was wondering. Why did you promote me?"" I am the least deserving in my office of a promotion purely because of my hatred for the job.

""I see potential in you, Delilah. You're a hard worker and even I can see your distaste for your work."" I blush. ""I want you to take Opulence and make it into something great. The only thing keeping it from true success is the shallow, salon-gossip undertones and I believe in your ability to fix it."" I nod my head, not knowing what to say. We sit in silence for a while more. ""Delilah, I'd like to take you for lunch tomorrow. That restaurant on the pier. We can discuss your new role in the company and whether or not you feel you can...listen to instructions. I plan to work very closely with your company, and if you do well there could be another promotion in your future."" As far as I'm concerned, Opulence is a stepping stone to greater things, and either I'm really stepping on that stone, or Dominic has ulterior motives.

""Yes, I'd love to.""

""Excellent. I'll be there at noon. Do not make me wait."" With that, he whisks me back out to the waiting limousine, and I'm driven home, drink still in my hand, wondering why Dominic has chosen me to be his personal project.

Lieu de Prospér is a high end restaurant on the pier run by a French man and his British wife. It is the restaurant equivalent of Insub and every dish has frivolous amounts of either gold leaf or black truffles. It is neither a place I could realistically afford - aside from a few months of saving - nor one I desire to dine at, and yet I found myself excited to spend the day with Dominic. He has some kind of psychological control over me, and I somehow associate him with an intense feeling of butterflies and joy, sort of like a rush of heroin, or the closest thing I'd ever tried. We walk in with the aura of a business power couple. Not in the celebrity, romantic way magazines make it out to be but the kind of power couple who have nothing together but business. It was nice. Dominic had given me another dress before he'd come to pick me up, a classy lace number, navy blue like his foyer. He sent it over before him, like last time. It's a nice feeling, rich people stealing glances at me.

We sit at a beautifully decorated table with a small candle set burning in the middle. It's classy, and somewhat romantic, dare I say it. A waitress comes around with gold-plated menus, but Dominic waves her away. ""We will both be having the lobster, with a salad to start. Bring me your best Chardonnay to pair."" I wriggle in my seat a little as shivers race up my spine. Dominic's subtle control over me makes my panties wet and my body shake. I lick my lips a little as Dominic stares me down. After a long pause, he speaks. ""You look lovely today. I know lobster is quite the heavy lunch, but I must confess I have neglected to tell you about some...commitments I have for you later today. As the new face of Opulence I need you out and about at many prestigious events, especially with the rebrand coming up. At around 3pm you are to attend a press conference about the direction in which you wish to be taking Opulence, and how it will affect business, preferably positively, as I'm not one to advertise the failing of my child companies. This will take place at the office, and afterwards you and I will be having dinner. No business, just...pleasure."" More chills. All I can do it nod. The waitress from before sets a salad down and I can barely force myself to pick at it. Me? Attending prestigious events as the face of Opulence? It all seems so ridiculous. I'm a businesswoman at best, a shitty columnist at worst. I've never once pictured myself mingling with the aristocracy of the country, or even the world, as many international figures frequent Dominic's ventures. I sip my water in anticipation of the wine I'm going to need.

""Dominic,"" I begin. Those eyes flit up to meet mine, and I find all the confidence in my body sucked out into them. I clear my throat and start again. ""Dominic. I was wondering why I seem to have...become your representative. Surely there are more qualified...more experienced people working for some of your other companies who are better choices than myself."" I'm rambling, and I'm aware, but his stare makes me feel like I'm completely naked.

""Delilah. Your magazine is a huge hit as both a business and an extension of culture, and I've found it is as opulent as its name suggests. I acquired your magazine because I wanted something as tasteful and elegant as the things I wish to surround myself with. Of course, Opulence is trash. You know it, I know it, but the public does not. They see it as an insight into how people like myself live, and as such it becomes an appropriate representation of my lifestyle. I do not have the time to attend every event I'm invited to, so I elected to choose a representative to attend these events for me and make sure my brand is properly maintained. I chose you because you are a beautiful and savvy young woman who clearly knows how to follow orders. While I admire your inquisitive nature, you are not to question me again, or you will be punished as I see fit."" I swallow the lump in my throat and muster up a weak smile.

""Of course, Dominic. I apologise."" I stare down into my salad, trying my best to hide how aroused I am.

Despite being a member of the press, technically, I'd never attended a press conference. I had no idea what to wear to one, nor did I know what I'd be doing. The first thing I did when I got home was open a new tab in my browser and look up stock photos of press conferences. Eventually I decided on a thrilling and unique combination of a slate grey pencil skirt and white silk blouse. It was an outfit I'd bought after I'd finished university in order to impress at job interviews. As I'd obtained my job at Opulence almost straight after graduation, I'd only pulled it off the hanger once. Luckily, I also had the pantyhose to go with it. I look in the mirror and find myself quite alluring. I'd managed to pull off the perfect sexy librarian look. Hopefully it was appropriate for a press conference. I slide myself into my plainest pair of black heels and then slide myself into my car. A quick search of the address Dominic had texted to me burdened me with a 25 minute drive. A looming mid-1800s building leered down at me, daring me to speak to the press about Fabreau Publishing's takeover. Inside, at the far end of a huge hall was a sturdy table with a red floor length cloth over the top. The press was yet to arrive, but Dominic's middle-aged assistant waited for me just inside the door. ""You're late,"" she barks at me. I smile back bashfully and tap down to the awaiting chair behind the table. The woman places a page in front of me. ""This page contains the relevant information to Fabreau Publishing's takeover of Opulence. Mr. Fabreau expects you to use it, as well as to fabricate your own answers and opinions to the more subjective questions. I will be joining you, although I am here as a representative of Fabreau Publishing, not of Opulence itself."" i nod my head.

""What do I do if someone asks me a question regarding something not on the paper?"" The woman glares at me through her half-moon glasses.

""That won't happen."" She takes a seat as press start to meander in through the door and take their seats. I feel my palms start to moisten as they gather. Soon, the cameras start to flash, and the questions begin.

""What was the net financial gain of Opulence last financial year?""

""Does Fabreau Publishing plan to acquire more publications such as this one?""

""How does the magazine plan to proceed now that it has new ownership?""

""Ms. Salace, before the takeover you were merely a columnist. Did you get such a substantial promotion because you're sleeping with Mr. Fabreau?""

I stop in my tracks. So far I'd answered every question directed at me flawlessly, but this is exactly what Dominic had banked on not happening. I swallow the ever-growing lump in my throat and smile through the pain. ""I-""

""Mr. Fabreau has been a businessman his entire life, and has not once done something as morally reprehensible as giving a woman a job in exchange for her body. Ms. Salace was awarded the promotion as she projects the image Fabreau Corp. looks for, as well as demonstrating outstanding skills in the areas of negotiation and public relations. There will be no further questions on the matter of Ms. Salace's employment."" Dominic's assistant, whose name I learnt is Mona Walter interrupts, displaying more authority and finality than I'd ever seen in someone other than Dominic himself. I find myself wondering who had learnt it from whom. Mona allows the questions to continue, although there is a noticeable tension in the air from that point onwards. As a whole, I am unsure as to why Dominic chose me. Mona's answer was entirely bullshit, since I have absolutely no experience in 'negotiation and public relations'. Shit, I barely have experience in journalism. I'm distant for the rest of the conference, dwelling on that one, stupid question.

That same evening, I attempt to finish my advice column. It's the one piece I'd managed to keep despite my fancy new promotion. For everything I hated about my old job, Self-Help Corner was my favourite part, and the only thing about my meaningless career I found entertaining. I had a separate work email specifically for these submissions, and aside from the usual spam about how much these people wanted to impregnate me, and the genuine submissions, there was one email that stood out to me. It was titled Insub, like the club. I opened it warily, as I've almost fallen for many a virus ploy before. The body of the email was non-existent except for a jpeg attachment. I ran it through a malware scanner before opening it up.

YOU'RE INVITED

Insub is holding an exclusive downstairs event on Saturday night.

As a valued patron of our establishment, you are invited to attend.

Requirements include a masquerade mask to obscure identity,

and a $5 bill with your access code written on it

In fine print below the body of the invitation there was a nine digit number. I close the attachment and take a deep breath. Dominic Fabreau buying my place of work had turned my mundane life into something out of a Lifetime movie.

__________

Drinking had never been my thing, but here I was. 18 years old at my first ever party. Sammy had decked out her parents house with more fairy lights than I ever thought possible for one family to own, and it provided perfect mood lighting. The well-placed sound system blasted some shitty EDM and the entire living room was filled with people grinding on each other and slowly losing clothes and integrity. I sipped my stereotypical red solo cup of vodka lemonade as Kathy pranced around me, already off her face, shrieking about how sexy Kyle who plays trombone is, and how she's totally going to fuck him tonight. I ignored her, preferring to spend my time spying on people. Although, can you really call it spying when they're yelling everything they say, and rubbing up against one another in such a public place?

Hours pass, and I held the same cup, yet to be empty. the lemonade had long gone flat, as had the party, but the stragglers remained. As I walk through the house - a mansion, really - I stepped over not one, but two couples blatantly fucking on the floor. Disgusting. This is not a scene I regret not being a part of. I searched for Sammy, not having seen her since the start of the night when she welcomed everybody inside. Her parents were super rich, and were constantly pissing off to foreign countries for both business and pleasure, not even batting an eye at the parties Sammy managed to hold at least three times a month. I crossed the kitchen and stepped out onto the patio. Everything was still perfectly manicured, despite the beating it had taken as 300 of Sammy's closest friends fucked their way through her 9 bedroom home. I took a seat at the ornate wrought iron bench tastefully placed between some shrubs that had undoubtedly been pissed on by various boys as the night progressed and stared out into the sunrise. I wasn't sure how long it has been before I noticed him, standing in the doorway and staring at me. I turned my head. ""What are you doing?"" I asked, placing my cup next to me. He shot me a grin and wandered out over to my seat.

""I was just...taking in the view."" He eyed me up and down with a pair of incomprehensibly deep brown eyes. I rolled my own eyes and went back to taking in the scenery, ""What's a girl like you doing at a party this wild?"" He sat down next to me, separating us only by the solo cup I had abandoned.

""It's my friends house. I wanted to go to at least one high school shindig before I'm thrust into the world of tertiary education."" The boy...man laughed. A short, attractive sound. I took in his figure. He was clearly an athlete, with chiseled arms, a chiseled jaw, chiseled abs...chiseled everything. I shook myself out of my trance, accepting that this Adonis was the peak of male beauty.

""Well, I happen to know that parties like this always end up with the hottest girls getting laid, so who did you get it on with?"" I snort unattractively.

""Please. I've never hooked up with anyone in my life."" I picked up the solo cup and took a swig of the sickly-sweet syrup. He looked me up and down before grinning a grin that dissolved my panties.

""I guess we'd better fix that then."" He grabbed my hand, and led me through the house, up the stairs and into a vacant bedroom. I was paralysed by his beauty, unable to say no to such a magnificent creature. He closed the door and turned to me, brushing his hands on my waist. He leaned in, kissing me gently at first, and then with all the force of a hurricane of lust. I didn't remember how he got my clothes off, but I certainly remembered the way he picked me up as if I weighed nothing and practically threw me onto the bed. He kissed my neck, my collarbone, my shoulder, and then back up to my lips. His shirtless form felt so natural under my hands, and as he unbuttoned his jeans I could see his bulge outlined by his Calvin Klein boxers. They soon followed his jeans, and again, there he was. Each kiss on my skin sent tingles up and down my spine, culminating in my core. The first entrance was the hardest, but after that it was like he belonged inside of me. He pulled out to bring my ankles up to his shoulders, and in that moment I felt too empty, but as fast as he left he returned, and he was back, pumping his hips as he ran his thumbs across my nipples. I was unable to hold in my moans of pleasure as he hit all the right spots. I managed to force out a breathy 'harder', and he obliged all too willingly before withdrawing in an instant. ""Get on your hands and knees,"" he commanded. I obliged all too willingly, hungry for him to connect with me once more. The sound of our skin slapping together was the only sound in the room aside from my sighs and moans. He was a man who knew what he was doing, and he didn't stop until I could barely hold myself up. He leaned over, lips brushing against my ear. ""Are you ready?"" Somehow I knew exactly what he was talking about, and I nodded.

""Y-yes."" He thrusted harder and faster than I thought possible before coming to a halt. with a sigh, he exited me and immediately started pulling on his clothes.

""There you go, now all the hot girls got some."" I tried my hardest to catch my breath as he pulled on his shirt.

""W-what's your name?"" I asked. He hesitated before shooting me that grin.

""Call me Lucas...""

""You need to get it done by four, Eli."" I order Eli, in charge of the rumour section of Opulence to actually get something done on time for once. Eli had been hired at the same time I was, and was probably the saltiest man I'd ever met. He was a whole 20 months older than I, and seemed to think that gave him the right to boss me around. He had been the most unhappy with my sudden promotion, sending me spiteful glances ever since the announcement was made. He had been gunning for any kind of promotion ever since we finished our trial period. He was ruthless, and if he weren't so stupid I had no doubt he'd have gotten the promotion he was after. Alas, he was a few crayons short of a box, and I came out on top. One of the highlights of my new position is most certainly getting to order around everyone in the office who had ever so much as looked at me funny. Sure, call me petty. I do.

I sit in my office, pretending to do work, as I often do, when there's a knock at my door. ""Come in."" Kathy enters, and as soon as the (soundproof, for some reason) door shuts, she squeals and trots over to me in her extraordinarily high heels.

""Are you excited for tomorrow?"" Unfortunately I know exactly to what she's referring to. My first Insub basement party.

""I'm not sure. I don't even know what goes on down there, it could just be a strip club but it could also be some kind of...sex dungeon."" I shudder at the thought. Sure, I've had my fair share of men, but none of them in a crowded room surrounded by people in masks. Kathy plops a bag in front of me that I didn't notice her carrying.

""This is your mask. I picked it up at lunch, credit card's in the bag."" I give her a hug before opening up the bag, peeling back a few too many layers of tissue paper. Inside is a beautiful lace eye mask. Being made exclusively of fabric, it will comfortably contour to my face and minimise weird patterns imprinted onto my skin.

""Holy shit, Kathy. This is amazing! Thank you so much. I'm sorry I made you go, but you know how useless I am at shopping."" She nods dramatically.

""You don't have to tell me hun, I remember the school disco..."" Oh god, let's not relive the school disco. I place the mask back into the bag and shove the bag into one of my desk drawers.

""I have a meeting with Dominic's assistant in like, ten minutes. You'd better fuck off before she bites your head off and sucks out your entrails."" Kathy laughs.

""Fuck you. Have fun."" I slunk back into my chair and sigh, scrolling through whatever bland celebrity's social media I had open for 'research' before the door swung open once more. I rolled my eyes, expecting Mona's tight ass, complete with large stick, but instead when I looked up my eyes met Dominic's.

""You will not roll your eyes at me, Delilah. I expect you to show me the respect I deserve."" I nod my head and sit up straight, biting my lip. ""Now. I am here in place of Mona for three reasons. The first is because I do not trust Mona with the contents of today's meeting. The second is because I felt like paying you a visit, and the third is to see the mask you've picked out for tomorrow night's event."" My heart leaps up into my throat. How does he know? I pull out the mask and show him without saying a word. ""Good girl. This will do perfectly. I'll send an outfit to your house tomorrow afternoon. Now, if it isn't already obvious, I will be accompanying you to the event at Insub tomorrow night. He moves over to one of the sets of shutters facing out into the office that I leave a fraction open for spying, and closes it fully. He turns back to me. ""Stand up."" I oblige. ""Come here,"" he says, pointing to the carpet in front of him.

""Yes,"" I say, obediently standing where I'm instructed.

""Now, I want you to turn around and bend over onto the desk."" I feel my face turn bright red.

""Uh, why?"" Dominic stares me down.

""I made it clear how I feel about you questioning me."" I swallow that familiar lump and bend over the desk. Dominic lifts up the bottom of my dress and inspects the wet patch of my lace panties. ""Good girl. I knew I'd chosen correctly."" He pulls the panties up in between my round cheeks and sharply slaps my left cheek. I can't contain the squeal that escapes my lips. ""Good girl."" He lets my dress go and turns around, leaving my office as quickly as he came, and leaving me bent over my desk, panting. I stand up and arrange myself. In most situations, that would be considered sexual harassment, but right now the last thing I feel is harassed. I think it must be pretty obvious at this point that I am of the opinion that Dominic Fabreau is a mighty fine piece of ass, and I would be pretty damn thrilled if he decided to make me his concubine for a short period, and this recent exhibition is pretty indicative of reciprocated feelings. Or, I hope it is. I take my seat at my desk and swallow that ever-present lump in my throat before returning to my analysis of the popularity of Opulence this quarter, or as I like to call it; staring blankly at an Excel document and drinking hot chocolate.

I just picked up an internship for the summer with Americorps, working for the Forest Service doing trail maintenance/management out in Lake Tahoe. Kicker is, the schedule is 8 days on, 6 days off, with most of the 8 on spent camping out of a work truck, and no housing provided. Now, rather than spending beaucoup dinero on a short term rental or a shitload of hotel nights for the 6 off, I'd like to take advantage of the rather unique opportunity for this Alabama boy to get out west and do some exploring in my truck. But, I need some help building a decent living space into the bed of my F150.

[Here's my baby as she sits](https://i.imgur.com/zKcUt6u.jpg). It's a 2012 F150 XLT 4x4 Offroad, Supercrew 67"" bed with the 5.0L V8. So far, it's got:

FX4 tuned suspension

2.5"" Rough Country Level

LT275/70/R18(33x11R18) Falken Wildpeak AT3W

Fab Fours Premium rear bumper

Ranch Hand Legend brush guard

GoRhino RB10 ""Raptor Style"" running boards

Traveler 20"" dual row LED bar

Spyder Auto Dual Halo Projector headlights 

Airaid PowerAid throttle body spacer

What I'd like to do is get a topper and build some form of mattress platform into the bed, along with some simple storage options for water and food/cooking supplies, without obliterating my college kid bank account. What brand/model topper would y'all recommend? I have a LEER and ARE dealer near me. What's the best/cheapest way to mount some water storage into the bed without drilling holes into my bedsides? What can I do to get a little power back there for my laptop? Any tips on building some kind of sleeping platform back there?

And, most importantly, anywhere y'all recommend I check out in the Lake Tahoe vicinity while I'm out there?"
8aonre,9,2018-04-08,My gaming journey,Stitchthealchemist,rpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/8aonre/my_gaming_journey/,"To open today, on the subject of the title. Before you read, please note that this post is about my life as a full-time paid GM, how I got here, and generally what my last few months have been like. This is not an advertisement or a how to, but rather a piece on what my life is like and how I feel having pursued this as a career path. If the subject of paid GMing is a hot button issue for you, close out now. If ramblings about my fairly boring life doesn't interest you, close out now. Thank you. 

I started gaming eight years ago. I had started a group back in high school after having seen King of the Nerds on TBS of all things. Embarrassing, but there it is. I tried Googling the rules for Dungeons and Dragons, but all I could find at the time was ""roll dice, things happen"". I think I only owned a few d20s, and those were MTG life counters. My first experiment with gaming was a homebrew [Skyrim game](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/2q63x7/how_to_ruin_a_campaign/), with nonsensical and inconsistent rules, and marked the first time I found myself failing as a Game Master: I had let one of the players at my table make someone else uncomfortable with sexual violence. That group came and went, we dissolved and got back together a few times before one of my players realized that [Pathfinder](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/3tr3ba/artifacts_gestapo_and_skeletons_oh_my/) was available for free on Paizo's website. And from there, my passion for gaming grew. I started on Pathfinder, and to this day it remains my favorite game despite having tried out dozens of other systems, d20 and beyond. 

I gamed on and off for a few years, mostly because work got in the way. I'm a college dropout, so I worked at a lot of retail and fast food places for three years or so. Due to my inconsistent schedules I got involved with World of Darkness larps and skype roleplaying groups. I played a lot of Vampire the Masquerade (Gangrel for life!) and fell absolutely head over heels in love with Changeling: The Dreaming. I was introduced to AD&amp;D first edition and died in character creation... twice. I began moving away from published modules and towards elaborate homebrewed settings. 

Eventually I found myself working at a Dunkin Donuts that was a few doors down from a now-closed Local Game Store. I played a lot of Magic: The Gathering and spent close to all of my free time there. I'm ashamed to admit that my poor financial decisions at the time revolved around pieces of cardboard. Anyway, I spent so much time at this game store that I became somewhat of an informal intern. I befriended the staff and the customers, and I ran my first few games for people outside of my friend group, a terrifying experience to be certain. I ran the [game of a lifetime](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/576n0x/the_heist_finale_or_how_my_players_planned_this/) with my new group and had a blast every step of the way. I built up somewhat of a legend in that area of Illinois, and when I moved away to Las Vegas someone from back home offered me money to run a game in my free time, and that's all about how I got started. 

I was still working fast food, but stories of my games started to be [told by my players](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/7ahcgf/how_my_group_got_a_powerful_sidhe_to_go_trick_or/). I was getting better at running it. I was getting confident. I was working full time and still running around five games a week, two of which were paid. It felt good. Finally, I got my third paid game and with that I could afford to quit my day job. 

So I set out on the journey. Broke as hell for awhile, until I picked up a few more paid games. I was convinced by friends to do an [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/7mggaf/i_run_8_to_9_games_per_week_every_week_ama/). I picked up even more games, I'm running 13 every other week (11 every week). And as much as I'm going to sound braggy or too full of myself, but I'm very very proud of this one, I was invited after some email correspondence I was invited to talk about what I do on [Nerdarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBiWKB4UFiw&amp;feature=youtu.be). 

And now? Now I work overtime. I run games for about 48 hours every week, and I work on them for an additional 30. To be honest I really don't pay myself enough, but I'm not in this for the money. It's a massive workload, almost all of my freetime is spent on gaming. Since I don't have a hobby anymore (my hobby is my job) I picked up my own YouTube channel as my way to goof around and have a good time, just talking to myself about the games I love. I'm overworked and I'm a little stressed, but it's worth it. I'm having a great time just getting to do what I love most for a living. 

Over the last few months I've gotten to meet people in the hobby that I admire as a fan, people who I've watched for years. I've gotten to try games I never would have even considered before, and I've gotten to meet wonderful new friends through my games. My views on the game have changed drastically, from allowing non-serious characters to my idea of what makes a game good. I've had my first ever TPK (in a paid game, no less) and I've cried and laughed and been bored and caused boredom. 

I don't even know why I'm typing this out. It's one in the morning, I just got back from a concert, I'm a little drunk, and I just felt like it I suppose. 

Sorry if this comes across as a humblebrag or something, feel free to ignore/downvote/whatever. I just wanted to share, and now I just want to hear from the rest of you guys. What's your gaming journey? What did you start with, how did you get involved, how does your beginnings in the hobby compare to where you are now? Thank you. "

It was super cheap (&lt; $1k) and let me lease for only 2 or 3 months, was next to grocery stores and stuff like Rite Aid, etc, and was within walking distance to the subway system so my commute would be like an hour. But it turns out that all of these apartments are right next to Main Street of Norristown, which is apparently a very questionable area?

I was wondering if walking to and from the subway station for like a mile a day would be sketch. I'm a suburb boy(xd) and I would like to avoid trouble. I probably won't be going out much beyond going to work and grocery shopping on the weekends. 

Is Norristown actually that bad? Should I just find a different place and eat the extra costs and commute? Or is it overblown and I'm being paranoid over nothing."

Anyways, what I'm wondering is, are managers still hiring for summer roles or have I missed the opportunity?

I feel like I'm a strong candidate. I'm in my last semester of a masters degree at The Graduate Institute in Geneva and I have internship experience at the OECD and with NGOs in South America.

8aplt9,4,2018-04-08,"When would you say a Ubuntu release is ""stable enough""?",Commodore256,Ubuntu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/8aplt9/when_would_you_say_a_ubuntu_release_is_stable/,"I say if you're used to rolling releases and don't use a GUI and just use SSH and Ncurses, using Alpha 1 is ok because there's less things in the stack that could go wrong. Though I'd recommend a production server should use at lease close to final release or old LTS with backports.

If you want a production machine and you don't bother with the intern releases because you consider those to be beta, but you install LTS on release day because you don't mind a few growing pains, you might as well use at the feature freeze or the UI freeze.

If you're one of those people that want a rock solid system, use the LTS after it's at least 6 months after release because that's when I feel the ""true beta"" ends.


I've been using Bionic (Mate Edition) since a couple days after the UI freeze and it's pretty good so far. I figure if I'm going to be a ""beta tester"", I might as well test during the advertised beta instead of the ""final release"".


The thing about software is it's only really ""finished"" when it's end of life like in the case of Windows XP. Though there's still new Wifi Drivers for it and POSReady 2009 has another year and a day, the point is Software is never final until it's dead.


But I would say there's a ""good enough"" point."

Possible roles for this include:

- You're at your best friend's birthday party, but you'd much rather make a conquest of his slightly younger brother, right under the poor sap's nose, maybe even on his bed.
- Same as above, but I'm your best friend's boyfriend. He's a nice guy, but you've seen my ass and you know it's begging to be used by anyone but a nice guy.
- I'm a rich kid and you're a builder/repairman/plumber etc. I talk down on you, but you're more than confident in your masculinity and know just the way to shut me up.
-We're on the same course, and I've been assigned by the lecturer to help you study since your grades haven't been too good. Even if I'm not trying to act like I'm smarter than you on purpose, you're too horny to study.
- I'm a prince and you're my bodyguard, and you're getting tired of watching from behind as I get my way. You've seen the way I've glanced at soldiers, and you're going to show me how much more virile a ""commoner"" can be.

8aq3b6,662,2018-04-08,PSA: Keto and weight loss won't magically fix you.,themapoe,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/8aq3b6/psa_keto_and_weight_loss_wont_magically_fix_you/,"This is a very important detail that I feel like gets glossed over *a lot* in this community. We focus on our successes and general positives, which is great. However, if you're new here or someone only looking in, it's really easy to see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeGQXqqvvAY), but with weight loss instead of a relationship (btw Crazy Ex Girlfriend is an incredible work of art). In other words, this community unintentionally feeds into the idea of ""All my problems are because I'm fat and losing weight will fix me.""

#THIS IS NOT TRUE

Story time:

I gained a ton of weight when I started working/driving/going to college. By no means was I skinny before, but I went from ""I'm a little chunky"" to ""I don't want to go to Ikea with y'all because I'm worried about all the walking."" During this time, it was very easy to use my weight as a blanket excuse for all my problems. I have no money? It's because I'm fat. I can't get laid? It's because I'm fat. I can't get an internship? It's because I'm fat. And don't you dare lie to me and say you don't/didn't do this because I know for a fact that every one does to some extent. Anyway, I started keto and some little part of my brain was holding on to the idea that I would be ""fixed"" when I got back to my start weight. Intellectually, I knew this wasn't true, but deep down I didn't *really* believe it.  

Then I lost the weight I had gained and, this is really going to shock you, I still had no money, I still couldn't get laid, and I still didn't have an internship. Losing weight only helped the problems *actually* caused by my weight; not the problems I attributed to being fat because it was easier than actually addressing them. I have a slew of mental health problems and often like to think of my mental state as an airplane. During this realization, this airplane caught on fire, crashed into the ocean, and all the people on board were eaten by sharks. Seriously my mental health went to a place of bad I didn't realize I was capable of achieving. I went through this 3 month period of awful because I *should* have been ""fixed"" but I wasn't. The only thing that allowed me to start crawling out of my void was firmly coming to terms with the fact that there is no such thing as being ""fixed"" and self improvement now is just as difficult as it was when I was bigger. 

This was really, really hard because *everything* is pointing towards this false idea of if you're fat, you're miserable and if you lose the weight, everything is going to fall into place and be perfect. Every single weight loss story follows this path and it is absolutely not true. You'll have good days and be happy with the weight and you'll have days where you're fucking miserable without it. It is **so** important that you fully embrace this *before* you start your journey. Down vote me all you want, but this community makes it very difficult to do that. ""Keto cured my mental illness!"" No, *you* worked on managing it better. ""Keto improved my relationships!"" No *you* worked on your relationships. ""Keto made me a better person!"" No *you* worked on your self improvement. Keto didn't do any thing; *you* did and it took a lot of work and it was hard and sucked at times. Keto is easy, yes, but everything else is hard and keto or losing weight will not change that. 

Because this post isn't long enough, let's say you bring your car in for service. They change your oil, they give you a new timing belt, they suggest you start using higher octane fuel and you do... Your car runs great; the best it's ever run. The car runs just as smoothly as the day you drove it off the lot. However this service didn't fix the radio, and it didn't fix the stain on the seat, and it didn't fix the scratches from when you love tapped that car in the parking lot, panicked, and left. Keto is no different. Keto will help your car run better, but it won't fix all the problems on the inside. *You* are the only person who can do that. Stop giving keto credit for *your* hard work. 

tl;dr: 

Keto does not take the work out of self improvement and if you're miserable when your fat, you're going to be miserable when you're skinny too. 

edit:

You guys... Thank you kind stranger for the gold!"
8aqgjg,2,2018-04-08,A letter to the old Josh,throwaway395767590,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8aqgjg/a_letter_to_the_old_josh/,"I need to get this off my chest. I’ve changed or blanked out the names of people and places for obvious reasons. I also slightly changed some numbers that could be used to identify me. 

&amp;nbsp;

Short backstory. Josh is a lifelong childhood hero of mine. When I was down in the dumps and needed someone to talk to, Josh was there to listen and made me feel better. When my house was broken into and my computer was stolen, Josh bought me a new computer. Josh took me to see a car show in Detroit because he knew I was poor and he wanted me to experience the good things in life. When I needed advice in life, Josh gave me honest, realistic, and non-judgmental answers. I want repay him later in life; when I’m more financially sound. I wanted to thank him for showing me that good people exist. Josh grew up poor, but he didn’t end up like his parents. Josh was successful in life; he made $75,000 a year, had a house of his own, and did what he loved. I didn’t want to end up like my parents; I wanted to be like Josh.

&amp;nbsp;

Just shortly before I went to a state university, I found out that Josh was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor; he went to prison a year later. I no longer see him a hero. Josh won’t be out any time soon; he was sentence to 18 years. I used to write letters to him. Each time I wrote to him, I wrote in a very judgmental tone. I think he picked up on that and, after the third or fourth letter, he never wrote my back. I’d assumed he was tired of my shit and so I didn’t write back neither.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to write a letter to Josh, but I can’t: the Josh I knew died a few years ago. I miss the old Josh. So, the letter below is to the old Josh:  the Josh before I found out.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Josh,   
I feel sick. I wish you were here Josh. I wish I had someone I can trust to talk to; a lifelong friend to talk to.

&amp;nbsp;

I graduated from ***** State University with a bachelor in mechanical engineering and a 3.88 GPA back in December 2015. I couldn’t get any internship; I didn’t try very much. I didn’t have a car until my last semester, so I wasn’t sure how I was going to go to work. I was pretty burned out during my last semester. That and… back then, I basically have nothing worth a fuck on my resume. What? They’re gonna hire some idiot who’s only job was a pizza cook for two years as an intern engineer? I wish you were there to give me some real, honest, brutal advice. I didn’t know any better; I thought having a really stellar GPA was on par with having a mediocre GPA and an internship.

&amp;nbsp;

I got a job seven months after graduating. It was a temporary “project engineer.” The pay was laughable: $16/hr. Oh well, I told myself, “its experience. It’ll lead to bigger and better things. And, it’s not like you have much experienced.” I only got the job because Ann girlfriend’s dad happens to know someone. I can’t thank Ann enough for that; I was running out of money.

&amp;nbsp;

The job only lasted for eight months; the company got bought out. I didn’t like the job anyways; there wasn’t enough math, programming, and engineering. In fact, there was very little of it. I did a bunch of random shit when I was there.

* Replicated a machine component in Solidworks (a 3D CAD software). Modify the component to work with another product. Sent the drawings out to be made. 
* Calculated the through put of several production lines. My boss wanted to find out what was the bottleneck.
* Relocated a production line. I didn’t do the execution, just the planning.
* Conducted a warehouse feasibility study. Basically, I just used AutoCAD to make a bunch of layouts.

So yeah, I did really random shit that questionably connected to engineering.  They’re not as impressive as I’m making them sound, Josh. Trust me on this one.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, I went back to the job searching grind and after five month-ish of fucking nothing, I decided to take a hiatus. I saw and remember that some employers wanted candidates that have an EIT (Engineering-In-Training) license. It took me five month-ish to get caught up to a point where I felt ready to take the FE (fundamental of engineering) exam; I’ve been out of school for nearly two years so I didn’t remember everything crystal clear.

&amp;nbsp;

With all the prep material and the exam itself, I probably spent $500 bucks getting my EIT. And, what did I get in return for that? Nothing substantial. I was getting more calls, but they were mostly some fucking Indian-accent guy trying to scam me. Much like before.

&amp;nbsp;

During my job search, my mom “forgot” to pay her bills for the new car she bought.  Fucking dumb bitch places the blame on me. 

* Okay, first of all, I didn’t even see her car bill; so, I couldn’t even warn her even if I wanted to.
* Second, she’s been the united states for some 20 fucking years and she hasn’t even learn basic English? Even then, she hasn’t learned to identify a car bill?
* Third, the car dealer shows up to the house to warn her that her car will be repossess. She shoos him away because she doesn’t speak English and thinks he’s a marketer. I was in my room a few feet away; why didn’t she get me, she’s done it before? In fact, I stepped out of my room a second after the car dealer was gone and asked her who was that. She told me it was nothing.
* Fourth, she told me explicitly not to worry about any bills other than the water bills because my dad will sort things out when he gets back from his overseas visit. She had the water bill in her hand; she just wanted to know if she has enough money in the bank to pay it.

Now the family is scramble to pay the car loan in full. And, I’m feeling pressured and blamed for the car being repossessed. I ended up loaning her $5000 because she and nobody else in the family couldn’t get another loan. Ann loaned her $3500. Lin… Lin was smart; fucking loaned her a cool $0. That and… Lin was probably broke from gambling; he lost $7000 on an online bet that Hillary would win the 2016 presidential election. Seriously, you can’t make this shit up. 

&amp;nbsp;

So my savings, been basically cut in half. I fucking doubt I’ll ever see that money back. It took her some three years just to save enough for the car’s $3000 down payment. Four months later, I still can’t find an engineering job. So now, I’m really getting desperate because I know I won’t have enough money to pay my student loan for much longer. I pretty much have to take a job as a drafter. Fucking recruiter try convinced me that drafters often become engineers; right… right... and, truck drivers often become auto-mechanic. The drafter job pays $18/hr and is located 65 miles away from my house. That’s right Josh, I drive 130 miles (3 hours) to work and back every Monday through Friday. The interviewer tells me that hopefully “he’ll get permission to hire me as a production engineer with a focus in automation;” I’m not holding my breath for that one, Josh. But I not gonna lie to you, Josh; ever fiber in my body wants his promise to come true.

&amp;nbsp;

Oh by the way, during the four months I mentioned above, Ann moved out of the house with this girlfriend. He bought a nice middle class house and a sweet new pickup truck too. And Lin? Well, he’s working 10 hours a day and attending college at the same time. Therefore, being the genius, Einstein, 200+ IQ, 100% totally responsible guy that he is, he decides what he needs in his life is a beagle. So yeah, I pretty much have to take care of the dog that I clearly don't give a shit about.

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, Josh. Life is fantastic. Where did I go wrong Josh? I grew up poor, you know that. I saw the life my mom and dad lived; I wanted none of that shit. The people in life, and society for matter, told me that if you worked hard you’ll achieve the American dream.

&amp;nbsp;

I was lead to believe that I need to study hard for math and science because you need it to get anywhere in life. I was lead to believe that there are not enough engineers; that, employers need more engineers. I was lead to believe that, as an engineer, you get to use math, science, and technology to solve the world’s most challenging problems. I was lead to believe that, as an engineer, you’ll get paid pretty well. I was lead to believe that to become an engineer, you gotta get an engineering degree. Well, all that shits has been nothing but a fucking lie.

&amp;nbsp;

Am I asking for too much Josh? I just want to become a fucking robotic/automation/design/mechanical engineer. I just wanted to become an engineer that uses math, science, and engineering to solve tough and meaningful problems every now and then.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel like a loser Josh. I am a loser. A loser who got an engineering degree, but couldn’t get a job as one. Don’t give me that shit about that temp project engineer gig; it’s not a real engineering job, Josh. The recruiters know that. I’m a fucking worthless 28 year old piece of shit loser, Josh. A fucking worthless 28 year old piece of shit loser that still lives with his parents.  A fucking worthless 28 year old piece of shit loser that never been kissed by a girl. A fucking worthless 28 year old piece of shit loser that only had three jobs his entire life. A fucking worthless 28 year old piece of shit loser that has no friends. A fucking worthless 28 year old piece of shit loser that probably going to end up like his parents. I failed you Josh. I’ve let you down. My will to remain hopeful is fading, Josh. I wish you were here Josh.

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve chosen the wrong path in life Josh. I should have sold weed like Ann did. I should have hung out with the wrong crowd like Ann did. I should have been out partying and having fun instead of studying like Ann did. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUT MAKING FRIENDS INSTEAD OF WORRYING ABOUT MY GRADES LIKE ANN DID. Who gives a shit if most of his friends are superficial and probably only hung out with him because they use to be weed buddies. At least he has friends. Look where Ann is now; he’s a middle class guy now and he has a job that he loves and he didn’t have to go to college. 

&amp;nbsp;

You know Josh, sometimes when I drive to work on the highway going 65 mph, I wish a cross-traffic semi would swerve into my lane and just fucking end me.  Do you remember Josh? When I was younger, I told you that I sometimes would cry alone in the dark at night. And when I did, even though I felt an intense sadness, I also felt as if another more perfect me was present. Another me that's buried deep inside my subconscious. Another me that knew what to do. Another me that knew what i needed to do. Another me that told me what to do. Another me that made me feel warm and hopeful. He told me to study hard and to get good grades; and if I did this, I won’t live the life my parents did. He told me that I won’t have to wake up and work a shit job for shit pay if I just believe.

&amp;nbsp;

Now when I cry alone in the dark at night, I don’t feel that other me anymore. I only feel pain and emptiness now. No. No, that’s not true. There’s someone else there; someone who I’ve brushed off many times before. He tells me things that I don’t want to be true, but I’m starting to believe that he’s right Josh. I’m starting to think that he has a point. I think he’s the medicine that I need Josh. He tells me

* It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.
* You’re only worth what you can give
* There are two sets of rules in this world
* People are only looking out for themselves.
* The strong survives and the weak dies out.
* Good people do evil things
* Evil wins
* They’re lying to you
* They don’t give a shit about you
* Violence isn’t an answer; it’s THE answer.
* You’re worthless without me
* They’re using you
* I told you so
* I can fix you
* I can make you feel better
* Let me in

He flashed a picture in my mind: it was a picture of a couple smiling happily together. He asks me, “Have you genuinely smiled like that, one out of happiness?  Why not?” No. No, I haven’t. I’m afraid Josh. I’m afraid to answer the “why not?” Josh. I’m afraid that I’ll accept the truth.

&amp;nbsp;

I’m changing Josh. I feel pathetic. I feel jaded. I feel anxious. I feel angry. I feel hateful. I feel jealous. I feel hopeless. I feel vengeful. I feel I’ll end up like my parents. I feel the doors of opportunity closing on me. I feel scared. I feel as if there’s only one truth left josh: either I must die or they must die. I feel evil josh. I feel it flowing through me Josh. It feels good Josh.

&amp;nbsp;

I think there are only two things preventing me from entering madness Josh. The interviewer’s promise and the “other people have it worst” defense.  You know what I’m talking about right Josh? “I would kill for $18/hr. You’re just a whining spoiled shit.” Maybe they’re right Josh. But you know Josh, every time the pain and emptiness sets; I start to buy into it less and less.

&amp;nbsp;

I miss you Josh. I wish you were here Josh. I’m afraid Josh."

I also plan on going straight into a master's degree in Computational Neuroscience which will take an extra year but I really want to do it. Over the long summers of college and Uni I have worked 40+ hours a week in various catering jobs to earn money to fund travelling etc. Yet everytime I come home, I'm always made to feel like I'm just sat around not doing anything?

I came back from a 2 week trip to Equador a couple of days ago to visit a friend (which I funded myself), and my dad (58M) offered to pick me up from the airport on the way back- but he never asked me how the trip was. Instead he was just asking me about my future plans (which I'd already told him), pressuring me saying I need to start looking for a job and that my plans to do a master's degree were pointless and that I need to get some experience otherwise it's not worth anything. It's not as if I've ever disputed that, I know I should get some experience &amp; I've tried to find internships in my spare time; but truthfully I don't think I've had much spare time outside of my full education. He's never been to uni and he just puts me down about it and says I could have just gone into a job and worked my way up. I don't think he understands that I would have struggled a lot getting a job in biocomputing (what I want to do) would have been near impossible without a degree.

I come home and my stepmum (57F) starts talking about her nephew who is the year older than me and has just been offered a job with a graduate salary of £35k a year in London after his degree at Oxford Uni and that I need to start looking for a job.

I'd just try to brush it off but it's all they ever talk to me about. I just want to come home and have a nice conversation with my family, I really don't understand what I've done for them to get the impression that I'm not achieving enough or applying myself when I think I work very hard. I'm a naturally very anxious type prone to overthinking and worrying about my future, I don't need other people nagging me about it too.

Recently I've also been thinking that I've wanted to take a year out of career building after my master's (as I never took a gap year), get a working Visa in Australia to live there and support myself with a random job for a year so I can see that side of the world for a bit. I am very young for my year and will still be 20 when I graduate from my undergraduate degree so I think I've got some personal growth &amp; confidence building to do before I settle into a ""big"" job. I'm worried about mentioning it to my parents because I'm pretty certain they'll just shut me down and say I'm going to be making myself look really bad by not going straight into a relevant job.

 I don't know how to approach them about it, or whether this is a natural thing and I'm just being a ""bratty kid"" who needs to get my act together and stop being so sensitive because they're older and know best? I just wish for once that they were proud of me but it's like whatever I do isn't good enough.

    TL;DR My parents make me feel like I'm underachieving and like I'm a disappointment that can't make the right decisions, even though I think I'm trying as hard as I can.

Edit: My parents do not financially support me in any way"
8arsfi,0,2018-04-08,Multiple internships - How long to stay?,steve8524,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8arsfi/multiple_internships_how_long_to_stay/,"I'm still in school and am planning to do multiple internships. 5-6 minimum would be ideal. Not at the same time of course. I'm just trying to get as much exposure/experience as I can before I graduate in 2.5 years. I'm about to begin my first one in the payroll dept of the hospital I work in. When that's over, other places I'm considering interning are the accounting dept at: my school, a retail company I used to work for, a city/waste management job where my father used to work, and a film/tv company for starters. 

The internships would have to be part time because I work full time and have a family to take care of outside of work. For instance, my first internship (payroll) is going to be 2 mornings per week (9am-12pm) because I work 3pm-11pm.

My question is, being that I would be interning part time (and working at my job full time), how long should I stay in each internship?"

My girlfriend and I are moving up to Baltimore for her internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital and I've been able to find pretty recent and credible info on most of the areas we're considering renting in, [except for this area between Central Avenue on the west, Broadway on the east, Fayette on the north, and Pratt on the south, centered on City Springs Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Washington+Hill,+Baltimore,+MD+21231/@39.2911017,-76.5962137,17.28z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c804874ca91c65:0x5fb4a99717bcf76c!8m2!3d39.2902003!4d-76.5957778).  She'll be spending most of her days at Kennedy Krieger on Fairmount, so this area would be super convenient for her.

I've seen a lot of discussion about staying south of Fayette St with regards to the Patterson Park &amp; Butchers Hill areas, but I also found [this exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/2dj8my/looking_to_move_into_baltimore_recommended/cjq0osm/) which seems to imply that even sourth of Fayette in the Washington Hill neighborhood isn't great.  OTOH, that was three years ago and from everything I can find the whole area around JHH has been rapidly improving.

Sorry to clutter your sub with another ""How bad is \[this exact spot in\] Baltimore?"", and thanks for any info!"

Easter came up last weekend and I was preparing for AP tests last week. Pair that up with my father's birthday Friday and it's been busy.)

(But I should be good to go now. Again, I'm very sorry I left you all hanging. I know the last section was a little boring as it was idea solving and you all may have forgotten it so I'm going to continue it with all of the solutions. Let me know if you've started any arcs that prevents this from continuing for your character.)

*Aneas cleared his throat and the room fell silent.*

It's become a little obvious to me that there is some mastermind in the forest. And as a result we will need to defeat it or try to bargain with it. I will set up an absolute zero chamber here so that if the mastermind chases us, we will have something very cold to apprehend him in case none of our weapons work.

Gio, will you please put together some nitrogen flamethrowers? They may be helpful against any live vines. Also you should arm some interns with glaives.

Roland, get your dry ice air strike ready. We'll use it before we get started. Gio will give you a nitrogen flamethrower unless you have something else. Take care of the eyes of the mastermind first. Those blue flowers.

Copernicus, Machina has finished a weedkiller but we don't have too much. As a result, we'll be using it when necessary, mainly against fields of deadly flowers we'll come across. It's safe for humans like you but not my species or the deadly plants. Can you take charge of that? I understand if you can't do it and if you'd prefer to stay behind.

Fitch, you suggested flooding them. I know we just met and that you just got here but Machina put together a hydrogen slash oxygen shooter. It'll shoot water from the oxygen in the air and it's own hydrogen. You can use it to flood any flowers we come across and see whether your idea works.

We'll gather a bunch of interns and give them glaives so they can cut anything you all freeze.

If you don't want to participate in the journey, now is the time to say so. I understand if you don't want to and I don't blame you. This is my fault for not checking the radiation leakage and biological contamination.

We'll meet tomorrow outside the Facility at dawn. Roland, do the airstrike before we leave, ok?

*Everyone would get their preparations together and decide whether or not they were coming or leaving.*

*The sun rose the next morning, screaming its red colors across the night sky as it frightened away the two moons. Aneas looked up at the sky and checked his radiation unit. He would have to get a new unit soon but he could last throughout the next couple days before a new one.*

*He set Tilot on a piece of metal.* [Don't come with us. Stay here.] *He said in Tee'en.*

*He checked and made sure that everyone who was coming were ready. The interns were nervous but had hardened faces as they readied to fight for their wageless suicidal jobs. Aneas looked at the rest and smiled.*

Today's the day we take our grounds back! Today's the day we make our say on this planet!

Roland, send out the airstrike!

*Several ships would then zoom above them and drop their dry ice bombs, sending huge clouds down onto the flowers and the plants before them.*

*As the fog settled after some time, the teal plants appeared again with some frost.*

Interns, start cutting them up. Everyone else, let's go!

*And so they would begin their fantastic voyage.*"
8atl9z,2,2018-04-08,A brief history of my relationship with my mother.,Czarike,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8atl9z/a_brief_history_of_my_relationship_with_my_mother/,"	
It took me a long time to realize my relationship with my mother was far from perfect. There were always signs, but I was too naïve to realize them. 
	
My youth was very sheltered. Everything revolved around school. This was a fact of my life since pre-k. Things got worse when I was held back. Some back story is needed to get the full scope of my early childhood. So, let us go back a bit.
	
I was adopted at a young age. All the paper work was filled out and approved when I was three months old. My birth mother was a heavy smoker and I suffered a tad from her habits. The biggest thing affected was the development of the motor area of my brain. It was and still is not as developed as it should be. Due to this, I was unable to write competently for my age group and was help back in kindergarten.
	
Life got a lot more stressful after the decision was made. It was made by my mother, of course, but the blame was placed on my shoulders. It was not a great summer for me. All my friends were moving on in life and I was stuck in the same place. Little did I know, this would be a common feeling in my life.
	
My mother enrolled me in many courses over the summer. All the courses were for mentally disabled kids. That was not me. This seems incidental, but my mother has always had a low opinion of me. She thought I belonged with these kids. In a lot of ways, I did. We were all trying to be normal but had been dumped off by our parents to be someone else’s issue. Stuff like this (courses of this nature would continue until 7th grade) was common place for me. As hurtful as it is to think about, my empathy grew extraordinarily due to these courses.
	
The courses were enough for a normal person to see my mothers’ disappointment in me and her aversion to my issues, but her reaction to my learning disabilities was enough for even young me to have an issue with. I was never allowed to say I was different. Swift punishment would result if I asked for extra help. I would not actually get accommodations until my 4th grade teacher pushed for it behind my mother’s back. I owe so much to that teacher. 
	
My mother’s embarrassment about me stemmed from more than my learning disabilities. We were poor. The move from another country did not leave us with a lot of cash reserves. It left us with no savings. This, of course, was all my fault. From the time I could understand English to now, I have been told how much of a money leech I am. Her ever growing walk in closet was never the issue. I did not get new clothing until I was thirteen. My mother was always getting new dresses and shoes. All my clothing was from my cousins or goodwill. All of hers was name brand. This reminds me of a funny story. When I was in 2nd grade, I had to get two teeth pulled. My mother splurged for the worst rated dentist in town. This was after she spent a bad amount of money on Botox. The dentist’s aids did not numb my mouth enough and I threw up all over myself due to the sudden pain and having all that blood cascading down my throat. My school uniform shirt was white and the only one I had at the time. My mother forced me to go back to school in a vomit covered shirt. I was never allowed to accept gifts or food from friends. My mother did not want to seem poor. I spent a lot of my childhood saying “no” to things I wanted or even needed.
	
There was also the time I needed eye surgery. I had a small piece of steal suck in my eye. I spent a week with no medical attention. My eye began to get pink and swollen. Fearing that I had pink eye, my teacher would not allow me back into class without a doctor’s note saying I was healthy. Another teacher than saved my ass. They found the steel and I was rushed to an eye surgeon. After it was all said and done, the doctor requested that my mother buy me sunglasses and for me to avoid direct eye contact with the sun for 3 months. Otherwise, I would always be hyper sensitive to light. My mother’s solution was to get me fake Men in Black sunglasses from a Happy Meal. I am still hypersensitive to light.
	
Many of these stories culminate in physical abuse, I only had this happen once. I remember what it was about, as well. I had just gotten some slime type toy. In my stupidity, I got it stuck on the ceiling. My mother’s anger was focused all in her back hand. I don’t know if it is natural or a result of my upbringing, but I had a lot of emotional issues as a youth. After a short fist to cuffs with my mother (I was 5 at the time. I did not win), my mother threatened to send me to an orphanage. After she saw how that affected me, she never had to hit me again.

That was not her only weapon against me. She would always compare me to my sister. My sister was adopted to a different family. A rich family at that. It is something I don’t resent her for, but I do sit and wonder how my life would be if roles were switched. Being from a more affluent family, my sister had a lot more opportunities than me. Her success has always been used against me, until recently. My mother has found better people to compare me to.

I often thing a pet’s instincts about a person are a good gauge to go off.  My cat would often shit on my mother’s pillow after she would dig into me. I have always found that funny. 

I do not really like thinking about my past. Most of them are repressed and only shards of my childhood exist. I wish that meant I faced the worst of my mother as a kid. My life was much easier then.

I feel like I should skip stories from high school. A lot happened then, but I hate thinking or talking about them. The easiest place to pick up is sophomore year of college.

Throughout my life, my aunt, grandma, and mother put money into a college fund for me. All my birthday and Christmas presents from them were just additions to this fund. I was beginning a film production class and wanted a camera. I knew I had enough in the fund to get a decent one to use in the class and future classes. I have a full ride to my school, for the most part, so, my college fund has hardly been touched. Well, turns out there is no such thing as my college fund. It is my mother’s savings account for retirement. She also took all my savings bonds that my grandma gave me for college after every important moment in my life (baptism, citizenship, etc.) Not only did I not have money for a camera, my dreams of grad school are fucked. Oh, that was also money for me to move out. That will not happen for a while now.

Speaking about taking a film production course, I switched my major to English. I am now labeled as a disappointment by my mother. I started in Bio, as she forced me to take that as a major. It took me a couple years to get everything ready to change my major under her nose. This still pisses her off. She rants on and on about how I am wasting my life, her money, and her time due to the major change. 

I may get to move out soon, though. If I do not get another job and an internship for this summer, I basically will not be allowed in the house anymore. I already hold a job, run two clubs, and am a full-time student. My mother thinks having free time makes me a lazy free loader. 

I am no longer a disappointment. I was downgraded to “filth”, as of today. This is being written while I am sort of locked in my room, a common occurrence for me. (None of my locks work perfectly.) I have been fighting my mother for 22 years and I am just tired. Every second, she is nice to me is her trying to get something out of me. I walk in constantly to her telling friends and family how worthless I am. Today, she even said she cannot wait to be rid of me. 

If you got this far, thanks for reading. This is not the most coherent write up, but I need to vent a tad.

I am the only guy working in Marketing at my company (website creation) so when the client arrives looking for Marketing Services i am the only guy that will talking to him to offer ""Marketing Services"" to solve their problem (99% times is to get more sales on ecommerce store or more contacts through their service page). 

And here is the problem, i feel i lack the overall view to help someone who needs marketing. I graduated in marketing so i already have all that common sense but sometimes i feel lost looking at an Client and thinking ""How can i help this guy? Facebook page? Google Search Campaign? Or just say to him to search for instagram influencers? And why?"".

I dont know if i am being confuse but in a tl;dr way: i actually getting handy at the PPC Tools but i feel a like that outside of the box thinking to help someone through Marketing. How can i get better at this? Is just time?

8atuqq,3,2018-04-08,I don't miss my grandfather at all. Am I cold?,darkracerx,family,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/8atuqq/i_dont_miss_my_grandfather_at_all_am_i_cold/,"So last year my grandfather on my father's side passed away at age 82 after a massive heart attack. I heard the news when I got back to my apartment after coming from work. A small part of me was sad, but for the most part, I felt relieved. I didn't really like my grandfather that much, not only because were we not that close, but mainly because of how he treated my grandmother, aunts, uncles, my parents, and sometimes me and my siblings and cousins. He was a my-way-or-highway type of guy, always had to be right about everything. He often talked down to others, including his wife and children. He would constantly bark orders, even in front of visitors. My dad told me when he was a child, he either went to his friends house across the street or would lock himself in his room to get away from his father's constant screaming and anger. Everyday when he came home from work he would often find something to yell his wife and children about. No one should ever have live to live in fear in their own home. Before my siblings and I were born, my father vowed to be a much different parent than his father and he kept his word. He is the most fun-loving, patient, and caring father that anyone could ever ask for. My mother is the same. I couldn't imagine growing up in a household like the one my father grew up in. A 15-16 year old shouldn't have to stand up for his 43 year old father in an argument, nor break up a fight. He would shout insults without regarding other people's feelings and would bark orders at us. When my siblings and I were kids, my grandpa would bark orders at us when we'd go to visit his house. He made us do chores and would berate us for not doing them right. He would often tell my dad what an awful job we did and how lazy and bad behaved we were. The first few times my dad believed him and would reprimand us, but later on he could tell that he was just making up bullshit. When my brother accidentally broke a glass (he was only 8), my grandfather pulled him into another room and spanked him until he cried. My grandmother took him to a room in the house and put him to sleep. Another time, my grandfather called me stupid for forgetting to do a chore. I nearly burst into tears when that happened. I once overheard him insulting my mother when she wasn't there. I didn't tell my mother what happened, but I bet she would have wanted to know. He once drove home while sipping a beer while my siblings, two other cousins and I were in the car with my grandmother while coming home from the Russian day celebration. I tried to tell him that it was illegal, but he ignored me. Then grandma, who sat next to him, intervened and told him to stop. Luckily we made it back safely. None of us told our parents or our aunt what had happened because we wanted to keep the peace. Two years later, just a few days after my high school graduation party, my dad and grandpa were arguing and he called my dad stupid in front of his own wife and children. Seriously, a 75 year old man did that. For my dad, that was the straw that broke the camels back. He stood up to him, and ceased all contact with him. I could list more incidents, but for this post I'm going to keep it short. In fairness, my grandfather could be kind when he wanted to, but it was the lack of empathy, patience, and emotional connection as well as his constant abrasiveness that I found hurtful. My grandmother was a much kinder person altogether but she was unable to stand up to her husband even on occasion when I went to her for help. After his death, the following thanksgiving my grandmother, whom surprisingly wasn't upset at my non-attendance of the funeral, sat down with me and told me an hour and a half long story, something that I wish I had known more in detail before. Well, okay, my father told me this many times. But not in any great detail. I forgive my grandfather and am proud of the hard work and sacrifices he made to come to this country. I also know that he had a difficult childhood back in Ukraine whereby he was poor and was constantly treated badly by his parents. That makes me feel really sorry for him. However, I cannot forgive or excuse the rudeness and abuse. He seemed to channel his frustrations onto us. If he had the ability to just talk to us, but he didn't, and we've have had to live with the results ever since. During one of my internships, I went to that school counselor for therapy and have been doing on-and-off therapy since then without ever lasting positive results. My girlfriend felt that I was being insensitive for not going to my grandfathers funeral. She probably wouldn't understand because she had loving grandparents. But I kept my thoughts to myself. Nonetheless, I have been grateful for her understanding and support. However, despite my good upbringing, I'm questioning whether or not to have children, or even grandchildren, for that matter lol, because I'm afraid I might treat my children the way my grandpa treated me, even though my parents treated me the exact opposite. To this day, I still do not understand why my grandmother stayed with him. She deserved so much better. Anyway, am I a cold heartless person for not going to my grandfathers funeral?"

On paper my life seems like it’s going in the right direction. I got an internship which is pretty difficult to get in my field. I am doing well in my classes and my teachers are impressed with my project I’m working on. I’m making more friends and going out more often. Yet when I come home, and I’m done with work, I just feel so empty. So unhappy with my life. 

Anybody else feel this way? understand 5 months isn’t that long, but I can’t stand this pain. 

I know I need to go NC and I broke it to get some stuff back. We ended up chatting and we decided to be honest to each other and he said he would be down to try again if the problems we had weren’t valid anymore. But anytime soon would just be bad timing because of his troubled academics, his depression, his drug abuse, and long distance. In a way I guess I “won” the break up, he’s doing much worse, but it definitely doesn’t feel that way.

I get it, the factors are against us. Those are good reasons to just move on. He trying to move on and improve his life in the meantime, but when he tells me he still has my pictures and drawings on his walls and he cries every time he hears a song we listen to a lot I just don’t know what to say. 

I want to move on and I know I need to go on NC again but damn I keep breaking it and breaking it. While on NC I keep hoping he’ll initiate contact with me... 

I think of all the things I didn’t like in the relationship and all the ways he wronged me. So many reasons to stay away from him yet I still love him. "

Also, remembering the story, vitals, labs, what was done yesterday for the patient, etc. is really hard for me to spout off the top of my head when the attending or senior resident asks me to tell them about a patient. I get stuck a lot and start flipping through a bunch of notes trying to find an answer to their question. I have a lot of anxiety that I am going to drown as an intern.

8aui5f,37,2018-04-08,This Sub is life. WARNING: Multiple MLM's in one story.,abowmanlex,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8aui5f/this_sub_is_life_warning_multiple_mlms_in_one/,"Ever since I was a kid I've had multiple family members and a few friends get into MLM schemes. It's just sad seeing how these organizations suck the life out of some people especially family.  
  
I was introduced to these products when my aunt and uncle started to sell Amway products, then Avon cosmetics, THEN they'd sell those XS energy drinks, and now they are apart of WFG running their ""own business"" going 6 years strong. It's sad because they've been sucked into multiple schemes in the past 20 years and never got the picture. They even told my cousin to drop out of college to join their business and she did.  
  
For a moment in time I only knew of them getting in those schemes, but then in high school a family friend finds out that I'm pretty business savvy knowing stocks well and basic business strategy/analytics. At the time I was 16 and he said when I'm 18 I'll be making ""real money"" getting into his business, but he gave me a run down of what he did which I thought sounded cool. He'd use the key phrases that anyone desperate for money wants: potential six figures, weekly pay, vacation time, retire early, etc. SO when I was 18 he hit me up and I found out he's apart of WFG, but by then I was smart enough to know that other family is sucked into it not making money and knew the concept of a MLM scheme. Just like other people on this forum I had similar experiences with the meeting, presentation, and them wanting money for some books, but I told them I'd think about it and I never talked to him since.  
  
Last year was the peak of seeing MLM come to my life since my mom and aunts got sucked into the WFG, Purium, and It Works. They were all trying to recruit me and I'm not the type to shoot down dreams of making money, but I declined all of their offers without telling them what they really got into because they are all in financial hardships and I just want them to have some sort of hope. Luckily they were all broke enough to not further their ""businesses"". Other than that I was also in the market for a job and just got bombarded with phone calls from random insurance groups, facial oil companies, and some door to door shit. Basically when I'd get a call from them I'd tell them I found a job and am no longer on the market  then I block the number.  
  
My last experience recently was such a bummer because it was my former boss that I got an internship with. She emails me details about a ""business venture"" that I may want to be apart of, but through experience I knew what it was...WFG. I immediately told her what she was getting into and how I won't join her ""business"". She then thanked me for informing her since she didn't get to the life insurance part until the week after we talked and she actually took my advice to stay away or just use the free sessions to beef up her sales tactics for houses.  
  
Bottom line is I hate seeing people getting sucked into these shitty companies and as an advertising/marketing major it sucks getting approached by these people often. Currently looking for internships at ad agencies and have been hit up by three people in the last week smh.  
  
Thanks for reading and spread awareness before someone gets to someone you love."

As part of a summer internship, I was researching answering factual questions with deep learning language techniques.

I needed to prototype many experiments quickly. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any software that fit and so after an initial proof of concept, this project was born.

Learning deep learning over summer was fun, as well as it included tricky but gratifying problem-solving.

Following submitting my first research paper, I feel that PyTorch-NLP is ready. A year after the initial proof of concept, I'm ready to make it make it public.

I hope that this project will help other researchers quickly prototype deep learning systems. Also, I hope to build a community that can keep the toolkit up to date with state-of-the-art techniques.

8ausei,2,2018-04-08,I am [20 M] worried my brother is depressed and maybe even suicidal [24 M].,depressedbrothermayb,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ausei/i_am_20_m_worried_my_brother_is_depressed_and/,"Hey guys,

My brother graduated university a year ago in a lucrative major (computer science) and since then he has been looking for work.  He has had interviews but overall has had no success. 

Quite frankly, I can see why he does not have success. He has no sense of personal hygiene and overall has poor social awareness. The only thing substantial on his resume is his grades and a co-op internship he had. So he has been able to get interviews but he hasn't been able to ace the interview.

Here's the problem. We grew up in a very strict and conservative family. Our parents would always argue over the littlest things and this affected us to become similar to them. Because of this, my brother and I are fairly introverted. Our family never shows affection for each other (no hugs, we never say ""I love you"", nothing). 

I somehow was able to break free from this, as I am a somewhat less introverted guy surrounded by a great group of friends and a loving girlfriend. However, my brother is the exact opposite. He stays in his room all day unless he has to eat, go to the washroom, and occasionally buys groceries. I am not too sure what he does in his room, but I know he is putting somewhat of an effort to finding a job. He has literally no friends to hang out with in person (maybe he has some online, I am not sure).

Obviously, my family can not support my brother's lifestyle forever, so they pester him constantly about job openings and ask him about any updates on the job hunt. My brother always replies in anger. Everything he says is filled with anger, every time I try to make conversation with him he either ignores me or has a snarky reply. Presumably, I believe he adopted this type of speech from my parents. 

I am greatly worried that he is depressed. Furthermore, I have no idea how to even approach him and talk about the possibility of depression. It's already hard enough to have general conversation without him being snarky, but to talk about his feelings? That's another level that would make both of us uncomfortable. Remember, growing up we NEVER talked about these kind of things. 

I talked to my mom about it and she agrees that I may be right, and she definitely toned down her nagging to my brother about the job hunt. My neighbour recently hung himself while he was in high-school and it devastated the entire community. My mom definitely does not want that to happen to my brother. However even with my mom toning down the nagging, I am worried that my brother will hurt himself more and more because he can't find a job. 

One other thing, since we live in the same household, I sometimes feel like I might also be making it worse. I sometimes bring my friends over to my place and I feel like this might make him even more depressed that I have friends and he has no one. 

I am at a loss on what to do. I do not think directly talking about his feelings will fare well, and I also am uncomfortable to talk about it. Any advice on what to do would be appreciated. This is the longest reddit post I've ever written, so I apologize if it is too long, but for my brother I think me writing this post is worth it. 

TL;DR: Brother graduated university a year ago and hasn't been able to find a job. My family and I are afraid it is causing him to feel depressed and worthless. However, no one in our family is able to talk about this because we grew up in an environment where we never talked about our feelings, and never displayed affection. I am at a loss on what to do.

8av5ot,2,2018-04-08,Templar House of Church Hill,AhuwahZeus,conspiracyfact,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyfact/comments/8av5ot/templar_house_of_church_hill/,"The Spencer family is a high level British nobility which manage politics and media in the UK for the British Crown. Various members of this family have been Knights of the Order of the Garter including John Churchill the 1st Duke of Marlborough. They originate from the Despencer family and Hugh le Despencer the 1st Baron of Despencer who held the position of Justiciar of England which is similar to the modern position of a prime minister. The Despencer family held high level positions in the English government. Winston Spencer-Churchill was a well known Prime Minister of the UK. Winston Churchill's grandfather was Leonard Jerome an American financier and friend and business associate of the wealthy Vanderbilt family. Consuelo Vanderbilt was married to Charles Richard Spencer-Churchill the 9th Duke of Marlborough. Anderson Cooper is a two time CIA intern and member of the Vanderbilt family. Anderson Cooper runs propaganda for CNN and is a pedophile that molests little boys. Pedophiles are staging mass shootings and then demanding gun control. Princess Diana of Wales was a Spencer so Prince William is closely related to this family. Charles Spencer the 9th Earl Spencer is a high level member of this family along with his wicked son Louis Frederick Spencer the Viscount of Althorp. Louis Spencer is a member of the Order of Bath and involved in bathing the human blood. Charles Spencer is involved with the mainstream media and worked for NBC. Randolph Churchill was a politician and journalist. The Spencer family are connected with the Freud and Murdoch families which run News Corporation and Freud Communications which is a marketing and public relations firm. Matthew Freud was married to Charles Spencer's ex wife and remarried Rupert Murdoch's daughter at the Spencer's Blenheim Palace. Emma Freud is a Dame of the British Empire and works in radio and television. Matthew Freud's ancestors are Sigmund Freud the brainwasher and fraudulent psychoanalyst as well as the propagandist Edward Bernays.

James Spencer-Churchill the 12th Duke of Marlborough is the head of the House of Spencer along with his son George Spencer-Churchill the Marquess of Blandford. They own the very large Blenheim Palace. Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill is married to Nathan Gelber the CEO of Stamford Associates which is an investment advisory company. The half brother of James Spencer-Churchill is Edward Spencer-Churchill and he is a business associate of Prince Valerio Massimo and they founded the aerospace company Auctus Industries and SCM Capital Partners. Edward Spencer-Churchill and Prince Valerio Massimo are extremely sadistic. The knight of the British Empire Rupert Soames is the CEO of Serco and a grandson of Winston Churchill. Serco is company that privatizes governments and runs health care systems, prisons, military agencies, information services, and transportation for governments. The Spencer family have shares in Serco. Nicholas Soames is also a relative of Winston Churchill and was the Shadow Secretary of State for Defence. Nicholas Soames is currently chairman of the private military group Aegis Defence Services. Aegis has set up criminal operations in Syria. There are towns all over the United Kingdom and its commonwealths that are named Churchill. Charles Spencer's ex wife Karen Spencer established Whole Child International which is involved with orphanages around the world and has been financed by the Clinton Foundation. The royal and noble families are known for their involvement in trafficking children. They use fake charities as fronts. Various members of the Spencer-Churchill family have been involved with military. They founded The Churchill Machine Tool Company which then established Matrix Churchill a precision machining company that was given to the Iraqis which used the company to machine parts for artillery and rockets.

Winston Churchill was a Knight of the Order of the Garter which is really a continuation of the Knights Templar of London reestablished under a new name a few decades after they were disbanded. The Knights Templar were Christian Crusaders that fought to conquer over Jerusalem. They were also bankers and merchants. The name Church Hill has the same meaning as Temple Mount. Temple Mount is a religious site in Jerusalem and where King Solomon built the first temple. King Solomon was considered to be a sorcerer who used ""demons"" to build his temple. The Knights Templar or Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and the Temple of Solomon took their name from the ruins of Solomon's Temple during the Crusades. Freemasonry is partly based on the Knights Templar and the Freemasons and other similar groups use sorcery or witchcraft to mind control people into doing their bidding like building temples. Winston Churchill was Secretary of State for the Colonies during the British Mandate for Palestine which is when many Zionists under contract with the British Crown migrated into Israel. This was supported by the Balfour Declaration issued by the Knight of the Order of the Garter and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Arthur Balfour who was a political associate of Lord Randolph Churchill the father of Winston Churchill. The Spencer family have been using Aegis Defence Services mercenaries in Syria. Aegis was founded by the British Knight Tim Spicer. During the war in Iraq videos linked with Aegis Defence Services were released that showed mercenaries shooting at civilians. The name Spencer refers to dispensing or distributing. The Spencer family gave over their machining company to the Iraqi government to make weapons which were likely used to kill Americans and British during the wars in Iraq. They also helped to give out land that wasn't theirs to Zionists because the Spencer family are Christian-Zionists.

8av7rq,285,2018-04-08,[Discussion] To all the kids in college wanting a dog...,jacobycrisp,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/8av7rq/discussion_to_all_the_kids_in_college_wanting_a/,"This past October/November I decided I wanted a dog. Being a 21 yr old college kid, many people, including my parents, wrote me off as just another stupid college student who wanted a puppy for a few weeks and would eventually return it because they didn't know what they were getting into. Thankfully I took what they said to heart and did my absolute best to make sure I knew what I was getting into. I did my research about breeds, learned what to do when you adopt, what age dog was good for me, etc. and most of all, took my time in deciding if it was truly a good thing to do. Well finally in February, after months of planning and work, I  adopted my new 5 month old American blue heeler, Ryder, and I can say it has been a great decision. It's helped me grow as a person and taught me to be responsible and caring no matter what kind of day Ive had at school/work.

That being said, for all people who may read this post who are college students/young adults, remember this: this s#*t is a lot of work. There have been many times where I'll get home from work and I'm tired as anything, but he is still my responsibility and it's my duty as his owner to take care of him and make sure he is good. It also costs a lot of money that most college kids may not have unless their parents are helping. I'm lucky in that right now I am working as an intern and getting a good salary where I can support myself and Ryder, whereas most kids do not have that kind of steady income.

In the end, what I'm trying to say is that, when I was looking at getting a dog and frequenting this page, there were not a lot of stories from people my age telling their experience. I wanted to tell what I've learned so far and what people like me should expect as well. Do your homework, and really find out if it is a good idea for you, because if not, you will 100% regret it once the glamor of having a new companion wears off. However, if I can do it, others certainly can too. Raising a dog has been the most rewarding experience of my life and I look forward to all of the road ahead and I wish you all the best of luck as well.


EDIT: Well dang guys, I honestly wasn't expecting this much response, but I really appreciate everyone telling their success stories and experiences. It helps me knowing it can be done, and I'm sure it will help other as well looking I to this in the future. Thank you all again for the support!"

8avagq,73,2018-04-08,"Boyfriend (26m) of 2 years saw a picture of me (22f) with a ring and unfortunate caption and now believes I’m married, what do I do?",Listentomepleasethx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8avagq/boyfriend_26m_of_2_years_saw_a_picture_of_me_22f/,"Mobile plus throwaway so expect awkward spelling. 

My boyfriend, Tod is 26m and I’m 22f. We’ve been dating 2 years, 1 semi long distance due to Tom getting a job about four hours away. Honestly everything has been perfect and amazing, we get along great, no major issues and until today I thought we’d be getting married and living happy ever after. 

So some background about today, 5 weeks ago I moved to California from the east coast where Tom and I live for an internship. Tom was very proud of me and had no issues with me leaving. Two days in I met my Cali best friends, Amy (21f) and Alex (22m). Amy works in the same team as me and Alex works at the same desk island thing. Alex is also (very) gay (relevant). I have a very hard time making friends so Tom was happy I befriended people so fast. We both have mixed sex friend groups so this is no issue (foreshadowing: or so I thought). 

So yesterday Alex, Amy and I decided to hit some bars (mostly Alex wanted too but I enjoy going out so I went with). Usually we go to gay bars but Amy wanted to meet up with a guy she was seeing so we decided to hit up a straight bar mid way through the night because he didn’t like gay bars much. So, since I knew this, I grabbed a simple silver ring because I had read on the internet once that guys hit on girls less if they’re wearing a ring. It worked but This turned out to be my downfall. We all went out, I wore my ring, went to a gorgeous bar by the ocean at sunrise, took pictures, got too drunk, passed out at Amy’s. I texted Tom when I left, what we were planning on doing, and when I got home, no other correspondence that night - which is what we do every time one of us goes out (plus time zones make it impossible for us to talk past like 7pm). 

I woke up around 9 to a text from Tom that came in at 5 my time saying we need to talk. I was confused so once I was feeling a bit better (around 5 hours after his text) I called Tom. 

He was pissed. He was interrogating me about sleeping with Alex, if I had a secret husband, and how could I cheat on him. Literally went 0-100 on me. I was crying, asking if he was insane, what was he talking about, mostly just general confusion and hurt (especially after the secret husband comment). He hung up saying we’d talk after he got off work.

So after that I woke up Amy and we had a chat about wtf he was going on about. As we were talking Alex (who was in the other room) came in looking really sad and showed me a picture he’d posted on Instagram at midnight-ish. There were three pictures but the first one was me, holding a glass of wine looking at the sunset (ring VERY visible) and the caption “the wife, the tipsy, and the (best) lover”. Now, on its own that probably looks like I’m all three but I know the wine is a very popular variety here that’s nickname is literally “Wife Juice” and the restaurant we were at is the only place that sells it (which obviously atom doesn’t know), and the other two pictures were Amy stumbling down a street but matching the art in the background (sounds trashy but Alex is a really good photographer so it looks classy, I swear), and the third was Alex’s boyfriend kissing him at one of the bars. 

Tom doesn’t have Instagram so I’m assuming a friend must’ve shown just the picture of me? I’m not sure. Honestly I’m not even sure how I can convince Tom I didn’t cheat on him, I’m not “secretly married”, and I literally wore a ring so that guys would leave me alone. Alex has apologized profusely and I’ve told him it’s not his fault, he didn’t cause this (even though he technically did but he didn’t). I’m calling Tom in a few hours, what do I do? What do I say?

tl;dr Went out with a ring on so randoms wouldn’t hit on me. Long distance boyfriend saw a photo with the caption “the wife” posted by a close (gay!) male friend of mine. Boyfriend now thinks I have a secret husband/cheated, what do I do?"

# Elementary school (7)

I was growing up in a messed up family: painful divorce, violence, poverty, and a shitty country in Eastern Europe.

Was always rejected and bullied by peers, from kindergarden to school - either because something was wrong with me, or because I was poor, or because I was smart.

It did not help that I've changed a dozen of schools over lifetime due to family reasons. In each school I was a new student, so it was harder to build friendships.

I was lucky (or not) though that I happened to be smart. Studying was easy (except when social awkwardness got in the way - i.e. when you need to write essay on how you spent your summer).

Perhaps it is fair to say that I was smarter than 99% of peers. Or maybe even 99.9%.

However being smart doesn't help with respect from classmates, or self-respect. Wearing glasses didn't help either.

Being always bullied and humiliated, I quickly internalized the belief that I'm just worst than most people, and there is no way anyone can like me.

# High school (12)

It got somewhat better at the age of 15, when classmates became more civilized, and some of the worst offenders just dropped off.

However, I kept seeing myself as a failure, despite winning regional and national competitions on many sciences.

It felt that I might be good at science, but there is something disgusting about me, so nobody can value me as a person or enjoy my company.

At that time I was angry at people who were more socially successful than me.

Having friends, going to parties, dating seemed like something from the other world, for _normal_ people, but not for me.

Hence I didn't bother taking care of my looks, maintaining personal hygiene, or even planning my life at all.

I was just escaping in books and fantasies.

One view on the problem was (though I'm not sure I quite believed it) that I'm not worse than all of the peers, I'm just too smart for them, and the life will make things fair... maybe.

I was angry at girls that were dating other classmates, and not myself.

I was even fantasizing how due to some magical skill I would be able to force all of them to have sex with me. I didn't consider their feelings at all, not because I felt privileged, but rather because I felt that their life is already so much better than mine, that it just would be justice.

Eventually - without much effort - I finished school with distinction, and family sent me to a college.

# College (17)

Peers at the college were much more intelligent than classmates from high school (most of those didn't go to college at all).

However, I got used to hating myself and not trusting anyone, that I pretty much was isolating myself and not building connections, and only slowly improving on that over years.

I wasn't hateful towards the world by then though, since I realized that nobody wants to hurt me now, it is just a matter of resolving my own problems.

As an example, when a classmate was diagnosed with cancer, and her friend was collecting money for the surgery, I gave her half of my savings from three-months internship.
I didn't do it because I was close to her or hoped for some reciprocity, I barely knew her.
I just was thinking that she is capable of enjoying this life, so she deserves to live more than me.
It was very embarassing to do so, as I imagined that everyone would be disgusted by me and would laugh at me, however it went fine.
She did return most of it though, saying that she can't accept such a big contribution.

I was confused as to why this happened, and asked advice on some anonymous forum.
Internet people told that this is because I am an ""omega male"", and it would be repulsive to accept big contribution from me.

By the end of college, I started being more open, confident, and finally started taking life into my own hands and thinking what I can do to improve it.

Though still I knew that I need to close the gap between the ""public"" self that was demonstrating that I'm just fine,
and am only disappointed by the stupidity of people around me, and the ""private"" self who was concerned that I'm a monster that nobody can ever love or even like.

# Adult life (23)

After graduation, it became clear to me that I am finally valued.

I was able to work by doing what I enjoy (tech), while at the same time being paid good money, which made me feel hopeful for better life.

I noticed though, that my defense mechanism ""I'm being rejected because everyone around is stupid and I'm too smart for them"" wasn't working anymore.

Now everyone around was smart, but at the same time socially skilled, so I felt that I do have a problem that needs solving if I ever want to enjoy being with people.

Now that I was making money though, I felt I have levers to improve my life.

I've read about autism and the spectrum (trying to understand what's wrong with me) and about PUA sphere (since they promised solution to the most complex social interaction: dating).

I've switched jobs several times, found the one that I truly enjoy, and the one that was helping me grow. Moved to New York.

My plan on improving the life (when I was 23) was as following:

 - Since I got my chance getting out of shit, I must not waste it.
   - I must never relax (as people who had simple childhood may do) and must keep working on improving myself.
   - I must not do things because ""this is how I always have done it"", I must always be open to improvement.
 - Now I have lots of money, and also I'm smarter than other people.
 - I need to continue improving my intellect and professional skills since it is my ticket to happy life
 - I need to funnel money and intellect to ""fix"" the areas where I'm worse than others:
   - Hire doctors to fix all my health problems that accumulated over the time of neglecting myself
   - Maintain a healhy lifestyle. Start picking up hobbies that would involve physical activities and also would make me more interesting.
   - Use PUA resources to learn how to be neat, attractive and take care of myself. Date women, have sex, and use it to fix self-esteem problems.
   - Hire a therapist to figure out what is really wrong with me (since self-diagnoses might be misleading).
   - After learning how to communicate with people, continue improving. Don't stop. I don't want to go back to miserable life.
   - Having learned how to build connections with people, build many connections, have many deep conversations, learn how people lived their childhoods, what they were feeling, what they were dreaming of, how they live and organize their lives now, what they are trying to do in their lives. Basically learn everything about other humans, so that I can stop being an alien and successfully integrate. After that, reiterate on my life plans and understand what I want to achieve by the age of 30, 40, etc.
   - Never stop practicing social skills. Make sure I am popular, have many close friends, and can easily get more. I don't want to go back to my previous life of outcast.
   - While I'm young, make sure I can learn how to get sex, finally fulfill everything that I've been denied in high school and college. After that find a smart (unlike people who I was growing up with) and successful woman and build a relationship with her. This way I could stop being bitter and resentful about my younger years, since I would've found truly good partner (unlike my classmates).
   
I started executing the plan and was quite successful in it.

I had eye surgery to become a normal person that doesn't need eyeglasses.
It was amazing to see the world in great details and instead of looking at the ground, look all around yourself when walking.
All the buildings are beautiful.

I started going to a gym.

I had energy of moving to new country, feeling successful, feeling valued.

Started making friends, hobbies, started being more open and showing my emotions, started participating in social events. I was living according to the principle ""never say no"" and was signing up for every opportunity to do social activity. I was growing both professionally and socially.

When I talked to my ex-peers from university, they were admiring how much I achieved so quickly, and were saying that talking to me is always so inspirational.

Those were absolutely best years of my life.

I've also read about feminists around that time. I liked them. Not because I clearly understood their goals or empathized (it is hard to empathize to someone who you perceive more successful than yourself), but because they seemed modern, progressive, and smart. I liked the idea of having a partner who is equal and has professional achievements rather than just spends time in a kitchen or shopping. I also felt some affinity, since both me and them were oppressed but managed to become successful.

After a year of big self-improvement I felt confident enough to go take a short PUA training to understand at least the first step: how to meet someone.

I didn't care about what to do next, since the first step was about fixing self-esteem, and busting the fear of rejection. After meeting someone and validating myself, I would have new emotions and information to process, and would be able to think what to do next.

I went through the training (really short), made a few approaches, wasn't rejected, had some warm conversations, even a date.
Didn't get sex, but that didn't matter.
What mattered at that moment, was that I was finally realizing that the fear is almost gone, and I can be interesting to other people (those people were way below my league - but I needed to start from something).
A little bit more practice, and I'd be able to feel ""normal"".

And then the next week I met Her.

# Her (24)

She (F23) was from the same country as me, visiting New York for a holiday, and looked like a person who is very emotional, positive, and kind.

I (M24) overcame my fear and approached her.

We talked several hours, and agreed to meet again the next day.

She wasn't particularly smart or successful, but at this moment what mattered for me were emotions.
She was the first person to smile at me in my life.

Over the next week we've been seeing each other every day.

I showed her the city, she was very happy, I was happy to see that someone can enjoy time with me.

I told her that it was my first time talking to a girl and she was very supportive.

I felt that I met an angel (though rational part of me knew that this is probably how all women or even humans are, and I'm just too excited because it is my first emotional contact).

I awkwardly suggested having sex, and she said she can't do it with a person who she knows for so little time.
I was perfectly okay with that, she already had done a lot for me.

I realized I want to make sure I never hurt her.
How could I hurt a person who changed my life so much and was so kind when I was afraid.
She was the first person who had ever been so kind to me.

I tried to make the remaining days of her visit as good as I could.

---

After she came back home, I didn't plan to continue this relationship.
We were too different, long-distance relationship is hard, and I didn't need a relationship anyway, I needed more practice!

However she called back the next day, and wanted to talk. That was strange, but I though some practice of phone conversations would hurt.

We talked almost every day. It was nice to hear her voice, and hear that she enjoyed time with me, but we didn't really have any shared interests.

She was much less educated, didn't share my passion for knowledge, barely spoke English, and wasn't inspiring.

She wasn't progressive, she was very traditional - wanted big family, husband, and children.
She thought that feminist women are just unhappy unsatisfied women, ""otherwise they wouldn't fight for something"".

In my mind she was just a very kind person who I was very grateful, but nothing more.

I was also conscious whether she is just trying to use me, or to make a family with me because of my financial stability (I was making $200k and living by myself in the best city in the world, and she was making $15k and was living in some shit town with her parents).

I cared about her, but I still wasn't quite trusting anyone, and didn't want to sacrifice all my plans to live boring and regretful life with a person who is not interesting to me.

A few weeks later she suggested she'd love to go on some sea trip with me. This was tempting. I booked us a tour to some tropical island.

Since I was paying for both of us, I felt somewhat uncomfortable that either she is using me, or I'm buying her.

However, I made my mind that:

 - Regardless of her intentions, I don't mind paying for that since for me it is a very valuable experience
 - I will not do anything to make her feel sexually obliged to me that I paid for the trip, since I don't want to take advantage or make her feel uncomfortable.
 - I also promise myself that we don't continue anything after that trip. In that case everything will end up fair regardless of her real plans. If she sincerely enjoys spending time with me, she will've spent a good time. If she is pretending that she likes me in order to marry me, then she won't get what she wants.

---

We went to the island and had a good time. She was very kind and caring. I was disappointed by her being not as smart as people I'm used to spend time with, but was still very grateful.

I asked about her previous relationships and she told me how people have hurt her before.

I decided I have to find a way to end this relationship without hurting her.

However the whole situation was becoming scary, since it seemed that she was seeing it as a beginning of long term relationship.

Anyway, the vacation was great. I've never enjoyed travel as much as then.

---

I became deeply concerned about her future. That was new. I've never cared about anyone that much in my life.

If for me, my exceptional intellect was giving me a ticket to a successful and interesting life, she was an average person. Maybe even below average.

I tried to imagine what it is to be a below-average person and live in her town - and it seemed unbearable to me.

She also was very emotional about how happy she is with me, and I just couldn't take it away, especially after I've shown her a better life.

Besides, nobody had been so kind to me in my life.

_(She was so happy with me because she fell in love, and not because of opportunities I was opening, but I didn't understand it back then)_

I felt that my moral obligation is to marry her and give her the happiness and everything that I have, instead of caring about my life goals.

I felt very guilty thinking that I just used her for sex, and accidentally have shown her a better life, and would take it away, potentially making her regret it for many years.
I knew she would never be as successful as I was.

_(In retrospective, I didn't really understand what she feels and wants (due lack of empathy), I just was just imagining what I would've felt on her place.)_

We met each other a few more times, traveling back and forth.

Once she said that she wants to be with me forever - that was horrifying to hear.

I tried to ask her if I can somehow improve her life apart from the relationship. She helped me move forward in my life significantly, and I wanted to do something big for her. But she didn't really have any speficic life plans, and was focused only on us being together.

Once I tried to ask here what she likes and doesn't like about me (hoping to see if she likes some personality qualities, or maybe can encourage me to improve on something), and she said that she likes everything. This is sweet, but it is not personal.
I didn't get to see why exactly she wants me and not someone else.

I tried to explain to her the dilemma that I'm facing, saying that at this moment of life,
the quality of partner that I'm with is a way how I improve my self-esteem, and being with
her will make me feel like a failure, hoping she'd set me free of the obligation.
I felt like shit saying those words.
After she started crying, I just had to take it all back and say that I will not leave her.

---

Next several months were mix of tenderness and care about each other, and tears due to this conflict of interest.
There were times when she was saying that I don't have to stay with her and can leave and live my own life, but I heard it as self-sacrifice from her side, and couldn't let myself do it.
She was the person I cared for most in my life, and I couldn't start building my own life at the expense of hers.

Desperate, I tried to talk about it to some friends, they were saying that I should end all of this, but I couldn't let myself do it.

She was still my first sex partner, but I couldn't take advantage of it.
I felt that if we are now in an unequal relationship, she is so dependent on me, then asking her for sex would be not nice, since I'm in a position of power, and she would be obliged to agree fearing that I'll leave.
I didn't want to make her do anything.

Additionally, since she wasn't intellectually stimulating, I felt uncomfortable wanting sex with her, since it would mean that I'd be treating her just like piece of meat.

From our conversations I understood, she really wants to be desired and valued and it hurts her to see that I'm looking down at her.

---

Eventually, I decided (probably the worst decision of my life):

 - I have to marry her. I can't get away with having used her and then proceeding to my awesome life while leaving her suffering.
 - Since she is not interesting to me, I'm at risk of leaving her for someone else.
 - All of my life plans contradict this marriage, so it'll be hard to maintain my commitment.
 - So if I want to ensure I don't back off, I need to take advantage of my weaknesses, reverse everything that I've achieved and abandon all plans:
   - Stop dreaming about being successful with women. This is not allowed anymore.
   - I need to stop making friends, since they would be smarter and more interesting than her, and I don't want her to look bad.
   - I need to destroy my self-confidence, so that I switch into the mode ""I'll never find anyone, so I value, worship and adore you"".
   - Stop improving social skills
   - Stop taking care of myself (hygiene and health)
   - Stop improving career
   - Stop enjoying my work (otherwise I can get distracted by work which I truly enjoy and stop caring about her)
   - Stop having clear view on my life plans or any motivation to plan my life
   - Stop being curious and learning
   - Just stop improving myself - I'm already too much ahead of her, I don't want the gap to increase
   - I must not honestly ask myself a question ""what do I want in my life"", since the answer must be predetermined: ""family and kids""
   - ...and then I will really become the kind of person who _needs_ her as I won't have anything else in life than her.
 - After I abandon all my life plans, my life will be meaningless, and I won't be the determined person that I used to be.
  - However, she is so happy with me, that she probably won't notice. Even broken version of me still can earn enough to support her and kids.
  - It may be that this whole thing will become too unbearable to me, and I'll have to end my life. In that case she'd at least get pretty big insurance payment from my employer. Besides, that would be not my problem anymore.

Thus my path of self-destruction began.

I went to a shop and bought a diamond ring, since I knew she is an ordinary person that cares about these traditions (in fact it is a conspiracy by De Beers but she wouldn't understand it).
But I couldn't make myself to propose.

Six months later, I've conditioned myself enough to feel terrible without her.
I stopped being passionate about my work, stopped taking parts in all social events, stopped talking to everyone, stop taking care of myself, stopped watching movies.
I was coming home every evening, feeling like shit, and calling her, and she was saying ""Everything is going to be great, life is amazing"", and was making me feel a bit better, even though I knew life is not going to be great.

I realized, if the only quality that she has is kindness, I have to make sure I _need_ her kindness and care, so I must be pessimistic and suffering.

# Marriage (25)

Then I proposed to her. She asked ""are you sure?"", but she didn't seem to understand the sacrifice that I was making, and I didn't want to make her understand it.

We married next month (she was taking care of all the arrangements).

I felt like I'm getting trapped and my life is over.

In our first night after marriage we talked a lot and I was telling her how I feel, and she was saying that I must not destroy myself, but I was too fixated on my obligation.

She said that if I don't improve the situation in a year, she'll have to leave me so that I'm free to explore all my opportunities again.

I said that this is not an option, since I _must_ be with her forever.

A few months of living together, we had a lot of crying, she even started having panic attacks from all the stress.

Some time later, I decided that what's happening isn't good for either of us, and tried to get back to normal life.
In order to gain some motivation, and recover self-esteem I tried to travel the world, while doing this I dated someone else, and had sex.
However my wife found out (since I can't lie), and was hysterically crying for many hours.

I felt guilty, but at the same time angry (doesn't she understand that I was trying to fix our messed up situation), so I decided the following:

 - OK she wants me to be faithful, despite my needs
 - I'll be faithful, by I won't try to fix anything anymore, and will be the most unhappy person, and it will be her responsibility

The next year could be described as ""revenge"".

I kept isolating myself and abandoning all friends.

I was blaming her almost every week that she destroyed my life. I was shouting at her, throwing things at the wall. She is scared of me.

My eyesight went down again, and I realized that surgery was futile, and I ended up having just four years of clear vision, and I'll need to wear glasses again.

She was trying to help as much as she could, but I was too committed to my path.

She suggested we end this marriage, but I said that I can't leave without her and would kill myself, and she should bring everything back into the state that it was when we first met.

Now she is ready to do everything to help me, even let me date other women, but I feel that nothing can be done anymore.

She is putting so much effort, trying to help me, that I'm now feeling guilty that I can't fix anything.

I feel like I've ruined my life and am ruining hers now.

I'm remembering how I was shouting at her a month ago, and she wasn't listening and instead kept repeating one phrase: ""I want to be happy. I want to be happy. I want to be happy.""

I've never planned this relationship to hurt her. I was just trying to help.

# Nowadays

The time has passed, I'm now 28 and it is too late to have enjoyable life.

I've lost that motivation and excitement that I had when I first moved to New York.
I've spent three years destroying all I've built in the years before: health, social skills, confidence and motivation.
I don't want to spent several years rebuilding everything.
And even if I rebuild, what then? I don't know how to help her. And it will be too late for me to compensate for my missed youth.

Even if I date someone now, they wouldn't be as kind as she is.
I don't love them, they wouldn't care about me.
They wouldn't respect all the sacrifices that I've done for her, they would just see a man who is a failure.

Sometimes though I feel that both me and her have a ticking bomb: time to have children.
If we are to separate, we should do it rather sooner than later, so that both of us has enough time to rebuild our lives.

I'm hopeless and bitter and resentful.
I'm hating young people since for them the whole life is still ahead.
I'm hating people who have their first love at 18, since they incure much lower costs when it doesn't go well.
I'm hating people who have guilt-free love, since they didn't sacrifice their needs for it.
I'm hating this world since no one seems to care about me or her and no one can help us.
It is a bit paradoxical though, since in a way you may say that I'm more financially successful than 95% of population of the planet, but unfortunately it doesn't help.

I'm hating myself since I wanted to be a good person who loves everyone and not who I became.

When I see people who achieved less: waiters, Uber drivers, hairdressers - I feel uncomfortable and sorry for them, but at the same time I envy that they somehow managed to be more happy than me.

This just seem unfair, I had everything: talent, luck, and I tried to be a good person.
However both me and the person that I cared about are now miserable.

I am a United States citizen, and I have secured an internship in Germany for the summer.  The position will be paid hourly, and I am trying to figure out which taxes I must pay.  Initially, I was told that I would have to pay both German and US taxes; however, another contact I have told me about the US-German Tax Treaty to avoid double taxation.  I have tried to find information online, but have not had much luck finding clear answers.  As a student intern, would I be eligible for exemption from either German or US taxes?

Is there beauty in limerence?  If I could look through the eyes of a LO, would I find the limerent's feeling beautiful?  Could it be beautiful even if the feelings were not reciprocated?   

7 years ago, I met Ami (name altered) while I was a medicine intern. Ami's mother was a cancer patient with a poor prognosis who has been in our hospital for several weeks.  Ami had flown from across the country to be with her mother, who does not speak english.  During my first day on the service, I was warned by my colleague that Ami is very much involved in her mother's care.  Specifically, I was told to give Ami an update every morning since she wants to know all the detail of medical plan for each day.  I remember the first day when I met Ami and her mother (Mrs. X, my patient).  Ami mother was frail and had a look of vulnerability, both as a patient but also as a foreigner in a foreign place.  She would speak in a very soft voice in her native language and often not make eye contact when speaking to me.  Ami, on the other hand, was a force to be reckoned with.  From the very first day, she would set the tone by speaking firmly on behalf of her mother. She was a petite young woman in her late 20s or early 30's, but her voice commanded respect.  Her questions ranged from the minutia to pivotal, goal of care related topics.  She doesn't miss much - if I didn't have the answer, she would ask me to go check the labs and get back to her.  Our daily morning routine went something like this:

me: ""Good morning, Mrs. X.  Hi Ami. Mr.s X, how are you feeling today?"" (Ami would always spend the night in the patient's room with her mother). 
Ami: (after translating for her mother) ""she was OK last night.  She still has pain in her back.""  
Me: ""I see.  well, we can try to increase her pain medication tonight:
Ami: ""Dr. Y..."" (deliberately pausing for 2 seconds).  ""Do you think this is the right pain medication for her?  if she is still in pain, why would you give her the same medication?  shouldn't we try a different type of medication?)
Me: ""uh.. well, it's not a good idea to mix different type of pain medications.  Since the team had previously started this one, I thought we should stay with this one and increase the dose.""
Ami: ""Dr. Y.."" (pause again) ""I see.  Could you ask the team (i.e. my supervising attending) whether this is the right medication for her?""
Me:""umm.. sure.  I can do that.  We will round in the morning and I will get back to you.""

As a intern fresh out of med school, I felt so out of my league during the first few months of internship. From mundane tasks such as filling out discharge forms to making decisions about medications, everything was new to me and I didn't feel sure about anything.  I did (as we all did) my best to learn as much and as quickly as possible, but at times it still feels like I was not a real doctor.   I still recall every time Ami called to me, ""Dr. Y..."", it would send chills to my spine and make me wonder do I really have what it takes to take care of her mother.  Nevertheless, our daily routine continued for 4 weeks during my rotation. During this time, I learned that Ami is a litigation lawyer (gulp!) and that she is taking time off from work to be with her mother.  Her mother's condition was variable - some days worse than others.  Through it all, Ami never stopped being by her side.  She never stopped asking questions either.  I admit, many days I dreaded going into that room knowing that I don't have the answers.  I don't know if she is going to get better, or if this trial treatment is going to work or not.  More than anything, I dreaded being the person to deliver the same uncertainty that comes with being in a cancer ward.  I wondered if the family (Ami and her sister) also are dreading having an intern taking care of their mother?  Yet, with every question, Ami would still address me as ""Dr. Y..."", even as I stumbled at times to comfort them or provide insight into her mother's illness.  

During the last day of my rotation, we ordered a radiology study to examine her bones.  I told Ami that the results won't be ready until tomorrow, when I woudl've left this team.  I assured her that I will tell the next intern to get the results to her as soon as it's ready.  I smiled and said my goodbye to them.  I thanked them for letting me be a part of their care team. Ami then surprised me.  She asked that I give her the radiology report myself.  I was confused, but I said that I will look for the result and have the next intern give it to her.   She then looked me in the eyes and said, ""when the results ready, can you write to me?"" as she hands me a piece of paper with her personal email and phone number. I was dense.  I said, ""but the next intern will...""  Ami, cutting me off, then said ""even if it's not about the report, can you still write to me?""  As I looked up, i noticed just a trace of smile on her face right as she turned to walk away.  I then saw her older sister, who looked at me, then looekd at Ami, then smiled.  As I walked out the room, I gathered my thoughts as I realized I was just hit on.  Even a dense, overworked intern like myself couldn't miss this one.  I chuckled and smiled a little, but I didn't think too much about it. The next day, I told the incoming intern about Mrs. X, her daughters and their family dynamic, as well as the radiology report that was pending.  I don't remember if I didn't write to Ami personally becuase I felt it would be inapproriate, or if I was just too overwhelmed on my next clinical rotation.     

A couple years passed and I had completed my internship. I was now a senior resident in the hospital.  One day during rounds, i noticed a familiar name on my patient list, ""Mrs. X.""  I asked my intern if Mrs. X was who I thought she was. My new intern confirmed, and tells me that her family is very demanding.  ""You mean Ami?"", I asked almost instinctively. To which my intern replied yes and asked if I knew them.  Before walking into that room, I remmember thinking if they would recognize me, or if Ami would remember what happend that day several years ago. I have to admit, I was nervous and a little self-conscious.  When I first walked into that room, i immediately recognized Mrs. X.  She looked the same, but even more frail now.  She must've lost 20 lbs when I last saw her.  As my intern introduced the team, I surveyed the room and saw Ami sitting in the corner, just like she always did.  As we made eye contact, it was my turn to introduce myself as the senior resident.  Without knowing what they were thinking, I said "" Hello, Mrs. X, I am Dr. Y.  I met you and your family a couple years ago.  Do you remember me?"" Right then, I caught the smile from Ami again.  The same smile that I saw 2 years ago, with her lips just a little perched, and eyes just a little smaller.  Only this time, she smiled and then looked at her sister, who was smiling at her with the same expression as before.  After that smile, as the three of us made eye contact, I realized something.

That was the last time I saw Ami.  A couple years later, I learned that Mrs. X had passed away. I wondered if Ami was a little infatuated or even limerent with me, during the brief period when I was her mother's doctor.  I'd like to think it is because we made a genuine human connection. Even though she was tough in the way she spoke, I can sense her vulnerability beneath it all steming from the posibility of losing her mother. I like to think that we made a connection because she realized that we were both her mother's strongest advocate during those 4 weeks- she from the perspective of a caring daughter and I from the perspective of an eager intern. We were both scared, but we didn't let it stop us from caring for her mother.  However brief our connection lasted, it was human, and it was beautiful.  

I was not in love or limerent with Ami, but I admired her.  I admired her strength and her fierce determination to help her mother. Her courage inspired me as I learned to become a compassionate physician. I hope that in turn, as unsure or scared as I was as an intern, that I also helped her in some way.  When an infatuation stems from a genuine human connection, however unconventional or unrealistic in its long-term potential, it can still be beautiful when it blossoms.

I'm new to this subreddit but I'm here because I'm desperate and I need help on where to focus my efforts. I am looking for IT Project Management Internship for this summer. I am a third year student studing Information Technology.

I understand most companies are done with their recruiting by now but if anyone has any connects or ideas on where I can apply to, I would be greatful. 

This past summer's I interened under PM intern for a pretty well known silcon valley but due to some personal reasons I chose not to return to the company. I have strong customer services skills holding jobs as a support specialist and front desk stduent worker over the last two years. My most recent job has been working as a coding instructor and mentor with a non-profit organization in my community. 
My Skills: Java, SQL, Oracle, Jira, Scratch, HTML, Microsoft Excel, Asscess, Powerpoint &amp; Word

I would be interested in working almost any industry but I'm particularily interesed in entertainment or technology services industry. I am also very willing to relocate for the summer

I'm not sure what else to add but please message me if you have any ideas. Thanks"

They are as follows

Just to mention, I'm a beginner at machine learning.

Company 1: 
-Work is related to detecting pattern in wireless sensor data. 

-Would have to build models in Python (which I prefer) 

-Would be comparetivly easy and give me free time to pursue online courses in machine learning and math. (This is the biggest advantage for me, as I am weak at math and would have to use it a lot in my thesis).

-There would be no mentor, would have to do it all by myself (only the professor to guide me). (This is the biggest drawback, as they don't have an experienced ML engineer and no existing model I can work with).

Company 2
-Works with computer vision (which I don't know).

-Would have to implement algorithms in c++ (which I hear is hard as several algorithms have to be implemented from scratch).

-Would be hard cause I have no knowledge of computer vision, or good knowledge of machine learning and it won't give me time to pursue online courses to solidify my skills.(biggest drawback, as my math is weak and wouldn't give me time to brush up on it.)

-There would be an experienced ML engineer and a computer vision expert to guide me, and they have an existing product that I would be working on (biggest advantage, would give me a chance to learn a lot.)


My end goal is not to work in the field of computer vision. Just learn machine learning and be good at it. Which one should I go for? First company gives me time and flexibility to be better at ML and math myself but no professional guidance, and second one doesn't give me time and flexibility to be better at math but gives me a chance to learn from experts and work on an already existing system.

Please help me choose."

Title: I need your honest opinions about attitudes towards contractors

I realized ""work dynamics"" or ""politics at work"" far **late** (out:later) in my career. It's only because I'm a little slow on catching emotional things. Also I'd been very positive believing in good human nature. Even though I had some incidents where I was impacted by work politics, I considered them as personality conflicts, **not** (out:but) a group bullying. 

I learned work politics in a hard way. Recently I had some incidents and now I wonder whether I should treat contractors following the rule of work politics - brown nosing the power and ignoring the powerless.

1st case: 
When I was an intern, there was a full-time employee who hated me - she was recently hired and her work was a mess. I think she must have felt insecure about her job and considered me as a threat. She influenced other full timers about me. Around that time, our team had a contractor. In the first meeting with him, he was excessively praised me as a young, smart, talented person doing an internship. From the second meeting (I'm sure he must have heard something or sensed her), he treated me like a shit. As a contractor, he might need to brown nose her, a full timer, not me, an intern. 

2st case: 
I'm currently working as a full-timer at another company. At work, I'm politically in corner because another female employee doesn't like me (FYI, her work is a mess but she always pleases people in other ways). There are other female employees performing far better than me. However, since she and I are both singles and others are married, she seems targeting me (she is a type of person always comparing herself with someone else). 

In my project, we had a contractor team and they  were supposed to implement my work (full time-associate) and my partner's work (full time-manager). My partner's work had many things missing. The contractor tried to get those missing parts from my partner but she was evasive or almost mad at such requests, so the contractors couldn't get what they needed. Since my work and my partner's work were related, I tried to help them within my bandwidth. But now that I was nice (I cannot think anything other than this), the contractors steered their frustrations to me and started complaining about my work. It was preposterous to me. 

Then another full timer unnecessarily engaged and argued with the contractors on behalf of me. This full timer was usually against me when I worked in a group of other full timers. As I mentioned, I'm politically in corner at work, so she always voiced up against me. Her sudden attitude change looked even bizarre to me. Especially she didn't need to jump in the conversation at all. I gathered that she might find it as a good opportunity to get some good points from me, a full timer (more power) over contractors (powerless). 

3rd case: 
I talked about this contractor thing with my friend. He almost laughed at me pointing out that even contractors had challenged me, a full timer. He didn't tell me details but in his nuance, it seemed it was a known rule that contractors would not challenge full timers in general to keep their work.


So far I talked about 3 of my cases related to contractors. 

I'm very sick of work politics but I also learned that they are something I should learn to dance along to to survive at work. 

Do you think contractors are something like a second citizen at work and should be treated in that way? 
I think so, especially considering all the shit I went through after being nice to and supportive for the contractors. I regret I didn't act like my manager partner who was almost mad at them. 

Any thoughts?

My current rucksack is pretty old and I am looking to get a new one that will serve as many of my needs as possible: I am a student at university most of the time but will be wearing a suit every day during my work placement, want to carry a 15 inch laptop, notes, canteen etc. I have looked at a few threads on here but am not keen on the look of some of the more travel oriented bags but do like their functionality. So far my favourite bags are https://missionworkshop.com/collections/backpacks/products/the-sanction-vx-rucksack-backpack?variant=16740155781 and https://www.timbuk2.com/customizer#/product/29-custom-frame-pack/size/3/customize with the luxe trim.

I was wondering if anyone had recommendations for similar bags, I love the Mission Workshop one but it is a tad out of my price range. I don't mind spending a decent amount if it means I am getting a good product but I'd say the Timbuk2 bag already seems quite expensive to me.

My problem is that my university has no cooperation in these countries and I have difficulties finding a suitable college for Computer Science so every hint to a college would be appreciated.

And of course I want to be highly immersed with the arabic language rather than using English. Do you guys have any tips for this? Are there programs dedicated to language immersion?

I am a Shia Muslim and want to visit local Mosques regularly. Would that be a problem in some ares? And are there Shia mosques?

Any Help would be appreciated, thanks in advance!

EDIT: I would only do half a year abroad and this would mostly be covered by state funding. I also have the opportunity to do an internship abroad (also state-funded). Would that be better in your opinion to practice Arabic? "
8ayius,297,2018-04-09,“Not-so-Secret” Formula to Securing a NASA Internship (From a 2x NASA intern) [XPost from /r/engineeringstudents],kaixixx,nasa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/8ayius/notsosecret_formula_to_securing_a_nasa_internship/,"Hello everyone! I’m an aerospace engineering student and I’ve interned for NASA at two different centers (Armstrong and JPL). You definitely do not have to study aerospace engineering to work/intern at NASA. NASA is a great place to intern from my experiences so I wanted to give some tips that have personally worked for me in the past. While these tips worked for me at NASA, I’ll be these can also apply for any other big engineering company.

Landing a NASA internship is difficult. On top of the obvious advice everyone provides like have a high GPA, etc. there are more distinctive ways to stand out from the crowd. I know people who have sub 3.5 GPAs and still interned for NASA by doing the things listed below. The secret formula is a simple 3-step process:

KEYWORDS IN YOUR RESUME
Because so many people apply to every single position on OSSI (the website to apply for all NASA internships with the exception of JPL), the hiring managers automatically screen through the resumes using some sort of software. They look for “keywords” that they deem as necessary for the position. For example, if the job listing is for computational fluid dynamics, you probably want to include “computational fluid dynamics” or “CFD” somewhere on your resume. They also might look for soft skill words like “group” or “team.” You want to match as many words on the job description in your resume as possible without lying about any experience. This step is crucial because even if you have a lot of experience, if you don’t get past the computer screening, no one will even take a glance at your resume.

DON’T BE AFRAID TO REACH OUT
If you see a position online that has the hiring manager’s email, feel free to reach out to them with any questions you may have or even express your interest and ask them questions about what their work entails. (definitely don’t spam them begging for the job). I know this is hard since you probably don’t want to bother them but trust me, they put their email on there for a reason and the worst thing that can happen is that you don’t hear anything back. Reaching out not only expresses your interest, but also makes you stand out from the crowd since the hiring manager might remember your name and take a glance at your resume. At JPL, every other intern I’ve asked has said that they emailed their respective boss when they applied.

GET INVOLVED
This is kinda a given. Whether you do research with a professor, are a part of an engineering org, or do something completely unrelated to your major, just do something. You could have a 4.0 but without experience, not a lot of people will pick you from a group of people with lower GPAs but with more experience. Getting involved can mean joining any engineering org like FSAE, AIAA, DBF, etc. but the most important aspect is to actually be passionate and dedicated. I secured my JPL internship because I’m obtaining my high school teaching certificate in math/physics. I didn’t have to do any sort of crazy research or build rockets or anything of that sort although many other interns did.

I know the process is hard so if you have any further questions or just want to chat in general, feel free to dm me at

The navy blue suit fit perfectly to my body from a tailors on Madison Avenue, quite some trouble they had getting the shape of my shoulders and tightness of my waist *just* the way I like it. A bottle of scotch on my table, unopened, with a pile of paperwork on the other side. Monday was about to begin.

I had been drafted in as interim CEO for a dying advertising firm, the previous being fired for 'internal issues.' From my understanding, he was taking money off the top of the payments, ultimately causing his company to crash and burn. With my beard expertly shaven, and my sizable hands cracking in preparation, I got to work on the various forms and regulatory sheets that were needed to start pulling this place from the ashes. 

Located on the 34th floor of a Lexington Avenue skyscraper, my new office was a beauty. Modern decor, stunning view, expansive glass panel windows. Exactly what a CEO deserved. 

""*Sir, Miss Jayne is here to see you.*"" 

I place my finger on the intercom button, leaning in to the microphone. ""Alright, send her in. Thank you, Jessica.""

___________

A new CEO comes to save a dying company in Manhatten. However, he's hot as hell and surrounded by the most incredible working women the city has to offer. Standing 6'5"" with a body that was unmatched, it's possible that his work might not be 'clean' every day of the week.

Who are you? My secretary, an office employee, an intern, Miss Jayne, a client, my old boss, someone on the managing board?

Perhaps you could play them all in a series of sexually charged, lustful encounters with the new CEO.

Kinks: Rough sex, ***huge*** cocks, face fucking, voluptuous females, hair pulling, tight outfits, high heels/heeled boots, anal, oral, cock worship, muscle worship, revealing clothing, manhandling, male domination (not always needed, dependent on character pairing), seduction, charm, romance, cuddling, hair pulling, choking (giving), MFF+ Group scenarios.




***Kinks and characters can change on a scene by scene basis.***




Limits: Shit, piss, non sexual body fluids, children, incest, futa, tentacles, rimming, death during sex, monster sex, etc.


Hope to hear from you!"
8b01g4,1,2018-04-09,Should I ask for a raise?,chopperhead2011,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8b01g4/should_i_ask_for_a_raise/,"Some background:

I started my job as the equivalent of an intern, doing intern-level work. I was hired here from ITT-Tech before they were shut down. They liked me, so they kept me, albeit part time.  I started doing work that exceeded intern-level work a few months into the job.

I did ask to be hired full time or be given a raise a couple times. I also told my boss that, during my time in ITT, I was actually given another job offer by the president of the company the job was for, and I declined (not as a threat, but as evidence of my loyalty to the company.) My boss said ""yeah I'm working on getting you here full time. That will include benefits, and with that usually includes a bump in pay."" After about years of working part time, I was finally hired full time.

I was told that I need to work full time for 3 months before my benefits kick in. After the 3 months were up, I was informed that the time frame is actually a year. I need to work full time for a year before benefits kick in. This shocked me and all my friends and family, as they had never heard of such a long prerequisite time frame to qualify for benefits.

I will have worked here for 3 years when my benefits finally kick in.

So long story short, is any of this uncommon? I'm just afraid that the ""bump in pay"" will be another ""oops, we didn't really mean that"" situation like the ordeal with my benefits was. As a millennial, I don't want to come across as an entitled dick, but I feel I have proven my worth and loyalty to the company.

I should also mention that:

1. my boss is fucking awesome and that the wages and benefits of the people in my department are not his decision. I would bet money that if it was his decision, he would give me a raise without hesitation.

2. This job is my first real job with no connection to family, and I'm a very anxious and self-conscious person, so there's a TON about how things work that I just don't know. So sorry for the long post!!!"

(For those pursuing higher education).",MsCardeno,povertyfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8b0klk/i_was_a_third_generation_high_school_dropout_from/,"Step 1.) finish high school or get your G.E.D. I dropped out at 16 (as my sister did, my mom, my grandma and probably her mom). About 2 years of having no goals I had to change and took my sister and myself to take the damn test.

Step 2.) if you come from low income family most likely community college will be free for you. I maxed out Pell grants and it covered my tuition for the three years. I went for Communication.

Step 3.) get a serving job that has a bar. I was always a server in college. I worked about 25 hours a week and always made $500 a week. It’s fast money and it’s good physical activity. DO NOT settle for minimum wage paying cashier jobs. Restaurant work is tough but after 6 months it’s kind of fun! And I’ve always worked in corporate restaurants - the promotion to manager is usually pretty sweet. $50k starting and 2 weeks paid vacation. The hours suck but the people you work with are usually solid people and a good time. But it is a viable career option. You can then work your way up to general manager and they break 6 figures. I obviously didn’t do this - I stayed a server through school- but it was definitely a consideration for me. I mention it here as a career option bc many people don’t think of it.

Step 4.) use your degree or certificate! I transferred to a 4-year university and completed a degree in business (better for job prospects). I highly advised to please choose a relevant and demanded degree. And most importantly be passionate on what you want to do. My sister go a degree in social work and she has had no desire to look for a job for the two years we’ve been out of school. 

Step 5.) Leverage your network. Who do you know? Where do they work? Does the school hold job fairs? Go to it. Does your advisor know of internship opportunities? Talk to them. My gf’s dad worked at a big company and I asked him how I can get into their internship program.

Step 6.) research and practice interview skills. Really you have to. It helps so much. 

Step 7.) clean up the resume periodically and apply to internship after internship after internship. I only applied for paid internships. I interviewed in total about 8 internship places. My first internship was with my gf’s fathers company (not his division or office but for corporate - he sent me a link to apply) but it took me two years to get that position! The first year they said sorry and even tho I was devastated I gave it my all the next year and got it! My first internship, it was super competitive and they paid $20 an hour. I ended up taking the $65k starting offer with this company. My second internship was minimum wage but it was still amazing. I made it work. 

Note: if you need certain experience volunteering is a good way to get these skills on a resume. I joined an LGBT club in college where I was a PR officer - that looked great on my resume and it was relevant work experience 

Step 7.) review and update the resume again

Step 8.) keep applying to internships. If you are finished with school or about to graduate apply for full time positions. You may luck out and have an offer from where you interned. 

Step 8.) keep networking. At work and in your personal time. I went to a better position within my company within 1.5 years. 

I get that college is not for everyone but this is how I did it. I’m currently working on my MBA that work pays for. 

The most important takeaways here are the network and the effort. Keep applying. Even when you don’t know if you should apply. Apply. Every interview you go on makes you better for the next one. There were a lot of opportunities I didn’t get but I still very fortunate to the 3 that were life changing for me. 

I hope this helps someone. Keep applying!! If your not good at resume design you can buy nice, outstanding looking resume templates on Etsy! "

Ive been accepted to **Sapienza university in Italy** and **Mines Albi in France** for my masters program and am unable to decide. And i need some help.

In Sapienza, Ive been accepted to Space and astronautical engineering with maybe the possibility to change to aeronautical engg. Ive heard that Italy is not a good place to find jobs for aerospace and that France is much much better. While i do agree with that,

1) The coursework in Sapienza is much more preferable to me.

2) The course is much cheaper here and probably ill get out without any debt unlike  in France where ill have around 15-20k Euro of debt.

3) Ranking/prestige is much much more.

Looking at these factors I would prefer sapienza. But my primary interest is how easy it would to find a job afterwards. Im expecting to do fairly ok at least and maybe better too. 

**Is there a good job market in Rome,Italy? **

And also if anybody knows, **does Sapienza have good industrial connections for internships and/or job networking?**

Im also on waiting list at Linkoping Uni in Sweden with a pretty decent chance of getting in.

Same question. Is job situation good there??

Please help **ASAP** cause  ill have to accept the offer within 10 days max.

It's frustrating because in the moment, it seems like the only option, but soon afterwards I regret my actions and wish I would have opened up. It makes him frustrated and he says he never knows what's going on in my head, but to me, it seems so obvious that I have no idea why he can't figure out what's wrong. It's causing a huge block in our relationship.

To make matters worse, I'm about to leave for a 7-month internship 1,000 miles away in June, so we'll only be able to see each other when he comes to visit. I want to feel like we have a secure relationship before I leave so we can work through going long-distance, but at the same time, I don't want to keep bringing up our ""problems"" and my ""emotions"" because I feel like I'm bugging him and causing conflict, even if he doesn't seem like it bothers him. In the past, when I've brought up how I feel, he just says I'm being crazy. He doesn't seem to understand that even if I realize that what I'm feeling is not rational, it's still what I feel.

What should I do?!

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

8b1a5x,12,2018-04-09,Jr. copywriter looking to dip. How do?,hold_my_pabst,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/8b1a5x/jr_copywriter_looking_to_dip_how_do/,"Hey /r/advertising. 

I'm sort of at a crossroads. Y'all helped me out a lot when I was an out-of-work intern, so hoping you guys can offer some great insight/advice towards my next step, as I've yet to find a readily-available mentor.

I'm a jr. copywriter at a big-name Canadian agency looking to jump ship. Lucked into my second internship here and loved it; got hired after and still here a year-and-a-half later, but loving it...much less. Lots of creatives have left, the vibe has turned pretty somber/
corporate-y, and there's been some major leadership changes since (including the CDs who hired me). 

Most importantly, while we've both tried, there's zero creative chemistry between my partner and I. I'm also leery of asking for a new partner, because a senior writer went 7 months solo before they hired his replacement AD. 

The work is still decent-ish, and I've wrung a handful of produced (though nowhere near award-winning) pieces for big clients from my time here, but overall looking for a change. There's a lot of advice on this sub for landing an internship, but not another job, so a few questions I was hoping to get answered:

1. At ~2 years into the game, should I be looking for intermediate gigs?
2. I've built up a decent network from my internship hunt. Should I be messaging CDs directly and straight-up asking for a job, or a ""chat""?
3. I'd like to work abroad someday. Is it important to keep to big-name multinationals then?
4. Sadly haven't won an award yet. Does this affect my chances at getting into another large agency?
5. Are recruiters useful at this stage in my career?


Any help or additional advice muchly appreciated. Spanks, y'all. &lt;3

8b1u05,1,2018-04-09,Review of Lexapro after 4 months,lexa-Pro,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8b1u05/review_of_lexapro_after_4_months/,"I figured I would give an honest review of Lexapro since it has helped my anxiety. I suffer from other co-morbidities as well (ADHD, Trichotillomania, Ulcerative Colitis, etc.) and couldn't find much on this sub regarding how Lexapro may affect them so I will discuss those as well. If you don't care for the back story you can just skip down to the bottom where I talk about how the lexapro has affected my specific conditions. 

**Childhood:** As a young child I was very hyperactive and all over the place. In school, I was constantly getting in trouble for talking while the teacher was talking, swearing, and doing stupid things. Outside of school I was very active in sports and was always outside playing in the summer months, but this did nothing to calm my hyperactivity. It came to a point where in 3rd grade my parents met with a school social worker and my teacher, the social worker/teacher told my parents I should probably be tested for ADHD as I am constantly disruptive in class. My dad who is foreign and old school absolutely refused to have me tested because he figured if I tested positive for ADHD that it would be an opening to force meds on me. The disruptiveness and talkativeness went on until about middle school. At this time I stopped being so disruptive because I was absolutely terrified to be publically shamed and have the spotlight on me. This fear did not go away once I left a classroom though, I was always terrified of talking to people I was not familiar with, standing in checkout lines in grocery stores, going out on the weekend with friends. It wasn't until my last year of college that I realized I most likely had social anxiety. It is also clear now that I probably suffered from generalized anxiety as well. In 9th grade I remember that I began to twist and twirl my bangs (to the point where I was pulling hair out) when I was home from school. I would never realize I did it until 20 minutes after I started doing or unless my dad or sister would yell at me to stop if they saw me. Eventually, I stopped twisting my bangs and started twisting the hair on the top/back of my head. I now have a small bald spot from where I would occasionally twist. Apart from the hair twisting I also suffered periods of depression where at least once a month I felt like committing suicide for a couple days. This was usually precipitated by getting a bad grade in school or feeling like I messed up in some social interaction. Also regarding the anxiety, I found it VERY hard to eat food in public from when I was in 12th grade until junior year of college. If I tried to eat food in front of people I would immediately feel sick and gag. Till this day I don't know if it was caused by the GAD or social anxiety.  Lastly, I was just recently diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis about two months ago. I don't think the UC has really made any of my mental disorders worse, but I know for a fact that my anxiety used to exacerbate the hell out of my UC. 

**Senior Year of college:** As I stated earlier I had suffered from suicidal Ideation ever since 10th grade. From the time I entered college to my senior year it began to slowly worsen. The summer going into my senior year I did an internship. Near the end of the internship, I found out that some (almost all) of the interns were offered jobs at the company for when we officially graduated in a year. I was not one of them and it absolutely devasted me. I crashed hard and thought about suicide almost every day for the next 2-3 weeks (basically the rest of the summer). I knew that if I did not get help soon that I would probably do something to myself. Eventually (5 months ago) I booked an appointment with a therapist at my college because my suicidal Ideation was getting worse and worse. During my first meeting with the therapist I told her pretty much most of what I said above and also discussed with her events that had happened in the weeks leading up to seeing her that worsened my SI. She told me that she suspects I suffer from ADHD, anxiety and possibly depression. About 2 weeks later I met with a Nurse practitioner who gave me the choice to try stims to see if the ADHD is what was causing the anxiety, or an SSRI to see if they were separate issues. I decided to try stims because I knew I most likely struggled with ADHD my whole life. I eventually stopped stims because I hated the side effects and they made my anxiety worse at the time. Next, the practitioner put me on Zoloft 50 mg and it gave me horrible diarrhea and GI upset so I stopped it. I figured I would give one more go and I was put on lexapro 5 mg. It worked, but not enough, so It was upped to 10 mg and I now feel great. 

**Current med regimen:** 
- Lexapro 10 mg a day, Remeron 7.5 mg at night (started a month ago for sleep), Strattera 40 mg a day (just recently started for ADHD), Mesalamine 4.8 grams a day (Ulcerative colitis)

**Before/After comparison of disorders:**

Social Anxiety: Absolutely amazing. I don't think Lexapro is a first line SSRI for treating social anxiety but It has done wonders for me. I used to look forward to going out all week and then when the weekend arrived I would lay in bed all day nervous as hell to go out with my friends. This is not the case anymore. I also used to be terrified of being around/talking to unfamiliar people and being in large crowds but that has gone away as well. 

Generalized Anxiety. Not as much of a difference as with the Social Anxiety but It is still much better. It used to be hard for me to start school work at times because I would have the idea that I was going to produce something sub-par, so I would wait untill the last minute to do it anyway. This has changed. I now find it much easier to start work earlier on. 

ADHD: The lexapro has hardly touched this but that is expected. I am still very easily distracted and inatentive in my classed. I have found that it helped my motivation a little though. I used to find it incredibly hard to even get out of bed and be motivated to do anything (could be anxiety or ADHD but I'm guessing its more the ADHD) but now It is much easier to get up and get going (still a struggle at times but much better). I also used to be very impulsive and do a lot of online shopping, this has also decreased quite a bit. 

Suicidal Ideation: Once again the Lexapro did wonders for this and along with the decrease in social anxiety is is the reason I know the lexapro worked. I went from thinking about suicide every 3 weeks to thinking about it maybe 2 times in the past 4 months. I rarely ever have periods where I feel depressed now and If I do they do not last more than a couple hours. 

Trichotillomania: The lexapro has also helped this. I used to go home and twist/pull my hair every day, now I do it maybe like 1 or 2 days a week. It usually is only bad during periods of heightened anxiety like before a test or when I'm approaching a big deadline.

Ulcerative Colitis: The lexapro has not directly affected this (expected) but in calming my anxiety the drug has also indirectly lessened the severity of the colitis. The big take away here is that the lexapro gave me virtually ZERO intestinal upset, even though SSRI's are known for GI upset given the large amount of serotonin receptors in your gut. In comparison, the Zoloft had me running to the bathroom at least 2 times every hour for half a day when I tried it. 


**Summary:** I would wholeheartedly recommend Lexapro to anyone who has anxiety along with any of these other conditions (especially the Colitis). It has greatly helped my anxiety and has not given me any GI distress, even though I already have a GI condition (like the Zoloft did and many other SSRI's are known to do). The only negative effects I suffered from the Lexapro were decreased libido and lightheadedness (disappeared after about 3 weeks)"

For some, my questions may seem to be obvious, but I'm a complete noob in VR technologies, looking for any advises. 

I'm doing an internship in neuroscience lab, which is doing experiments on spatial cognition of animals (fruit-flies, zebra-fishes and mice). For now I've been working only with the outcomes of the set-up we've got, but now I need to go deeper into the ""technical"" part of experiments we do.

Maybe some of you heard about FreemoVR (https://strawlab.org/freemovr), this is a custom made VR arena for animals, which consists of two parts: custom engine which generates and projects virtual environment on screens, and the “tracking part” (input device), which with the help of 10 high-speed cameras tracks an animal and sends its positioning to the engine.

For now the engine is not really user-friendly, so my goal is to find another engine (Unity, UE, etc.), with which a non-experienced in programming and engineering scientist could work. 
The main question for me now, among all others, is whether these engines (Unity, Unreal, or any other) could work properly with such an unusual input device? 

Very roughly and simply speaking the goal is to create a simple virtual environment (like an arena with some obstacles in it), project it on the walls of a small room, put a fly there, track its positioning with high-speed cameras, and the projection of the created environment must change accordingly to the positioning and the direction of movement of the fly in real-time. (I know this description looks really silly, sorry for that)
Any ideas and advices are very welcome, please share your opinion. Even most obvious and simple help is very appreciated. I just don’t really know where to start.

# Elementary school (7)

I was growing up in a messed up family: painful divorce, violence, poverty, and a shitty country in Eastern Europe.

Was always rejected and bullied by peers, from kindergarden to school - either because something was wrong with me, or because I was poor, or because I was smart.

It did not help that I've changed a dozen of schools over lifetime due to family reasons. In each school I was a new student, so it was harder to build friendships.

I was lucky (or not) though that I happened to be smart. Studying was easy (except when social awkwardness got in the way - i.e. when you need to write essay on how you spent your summer).

Perhaps it is fair to say that I was smarter than 99% of peers. Or maybe even 99.9%.

However being smart doesn't help with respect from classmates, or self-respect. Wearing glasses didn't help either.

Being always bullied and humiliated, I quickly internalized the belief that I'm just worst than most people, and there is no way anyone can like me.

# High school (12)

It got somewhat better at the age of 15, when classmates became more civilized, and some of the worst offenders just dropped off.

However, I kept seeing myself as a failure, despite winning regional and national competitions on many sciences.

It felt that I might be good at science, but there is something disgusting about me, so nobody can value me as a person or enjoy my company.

At that time I was angry at people who were more socially successful than me.

Having friends, going to parties, dating seemed like something from the other world, for _normal_ people, but not for me.

Hence I didn't bother taking care of my looks, maintaining personal hygiene, or even planning my life at all.

I was just escaping in books and fantasies.

One view on the problem was (though I'm not sure I quite believed it) that I'm not worse than all of the peers, I'm just too smart for them, and the life will make things fair... maybe.

I was angry at girls that were dating other classmates, and not myself.

I was even fantasizing how due to some magical skill I would be able to force all of them to have sex with me. I didn't consider their feelings at all, not because I felt privileged, but rather because I felt that their life is already so much better than mine, that it just would be justice.

Eventually - without much effort - I finished school with distinction, and family sent me to a college.

# College (17)

Peers at the college were much more intelligent than classmates from high school (most of those didn't go to college at all).

However, I got used to hating myself and not trusting anyone, that I pretty much was isolating myself and not building connections, and only slowly improving on that over years.

I wasn't hateful towards the world by then though, since I realized that nobody wants to hurt me now, it is just a matter of resolving my own problems.

As an example, when a classmate was diagnosed with cancer, and her friend was collecting money for the surgery, I gave her half of my savings from three-months internship.
I didn't do it because I was close to her or hoped for some reciprocity, I barely knew her.
I just was thinking that she is capable of enjoying this life, so she deserves to live more than me.
It was very embarassing to do so, as I imagined that everyone would be disgusted by me and would laugh at me, however it went fine.
She did return most of it though, saying that she can't accept such a big contribution.

I was confused as to why this happened, and asked advice on some anonymous forum.
Internet people told that this is because I am an ""omega male"", and it would be repulsive to accept big contribution from me.

By the end of college, I started being more open, confident, and finally started taking life into my own hands and thinking what I can do to improve it.

Though still I knew that I need to close the gap between the ""public"" self that was demonstrating that I'm just fine,
and am only disappointed by the stupidity of people around me, and the ""private"" self who was concerned that I'm a monster that nobody can ever love or even like.

# Adult life (23)

After graduation, it became clear to me that I am finally valued.

I was able to work by doing what I enjoy (tech), while at the same time being paid good money, which made me feel hopeful for better life.

I noticed though, that my defense mechanism ""I'm being rejected because everyone around is stupid and I'm too smart for them"" wasn't working anymore.

Now everyone around was smart, but at the same time socially skilled, so I felt that I do have a problem that needs solving if I ever want to enjoy being with people.

Now that I was making money though, I felt I have levers to improve my life.

I've read about autism and the spectrum (trying to understand what's wrong with me) and about PUA sphere (since they promised solution to the most complex social interaction: dating).

I've switched jobs several times, found the one that I truly enjoy, and the one that was helping me grow. Moved to New York.

My plan on improving the life (when I was 23) was as following:

 - Since I got my chance getting out of shit, I must not waste it.
   - I must never relax (as people who had simple childhood may do) and must keep working on improving myself.
   - I must not do things because ""this is how I always have done it"", I must always be open to improvement.
 - Now I have lots of money, and also I'm smarter than other people.
 - I need to continue improving my intellect and professional skills since it is my ticket to happy life
 - I need to funnel money and intellect to ""fix"" the areas where I'm worse than others:
   - Hire doctors to fix all my health problems that accumulated over the time of neglecting myself
   - Maintain a healhy lifestyle. Start picking up hobbies that would involve physical activities and also would make me more interesting.
   - Use PUA resources to learn how to be neat, attractive and take care of myself. Date women, have sex, and use it to fix self-esteem problems.
   - Hire a therapist to figure out what is really wrong with me (since self-diagnoses might be misleading).
   - After learning how to communicate with people, continue improving. Don't stop. I don't want to go back to miserable life.
   - Having learned how to build connections with people, build many connections, have many deep conversations, learn how people lived their childhoods, what they were feeling, what they were dreaming of, how they live and organize their lives now, what they are trying to do in their lives. Basically learn everything about other humans, so that I can stop being an alien and successfully integrate. After that, reiterate on my life plans and understand what I want to achieve by the age of 30, 40, etc.
   - Never stop practicing social skills. Make sure I am popular, have many close friends, and can easily get more. I don't want to go back to my previous life of outcast.
   - While I'm young, make sure I can learn how to get sex, finally fulfill everything that I've been denied in high school and college. After that find a smart (unlike people who I was growing up with) and successful woman and build a relationship with her. This way I could stop being bitter and resentful about my younger years, since I would've found truly good partner (unlike my classmates).
   
I started executing the plan and was quite successful in it.

I had eye surgery to become a normal person that doesn't need eyeglasses.
It was amazing to see the world in great details and instead of looking at the ground, look all around yourself when walking.
All the buildings are beautiful.

I started going to a gym.

I had energy of moving to new country, feeling successful, feeling valued.

Started making friends, hobbies, started being more open and showing my emotions, started participating in social events. I was living according to the principle ""never say no"" and was signing up for every opportunity to do social activity. I was growing both professionally and socially.

When I talked to my ex-peers from university, they were admiring how much I achieved so quickly, and were saying that talking to me is always so inspirational.

Those were absolutely best years of my life.

I've also read about feminists around that time. I liked them. Not because I clearly understood their goals or empathized (it is hard to empathize to someone who you perceive more successful than yourself), but because they seemed modern, progressive, and smart. I liked the idea of having a partner who is equal and has professional achievements rather than just spends time in a kitchen or shopping. I also felt some affinity, since both me and them were oppressed but managed to become successful.

After a year of big self-improvement I felt confident enough to go take a short PUA training to understand at least the first step: how to meet someone.

I didn't care about what to do next, since the first step was about fixing self-esteem, and busting the fear of rejection. After meeting someone and validating myself, I would have new emotions and information to process, and would be able to think what to do next.

I went through the training (really short), made a few approaches, wasn't rejected, had some warm conversations, even a date.
Didn't get sex, but that didn't matter.
What mattered at that moment, was that I was finally realizing that the fear is almost gone, and I can be interesting to other people (those people were way below my league - but I needed to start from something).
A little bit more practice, and I'd be able to feel ""normal"".

And then the next week I met Her.

# Her (24)

She (F23) was from the same country as me, visiting New York for a holiday, and looked like a person who is very emotional, positive, and kind.

I (M24) overcame my fear and approached her.

We talked several hours, and agreed to meet again the next day.

She wasn't particularly smart or successful, but at this moment what mattered for me were emotions.
She was the first person to smile at me in my life.

Over the next week we've been seeing each other every day.

I showed her the city, she was very happy, I was happy to see that someone can enjoy time with me.

I told her that it was my first time talking to a girl and she was very supportive.

I felt that I met an angel (though rational part of me knew that this is probably how all women or even humans are, and I'm just too excited because it is my first emotional contact).

I awkwardly suggested having sex, and she said she can't do it with a person who she knows for so little time.
I was perfectly okay with that, she already had done a lot for me.

I realized I want to make sure I never hurt her.
How could I hurt a person who changed my life so much and was so kind when I was afraid.
She was the first person who had ever been so kind to me.

I tried to make the remaining days of her visit as good as I could.

---

After she came back home, I didn't plan to continue this relationship.
We were too different, long-distance relationship is hard, and I didn't need a relationship anyway, I needed more practice!

However she called back the next day, and wanted to talk. That was strange, but I though some practice of phone conversations would hurt.

We talked almost every day. It was nice to hear her voice, and hear that she enjoyed time with me, but we didn't really have any shared interests.

She was much less educated, didn't share my passion for knowledge, barely spoke English, and wasn't inspiring.

She wasn't progressive, she was very traditional - wanted big family, husband, and children.
She thought that feminist women are just unhappy unsatisfied women, ""otherwise they wouldn't fight for something"".

In my mind she was just a very kind person who I was very grateful, but nothing more.

I was also conscious whether she is just trying to use me, or to make a family with me because of my financial stability (I was making $200k and living by myself in the best city in the world, and she was making $15k and was living in some shit town with her parents).

I cared about her, but I still wasn't quite trusting anyone, and didn't want to sacrifice all my plans to live boring and regretful life with a person who is not interesting to me.

A few weeks later she suggested she'd love to go on some sea trip with me. This was tempting. I booked us a tour to some tropical island.

Since I was paying for both of us, I felt somewhat uncomfortable that either she is using me, or I'm buying her.

However, I made my mind that:

 - Regardless of her intentions, I don't mind paying for that since for me it is a very valuable experience
 - I will not do anything to make her feel sexually obliged to me that I paid for the trip, since I don't want to take advantage or make her feel uncomfortable.
 - I also promise myself that we don't continue anything after that trip. In that case everything will end up fair regardless of her real plans. If she sincerely enjoys spending time with me, she will've spent a good time. If she is pretending that she likes me in order to marry me, then she won't get what she wants.

---

We went to the island and had a good time. She was very kind and caring. I was disappointed by her being not as smart as people I'm used to spend time with, but was still very grateful.

I asked about her previous relationships and she told me how people have hurt her before.

I decided I have to find a way to end this relationship without hurting her.

However the whole situation was becoming scary, since it seemed that she was seeing it as a beginning of long term relationship.

Anyway, the vacation was great. I've never enjoyed travel as much as then.

---

I became deeply concerned about her future. That was new. I've never cared about anyone that much in my life.

If for me, my exceptional intellect was giving me a ticket to a successful and interesting life, she was an average person. Maybe even below average.

I tried to imagine what it is to be a below-average person and live in her town - and it seemed unbearable to me.

She also was very emotional about how happy she is with me, and I just couldn't take it away, especially after I've shown her a better life.

Besides, nobody had been so kind to me in my life.

_(She was so happy with me because she fell in love, and not because of opportunities I was opening, but I didn't understand it back then)_

I felt that my moral obligation is to marry her and give her the happiness and everything that I have, instead of caring about my life goals.

I felt very guilty thinking that I just used her for sex, and accidentally have shown her a better life, and would take it away, potentially making her regret it for many years.
I knew she would never be as successful as I was.

_(In retrospective, I didn't really understand what she feels and wants (due lack of empathy), I just was just imagining what I would've felt on her place.)_

We met each other a few more times, traveling back and forth.

Once she said that she wants to be with me forever - that was horrifying to hear.

I tried to ask her if I can somehow improve her life apart from the relationship. She helped me move forward in my life significantly, and I wanted to do something big for her. But she didn't really have any speficic life plans, and was focused only on us being together.

Once I tried to ask here what she likes and doesn't like about me (hoping to see if she likes some personality qualities, or maybe can encourage me to improve on something), and she said that she likes everything. This is sweet, but it is not personal.
I didn't get to see why exactly she wants me and not someone else.

I tried to explain to her the dilemma that I'm facing, saying that at this moment of life,
the quality of partner that I'm with is a way how I improve my self-esteem, and being with
her will make me feel like a failure, hoping she'd set me free of the obligation.
I felt like shit saying those words.
After she started crying, I just had to take it all back and say that I will not leave her.

---

Next several months were mix of tenderness and care about each other, and tears due to this conflict of interest.
There were times when she was saying that I don't have to stay with her and can leave and live my own life, but I heard it as self-sacrifice from her side, and couldn't let myself do it.
She was the person I cared for most in my life, and I couldn't start building my own life at the expense of hers.

Desperate, I tried to talk about it to some friends, they were saying that I should end all of this, but I couldn't let myself do it.

She was still my first sex partner, but I couldn't take advantage of it.
I felt that if we are now in an unequal relationship, she is so dependent on me, then asking her for sex would be not nice, since I'm in a position of power, and she would be obliged to agree fearing that I'll leave.
I didn't want to make her do anything.

Additionally, since she wasn't intellectually stimulating, I felt uncomfortable wanting sex with her, since it would mean that I'd be treating her just like piece of meat.

From our conversations I understood, she really wants to be desired and valued and it hurts her to see that I'm looking down at her.

---

Eventually, I decided (probably the worst decision of my life):

 - I have to marry her. I can't get away with having used her and then proceeding to my awesome life while leaving her suffering.
 - Since she is not interesting to me, I'm at risk of leaving her for someone else.
 - All of my life plans contradict this marriage, so it'll be hard to maintain my commitment.
 - So if I want to ensure I don't back off, I need to take advantage of my weaknesses, reverse everything that I've achieved and abandon all plans:
   - Stop dreaming about being successful with women. This is not allowed anymore.
   - I need to stop making friends, since they would be smarter and more interesting than her, and I don't want her to look bad.
   - I need to destroy my self-confidence, so that I switch into the mode ""I'll never find anyone, so I value, worship and adore you"".
   - Stop improving social skills
   - Stop taking care of myself (hygiene and health)
   - Stop improving career
   - Stop enjoying my work (otherwise I can get distracted by work which I truly enjoy and stop caring about her)
   - Stop having clear view on my life plans or any motivation to plan my life
   - Stop being curious and learning
   - Just stop improving myself - I'm already too much ahead of her, I don't want the gap to increase
   - I must not honestly ask myself a question ""what do I want in my life"", since the answer must be predetermined: ""family and kids""
   - ...and then I will really become the kind of person who _needs_ her as I won't have anything else in life than her.
 - After I abandon all my life plans, my life will be meaningless, and I won't be the determined person that I used to be.
  - However, she is so happy with me, that she probably won't notice. Even broken version of me still can earn enough to support her and kids.
  - It may be that this whole thing will become too unbearable to me, and I'll have to end my life. In that case she'd at least get pretty big insurance payment from my employer. Besides, that would be not my problem anymore.

Thus my path of self-destruction began.

I went to a shop and bought a diamond ring, since I knew she is an ordinary person that cares about these traditions (in fact it is a conspiracy by De Beers but she wouldn't understand it).
But I couldn't make myself to propose.

Six months later, I've conditioned myself enough to feel terrible without her.
I stopped being passionate about my work, stopped taking parts in all social events, stopped talking to everyone, stop taking care of myself, stopped watching movies.
I was coming home every evening, feeling like shit, and calling her, and she was saying ""Everything is going to be great, life is amazing"", and was making me feel a bit better, even though I knew life is not going to be great.

I realized, if the only quality that she has is kindness, I have to make sure I _need_ her kindness and care, so I must be pessimistic and suffering.

# Marriage (25)

Then I proposed to her. She asked ""are you sure?"", but she didn't seem to understand the sacrifice that I was making, and I didn't want to make her understand it.

We married next month (she was taking care of all the arrangements).

I felt like I'm getting trapped and my life is over.

In our first night after marriage we talked a lot and I was telling her how I feel, and she was saying that I must not destroy myself, but I was too fixated on my obligation.

She said that if I don't improve the situation in a year, she'll have to leave me so that I'm free to explore all my opportunities again.

I said that this is not an option, since I _must_ be with her forever.

A few months of living together, we had a lot of crying, she even started having panic attacks from all the stress.

Some time later, I decided that what's happening isn't good for either of us, and tried to get back to normal life.
In order to gain some motivation, and recover self-esteem I tried to travel the world, while doing this I dated someone else, and had sex.
However my wife found out (since I can't lie), and was hysterically crying for many hours.

I felt guilty, but at the same time angry (doesn't she understand that I was trying to fix our messed up situation), so I decided the following:

 - OK she wants me to be faithful, despite my needs
 - I'll be faithful, by I won't try to fix anything anymore, and will be the most unhappy person, and it will be her responsibility

The next year could be described as ""revenge"".

I kept isolating myself and abandoning all friends.

I was blaming her almost every week that she destroyed my life. I was shouting at her, throwing things at the wall. She is scared of me.

My eyesight went down again, and I realized that surgery was futile, and I ended up having just four years of clear vision, and I'll need to wear glasses again.

She was trying to help as much as she could, but I was too committed to my path.

She suggested we end this marriage, but I said that I can't leave without her and would kill myself, and she should bring everything back into the state that it was when we first met.

Now she is ready to do everything to help me, even let me date other women, but I feel that nothing can be done anymore.

She is putting so much effort, trying to help me, that I'm now feeling guilty that I can't fix anything.

I feel like I've ruined my life and am ruining hers now.

I'm remembering how I was shouting at her a month ago, and she wasn't listening and instead kept repeating one phrase: ""I want to be happy. I want to be happy. I want to be happy.""

I've never planned this relationship to hurt her. I was just trying to help.

# Nowadays

The time has passed, I'm now 28 and it is too late to have enjoyable life.

I've lost that motivation and excitement that I had when I first moved to New York.
I've spent three years destroying all I've built in the years before: health, social skills, confidence and motivation.
I don't want to spent several years rebuilding everything.
And even if I rebuild, what then? I don't know how to help her. And it will be too late for me to compensate for my missed youth.

Even if I date someone now, they wouldn't be as kind as she is.
I don't love them, they wouldn't care about me.
They wouldn't respect all the sacrifices that I've done for her, they would just see a man who is a failure.

Sometimes though I feel that both me and her have a ticking bomb: time to have children.
If we are to separate, we should do it rather sooner than later, so that both of us has enough time to rebuild our lives.

I'm hopeless and bitter and resentful.
I'm hating young people since for them the whole life is still ahead.
I'm hating people who have their first love at 18, since they incure much lower costs when it doesn't go well.
I'm hating people who have guilt-free love, since they didn't sacrifice their needs for it.
I'm hating this world since no one seems to care about me or her and no one can help us.
It is a bit paradoxical though, since in a way you may say that I'm more financially successful than 95% of population of the planet, but unfortunately it doesn't help.

I'm hating myself since I wanted to be a good person who loves everyone and not who I became.

When I see people who achieved less: waiters, Uber drivers, hairdressers - I feel uncomfortable and sorry for them, but at the same time I envy that they somehow managed to be more happy than me.

This just seem unfair, I had everything: talent, luck, effort, and I tried to be a good person.
However both me and the person that I cared about are miserable at the end.

8b2os7,14,2018-04-09,I hate my attractive friend,collegesucks1314,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/8b2os7/i_hate_my_attractive_friend/,"I hate my attractive best friend. 

It started back in preschool when we meant in ballet class. Here we were, two little girls learning the art of ballet until it became clear that the instructor preferred Felicity*. But I mean who wouldn't? She was this pretty brunette who got the best features of her caucasian and asian parent so she was scientifically more attractive than me... But at the time we didn't know it because were just two preschool ballerinas.

Years go by and it's eighth grade and we are competing for the same role because everyone knows we are equally as good. But she is Clara in the Nutcracker and I'm a background dancer. She did her dance so perfectly and I bowed too early and messed it all up. She got so many letters in the program and flowers and I only got one from my parents... In the end, the director said it was because I wasn't attractive enough.

So I gave up ballet and I really gave up everything to be honest while Felicity went to achieve everything I dreamed of. In high school she had to join a sport and tried gymnastics, and despite having no experience she managed to go to districts all four years and states her senior year. She went to states all four years for speech and debate and nationals her junior &amp; senior year. She was teen of the year in our local newspaper and senior class president and made summa cum laude (ranking 3rd in our class). Meanwhile I kept eating. I mean I literally kept going to food for my comfort and sat at home a lot. While her snapchat stories showed her having fun on Friday nights I was sitting at home eating ice cream. By my senior year I was 250 pounds and struggled to get up my stairs.

When college rolled around she went to Dartmouth and I stayed at a community college because my GPA sucked so much. I learned that least summer she got an internship working in the genetics department at Harvard Medical and she just announced that this summer she's interning at Stanford. 

yet, when i'm around her so makes me feel so much better because she's an overall great person and I really see her as my best friend because she's the only one that has stayed around through all my pain yet she's the one that's causing it."

I’ll be out of the country and she has an internship out of town. She needs a place to stay for those 10 weeks and told me that she might stay with a family friend who she knows from high school, due to the fact that it would save a lot of money. He is around my age and isn’t a bad looking guy.

We have a great relationship and give each other lots of freedom. However, I can’t help but feel jealous of the fact that she will be living with another man for 10 weeks, even if he is just a family friend. **Should I discuss my concerns with her, or just stifle my jealousy?**

Part of me feels like her living with another man (for any modest amount of time) is in some ways crossing a line. However, she told me readily and it did not seem to bother her. I am concerned that showing my jealousy may be off-putting, as it might send the message that I don’t trust her, or that I am insecure in our relationship.

Anywho, so I got into both schools with the relatively the same amount of scholarship money. However, I'm trying to decide which one is the best for me. Ideally I want to live in a southern state such as FL, GA, or TX after graduating. 

However what has me torn is that although LSU is more well-known, they have less opportunities for someone who wants to practice outside of Louisiana and even securing an internship in the Baton Rouge area because of its limitations as a city. Stetson on the other hand is in the heart of Tampa and has internships with those various counties. But it would be harder to find a career outside of FL.

LS;DR where do I go? Both have upsides and limitations.

And this is a huge reason there is such a divide in our country.  80k in one place let’s you live better than someone making 160k somewhere else.  Personally I’d love to live in a more rural area like Idaho.  Can you find a programming job there though?  People read online that someone is making 160k and assume they’re just being ungrateful, but in big cities they’re often living worse lifestyles because housing is so expensive. I have a friend that makes more than I do and can’t afford his apartment without 3 additional roommates.  It’s not a 4 bedroom apartment.  

So while people from other areas might think my salary is decent, around here I’m very much on the low end and can barely afford my 1300/mo (not including utilities) 1970s ranch style rental with 1300 finished sq ft.  This is outside town limits and I commute 40-50 min to work every day.  I also pay much less than people around me because I found an awesome guy on Craigslist that bought a property when he retired for the passive income and he hasn’t raised my rent ever.  Unfortunately though he’s basically a unicorn.  

This is the reason cost of living is such factor in salary.  I actually got my job because I replaced someone in an area they had to pay a lot more.  

I do have a question though, is 80k/yr hard to get in Idaho?  That’s about the starting salary for an average undergraduate engineering student here, provided you went to a school with internship programs.  Otherwise it’s about 50k.

P.S.  pm me if you want to buy unicorn tears I got the hook up

8b4vkh,1,2018-04-10,My [19/F] boyfriend [20/M] and I are studying similar majors and my competitiveness is affecting our relationship,peachtea7,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8b4vkh/my_19f_boyfriend_20m_and_i_are_studying_similar/,"So to give some background, my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 1.5 years. Over 90% of the time we get along super well and are a great fit for each other. Unfortunately, I have a competitive/jealous streak and it's been pretty bad recently. Upon being admitted to our college two years ago, my bf was also directly admitted to the major that I've been trying to get into at the school. All the engineering majors at this university are in high demand and competitive to get into. I was rejected from my bf's major again at the end of my freshman year.

So this past year I decided to start pursuing a different engineering major, one that's still quite similar to the one my bf has. If you don't know much about engineering, internships are extremely important for engineers who want to go into industry (instead of grad school) after graduating. I didn't apply to a ton of them, only about 20, and have received one interview but no offer. The rejections from the other ones I applied to have been slowly rolling in this past month :(

My bf has a bit of a procrastination problem and only applied to three. He just got an email for a phone interview for the last one he applied to and there's a very good chance he'll get an offer since he's been in correspondence with the interviewer and the last company he worked for made parts for this particular company.

I've been feeling unreasonably upset and jealous of him recently. I'm upset that I won't get an internship and valuable engineering experience and that I'll make a lot less money than him. I'm upset that I always put more effort into schoolwork, studying, applying to internships, etc. and I get worse grades and now he'll have a super great job for the summer and I won't. A job that will look amazing on his resume when he applies to jobs next year.

I should feel super happy and proud of him but I'm instead feeling ridiculously frustrated. I have some anxiety issues that have been getting a lot worse recently because of the things I mentioned. The thought of taking a break from the relationship has crossed my mind but that would really hurt my bf. 

I'm definitely considering seeing a therapist to resolve these issues but since it might be a while until I can set up an appointment, what are some ways that I can lessen my competitiveness? I'm scared that I could start resenting him over the summer if I don't figure out my feelings before then

TLDR: boyfriend got an internship, I likely won't get one and am dealing with feelings of jealousy"
8b4ynx,2,2018-04-10,"Trying to get started as a freelancer, 0% success. NEED advice.",LousyJournalist,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/8b4ynx/trying_to_get_started_as_a_freelancer_0_success/,"Hi all,

I'm not trying to make this a rant. But there's some serious self-doubt at play right now, and I just need some honest advice.

I left a Ph.D. program in computer science in the Fall because, in short, I hated it and all I've ever wanted to do is write. I have a bachelor's in CS right now. Basically I was sold the idea that having a CS degree would make you valuable in journalism. I've read other journalists say they wished they got their undergrad in computer science, so I figured I had a shot of breaking in.

No, no you don't want a CS degree, not if you want to break into this field. I've been out of the program for three months. I haven't gotten a single outlet to pick up a single story from me; not a reported piece, not a brief opinion piece, I couldn't even get a newspaper to take free coverage from me. I have no professional clips under my belt and hardly any amateur content, so I'm getting turned down for every single internship I've applied to - and inevitably every grad school I'd want to apply to when the day comes.

I'm getting seriously close to just getting a full-time data science job and giving up. This is putting a serious strain on my relationship because I have no idea how I'm going to pay the bills at the end of May when the funding for my part-time job as a data scientist dries up. My girlfriend has even said she's worried.

If I go full-time in CS, I'm basically conceding defeat, and I'm not sure I can live defeated in a profession I hate. There's no way I'm going to be able to do field coverage if I'm working 40 hours a week coding, there's just no chance.

I have no idea what to do. How the hell are you supposed to break into this business if you didn't get a degree in it? It's quixotic, and people make it sound like it should be so easy to whip something up and send it off to an editor and voila, you'll get your first clip in no time. If you're waiting months just to hear back from an editor on something you've submitted, how are you supposed to make any headway? How do you go get decent coverage if you're swallowing the cost every time you need to go interview someone or visit another city?

I want this more than anything, but there just doesn't seem to be a way for me to make this financially viable after the end of next month. Has anyone else managed to break into journalism freelancing? And please for the love of god share your secret."
8b53si,1,2018-04-10,I just got a really great internship through a lot of nepotism.,fellowteenagers,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8b53si/i_just_got_a_really_great_internship_through_a/,"For context, I’m a high school senior graduating this year. I’ve worked very hard for my opportunities and this is the first one I feel I may not fully deserve. 

I’ve taken very technical classes at colleges around me and I’ve also held a pretty selective internship at a medical research campus near me. I’m no stranger to laboratory work, but I’m not an expert by any means. 

A few weeks ago. I contacted my grandmother about an internship program at her company. Not asking for any favors, no recommendations, just information. She asks for my resume. Next thing I know, I’m CCed on an email where my grandmother is passing along my resume to someone in their hiring department. Then I give her the dates I can work. In less than a day, I found out I was given a paid, 2 month internship at this company. Then there was talk about working in one of their plants overseas. You can see how this all happened very quickly. 

I’m ecstatic, I go tell my parents and they’re super excited for me. Then my mother mentions something about my grandmother being a big wig at this company. Saying how everyone in *blah blah blah* department reports to her and how she only reports to one person. They also call her “Pink Slip *Name*”. Before, I felt that I truly deserved this internship, but maybe now I’m not so sure. I know it’s important to get my foot in the door, and I know I would be insane to turn this offer down, regardless of the reasoning. 

I just needed to tell someone about it. "
8b568n,1,2018-04-10,I don't feel good.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8b568n/i_dont_feel_good/,"It’s been a long time. Long time of feeling the exact same way. At this point, I don’t think not having an internship is the problem anymore. Even if I magically land something now, I don’t think it’ll change how I feel. I don’t feel good. I’m not saying this to be dramatic. I genuinely don’t feel good. I haven’t felt good in a long time. I honestly don’t even know if it’s about self-esteem or luck or anything at this point. It’s SO many things simultaneously. I’m afraid that I won’t be able to fix it all. Ever. I’m so young. I’m turning 19 in 3 weeks. Can you believe that? I’m going to be 19 years old. I don’t really know when I will die. But death is so unpredictable. A split second can change one’s life. One second I’m here. Next one I’m not.

 I am extremely attached to my past. It just seems so much better than where I am right now. What is even wrong with my life? I am making great grades. I go to a good school. My parents are pretty close from where I am. I could take a bus and meet them in less than 4 hours. I’m pretty smart. The only thing that might be different for other kids might be that I don’t have an internship. But a lot of kids are in my position. However, I believe my issues go further. Do I have a good social group of friends I can share everything with? No. Is  it my fault? Maybe. Am I living my best life in college? Definitely no. Can I change it? I don’t know. I feel this crummy feeling inside of me right now. I don’t really know how to describe it. It’s like my torso curls up and it feels like there’s a building pressure inside. Usually when I cry REALLY HARD, this happens. But I’m sitting perfectly still right now. I really need to see a therapist soon. 

I don’t know what will make me happy. Like genuinely happy. Going back to my hometown makes me sad. Going back to where my parents live makes me gain weight and I don’t really have anything to do there. Here, it’s just school work all the time. I don’t know where to go. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I was a happy person just 2 years ago. Now I’m a mess. I don’t know if I have depression or something. I know this line is overused but I don’t think anyone understands what I’m feeling. I spent the whole day watching dumb YouTube videos and episodes of The Office. I was laughing at times and felt really weird. It was like I had never laughed before. But I still don’t feel good.

 I have an interview coming up. I’m a little nervous but not as much as I was for other interviews I have had in the past. So, I’m not really sure how this one will go. I have prepared a little bit for this interview. I hope I get the job.  

When I was trying to nail down some causes of this weird constantly sad feeling, I thought relationships might play a significant role. I have never dated anyone. I have never asked someone out. I have been asked a certain number of times that you count with half of our fingers on your left hand. A girl I know made a point about this. She said that having a boyfriend, someone who wants  her, made her feel less insecure about herself. So, it could help. I know people use Tinder or some other apps to meet people. I’m not trying to sound like I’m above all that. But I do think that it’s a weird way to meet people. Especially people you want to spend a lot of your time with and share your deepest secrets. I have to admit that I had Tinder for like 3 days. I  matched with 3 people but I had my eye on one guy. Then, he proceeded to unmatch with me or delete his account. But we all know what really happened. So, I deleted the account and gave up hope. I know most of friends from school started dating after they come to college. For some reason, that hasn’t happened to me. I hear couples’ stories and they’re all so very coincidental. Like that’s not going to happen to everyone. So how the hell am I going to meet someone? My friend had a really tough first year at college. Mostly because she was being really naive and kept throwing herself against her worst nightmare. But last semester, things started turning around for her. She joined some meaningful student orgs and met some new people through her job. Now she’s dating a really nice guy who shares her interests and really gets her. That’s such a nice way for your life to turn around. Granted, I don’t really know what she went through or how bad it really got. But things clicked for her which is great. This is making me sound like I’m not happy for her and that I’m jealous of how things turned out for her. yeah I would agree with that. There is some truth in that statement. She does have a cool internship in Orlando for the summer. I don’t know what she might be going through now but seems like she’s having a good time in life generally speaking. I don’t really understand why guys don’t like me. Well. Lot of reasons actually. First of all, I don’t really hang out with guys a lot because they just haven’t made it into my friend circle. I do know a lot of guys though. I don’t know if they know me. I also act differently around boys. Like I’m a teacher and I’m trying to teach them how to do math. Or how  I don’t party a lot or get craaaaazzzyyy liiittt. But the second they start talking about some coding project or interview thing, I just turn really quiet. So, I might be intellectually threatened by them. But that’s anyone. I would be intellectually threatened by anyone who had something to say. I just want someone to talk to. Someone who will understand. In 10 years, I’ll be 29. I would like to be married to the love of my life and have kids. But if things don’t click for me by then, where will I be? In the same boat, writing on this subreddit?  This is exactly what I’m terrified of. Something that I am learning to accept now. The fact that things may not click for me in life. I know that sounds absolutely ridiculous. I literally wasn’t supposed to move to the U.S but things clicked for me. Things fell into place. What if that was my only lucky stroke in life? What if I used up all of my chances on this college thing? And it’s not even worth it because it could get really bad from here. With friends, things haven’t really clicked. I haven’t made friends with a single person that I would want to talk to in 5 years. I could literally leave this city right now and I wouldn’t miss a single thing. After 2 years of college, this is where I am right now. Is that pitiful? Is this attention seeking behavior? Is this a rough patch in my life that’s supposed to get better but it seems like it won’t for the moment? Is this one of those moments in life where everything looks really bad and then becomes really good? You can’t really tell right now. 

TLDR; sorry for the long rant. I don't know if I'm depressed. Can anyone tell from the tone of the first few paragraphs?

But my GPA is a 3.18. I took a gap year to retake courses (I applied DO only), and did okay, but 2 months before I applied they revoked that grade replacement policy. My science GPA is terrible (around 3.0). I did a post bacc this year at LECOM (for full disclosure), and honestly it is hell. They made this program ridiculously difficult. I learned a lot, but I won't be getting into school there. They gave this horrible exam today that failed out half of the class, and I found myself in that bunch. I don't know what to do. My MCAT is like a 502 right now. If I don't get in, I have no plan and no idea what to do. I still want to do medicine, but honestly I worked very hard. I sacrificed my health, and my happiness just so I could fall short and it stinks. Does anyone have any viable options of what you would do if you were me? Are my chances of admission over for good?

8b5gzd,2,2018-04-10,Admission into MScAC,flsingerman,dcs_uoft,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcs_uoft/comments/8b5gzd/admission_into_mscac/," Hi, 

I'm currently finishing my degree within the next year at the University of Ottawa with a 7/10 CGPA which is ~3.33/4. My upper year courses are closer to 7.5/10. I have done several internships as a Data Scientist and Software Engineer Intern. What are my chances of getting into the program? The UofT website says a B+ but those always tend to be the bare minimum.

8b6e10,1,2018-04-10,I need some clarifications about how Karma works.,MainGoldDragon,help,https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/8b6e10/i_need_some_clarifications_about_how_karma_works/,"My Background ""filler"" story:

I'm fairly new to Reddit as a user, but I have been hearing about the things people were accomplishing here and I've been lurking for a long time but I finally decided to post too since I've started my internship and I've got a lot of free time.

Basically I want to know things:

1. Why does *""show karma breakdown by subreddit""* only show 14 subreddits ? When I've posted or commented on more. And how can I make it show more ?

2. In 1 subreddit (r/XboxOne) the *karma breakdown* I mentioned earlier says I have -100, which is understandable because you know I corrected someone and you know, it's Reddit, but my overall comment karma is -100  too even though in the *karma breakdown* there are subreddits I have positive comment Karma. I'm guessing that subreddit has a max negative Karma that can be displayed, but it can go below that functionally. Like, I have -200 but it shows -100, because I've noticed I've been upvoted a few times after a certain incident but it stayed -100. Is that actually a thing and will it get fixed if I get enough positive karma ?

3. Does the Karma on the top right corner of Reddit's page, next to the username, only display Post Karma or does it not include the negative Karma I just mentioned above ?

4. Can 2 subreddits share the same Karma ? Because I also have the 10 min cooldown on r/SeaOfThieves but even if I can't see my karma there through the karma breakdown, I highly doubt I have negative karma there.

I kinda know the answers but still need the opinion from someone that probably knows more about these things.

Some of my personal opinion:

Also, I know Karma really shouldn't matter, but there are some subreddits that only allow you to post if you have a certain amount of karma and generally if you don't have positive karma in a subreddit, you have a 10 minute cooldown and as someone that wants to help other people, waiting gets tiring.

^^^I ^^^thought ^^^there ^^^was ^^^a ^^^spoiler ^^^tag

Also if upvoting your own posts/comments does nothing and doesn't contribute to your karma, why is it a thing ?"

I am 21 year old student currently attending an internal audit internship. I currently possess a bachelors degree in economics and in September I am going to start my masters degree.
Since my entry in this internship I work provide independent assurance that the risk management (ERM), governance and internal control procedures are operating effectively according to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (IIA) and the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
What I would like to know is if any lifetime auditors have any tips to improve myself or any guidance on what I should be doing to learn more about this field of work. 
I have been reading about the development of IT lately, not sure if anyone here could shed some light on their day to day work.
Are there any certificates I should look into that may be relevant in the future? 

Thank you!"
8b890n,2,2018-04-10,Of how I finally got rid of it...,IamBlade,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8b890n/of_how_i_finally_got_rid_of_it/,"Hey there.
I am new to this sub and I actually stumbled upon it by pure chance. I have something to share with you people.
So about a year back things got really bad for me. I'm about to graduate in a month or so. But back then things were really intense. I was in the shortest semester of the year and the campus internships were coming. My grades were low and if I have to get a good job the next year I had to study and score well and at the same time manage my other responsibilities (new to adulting). 

Every day I'd wake up, go to class and in the evening I'd take an exam whose score decided which companies I can apply for. It goes well into the night and I'd come back to room all drained up and crash on the bed only to start again all over.

The one positive light was my friend group. Like most of you, I was the odd one out, the least sociable, the awkward extra wheel who has nothing important to do. I knew no one else better and horrible at initiating interactions. And obviously single af. 

Once the semester ended we had to do a intern over the summer vacations and they counted for credits. I had to settle for a mediocre intern in a company where my uncle works. The place was a factory plant. And I literally had no job to do there. No guide, no mentor, nothing. They sort of asked me to collect details of the manufacturing process and thats it. For two fucking months. I'd wake up at 5 in the morning to catch a suburb train, to catch the only company bus to reach the plant. The entire thing was a 2 hour journey and I had to do it alone. I had no power bank then and I couldn't even listen to music or browse internet without risking to drain the battery. Somehow I managed to keep it on battery saver and pass my time.

Then things started to get more depressing. I had to stay at the plant the whole day without doing almost anything. Every worker around me had something to do and I couldn't even ask anyone to teach me shit. Someone would come and talk to me for a while to ask why I was there and would then leave. When I said this to my parents they asked me to try harder. I did. It didn't work. Every social media I had only reinforced the feeling. My friends and classmates were doing internships and posting pictures and statuses, and here I am, sitting in the middle of a loud factory doing nothing.

Thats when I tried reddit to avoid all those stuff ( I didn't know about this sub then ). Even then I'd be worried about how I will be graded for doing nothing at a company whose field doesn't even align with mine. About how I will explain this to my interviewers when I apply for a job. 

All right, I'm taking matter into my hands, I decided. I liked stories and books. And I wanted to write one. Everyday I'd just sit up and dream my story. But still I couldn't get to the writing part yet. The only consolation was it kept away the suicidal thoughts, of running away from home and skip the day by falling sick somehow. You get the idea.

No one could have been more relieved than me when those horrible 2 months ended. Once they ended I did one thing. One thing very religiously. Preparing for campus placements. I did everything I could do to get placed as soon as possible. I applied for a lot of companies and I didn't even pass the first round of selections for a lot of them. When it was starting to get worse I got through the initial rounds for a company and on my first fucking interview ever I nailed it! I can't even believe if I could be capable of such a thing.
Once I got over that obstacle, I started learning Photoshop as a hobby and designed posters, banners and stuff for our symposium events at college. I was the team head in fact. I met a lot of new people because of that and my social interaction problem has now been partly solved. I participated in several cultural events and won some. Went on road trips to place I've never been.

I feel much more hopeful now than before. 
I am not yet complete inside my heart but there are no more bleeding wounds...just the scars of my depression.
And to all of you who are still crippled by this invisible monster, I've one thing to say: There is a rock in the ocean you are drowning. Yes there is! **HOLD THE FUCK ON TO IT**. Don't yet give up. Take a deep breath. There is still something to fight for. There will be. Even if there isn't, make one for yourself. The dawn always comes.

8b9hjm,0,2018-04-10,Appeal to Jenks High School for Interim Compromise,bc354,oklahoma,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/8b9hjm/appeal_to_jenks_high_school_for_interim_compromise/,"I strongly support Oklahoma teachers in their quest for pay and classroom funding.  However, I am also a father of 3 and with the walk out into its 2nd week with no end in sight, I would like to discuss potential interim scenarios that could meet the goals of gaining increased funding and still meet the immediate scholastic needs of those students whose Near-Term futures can be most directly affected by scheduling issues.

My proposal is for Jenks to re-open the High School this week and keep the lower grades closed pending resolution of the larger funding issues.  This would allow over 2/3 of Jenks teachers (even after allowing for some child care workers to return to watch the small children of HS teachers) to continue protesting at the Capitol so this would not represent any type of ""giving in"" nor would the urgency of the message become lost.

At the same time, re-opening the HS would expedite the completion of the spring semester for Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors - who of all students are the most likely to have further education/employment plans already scheduled for early summer such as:

Summer semester College courses beginning in early June 
Summer HS student programs at leading universities both in Oklahoma, nationwide, and abroad
Summer jobs
Summer internships and/or camp counseling opportunities
Boy Scout and Girl Scout national camps, Eagle Projects, and potentially once in a lifetime trips to Philmont, Sea-base or Boundary Waters.

These highly beneficial and educational opportunities for students could be at risk if the walk-out continues much longer and the long term effects on future college applications, and future educational and employment opportunities is considerable. 

Also the effect for HS students is Much, Much larger than for a 4th or 5th grader missing a few days of summer day camp or whatever else the younger kids may have scheduled.  While I don't want to see the younger kids in school all June either, the future cost isn't as great - there aren't that many summer activities that an elementary student will be putting on their future college applications, and they also have more future summers to make up for the time lost.

Please consider this appeal to a rational interim compromise which does not give the legislature any kind of ""win""  - anything tangible to brag about, does not put the teacher's position on the issues in jeopardy, but still benefits the students who can be most effected by scheduling issues."

8b9vhd,6,2018-04-10,Rosen = Chosen: QB discussion,JetsSetter,nyjets,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/8b9vhd/rosen_chosen_qb_discussion/,"If the Jets chose Allen at #3 and Rosen is on the board I'm calling my billboard guy. I can get behind Mayfield (although I prefer Rosen), but Allen is a mockery.  

I know Allen can throw 80 yards and potentially has higher upside but as someone who has watched ""can't hit the ocean"" Hack, ""good guy"" Petty, ""Mike Tyson"" Geno, ""Back-foot pick 6"" Sanchez, ""Clipboard"" Clemens, ""My dad got me this internship"" Simms, ""He's a winner tho"" McElroy, ""exposed magician"" Fitz, and ""Verrazano Bridge QB"" McCown, I'm in need of consistency.  Yes, Allen could be a superstar Big Ben player one day (unlikely imo) but if we have another bust QB it stifles the development of our other players.  

Between Robby, Enunwa, Elijah, Legget (myb) and Crowell (still 25), we have a lot of young players with untapped potential. Another bust QB wastes their primes and adds them to the likes of Lav Coles, Cotchery, Keller, and Kerely who w competent QB play are good pieces.

Rosen can understand the system, complete balls, and run an effective gameplan.  The most flashy? No. Better accuracy than Baker? Probably not. Attitude problem? Debatable.  But end of the day, he's the most polished prospect who can run a pro system and made due with a dilapidated group of weapons at UCLA.

Help/kill me.",burnervapenayshyall4,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/8b9wfl/xpost_roffmychest_thought_i_hated_my_one_roommate/,"When I first moved in with two girls, let’s call them Zoe and Mary, who was my freshman year roommate, I thought I loved Mary but I didn’t know Zoe well. I guess hate isn’t the right word but we didn’t click. Zoe and I got in a few fights so at first I found this girl mean. I kinda was scared of going out with her because she’d start these fights over nothing, avoid me for days and kinda clash with me when she drank. Surprisingly though, she changed and we’re so tight now we laugh at when we were awk.

Now, Mary is getting on my last NERVE and me and Zoe both can’t stand her. Ever since she started dating (but refuses to call it a relationship because she “doesn’t believe in monogamy” but ditched all of us and changed her entire personality for one dude) this pothead frat bro, she became a lazy pothead too and hasn’t done a single dish or cleaned a DAY in our house all semester. To be fair, I have respect for productive stoners. My dad’s side has a lot of them. But she is NOT one. 

I just spent the last hour picking up big mac wrappers and mopping spilled sauce and mysterious substances (probably a mix of bodily fluids, big mac sauce and bong water,) and she left her unfinished pasta to fester in a pot instead of throwing it out so I had to scrub that out and peel it out of the pot. We live in a rural well off college town and when we refused to clean up after her once, we got roaches (fucking ROACHES!!! In our cornfield ass town it’s kinda unheard of) so we both accepted our fate of slaving away at our shitshow to maintain a civil relationship with her and not annihilate this girl’s feelings. Every time we ATTEMPT to ask her to help us she has a shitty excuse. “Oops i have to study!” Or “I’m at my mans!” Honey... don’t we all? Zoe has a man too but isn’t an obsessive weirdo wHo spends every minute of her life wasting a mans time while avoiding all human responsibility. I have 16 credits, am in a sorority, and hold an exec position on my dance team. I intern as a contributor to a college comedy publication (*Comedy.* Publication. Yeah, I know I seem uptight from this post but believe me. I’m generally easygoing and don’t take everything that seriously. I make fucking memes for class credit at this internship, for god’s sake. This just shows it had to be HELLA bad for the cold, uptight virgo bitch in me to come out. And it gets worse.) I have negative time but still clean so we don’t live in a fucking biohazard crack den.

She always pays the rent late so we all get late fees. Her not-boyfriend will come over and they’ll just sit and eat food and leave all the trash so we have to pick up after her like a baby after smoking up, not opening a window, the whole place will reek and ashing their blunts and leaving crusted hot sauce on me and Zoe’s plates and leaving them for US to scrub and us to pick up Big Mac wrappers and old chicken wings. Like, rotting chicken bones. Fruit flies. You name it.

The last unbelievable thing she did was she clogged the toilet, didn’t fix it OR tell us, went MIA for 2 days and it was so bad and unfixable we called maintenance to fix HER taco bell munchie shits. Seriously? Again, I have respect for productive stoners (my brother is one of them! It helps with his depression so no shade!) but no respect for stoners whose personality is dull as a board and lazy as shit.

It’s seriously disgusting and I can’t wait to get out of this dump when I’m home for the summer. Only thing is, she has a lease with me next year so. Fuck me. What do I do about this besides punch myself in the face or accidentally bitch her out."

It's a very crowded Hot 50 this week and the top ten reflects that, as there are only four artists in the list.

The entirety of Weeknd's new EP *My Dear Melancholy,* are in the top ten. Topping this week's chart is 'Call Out My Name', which is also this week's highest debut. His other songs on the EP 'Wasted Times', 'Try Me', ""Hurt You', 'I Was Never There' and 'Privilege' debuts at #2, #4-#6 and #9 respectively.

Moving on to Kacey Musgraves, two of her songs from her highly-acclaimed album *Golden Hour* are charting. Last week's #1 'High Horse' remains strong at #3. 'Slow Burn' debuts at #8. Kacey takes this week's biggest gain as 'Space Cowboy' increases 20 spots to #16.

'What I Need', Hayley Kiyoko's only song from her debut album *Expectations* which features Kehlani debuts at #7. Hayley takes this week's highest re-entry as 'Feelings' reaches a new peak at #15. 

For Taylor Swift, Delicate remains strong despite the new music dominance at #10. Unfortunately, a song that was defeated out easily by it was 'In My Blood' by Shawn Mendes, losing 42 spots to #45. 

* **Highest Debut:** #1. The Weeknd - Call Out My Name
* **Highest Re-Entry:** #15. Hayley Kiyoko - Feelings 
* **Biggest Gain:** #16. Kacey Musgraves - Space Cowboy (+20) 
* **Biggest Decline:** #45. Shawn Mendes - In My Blood (-42)

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

8bbuuk,4,2018-04-10,"Just wanted to share my story, and wanted to hear what you guys are going/went through",Pihv,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8bbuuk/just_wanted_to_share_my_story_and_wanted_to_hear/,"Hey everyone,
I just wanted to share what I’m currently going through. I’m sorry that it’s a bit long, but I honestly wanted to share it with someone. It has been going for a few years now and no one knows, not even family. I’m not sure if I could call it depression, as I’m still able to live “normally” and interact with people. 

Bit of backstory:
It started about five years ago on my last year of school, as I was struggling with many of my classes and I was feeling completely useless. I’m the same year, I found out people I thought were my friends would hang out and talk behind my back despite being friendly to my face. At the time, my mom knew I wasn’t well, but she had a lot going on as well, so I said it was all good, but she obviously felt something was wrong, and would always try to find something to cheer me up. I managed to graduate despite everything, and my mom gave me as a birthday gift a trip to London to visit my aunt where I stayed for a few months, had a great time and met some great people. When I came back, I decided to “act” as if I was feeling, let’s say, renewed and healed from whatever I was going through before the trip (and honestly I was, at least for a bit) as I didn’t want my mother to worry. 

However, for a few years now, I’ve been feeling a sense of emptiness, quite apathetic about everything and feeling like my life is going through a senseless routine. Most days, I could say I am “normal”, as I can go to college, talk to my friends, and live a relatively normal life. But now, as I’m approaching my third year of college, those feelings of uselessness are coming back, as despite having been looking for an internship for a few months, I’ve been rejected in all interviews. My mom, despite having some financial problems right now, is just saying that when the time is right, I’ll get an internship, and that I should not worry about her and that is making me feel useless. I’ve been wanting to to talk to someone about it, but I don’t want to risk talking to my friends about it, as I’m afraid of getting pushed away. I considered going to therapy, but for now I feel like I don’t have that option, as my parents are close to a divorce and my uncle is risking going to jail, so now, it’s my mother that needs my help, especially because she said what’s driving her to keep going strong is seeing me happy in college.

If someone read it all, thank you, I honestly needed to get this all out of my chest. I would really appreciate if you guys could share what you’re all going through and what you guys did to “fight” this. Thank you very much.

8bca9i,45,2018-04-10,"Vaginal, medicated, epidural FTM birth story--very positive!",Lordbloopington,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/8bca9i/vaginal_medicated_epidural_ftm_birth_storyvery/,"I guess I should preface this with the fact that I'm almost 7 months late in writing this. Time seriously flies after the baby is born! This group was so great for me throughout my pregnancy and I loved reading birth stories, so hopefully this will be helpful and/or enjoyable for some of you. I should also say that I had a pretty miserable pregnancy (nothing scary, just Reynaud's phenomenon of my nipples/heartburn refractory to EVERYTHING I tried/SI joint pain, starting my intern year of residency, etc.) and it was all worth it and I would go through that plus labor every day of my life for my daughter.

At my 36 and 37 week appointments, I was 1 cm dilated and 70% effaced. I was getting pretty discouraged even knowing that it really didn't mean anything, but I was OVER pregnancy and just ready to have the baby. At my 37 week appointment, my OB started planting the seed that I should start thinking about a date for induction in case we needed to go that route. I told her I needed to think about it (it seemed early and I really didn't want to be induced).

At 38 + 5, I was getting pretty impatient. I was working 60-70 hours a week, and got up at 5am to go to work on a Sunday. One of my coworkers who has since become a close friend offered to cover for me for the day because our patient load wasn't very large. Normally, I would have argued, but at 38 + 5 I decided I should probably take advantage and went back to bed. I slept until 10 am, and then my husband and I spent a day together relaxing and going out to lunch. That night, I decided that we should try having sex just to see if it would move anything along. Within 20-30 minutes, I started having contractions (it was about 10pm at this point). I was so skeptical that I was in labor (I had been having Braxton Hicks contractions since about week 20 and this felt entirely different, but I really didn't want to get my hopes up) and as soon as I had my first one my husband was convinced that this was it. After I had a few, I was convinced, too. He started timing them and we showered and got in bed. We had packed our hospital bags a few weeks before.

If anyone can sleep through labor, I applaud you. I honestly don't know how that's possible. We spent the evening timing contractions and they started getting longer and closer together. When they reached 4 minutes apart, we got in the car and headed to the hospital. It was around 3 am. On the drive over, the contractions were slowing down some. Once we got to L&amp;D, they triaged me and put me on the monitors. I was still only 1 cm dilated after being in labor for 5 hours. They said I could go home to labor more, or walk around the hospital for an hour and come back to see if I had made any progress. The rather snarky nurse told me ""when you're really in labor, you'll know."" (Turns out, it's true, and I did know). At this point I was really discouraged (I didn't understand how I could have been in that much pain for so long but hadn't progressed AT ALL on dilation since my last checkup) but decided I would much rather labor at home than walk around the hospital (which happens to be the same hospital where I work; I wasn't very keen on the possibility of running into coworkers in the halls). We headed back to the house.

We attempted to sleep for the next few hours, but I wasn't sleeping through the contractions and every time I moaned my husband would wake up, so neither of us really got any sleep at all that night.

We got out of bed around 6am. I didn't really feel like being touched while I was laboring, so my husband did dishes and cleaned while I labored and took a bath. The bath really didn't help me with the pain at all. We also had some people coming to install a fence in our yard that day, so my husband warned them not to be too alarmed if they heard weird sounds coming from inside the house (haha). I wish I could describe contractions, but for me, they were like nothing else I had ever felt. It's kind of weird because it's so painful that when you have one literally the only thought your brain can process is that you just need to survive until it's over. Then, as soon as it's over, you're hoping for another one because the closer they are together, the sooner they will stop and the sooner you'll get to meet your little one.

Finally, around 9am, we decided it was time to go back to the hospital. I was sure I had to have made some pretty good progress at this point. They checked my cervix and... I was at 3cm. I was terrified they were going to send me home again because I didn't feel like I could possibly go home. They spoke to the OB on call who started me on therapeutic rest--morphine to help me ""sleep"" and hopefully relax enough to make some progress. I didn't sleep but things are definitely kind of hazy at this point--the morphine didn't touch the pain, and I continued to labor in L&amp;D triage for several hours. They made me lie on my sides because of the baby's heart rate while I was contracting on my back, which was pretty uncomfortable on a triage bed. They came back to check my cervix, and at this point I was convinced nothing was going to have changed and I was just going to be in labor forever. The nursing student checked and then asked the nurse to check and confirm--I was 9.5 cm and fully effaced! I could hardly believe it and then asked if it was too late to get an epidural. It wasn't. They moved me to the delivery room and the anesthesiologist put in the epidural. At first the dosing wasn't high enough so they gave me a little bit more medication as well as a pump to administer it to myself as needed. The extra bit they gave me may have overshot a little and I didn't use the pump at all. After the epidural I felt AMAZING. I could still feel the pressure from the contractions but they weren't painful. While they continued to prepare for delivery I even called my mom and talked to her for a while (I had to be reminded of this later because I was so out of it at the time). My husband was starving and went to the cafeteria to get some food. While he was gone, the nurses came to try some practice pushes. I pushed twice and they said ""oh, she has hair!"" I called my husband on his cell phone and told him to come back because it was time to start pushing. I told him she had hair and he was like ""YOU GUYS CAN SEE HER?"" I think I pushed for a total of 10 or 15 minutes and she was out! They put her on my belly (not skin-to-skin until I requested it) and eventually told me I could try to nurse her. I don't even remember the 3rd stage of labor because I was so focused on her. She was 5 lbs and 11.5 ounces, 19 inches, and since she was so  little she had to have a heel stick to check her blood sugar before every feed in the hospital. That was pretty traumatic for her and us by extension. Thankfully, she's perfectly healthy and has put on weight nicely since then! I ended up with a 2nd degree tear which was stitched up and healed well.

All through my pregnancy, I felt so miserable that I thought I would never do it again. The day we left the hospital, I told my husband I definitely want at least one more. Having her is the best thing I have ever done and we are all so happy. In reality, my baby fever is worse than it was before I got pregnant, although I'm definitely not planning on having a second during residency! It's nice to come back to this subreddit and be reminded of how amazing pregnancy and birth were, in retrospect. Thanks for reading and if anyone has any questions feel free to ask!"
8bcjnx,3,2018-04-10,My Undergrad Major,Mourning_Beer,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/8bcjnx/my_undergrad_major/,"Hello r/biology,

Right now I am studying computational biology as an undergrad at one of the few schools that offer it. I am transferring to a state school, because this school is no longer financially feasible and I am generally unhappy. Without giving too much detail, this school doesn't offer a computational or bioinformatics program. The problem here arises that I still would like to work in this field of biology, so I have to tracks I have mapped out and would like some inputs by professionals on what would look better for being employed after undergrad. \(I have considered grad school and is still an option\) I will be a junior after this semester, so a double major is really out of the equation. 

My first idea would be to major in just biology with a BS. This school requires a minor with this \(which is a good thing imo bc of jobs\) and I would minor in computer science. I would probably take an internship for computational biology in the summer of my junior year and try to get some research experience. 

My second would be to major in Microbiology and Biotech with a comp science minor. This would be a heavier course load, but I already have a comp sci class out of the way and so far it's not too difficult. I would probably be taking 16 credit hours per semester. \(which is a lot for me \- I don't have a good handle on stress\) I would also be going for an internship as well.

The question I think I am trying to ask is that of which is better looking? A lot of people have graduated with biology and I don't think I'd be too competitive. As someone who hopes to work in the field as a comp biologist, I was wondering if I might be dismissed for having a specialized area of bio \(micro and tech\) rather than just the general biology major. Thank you for reading my predicament.  "

Last year I took the MCAT and was taking 4 classes at the same time while working 12 hours/week in a lab and shadowing a doctor twice /week. I ended up getting a low score on the test and decided to retake it this year. This time I was determined to manage my time and not take on too many things simultaneously and so I only had 2 classes and an internship. I started studying in January and at first I was fine. Still going out with friends, still positive and hopeful. About 2 months ago I started feeling very sad. I noticed that I was crying everyday and that during my practice exams I had spirals of negative thoughts and that I would think of everything that could go wrong while reading a question. I decided to see a therapist and I've seen her 5 times already. Today, she diagnosed me with depression and honestly I knew I was depressed but having a specialist actually diagnose me with depression makes it way more real. Medicine is the only career that I want to pursue and i don't know if I'm just going through a phase and that I'll feel better once the test is over or what. Has anyone else experienced this during the MCAT? Before this exam I was a very social person, had so many friends, loved going out now I'm just too tired to socialize and end up lying to my friends coming up with excuses as to why I can't make it. 

Not expecting any medical advice I'm just wondering if anyone else experienced this when studying for the test and if yes, what did you do to cope?"

I hate writing, but this work was really meaningful to me and I thought I would share it. It is called, Everything and Nothing at All. FYI I don't really agree with my ending. I just wrote it for the assignment. 
-------------------


“What does it feel like,” Emily asks
I look up from my bowl of pasta and sip my beer. “What does what feel like?” 
“To be depressed.” 
It was a Sunday afternoon and I had just told my friend of a year about my struggle with depression.
Despite my candid nature, I hated the word depression; I still do. In any given version of the dictionary depression is equated with sadness, and by no means would I define what I felt as sad.
I was experiencing a slew of other things outside of sadness. This thing inside my head -- it was a pain in the butt, to say the least. 
As I’ve pondered depression, I’ve come to compare these feelings to having a friend in elementary school that you are forced to play with because your parents are friends; it seems like they’ll never leave. I’ve come to compare these feelings to a vicious giant tick, slowly sucking the life out of you. Depression wasn’t one feeling branding my core, it was a swarm of feelings or none at all. 
 	I loathe the word depression. 
Depression is playing with childhood toys after you’ve finally grown up. Something that was once so exciting and vibrant, as you played out all the storylines and scenarios that were fun before, has lost its meaning. Ox, the ugly monster terrorizing barbies, turned into a green blob with ears waving in the air above a bunch of dolls. Where I had never felt bored or unfulfilled, I couldn’t connect with my toys that allowed me participatory experience as an adult. For me, depression felt exactly the same but with almost everything in my life. 
For the sake of this essay, I don’t want to call this jumble of feelings depression. I want to call it, It. Maybe you’re thinking of the clown It from the blockbuster of the same name, but at times it’s felt like It had a personality, but it was not a person -- it was something that came to visit unannounced and unwelcomed trying to rearrange my home in order to make space. It made me feel a whole onslaught of emotions; we’ve fought for residency. 
-----------------
The first time I experienced feeling this brand of overwhelmed, I was 16. I realize that a lot of people say that depression attacks them after a big moment, but for me it felt less climactic. I think I first felt it when I realized that I’d been gravely misunderstood. All of highschool I had one friend; I was an outcast. Feeling like I did not belong or that I was not welcomed, I would retreat to my corner, and not say a word. Because of this, I was often called slow or dumb by classmates and even by a teacher. Speaking up in a classroom or reading aloud has always instilled fear in me. I was made to feel a perpetual and cyclical rejection and isolation. I felt a long lasting otherness -- exposure, rejection, retreat, exposure, rejection, retreat. 
I think that may have been the beginning. I remember one day on a March morning as I protected my feet from the cold with thick socks, that I opened my eyes and I did not want to wake up. 
For a month this continued and sleep was a welcome reprieve.
When someone asked me why I couldn’t do something, I would offer up an, “I don’t feel well”.
I felt like I was living a nightmare where the whole world felt surreal, grey; I felt numb. 
Like most loving parents, my parents grew concerned. I was not going to school, I was hiding in my room, and, often, they would see me leave my room, eyes red and puffy. My parents did not always believe in mental illness, they believed a person could make themselves feel a certain way (typical baby boomers, right?). It wasn’t like I wanted to kill myself, by no means was I suicidal. It was simply that I had lost the passion and zest to live. I had surrendered myself to the abyss of nothingness. I wanted an escape but was too confined to run. I can recall looking at myself in the mirror. My loss of living reflected in my appearance -- I looked like a corpse. My face that was once full of color and joy, was pale, green veins were visible on my face. Dark circles masked my eyes from lack of sleep, yet I was in bed all the time. My body was hidden by a cloud of sweatshirts and sweatpants. I was floating. 
To think about those times today saddens me. Tennis had been my passion, and it was my dream to play in college. When I began to skip practice, my sports enthused parents caught on. Tennis was my one way ticket to college. 
“Why are you so sad,” my mom would ask as I choked back tears. 
“I am just tired and need to nap” or, “I have a cold,” would be my response.
 They finally took me to a doctor, and he told them what I couldn’t articulate. I didn’t know I had it, I have never heard of anyone experiencing it. In truth, I just wanted a soft, hazy space to live in and to be left alone. 
I don’t think my parents ever really understood that. They still wrestle with the idea that depression isn’t some far away inaccessible thing but that people -- that I -- could actually wrestle with this foreign and heavy It. They took me to one of their friends, a doctor they knew and trusted. Though they didn’t know how to embrace this reality, they approached in kind. To some it may have seemed like they weren’t concerned but, they were. My cumulative experiences were new to them and they did not know how to respond. I was given medication and recommended therapy and after I graduated highschool, I lived in France, earned a tennis scholarship to a school in Florida. After a time, the memory of what I had gone through faded; I talked to my therapist, I took my pill when needed. 
It took some time but a change had settled into the place where It once was. I was never the same as I was before, I still had doubt about myself but I waved a relieved goodbye to the thing that controlled my life. 

--------- 
The few years that passed saw I was a freshman at a college in Florida. I excelled in my classes, I quit tennis (being a D1 college athlete was not what I wanted). I was actively involved in a business club, and a medical fraternity. I dreamed of becoming a reconstructive surgeon opening up my own practice for face transplants, and of owning an investment fund. For the first time in my life, I felt smart. People would come to me for homework help and I actively felt the freedom and permission to speak up in class. I always knew that I was intelligent; I had IQ tests when I was younger. People merely believed and told me that I was not because I behaved differently. 
College felt better, I felt closer to a me that felt authentic and I had a small group of friends that reminded me of home although the south was a weird place. I was in central Florida whose residences weren’t the most friendly to northerners and at times were racist. 
One morning in February, during my second semester of college. I woke up suddenly and spontaneously uninterested with what was going on around me. The feeling felt oddly familiar, (maybe it was deja vu?). 
Not being able to identify these feelings or know what was going on completely frustrated me. I thought I had gotten lucky when my roommate moved out during my second semester although in reality I learned that it was both a blessing and a curse. I loved being alone, but I was experiencing increased loneliness. Being in my room alone made me uncomfortable about these feelings that I could not identify. To escape this, I drank. I went out six nights a week... If I couldn’t identify what I was feeling, I could at least be drunk, right? 
Not many people who knew me at school understood that I had a problem. I was the quiet, intellectual hermit. I often got asked by people if I was a vampire, because I was never seen during the day except at class, and rarely ate in the food commons. I would laugh with them at their remarks; I didn’t want them to know what was wrong with me. I yearned for someone to ask me what was wrong. 
Eventually, all the drinking caught up. I stopped going to my business and medical club meetings, and was surprised that I even managed to make it to class and did well. My ambitions of working in medicine dissipated.  
“You’re not smart enough, you shouldn’t be at this school.” 
“You would be an awful doctor. Who wants you as a doctor…?” It would whisper lies into my ear at night that would find me crawling under my blankets, trying to drown out the thoughts.
“Go away,” I would tell It.
I felt like the world was ending and that I was doomed. I often dreamt that a spirit came to me from the Moon anytime I felt the overwhelming oncomings of doom. She would take out her sword that would gleam and she would fight It with a redemptive vengeance. I didn’t know what It looked like, sometimes It was a black shadow that would latch onto me to the point where I couldn’t breath. Sometimes, It morphed into my insecurities, telling me I could not do something. It reminded me of a boggart sometimes. It would hiss, and retreat into the closet, or into the darkness, harmed but never killed. The spirit would then morphe into a shield cocooning and surrounding me. I was enveloped by comfort in a space where I felt safe. The Moon spirit would lift me into the air, and fly me into the skies to endless and nameless destinations filled with, goodness. 
The spirit would appear in my dreams occasionally over the past few years. These dreams gave me comfort in a time where it felt like I was stuck in these icky feelings for ages. The ugly engulfing feelings bombarded me daily, but I was able to survive because I knew that there was an end was in sight. Despite my incapacitating and debilitating feelings, I was not suicidal nor had I ever been; It had drained me and my enjoyment of living. I was a corpse having been drained of all humanly traits.	
I had lost most of my friends but was still bearing through class, and doing well, but I felt same vast nothingness. I had all this negativity about myself and it pumped through my veins, circulating throughout my body, expanding the emptiness with every pulse of my heart. It wasn’t until I met my friend Hailey, that I felt some semblance of okay. We saved each other in a way. She had experienced these feelings too. 
Hailey was a major psych nerd and worshipped Freud, a complex mind that knew intimately the dark and quick emotions that had subjected me to feeling swallowed up. I took it upon myself to lead the rescue party for her escape out of an abusive relationship. Her triumph was mine and I suddenly had a new hope for freedom from the ugly we had experienced. Hailey and I sought shelter at both of our dorm rooms. On the nights sleep evaded me, Hailey’s room was my cocoon. It smelled like patchouli as crystal salt lamps would light the room littered with books of eastern medicine, Freud and Journals. 
There, in that safe space, I could admit to her what I was afraid of, what I felt. I never had been able to openly admit that the feelings that I did not know or could not identify that incited a numbing had confused me. Hailey could not only recognize them but could empathize with them. For once, someone asked me if I was okay and would express that they cared for me and supported me. Hailey offered a mantra that I could repeat: I will be okay. I am wonderful how I am. Most of my friends couldn’t actually comprehend this. It seemed no one understood that this was all I needed in a friendship. I couldn’t recall  anyone ever saying that to me. I couldn’t recall anyone ever telling me that it was okay not to be okay, that being messy was an okay place to be.
Before long, I had stopped taking my medication because I was convinced that it no longer worked. Hailey urged me to work on that area of my life again again, in fact, she even helped me find doctors in my area. 
I told her that I needed to go home and to get better, and that I eventually wanted to transfer to a different school where I felt challenged and where I could find my purpose. 
We still keep in touch. 
I returned home back to Michigan. I started going back to my doctor, got into boxing, and financial trading on the side and felt a remarkable contentedness. For the first semester back home and away from Florida, I fully immersed myself in applying to colleges to transfer to. I wanted one with a great business school to pursue my interest in finance. I applied to Michigan, in hopes of getting into the business school, Notre Dame and Emory. 
I was accepted into Michigan, and decided that it was the place that I wanted to complete my degree so that I could be close to my home and to my doctors. 
I walked into 2014 excited. 
-------------------
A year went by and I wrestled with It on and off. I wasn’t accepted into the business school, and I got over it. I was an Economics major with an Art History minor and while I was struggling in my classes, I was still passing. I traded on the side, and was making pretty consistent money while tutoring in French, Econ, Spanish and Finance too. I pursued trading internships in Chicago and New York. I was growing comfortable with my new pursuit and my new life. I believed with 100% assurance that I was going to kill 2016 and I approached it with a positive, confident attitude. As I progressed throughout the term, I knew I needed to take a required Econ class and was nervous because I heard of people failing it. My fears and apprehension had manifested again as I failed the course and had to withdraw. I was so ashamed of myself. 
My advisor suggested to stop majoring in Econ believing the notion that I was making myself miserable. 
The nothingness followed, yet again. All my thoughts were, “you’re fucking stupid” and “you will never get a trading job”. I went to class, and tried without hope of victory.
 	My advisor suggested that I should major in Art History and take finance classes on the side and I was embarrassed to give up. Resolution and accomodation felt more like admitting defeat.
I would return to my bed, wanting to be left alone. Sleeping let me escape and once again, I familiarized myself with cyclical pattern of returning to the nothingness and fighting with It. Learning that switching my major would cause me to graduate in the Fall of 2017 angered me. I would be 23 and that? That felt something akin to failure.
-------------
It did not come around. I figured out I wanted to pursue Investment Banking after a summer in Chicago working in Private Equity. In the Fall of 2016, I killed interviews, and beat many business students, as an art history major for final round interviews in New York and Chicago. 
Things were going my way and I was excelling in my classes. 
Despite my dog dying, which was heartbreaking for me, I found some morsel of peace and comfort. I immersed myself in my goals and excelled at my summer internship in Chicago. I came back to Ann Arbor for my last semester, ready for my final term. 
But then It reared its ugly head. I stopped applying to jobs and being, generally, productive. I felt stuck and inadequate and helpless. It hadn’t been this bad in years. For two weeks, I did not leave the house.
 My friends that knew that I struggled with It did not understand. 
“What is wrong?”, “Why are you so sad?” and, “Why didn’t you come out with us last night?” were common questions that accompanied confused looks. I often lied to them, telling them I was tired or stressed with a lot on my plate from job recruiting. 
The most difficult part was keeping up with classes. Living at home I would lie to my parents saying I did not have class so that I could just lay in bed. My life felt surreal and detached, as if it weren’t my home. My friends and family were so excited for me to graduate, but I felt nothing. 
I was, in actuality, an observer of my own life, beautiful sunny days that I once loved were grey, and absent of laughter. My energy decreased and it was difficult for me to go to class let alone work up the strength to do school work. 
Often late at night, thoughts of failure consumed me. I felt a foreboding sense of doom, that this absence of all feeling would forever haunt me. 
“Go away,” I’d cry, “Go away”.
 	 I couldn’t remember that last time I experienced feeling. I longed for the days that I could walk outside and smile at the sun. I yearned for when things had color and tone and vibrancy. I missed hope and joy and peace. I missed feelings as if I’d never known them. I was nostalgic for a me that felt far away. I wanted to grab ahold of a tangible health, a palpable happiness.

A few weeks ago, I had the Moon spirit return to me in my dream although I had not seen her in years. I would ask myself why I felt what I felt and wished for pain where there was numbness while wishing for numbness where I felt pain. It would say, “You’re graduating, what are you going to do now? Fail?” 
I shook and hid under my covers, grumbling a, “Shut up! Go away now!”. 
It wrapped its grimey, long fingers around my wrist, pulling me in. 
“Come with me,” It said. 
I turned cold. 
“Stop,” I said, “I can’t do this anymore”.
The warrior of my dreams appears in a beam of light, and raises her sword. It hisses and shrinks and retreats into the darkness and hope lives.
“You saved me,” I rejoiced. 
The spirit hands me her sword. 
“I don’t know how to sword fight. I am useless!” I exclaimed 
She shakes her head and vanishes with a smile. It was a silent admonishment of my rebuking my own strength and authority. 
------------
The epiphany that I was in control of how I felt was raw and unexpected. I was a warrior, I didn’t need a spirit to save me, I possessed the ability to save myself. It will always try to make an appearance in my life, trying to bogart its way into my space, into my home but I’m in in charge. I have fought it and I will continue to fight it. I have learned that there will be occasional days where that I would fall flat on my ass. The truth is, however, that I have the choice of how I fall and how I get back up. 
-----------
“So, what does it feel like, to be depressed?”  
I sigh, and breathe. “I can’t explain except it feels like everything.”
It has felt like everything and it has felt like nothing.
And the real power --  I have authority and power over It even when it wags its tongue and roars at me. And somehow? These overwhelming feelings and pain are starting to seem purposeful in my radical pursuit of life.

I am a Statistics undergraduate student. A Stats graduate student at my university has recently talked about her internship in which she used Statistics and Bioinformatics to help patients with stroke. I got inspired a lot by that, and want to seriously consider if Bioinformatics could be an area of application in my career as a Statistician/Data Scientist. I have a couple of questions, and I hope you can help with them.

1. Could you talk a little bit about your background? That is, speaking of your first job involved Bioinformatics, what was your main area of knowledge and level of education? 

2. What are some highlights of your current work? In terms of involved projects and satisfaction.

3. Although I have a good computational foundation, with a degree in Statistics, I would love to do more statistical data analysis. What are some areas in Bioinformatics that I can apply/learn statistical skills?

4. I also plan to do a Masters in Statistics. Would it be a good move? Do you have any advice on how I should prepare for the profession? I am based in Silicon Valley, so I hope the location may help a bit. 

Although the title says Statistician/Data Scientists, I will just equally appreciate if anyone who has experience can help me. All inputs are welcomed. Thank you so much."
8be9y4,4,2018-04-11,Should I be worried about a drug test?,FlatPanncake,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/8be9y4/should_i_be_worried_about_a_drug_test/,"So, unfortunately companies still do a pre-employment drug screen. :( Although, I am not smoking for the time being because I really want this summer internship. I am trying to figure out if I should be concerned about failing my drug test.

Last night I was stressed out and took a couple hits of tobacco with my weed pipe that I haven’t used in a while. Now it’s got me sketched out that I maybe smoked some resin left over in the bowl because I hadn’t cleaned it will rubbing alcohol or anything. I didn’t get high or anything, but i’m still worrying about it.

I am gonna take the drug test either the last week of April or the first week of May, around that time. The last time I had smoked was March 24th (until possibly last night if I inhaled any bit of resin in the bowl). 

I have been a pretty consistent daily smoker since about Summer of 2016. I normally would just like to end the night with a couple gravity bong hits, and occasionally a blunt or bong rotation with friends. Starting fall of 2017, I went through 4gs normally in 3-4 weeks. Then starting in January this year I took off a little over a month of smoking (which was the longest since I started consistently). Mid February to March 24th I was back in my normal habit of smoking and also went to Colorado over spring break to experience the dispensaries for the first time and had a couple 10mg gummies and smoked a couple blunts too. 

I am 21 years old, about 5’7 - 5’8 and weigh about 165 pounds (Fall 2017 to now I have put on a couple pounds because of my busy schedule I haven’t been able to workout as consistently or have as clean of a diet as i’ve wanted). 

Ever since taking off smoking on March 24th I have had a cleaner diet filled with more vegetables and fiber and trying to stay away from more foods with high fats and carbs. I also am trying to get back in my workout routine and have been going pretty hard on cardio to try and burn off the little bit of fat I have put on. Been trying to drink a lot of water, and occasionally orange juice and an herbal tea at night.

There’s a lot of different information online about drug tests, some saying I’ll be clean in a couple weeks and some saying not for 2-3 months. So i am just trying to get some educated opinions on this topic since I have never had to take a drug test."

With an EFather and abusive Nstepmom, I still hold many grudges, unwanted memories... So the possibility of me leaving my mother's custody is a choice I rather not take.

Sorry if I type weirdly.

It's not like I didn't already know my biological mother was narcissistic; I'd say I've done well maintaining my cool up till the past two years when I was in her presence. I thought nothing would deviate from the usual tonight. 

It started off with me talking about RPDR, how I loved the community, the show. My mother suddenly took a turn of the conversation, saying ""you know I work in the mental health field, right? I work with those kinds of people all the time.""

My first thought was me wanting to say ""So you're calling them mentally ill?"" She was known for talking ill of others, managing to conjure a flaw out of nothing.  Instead I said ""What does that have to do with fashion?"". I wish I did not. She began to gaslight me after that.

It got so bad that she eventually came to the point of throwing insults at me, calling me a lowlife, intellectually stupid. I snapped, calling her woman, angry at how conversation had evolved from something so light-hearted to people dying in her life. People I did not know that she expected me to feel bad for. 

I did not want to hear another sob story of hers. I have multiple, but I dare not pull them out in a conversation about food or clothing or work because I felt that it was inappropriate.

She started getting closer to me, trying to hit me, while I kept blocking her with my arms raised up. I screwed up when I pushed her away. I wished I didn't, because then she had the reason to upgrade her attacks. She tried choking me multiple times, aiming for the neck. I put my books up between us that I refused to put down for some dumb reason. But I can still remember her hands on my throat. It scares me still.

She threatened to kick me out, call the police. Criticized me wanting to study for my exams and ACT, saying how spoiled I was to even be in  class (??? I am grateful for being able to have access to education, yet I am well aware she had plenty of access to it as well...she has a BS. I just want to graduate HS and move onto college). Criticized me for my choice of college, my intended major. 

I am just a junior, stupidly trying for an internship when I should have gone for a job. My other option for housing would be my grandparents, who live far away from my current school (they're instate at least). The only other sane family members I trust live over in the state next door. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I just need to survive for one more year and I can leave this state, but I don't feel like I can make it. I am tired, scared. I don't know how to live with this stranger. We do not know each other. She is too prideful for counseling. We have failed multiple attempts at reconciliation. I do not know where to turn. I just feel lost. I need advice to help me get through this. I am so close to finally being free, and I don't want to give up.

**TD;LR** Biological mother decides to throw hands after dumb argument, and I, who is tired of her continuously doing this (being aggressive), have no idea what to do."

[more Sara Lloyd-Gregory](https://i.imgur.com/H2FJHAH.jpg)

Height: 5’8”

Hair: dark brown, she wears it mostly in a bun or braided to the back

Eyes: hazel

---

Interests: Celestia love to read, mostly newspapers but the odd book here and there. She's totally into knitting, which is a pretty fun thing to do to take your mind off other things. Means she'll be seen wearing self-made ~~jumpers~~ sweaters or scarfs or what else often. Also likes to gift some of her creations to friends. She's also quite the nature person, meaning she might roam the castle grounds to just take in the surroundings maybe pick the odd herb for her potions.

Personality: Celestia is a warm and loving person. Her general character is compassionate, is very empathetic. She is also very aware though of the role she has as a healer and so often needs to put up barriers, be more strict and distant to not get involved too much in the personal fate of her patients. Celestia is very aware of that discrepancy and that's why her connection to her daughter is so valuable to her, giving her some personal breathing room. Celestia is pretty interested in peoples lives, not only for professional reasons so she's in quite close contacts with her friends still. But definitely also looking to make some new ones at the castle, some that aren't, like, an owl post away from her. Or 10 years old. 

Family Background: Celestia is from a pretty average wizarding family, if one leaves aside the rather large age gap that separates her parents. They met one day when Celestia’s father, Charles, was treated at St. Mungo’s and her Mother, Dorothea, was at the time doing an internship there, still attending Hogwarts at the time. The two connected and soon after Dorothea McMarshall left the school they started seeing each other more regularly and only a year and a half later Celestia was born into the family.

It was a quiet childhood in Wales where Dorothea completed her healer training before they moved to London when 1 Dorothea was offered a job at St. Mungo’s and 2 Celestia was close to attending Hogwarts. This was also the time when Phillip, Celestia’s younger brother was born. Celestia was sorted into Hufflepuff. She was rather popular with fellow students and got along pretty well with most of them, if she runs into students from then most of them would at least somewhat remember her and so would she. Always had a good memory for faces and names. Celestia has always been interested in Quidditch though she’s not a player herself. She’s capable of flying decently though.

Academically Celestia brought everything for the job of a healer as well as personally. She did very well in potions and herbology but really excelled in counter-curses. She shows compassion and empathy to her patients but can be very strict if rules of her ward are not followed.

Already from her 5th year at Hogwarts on she worked hard dot get her grades and recommendations right to be able to later meet requirements for healer training.

She graduated with NEWTs in all the classes required to follow her mom in a healer’s career.

Soon after she moved to London at age 19 she met a young wizard and the two of them fell madly in love. It was a passionate and intense relationship they got into but when after just a few months Celestia discovered she was pregnant he just as quickly as he came into her life disappeared again. Celestia had the boy, now a single mom, in the middle of her education. This did not make things easier for her the next years, but very much shaped her personality and character.

---

Educational Background:

After graduating from Hogwarts Celestia spent some time with her family. Her dad took her on some travels and after that her mother managed to get her some internships in different wizarding hospitals. Later when a she was eligible to apply she got the spot.

During her years of training she lived in London and worked hard and long hours to do her best to become the best possible healer she could be. Even if it is her passion there are hard times. Living  alone with a young son made times even harder and money was tight at times.

When at age 29 the offer came to take the Hogwarts position she decided it’s the perfect time for a change, and move back to her old school. It’s one of her favorite places on earth. She finds an apartment in Hogsmeade and moves everything there from her tiny one in London.


---

**Roleplay**: Celestia makes her way from the front door where she was dropped of by the thestral carriage all the way up to the ward where she sets up her office.

We are using a Wordpress and are using Xmarket as a theme.

We are using scanning tools to find mistakes, errors and other things on our website. However, last time we got a scan made by Website Audit and it kept on scanning. It reached far over a million pages scanned and after 12 hours we stopped the scan and got the result.

I do not get why this is happening. I think somewhere there is a loop being created and thus keeps scanning tools rescanning the same areas. 

For instance:
One of the results was the part 'Empty Alt-texts': 1360466. Which is abnoxiously high... I looked into this and it seems that all the media we have uploaded in Wordpress, has an alt-text. However, after looking in the source code, I found that the theme is generating images without alt-texts. 

This is one of many problems. But the main problem is that there is a loop being created somewhere which multiplies every problem we have. So I would like to ask you all: how do I find this loop and is there a way to fix it? Because it is a theme in Wordpress.

I do not know which subreddit this should have been posted in, so I am asking here. If there is a specific subreddit for this, I will post this there."

Not really dated this girl.

About 6-7 months ago I met her threw a mutual friend started talking to her started meeting her at the end didn’t work ( 2 months) out because we both just got out of a relationship and she would have internship abroad both did not believe in long distance.

Now about beginning of February she comes back seeking contact ( she still abroad but home 3 days per 2 weeks) we started off where we left liked nothing had happened felt great and everything promised to each other to take things slow, about 2 home dates further she messaged me that she has doubts about a relationship she doesn’t know if she is ready and to see me once in 2 weeks is not good enough for her and she is having a hard time making dicesions about choosing her friends abroad,home her parents and me. having doubts this early on is not a good sign.
So I told her that she is worth is for me to see where it ends but if this isn’t mutual we should indeed end things. She didn’t agree to end things because she didn’t want to lose me and she has feelings for me and really likes me and is almost crying about the thought of losing me and thinks I’m also worth it to see where it ends.

So that weekend we end op setting a date for Thursday that week

And then that Thursday before we meet, on WhatsApp she said she cannot do it that she is thinking about it everyday that having this much doubt is not a good sign this early on I love/like her more then she loves me. but she really wanted to stay friend and keep in contact wich I refused because if i accepted it at that time it wouldnt be a sincere friendship from my side which wouldn’t be fare to her and to myself. So I went in to no contact she didn’t like it but respected my dicesion 

Now 3 weeks in I have this gut feeling that I have to talk to her while my mind states that she was very clear and to leave it but also have this feeling she may want to contact me but because I stated to not want contact she doenst. But everything she says about feelings for me not wanting to lose me staying friends and keep in contact let me feel that she wanted to keep the door open for later and I have the feeling that I shut that door and doubting to contact her again so that door will be open again.

Really long story, I’m sorry

Has someone please some advice on what to do?

Thanks"
8bh889,0,2018-04-11,Self Defense Weapons,Christian314,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8bh889/self_defense_weapons/,"Hey everyone! My girlfriend has an internship in Haifa, Israel this summer and am worried about her safety while she is there (more so in the US tbh). I have been looking into different self defense weapons, but I’m not sure what to get her. I’ve mainly been looking into stun guns and pepper spray. 

I’ve been looking into flashlight stun guns because the flashlight is an added bonus. I’ve heard the sound of a stun gun can scare an attacker away, but I’ve also heard that the stun gun doesn’t hurt much unless you can keep contact with the person for a second or more. I’m also unsure of how effective they would be to a person that may be wearing a jacket. Plus, you have to be right next to your attacker for it to be effective. 

As for the pepper spray, I’ve been looking at ones that discharge a mist and ones that discharge a gel. With the mist, I’m afraid that in the case of an attack the wind will be blowing against her and will wind up blinding her as well. However, you don’t have to aim as accurately with the mist as you would with the gel. I also like the pepper spray that has an attachment that would let her carry it in the palm of her hand so she doesn’t have to fumble around for it. 

I haven’t been particularly fond of the safety alarm ones because you can’t use those to defend yourself, and if nobody is around then it’s useless. The plus side of those is that they’re small and easy to deploy. 

I also have to consider that she’s going to go out and usually doesn’t carry a purse if she’s drinking. Knowing her, if it’s inconvenient (like if she’s wearing tight clothing) and I get her a stun gun or pepper spray she probably won’t wear it because they can be bulky and annoying. In this case, a smaller device would be nice, but the really small devices have lower ratings. 

I would really appreciate anyone’s response on their experience with self defense weapons and what kind you like and other pros and cons of them. I’m also open to getting her multiple devices for different occasions if it’s necessary. Thanks in advance for the help! "

I've been dating my girlfriend, we'll call her Katie, for around a year now. We go to school in the same city, so we see each other every weekend and maybe once or twice during the week. 

We were really close during high school, but not super good friends, if that makes sense. We talked all the time over text, but we never really hung out, just because we both had super busy schedules. We grew apart when college started, but I invited her to a date night at my fraternity one weekend last year, and we quickly reconnected. After a few weeks, we started seeing each other. This is when the trouble starts. 

Last summer, she went to a state across the country for an internship, meaning we didn't see each other for three months. This is why we both kept things casual before that summer, because we both knew how much could change in three months. We definitely got distant and didn't really talk as much as either of us would've liked, but I attributed it to her adjusting to a brand new city, trying to make friends, etc.

At the start of this school year, she came back and everything fell back into place. Things were great, we both told each other we loved each other, etc. Then, I found out she cheated on me during the summer. It was just one night, but it basically confirmed my gut instinct that I had the whole summer. I know, I know, I should've gone to the gym, lawyered up (jokes), but I forgave her. She wasn't in the best frame of mind, as she only had one real friend (this guy), and she had been coping with the change by smoking a lot. I know nobody will agree with me forgiving her, but I found out almost six months after it happened, and I really did (and do) believe she had changed.

It probably sounds like I've been complaining a lot so far, but things really have been great. We get along great, I love her company and she loves mine, and we spend a lot of time together, while still also giving each other space when needed. Basically, I'd say it's a healthy relationship. But, the last month or 6 weeks has been... weird for me. Basically, I keep wondering if I'm missing out on the ""college experience"" by being in a committed relationship, and I'm always wondering how things would've been different if I had just broken up with her when I found out she cheated. She hasn't changed at all, and I know she isn't cheating now, it's just me starting to have doubts. Recently, she's started to talk about life after college, assuming we'd stay together, and while at first I was excited about it, lately I've been wondering if that's what I *really* want.

Since this is my first actual, serious relationship, I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is typical or not. Am I just in a rut? Is it stress from finals? Or is it an actual problem? I know the grass isn't always greener on the other side, so I'm also scared of just regretting everything if I break up with her, because I won't have any take-backs. One last thing; I'd feel bad doing it because, at the moment, she doesn't know that there's anything wrong. I'd completely blindside her, and even if we aren't in a relationship, she's still a great person and I don't want that for her. But, at the moment, I know that something has to change. When I'm with her, it's 50/50; some days it's great, some days I just feel slightly annoyed because I tell myself I should've ended things earlier. However, as much as I've been complaining, on the whole, things are still great. I've just been mentioning the bad, not the good. Sorry for the wall of text, but I just need other opinions from those more experienced than me.

TL;DR: Need help with knowing when to end my first serious relationship"
8bi0w2,11,2018-04-11,Just gained a little over 5 pounds and I’m not sure if it’s a victory or a defeat,rehab_baby,proEDadults,https://www.reddit.com/r/proEDadults/comments/8bi0w2/just_gained_a_little_over_5_pounds_and_im_not/,"I’ve been relatively skinny my entire life, peaking my freshman year in high school at around 5’9 and low 130’s (which is about 14 pounds underweight), fluctuating by about 10 pounds in either direction every now and then. You could see my ribs, you could see my abs, you could see my hip bones. I’m a trans woman, and while I didn’t really acknowledge it at the time, I liked how androgynous my face and body looked while at that weight.

Flash forward to my senior year of high school, I’m older, drinking heavily, my metabolism is slowed from basically not eating for 6+ years, I’m covered in a thin layer of grime and I’m trying desperately to have a normal relationship with food. I was underweight, I meet someone, we fall in love, I eat more because I’m feeling a little more confident, and end up being around 160.

I go off to wilderness rehab, gain weight up until I’m at around 165 because I’m doing strength training all the time in the yard and out in the field, and start purging to try to get back down to the low 150s, hypothetically losing the the fat while keeping most of the muscle. It doesn’t work and I fluctuate between 155-170 until I leave to go to a second rehab.

At the second rehab I don’t purge but I fast, losing around 20 pounds in 2 months. I get put under supervision and threatened with an ED inpatient program if I lose any more weight.

I leave at around 155 and move to do an internship. I stay at around 155, but slowly gain weight until I am where I am right now, 160, because I’ve stopped purging regularly. I’m still slim, but I have a little more meat on my bones.

I feel fat and disgusting but also realize that I’ve come a long way from being on amphetamines and throwing up in the woods, and now reside in the middle of the “healthy weight” chart. I’m debating on either maintaining around this weight, or drastically dropping down to around 110-120

TL;DR I’m conflicted about some weight gain because I’m not purging or restricting as regularly, and I’m either going to continue eating light meals regularly, or try to fast and purge so I go from 5’9 160 to 5’9 110-120. I want to be healthy, and I’m still slim, but I also want to be as skinny as I used to be.

Any thoughts?

I'm rewatching after years, I'm on season 6, maybe after all of her incoming traumas I'm gonna feel diffrent, but now...

She's rude. She's simply a bitch. She treats her interns like crap and she doesn't even trying to teach them. 

She is the best, she is the only one that counts, her skills and her career are the most important thing in the hospital, all the attendings should do nothing but teach her. And of course, cardio gods should make her their priorite, because cardio is hers and no one could do cardio too because it's her thing.

Yes - she is the most talented resident, but in reality, in teaching hospital, attendings must teach everyone, not only one in billion special snowflakes, because people need average, good doctors too. 

And seriously, she has so little bed side manner. She's basicly the butcher (and she's proud of it). No, having no emotions and no social skills doesn't make you a better doctor. Makes you a butcher. I don't think Izzie Stevens with her ""I love patients so much I killed one of them"" is better option, but doctors, even surgeons, should be kind and gentle with patients.

Soooo... why people like Yang so much? Because they too want to be this hardcore, talented, cold stones? I like her realism and sense of humor too, but her other attributes ruined that for me.

Cristina is egocentric, egoistic, knows-it-all - maybe this makes her a better butcher, but definetly not a better person and not a better psychician in general.

Edit: Yes, I know she is a well-written character and I love how good actress Sandra Oh is - but it's just doesn't make Cristina likeable for me."

My company has suggested living in Fairfield University intern housing, where some interns from my company and other companies will be living. It would be a great place to be around people my age.

However, rent will be $345 per week and I feel like I can find cheaper housing even in NYC. I also want to be close to NYC for its vibrant city life, close proximity to friends, and night life. But the commute for the places I've been looking at (Columbia University Housing) will be an hour 20 minute commute. 

1) Will the 1 hr 20 min reverse commute from NYC to Stamford be worth it?

2) Is there a closer place to live (in between NYC and Stamford)?

3) Should I just live in the Fairfield University Intern Housing?

8bidcl,40,2018-04-11,The Athletic: How Mike Maccagnan's draft record stacks up against fellow NFL general managers,dragonforcingmywayup,nyjets,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyjets/comments/8bidcl/the_athletic_how_mike_maccagnans_draft_record/,"https://theathletic.com/306614/2018/04/11/how-mike-maccagnans-draft-record-stacks-up-against-fellow-nfl-general-managers/



When the Jets introduced Mike Maccagnan as their general manager in 2015, they did so with a label. He was a tried and true football guy. No glitz. No glam. Just a film junkie with an addiction for coffee whose ideal vacation was a cross-country scouting trip.

Maccagnan believed the best way to build a team was through the draft. That's what he was taught throughout his career, what he wanted to do in New York, and what so far, he has.

In two weeks, Maccagnan will conduct his fourth draft from team headquarters in Florham Park. This one, undoubtedly, is his biggest. The Jets hold the No. 3 pick. They've got to pick the right player.

But will they?

Maccagnan's track record leaves wiggle room for both outcomes.

The Jets have drafted 22 players since 2015. Of those players, seven became every week starters before or during 2017. Leonard Williams is a cornerstone defensive end. Darron Lee a solid inside linebacker. Jamal Adams and Marcus Maye are there at safety. Jordan Jenkins at outside linebacker. Brandon Shell at right tackle. Lachlan Edwards at punter.

Maccagnan found a starter with 32 percent of his draft picks. That's not bad. Not bad at all. It's actually among the league's best.

Twenty-three other franchises had the same regime draft from 2015 through 2017. This includes the Giants (Jerry Reese), Redskins (Scot McCloughan) and Panthers (Dave Gettleman) who then made changes. Maccagnan's starter percentage ranks ninth, but just the Saints, Broncos and Giants drafted more starters (8) those three years.

It's not just about the starters, though. Players drafted in the later rounds are expected to have roles. Maccagnan's been able to fill out his team with core special teamers like receiver Charone Peake and linebacker Dylan Donahue. He drafted third-down running back Eli McGuire in the sixth round last year. McGuire finished with 477 yards playing behind Matt Forte and Bilal Powell.

Of every player Maccagnan's drafted, just one is no longer with the team — the lowest total of the aforementioned 23. The Jets cut guard Jarvis Harrison, a fifth-round pick in 2015, during training camp his sophomore season.

The Vikings (26), Ravens (24), Bengals (22) and Packers (22) are the only teams with more draft picks than the Jets on their current roster. But those teams had 29, 27, 27 and 25 picks from 2015 through 2017. The Jets had just 22. Those teams also found starters on just 20, 14, 14 and 24 percent of their picks.

Sound good? It should. But now for the other shoe to drop. While Maccagnan's been able to find starters, he hasn't found many dominant players. It's a big reason New York's won only 10 of its last 32 games.

Lee, while athletic, is undersized (6-1, 232) for a linebacker. He struggles in the box. He finished 2017 with a ProFootballFocus grade of negative-20.9. Shell allowed six sacks and had a PFF grade of negative-9.9. Jenkins, while a capable run-stuffer, has just 5.5 sacks in 30 career games. Edwards is a punter.

Quarterback Bryce Petty (4th round, 2015) isn't a capable backup quarterback. Linebacker Lorenzo Mauldin (third round, 2015) isn't the pass rusher the Jets hoped, nor is Juston Burris (fourth round, 2016) the corner they envisioned. It's hard to see nose tackle Deon Simon (seventh round, 2015) making it out of training camp.

Starting is fine. Special teams contributors are needed. But finding game-changing players is what elevates a team to contention.

The Jaguars drafted six starters from 2015 through 2017, among them cornerback Jalen Ramsey (2016 first round), linebacker Myles Jack (2016 second round), defensive end Yannick Ngakoue (2016 third round) and running back Leonard Fournette (2017 first round). Ramsey is arguably the best corner in the game, Jack a dominant defender, Ngakoue had 11 sacks last year and Fournette is an offensive weapon.

The Falcons also found six starters in those three drafts — three of which have already earned Pro Bowl honors. Pass rusher Vic Beasley (2015 first round) went in 2016. Safety Keanu Neal (2016 first round) and linebacker Deion Jones (2016 second round) went in 2017.

Of the 22 players drafted by the Jets, few have the potential of those mentioned above. Adams does, sure, but the jury's out on if Williams will ever be elite, or just very good. Same for Maye.

Excluding players drafted in 2017, and including only those picked within the first two rounds, Maccagnan found as many or more busts than those 23 other teams.

He took Ohio State receiver Devin Smith in the second round in 2015.  He's played in just 14 games in three years after tearing his ACL twice (2015, 2017). He has 10 catches for 115 yards and one touchdown. Maccagnan took quarterback Christian Hackenberg in the second round in 2016. He's one of three players in NFL history to be drafted within the first two rounds, then not play a single regular-season snap his first two years.

So what's it all mean?

Jets coach Todd Bowles called the NFL Draft an “educated crapshoot” during the NFL's annual meeting. He's right. It's impossible to know 100 percent which players can and which players can't play at the next level.

For every Carson Wentz, there's a Joey Harrington. For every Ezekiel Elliott, there's a Ron Dayne. For every Odell Beckham Jr., there's a Charles Rogers.

Maccagnan first started scouting as an intern with the Redskins in 1990. He held nine other positions before joining the Jets near three decades later.

He's had some hits and few misses in the years since.

It's impossible to know what's coming next, but he has as good a shot as any other general manager of getting it right."

I never did good in my programming classes.
I was never good at math, my problem solving skills are poor.

Today has been the worse that my depression has manifested itself, this is the first time I've felt too heavy to move, to tired to wake up to go to work. Since I have someone that relies on me, and I didn't have enough PTO to call in, I had to come into work. I feel so useless here. When I first started this job more than a year ago, everything just seemed so promising, depression wasn't as bad, but slowly, working customer service, seeing the cracks in the floor of start up life it has really made me realize that I hate this kind of work, and depression has pulled me down into it's depths. I feel like now I'm falling behind, I feel like dead weight now, everyone is surpassing me, while I am wading in the waters behind. 

I feel so lost too, I don't know what to do, I've been on Zoloft 50mg for a month and a half and it seems to not help me at all and it took so much energy to talk to my doctor, to tell him- to say the words that I'm depressed, that I need help, that I think about suicide daily. Now I need more help, I need to change the medication, but I'm scared to go back, he said I could call him, and ask for a different one but I don't know how to ask for him, since he was not my main doctor he was someone else- I don't know how to describe it, like he was an intern or something? I don't know. 

I don't want to feel like this anymore. I've tried self medicating with weed, which has helped to be honest, I used to be so against it, so afraid of losing control of myself, of being manipulated, but now I've discovered that smoking has freed me, and helped me cope with depression- but since I don't live in a legal state I feel even more trapped, I want to try more strains, since they help me unlock parts of my brain I couldn't see through the fog of depression, and I liked that, but since I'm in Chicago it's hard for me to find someone who can sell it to me and I can trust- it's so scary. Maybe I should just move to a legal state. Though I have no idea what kind of work I could get there, if someone would be kind enough to hire me when i'm broken, I just want to be happy and secure. Suicide is always on my mind. "

8bk7lt,0,2018-04-11,[F4A] Black World Order - The Basic Protocol,Dark-eyed-dragon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8bk7lt/f4a_black_world_order_the_basic_protocol/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the  girl! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match!"

I draw everyday for over 4 hours, I'm so passionate and get lost into my work to the point my friends have to drag me from my desk, because I want to become better and even when I'm not drawing I'm thinking of drawing and coming up with ideas. 
So here is my question. 
I know for a fact I want to be an animator
Is full sail a good school to study Computer Animation ? 
I hear good and bad things about this school. But many of the bad seem to come from the Game Design major or music production. 
I hear people say full sail is a waste but when I look at the top animation schools Full Sail is always on the list. 
My dream is to work for a company like  Cartoon Network or Universal. 
Also how is possible to do an internship when attending full sail if there is no summer break? 
My main question is, is it worth it? Do company's laugh when they see ""Full Sail"" or will the only care about my artwork."

I may not have much experience on Reddit but I sure do have years of writing experience (where it matters). I took a hiatus from writing to get my assignments done for the final year of Master's (English Literature). I used to work in an office as a content strategist and it was a total chaos with a fair amount of exploitation. That work paid less, way less, for a 12-hour shift on an average. So, I decided to make better use of my writing skills.  

**The OneDrive link for sample articles and my published work:**  [SAMPLES](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AgzyQylLehphjCYZAcsnYXtZMO8b)

My specialization lies in **Marketing content**, digital or non-digital (Blog/Article, text on creatives, text on printables, campaigns, classified ads, social bookmarking posts, press releases, etc.). Apart from that I have also created **Mock Test Papers of Pearson Test of English** for an education company, wrote **sports &amp; fitness news**, and have a substantial amount of experience in **Creative Writing**. I never get terrified or agitated with the amount of work in hand, and better yet, the more challenging the work, the better the satisfaction of completing it. 

 

**Before you read ahead:** 

*If you do hire me at the end, I request you to give me honest feedback on the work. It will help me grow and will definitely aid the writing community.*

 

#**Synopsis:** 

******

I have not only written on **WordPress** websites, I have also worked on the **backend** of many. I have spent years of incorporating the right **SEO** practices in my writing. I started with Sports News and Feature Articles, where I learned to find a pattern in constantly changing **keywords** and hashing out an article or essay structure. I have also **trained interns** to write better using SEO practices. Then I worked as a **content strategist** where I added more to my knowledge of **Digital and Non-Digital marketing content creation** skills. 

#**Experience:**

******

Here are the types of work that I have experience in. 

* Digital Marketing content. 

* Writing/Editing Sports news and feature articles. 

* Fitness blogs. 

* Text for Printable. 

* Mock Test Papers of PTE. 

* Original scripts. 

You can go through the OneDrive link I have provided for the sample articles, articles that I have written for few of the clients and the links to my published work as well. **But you can also PM me if you want me to send you the links to my published work personally**. Also, you can check my LinkedIn profile *(Read how to contact section below).*  

#**Skills:**

******

* Refined research for increased effectiveness.

* No grammatical, continuity and structural errors.

* Basic photoshop skills, in case customized image for content is required. 

* Better efficiency to decrease the turnaround time. 

* SEO optimized content. 

* Fluid interaction with the client to understand the nature of work perfectly. 

#**Services and Costs:** 

******

**Blogs/Articles/Copywriting:** $0.08 - $0.1 per word. Depends on the amount of time and work required to complete the work. For example, if an extensive research is required, it will definitely take a lot of time, and hence, $0.1 per word. 

**Proof Reading/Editing:** $0.05 - $0.08 per word. Depends on the time it is going to take. Smaller pieces of work will cost about $0.05 to $0.06 per word, and longer pieces of work will cost $0.07 to $0.08 per word. 

**WordPress Backend:** $35 per hour. 

**Explainer Videos:** $80 for a minute of video. 

However, I'll happily negotiate whenever the nature of work/content aligns with my interests (for example, I have a fitness bug). But in any case, I would like to have a conversation with any interested parties, because I believe that everything is an opportunity to learn. What will I learn from a conversation, you ask? Well, let's just say, it will improve my conversation skills with a possible client. 

#**Estimated time taken to complete a Work:**

******

Generally, the quality of work depends on the availability of resources from the client's end and the time available for research. On an average, you can expect the best writing draft of 600 words in just 6 hours. Needless to say, I will be available here to make as many drafts/revisions, even after the payment is done until the client is satisfied.

#**Why did I leave my day job? (Read it If you really want to know) (SOMEWHAT NOT RELEVANT TO THE POST)**

******

To be honest, I belong to a small city, and never really liked the concrete jungles, the pollution of every kind imaginable is too much for someone with a routine and a fitness bug. But that job at least got the bills paid. The hiatus was more of a reboot, to get my senses back, I had to unwind myself, and look at the prospects that were kind of contingent on my skills on hand. Actually, I've been writing for 8 years now, if you count poems and long stories that are not published anywhere, as a testament to the writing experience. But professionally, I've been writing for over 3 years now and I am still learning, that is why I require honest reviews from my clients. I crave for the work that will push me into learning something new or at least makes me aware of what I need to learn next. One of the reasons to quit office was also the stagnancy in learning. "

I have described a specific situation below:

There's an intern (who is matched to cardio already, yay for me...) who is  disrespectful, loud, and arrogant. He interrupts others constantly, speaks with the utmost confidence even when he is wrong, and doesn't take feedback. During multiple attempts to give him feedback, he will smirk, interrupt, and argue that he is actually in the right. His program director is aware of the issue and has discussed it with him, but no improvement yet. 

I am looking for peoples' thoughts on two things:

1. What are some strategies to prevent his arrogance from affecting the team dynamic?
2. I feel like this kind of issue bothers me more than it should - how can I stop letting it bother me? I am worried about the patients he will harm and the med students he will model these bad behaviours to. "

Mental issues have hounded me for most of my life  (my first time in therapy was when I was 4 due to my behavioral issues), but they hit their peak in highschool. Which is so cliché, in a way. 

Anyway, around 10th grade is when I started my decline into rock bottom. Abuse at home and school made my anxiety go wild. I was having a panic attack every morning before school (the teacher that abused me taught my first class) and I started to self harm. No parted me wanted to live. Then, it got worse. Insomnia started to take root. This made everything else amplify. 

Junior year was worse. Panic attacks between classes. I stopped self harming but stopped really eating. Dropped to 100 pounds. I was sleeping an hour or less a night. My left shoulder was totally frozen and useless. The lack of sleep got so bad, that I couldn't walk more than 100 feet without needing to sit down. Stairs were awful and the school wouldn't let me use the elevator. None of my female friends were allowed to help me walk because it was a Catholic school and that didn't allow enough room for Jesus. None of my male friends gave a shit. To make things worse, I entered into a abusive relationship that year. This made all my friends pull away from me. 

The girl ended up dumping me the night before my 2 most important final exams. I should have failed them both but those teachers knew how bad my health was and gave me the pass (i did all my hw, asked questions, and went to tutoring with the teachers frequently, so it was not a gimme grade totally). 

Things were looking up through the summer. I finally got medicated, started to go to therapy (ended up stopping due a lack of connection with the therapist). I was recovering from my insomnia slowly. I was up to 4 hours a night with the rare 8 hours once it twice a month. I could move my shoulder, though could not lift more than a pound. 

Senior year was okay. Still had anxiety issues, but I was getting a grip on them. I thought it was all behind me. It seemed I was going to be okay. 

Then this school year happened. My junior year of college has been killer. 

I was raped august during the first week of school. I was carrying 3 jobs and 17 credit hours. My anxiety started to creep up again and my insomnia started to get worse. I knew I needed to up my dosage but getting an appointment was impossible because it meant going through my mother. It should have been an easy semester. I should have gotten a 4.0 but ended with a 3.0 and almost getting kicked out a class. 

I thought I could rest during the winter break, but I ended up working my ass off. During this period, 3 people very close to me were diagnosed with cancer. Everything just seemed to be going to shit.

This semester proved that right. All my classes are hard and kicking my ass. My job has slowed down which means I am dead broke. A very close friend of mine over dosed on his meds and passed away. I made the funeral but had to leave right away to go home and work on hw. Oh, I also somehow became a president of a big club on campus. 

I was cut off my meds a month ago. I can hardly function now. Getting to all my classes is near impossible. I spend most of my time crying. To make things worse, my mother has put a clock on financial support for school that is impossible and will kick me out if I don't get another job, do summer school, and do an internship. 

I just feel stuck. I have no safe space to try and sort shit out. Nothing seems real, my nightmares are back and thus I am not sleeping. I am so behind in school that I'll probably lose my scholarships due to fucking up. I just am stuck, lost, and confused. This is worse than highschool.

Fuck this post is just rambling. I'm too out of it to make this coherent. I just needed to vent."

I would like your advice, if you'd give it.

I have done searches in this subforum, and quite a bit on Google to the point where articles are generally just repeating each other (perhaps not too atypical), but I still wanted to ask some questions from those in the industry directly (as I also try to search some out through networks). Additionally, I wanted some possible advice and insight of my situation at the end.

* How generally difficult is it to find entry-level work?
* How useful is a master's degree (MSLA) to finding work or rising through the ranks?
* Is an associate's degree looked down upon?
* What does the average entry level job look like? (Assuming job descriptions are unrealistic)
* How difficult is it to get a license?
* What do you wish you had known, or had done differently, before going to school for landscape architecture and/or started your career?
* Other than a direct internship, what other related work would look good on a resume?

I've seen enough internet articles or Reddit threads to not need to ask If is worth it? (Yes); Do you have to be a great drawer? (Not necessarily); Is the pay good? (Kind of, depends); How many hours do you work? (Depends); Do you get recognized and allowed into all the clubs? (Yes).

-----
This is where I outline my life story and you get bored. I am not expecting anyone to be my career counselor, life coach, or spiritual advisor, but I wanted to give a relatively honest assessment of myself and my situation and any insight related to landscape architecture you may have.

I have a bachelors in communication and am several years out of school. I first went into retail waiting for my break, then bookkeeping, then HR and administration and have been doing that a few years. I changed my major a few times in school, and never knew what I really wanted to do, and still don't. I keep thinking of returning to school, and each time I get nervous I'll invest the time and money into a new field that I will find out I do not like or am not good at. I'm still paying off student loans from my first degree and have many years to go.

Landscape architecture/design caught my attention, among so many others, many years ago. I got scared off at the time, but find myself returning. But I need to find out more about it before I commit myself to it. I also need to know if I have any current strengths that would lend themselves to it, and if my weaknesses will be insurmountable in this field.

Generally, I am very approachable and like to be around other people at work. I am patient, work well with superiors and subordinates, and have no problem working on teams, going to meetings, meeting with folks from other teams or outside organizations. I am not that great at making presentations, but I'm pretty good at and comfortable with giving them. I do not have a fear of technology or learning new things.

Conversely, I do struggle to multi-task and prefer cranking out one or two projects/tasks at a time (even though of the several jobs I've had, this is never something that is possible). I have a poor memory for details and tasks, and need to extensively rely on technology to aid me more than is average. While I have no problem working tediously at one long task, I like to work quickly and crank out tasks if possible, however, this can lead to mistakes, perhaps more than average. I like working with people, and can take light criticism, but do find it difficult to work with truly angry/yelling/aggressive managers or customers. I am fine with ambiguity, but don't necessarily do my best work under it.

Reading about architectural duties from online articles and job descriptions, and even the courses required for a degree, I am scared by the heavy use of potentially complicated programs for a beginner such as PhotoShop, In-design, CAD, 3D modeling software, etc. The same goes for hand-drawing/sketching. I know technical art takes a lot of practice, but I also believe I have little to no natural talent in drawing or art, and roughly the same for general creative design.

Lastly, after reading about all the different potential duties or specialties within landscape architecture, I find myself frightened by the above technical and creative aspects, but intrigued by the other potential aspects when designing: walkability, visibility, wind, rain, and sun exposure, soil types, animals that are attracted or repelled, moisture retention or repulsion, maintenance requirements, and general plant facts and horticulture to meet the vision of the users of the space or owner of the property.

I am not interested in just landscaping/trimming trees/gardening itself, but love plants and how they have different features to best suit people's needs and the area's parameters (space, shade, moisture, etc). Given what little you know of me, do you see red flags? Do you think a different job I am not yet aware would be a better fit? Do you have questions you think I should be asking myself?"
8bml37,1,2018-04-11,"So, I sincerely believe we can have another shot at this..",MindfulAlligator,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8bml37/so_i_sincerely_believe_we_can_have_another_shot/,"Background info, we're both 23. Alright, here goes. Hope I can include a TL;DR at the end of this.

EDIT: After completing this, I realize that I maybe just wanted to talk about it. It got personal, that’s why it’s so long. Anyway the question at the end remains and I’m looking for an answer to it. Still, it's not driven by feelings like ""I can't live without her, I need her, I'm desperate"". It's just that I feel there's many things that we didn't have time to experience.

So, I met this girl at a cousin's party and we hit it off immediately. I am more of an introvert than I am an extrovert and she was the opposite. We balanced each other out amazingly well and that was obvious even from the first 2 hours that we communicated at that party. She was very keen on talking with me constantly so I knew that I had to pursue this. After a couple weeks of constant texting, it gradually got more and more interesting and deep, straying from the normal chit-chat-y convos that you usually have at the beginning of meeting someone new. It became apparent that we were immensely compatible, finding out that we listened to the same weird music all throughout our teenage years, liking the same things etc. etc..

Thing is, this girl made me feel so confident. She removed every thought I had about filtering what I will say because she might not get it or feel weird and what not. She got me and I got her. We were both sincere about everything and talked about everything. She would tell me how she had no one else ever in her life that understood her so well. This feeling was so great that it felt amazing (and it kind of set the bar for any future relationships I will have).

I know that it's hard for me to explain something like that and convince you that I'm talking objectively, but I could tell that she meant all of the things she said, as could her close friends and also my cousin that introduced me to her. I knew that what she said to me, from the very first day till our breakup 2 months after (please don't stop reading here, I know, 2 months boo-fucking-hoo, but it wasn't like that), was true.

The attraction was great and we had this immense passion between us. To make things even better, after only seeing each other 2 times, we were so intimate that it felt like we knew each other for years. That was the reason we went from friends to lovers so fast. It felt like it was supposed to happen, excuse my cliché.

So, after 1 week of constant texting and seeing each other every other day, where we had the time of our lives (I'm still objective and talking about both parties), she started expressing some weird   stuff that bothered her and apparently were hardwired into her character. Her argument, basically, through this whole ""relationship"" was that she's coming from a bad breakup ( it really was) not that long ago ( it really wasn't that long ago) and that stuff is still broken and black inside of her. Meaning she can't fall in love. Can't or won't, never figured that out. So, she was constantly initiating talks with me, saying how we weren't in a true relationship, how we were ""keeping things casual"", how I shouldn't fall in love with her cause I will end up getting hurt. All the while we were behaving like we were in a full-fledged relationship and some more (which she acknowledged but made her feel better to say that we weren’t).

I may or may not have handled things from here on the optimal way, but let's say that I was passively expressing how I understood her situation and was in no way there to pressure her into getting in a situation that she wasn't ready for. I was supportive, without being needy or desperate. I just had big hopes that I could change her mind.

So fast forward 2 awesome months later, this conversation was initiated by her almost every other week and it always ended with her halfheartedly saying something along the lines of ""maybe we should stop seeing each other"" and me convincing her that there's no reason we should do that since we are both having fun and we can just wait and see where this goes, while living on today and enjoying every minute of it (I was starting to feel that things between us  might end sooner than later).

She was so absolute about this, because it was influenced both by her psychological status and her beliefs. She believes that in order for you to *start* a relationship, you already *must* be in love. She only had 2 other relationships before, both of them were already best friends with her, so it kinda makes sense that she would believe that, though that love might not have been the same kind of love we are talking about in a relationship.

And that was the reason things ended. One day I couldn't convince her. She just was so adamant and sad about the whole ordeal, feeling that what she was doing was unethical (having a sexual relationship with me, while not in love with me, hence not in a relationship with me, and said relationship could never happen because she wasn't in love with me, and she couldn't fall in love with me cause she always said to me ""don't fall in love"", which got my defenses up). This was the weirdest thing of our ""relationship"". An endless loop of beliefs that got nowhere.

The first breakup I didn't take that well. Of course, we ended things at a great and nice tone but I didn't get any closure. She didn't explain what she felt so I felt like there was another reason. So after around a week of no contact, I went to her house and texted her to come meet me so we could talk. She was so happy to see me and we both immediately said how much we missed each other and stuff.

We talked, I told her how what we had was worth trying and fighting for, that we could have some amazing times together and that everything else can be solved. And here's where I got the closure. She told me that she wasn't in a position to try and to fight for it because of a hectic personal life (work, uni etc.) as well as the inability to love (yet) that I mentioned earlier. That she could say yes and we would be back together again, but even from the next morning she would wake up thinking stuff like ""Am I leading him on? Do I love him? What am I feeling? What am I doing? He's going to get hurt. I'm going to get hurt"". Which would put an immense amount of psychological and emotional pressure on her, that she wouldn't be able to handle. That’s when I said O.K. I can accept this.

After that, we just stayed in the car listening to music, caressing each other, talking about life and then out of nowhere we just came very very close to each other and stayed there, asking each other “Why are  we still sitting here? We broke up 2 hours ago” and there we shared some passionate kisses for a while longer, before she left.

She send me a goodbye message later, telling how awesome I treated her, how good I was at understanding her etc. to which I replied something similar.
This left me with a great last memory to keep from all this, which has helped me loads in getting over it.

**TL;DR:** Met an almost-soulmate, the timing was shit, the physical attraction was top, the mental connection was top, she just couldn’t fall in love because of baggage and beliefs. Ended things great.

So the question is this, although not really relevant right now because I’m still trying to move on so I’m not going to text her now. We broke up 3 weeks ago, radio silence since then. Things were great between us and the sincere reason of the breakup was bad timing and that she still needed time to herself. I want to try and get another shot at this at some point. Getting back together just for sex isn’t what I’m after, so I want to wait a certain amount of time, during which she can focus on her emotional baggage and her work, so when I approach her, there will be more chances that she will be more open to a relationship.

**How long?** I know it’s not arbitrary and quantifiable like that, but I’m just looking for opinions regarding the whole thing. I was thinking of texting when the exams period and her internship end, which will be around June.

If anyone read this till the end, hope you have a nice day, you beautiful person!

Not passionate about teaching, and just follows  whatever bad advice my mom gives her.   

I am looking for advice to help my younger sister find some focus in her life. She has a lot of amazing qualities; she is kind, patient, and overall a pleasant person to be around. However, her greatest weakness is that she's generally apathetic and lacks the drive to better her life.   
   
My parents encouraged my sister to go to college because they honestly don't believe you can be successful without a college degree (I disagree). My sister, while hardworking, has always struggled with school. Going into college she didn't know what she wanted to do, so she chose nursing mostly because my mom is a nurse and she didn't want to be Undecided. Fast forward a year, and she's attempting to get into her school's nursing program. From what I understand different schools have different requirements to get into their nursing program. For her school she just needed to pass some certain test. Well she didn't pass the first time, but she said that was because a major part of the test was over Anatomy II and she had only taken Anatomy I at the time. So the next semester, while she's currently taking Anatomy II, she attempts this test again but fails. She was unaware that you can only take this test two times in a year, so now she's SOL. She was never really passionate about nursing to begin with, so now my mom is encouraging her to be a middle school science/math teacher. Why you ask? They want something that her current credits will transfer to, my sister is pretty good with kids, and my sister doesn't want to transfer to another school (there's limited degree options at her current school). However, this seems like a horrible plan to me for many reasons...   
   
1. She also has to take a test to get into the teaching program, but can't take the test until the Fall, so she couldn't take any more useful classes until the Spring.   
2. We live in GA and most of our tuition is paid for by the HOPE scholarship. This scholarship runs out after 128 credit hours (basically a bachelor's degree), so she can't afford to keep taking ""filler classes"" just to keep busy. My mom encourages her to just stay in school, but what's the point of taking classes if they aren't going to help you move towards a degree.    
3. Why on earth would anyone who isn't passionate about teaching become a teacher?! It's a tough job with little compensation.   
4. My sister is very sensitive and has this issue with crying whenever she's nervous or overwhelmed. I feel like students can be mean, and they will prey upon this weakness.   
5. Like I said earlier, she has always struggled in school, so it just seems odd that she would go into teaching.   
   
I've talked with my mom and sister a bit, but not in depth as I've been pretty busy finishing up this semester. However, here's some suggestions/ options that I've mentioned...  
    
1. Take some time off from school to work and figure things out.  
2. Consider transferring to another school that has a degree she actually wants to pursue.  
3. Look at possible associate's degrees.  
4. Look at possible certifications instead of finishing college.   
5. Shadow a teacher to understand everything that goes on ""behind the scenes""   
   
Other relevant information...   
   
1. While HOPE and my mom help my sister with school she has still been taking out student loans.  
2. My sister only works during the summer as a camp counselor, but has recently turned her nose up about this job. She's planning on taking classes rather than working this summer, but that seems extremely stupid to me considering these classes wouldn't actually help her.   
   
I love my mom, but I feel like she's a huge part of the problem. She often gives horrible but well meaning advice. Also, my mom often discourages working and supports focusing on school. This seems ridiculous to me. I worked continuously my first two years of school to avoid taking out student loans, and now that I'm at a harder school taking all my major classes I just focus on doing internships over the summer. I know my sister has more trouble with school than I do, so it would be hard for her to do both at the same time, but still...   

Sorry this got crazy long and God bless if you read the whole thing. How can I help my sister?

8bo5os,3,2018-04-12,My life story. Help!,jesmonster2,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/8bo5os/my_life_story_help/,"I kind of want to share my whole dang life story with you guys, because I am not getting anywhere and I want some outside perspective. As a child and teen, everyone EVERYONE always commented on how SKINNY and feather light I was. And I was. I was always underweight. It's genetic. My daughter is also underweight. It's not an unhealthy, starving underweight. It's a picky eater with a delicate build underweight. 

When I was 21 I went away to an out of state university. I didn't eat much due to depression, and I didn't have a car so I walked all over campus. I came home because I hated it there, but because of the extra exercise I looked GREAT. Everyone complimented me. That summer I started working out an hour every morning because I had nothing else to do. I looked the best I had ever looked in my life. I looked like a fitness model. Then I went back to my local university and got lazy again.

I moved out of my parents' house and was on my own for food. I became very stressed and turned to junk food and TV. I put on some weight and got out of shape again.That lasted until my mid-twenties. By age 26, I had put on about 15 lbs. I was still a healthy, normal weight for my age and height, but to me I thought I was SO FAT. I honestly wasn't. I just had a little bit of normal body fat and some feminine curves. I was not particularly athletic anymore, so I just looked the slightest bit soft. But in my mind I looked terrible.

 But to understand this, you have to know who my mother is. She is truly obsessed with fitness and her looks. She eats clean all the time. She does not eat any junk food. She is militant about the food that she feeds her family. She runs 5-10 miles daily. She says she is going to live to be over 100. She spends hours in the morning making herself look just right. She spends a lot of time and money on makeup and clothes. She always made me feel a little bit like an ugly duckling and a slob compared to her. I am just not like her. In comparison, I always thought I could never live up to her standards so why try? And honestly, her vanity bothers me. I don't want to be that vain.

So, when I gained some weight, it crushed my self esteem. I didn't do anything about it except for regular failed attempts at far too stringent dieting. I still had my mom's eating issues in my head. I was either stuffing myself with all of the junk I was never allowed to touch as a kid (candy, chips, ice cream, cheese, anything with fat or sugar) or I was running back to the eating habits that my mom taught me (vegetables, vegetables, vegetables and low fat cottage cheese). It didn't work. I just gained more weight.

Then in 2010 I went to Germany for a semester with some of my friends. It was the best time of my life. I met my now husband at that time. We were walking everywhere and getting way more exercise than usual, so I ended up losing all of my extra weight within a couple of months. I was also still in my twenties, so that weight just fell right off. 

Then the semester was over and I moved back home. I gained back the weight. In 2013 I started my master's program and got to go back to Germany for another semester. This was when I started dating my husband. I was in love and happy and I had lost the weight again. I decided to apply for a one year internship in Germany and I got it. So, I stayed for another year. This was when I got comfortable with my boyfriend, who was in excellent physical shape. We started just spending our spare time watching movies and eating. Eventually I moved to Germany permanently. We got married. We both put on weight. I got pregnant and put on more weight. And since we have been together (5 years now) we have only managed to both gain more weight. We are both at our heaviest and least physically fit right now. 

And my problem is that I don't really know how to lose weight. I started off as too thin. I always (except for one summer) lost weight sort of by accident because of a big change in my lifestyle. I don't really know how to make that kind of change now, as a SAHM in a foreign country with few friends and not enough childcare to get to a gym regularly. My husband works too much to take over childcare and let me go to the gym. I don't have the discipline to regularly work out at home (I have been trying to develop that habit again for years and I haven't succeeded.) I feel like junk food in the evening is my biggest comfort. I feel out of control around junk food. Even if I don't buy it, I get overwhelming cravings for it and I end up going out and buying it the next day or the day after. I am sure that my problems are psychological. I think I have in the back of my mind this need to make up for the deprivation I felt as a child and teen because of my mother's strict restriction of food and her obsession with fitness and looks. I don't really know what to do. 

Edit and update: I think writing this out and then thinking about it today made me have ""the epiphany."" It's not all as complicated as I am making it out to be. I don't have to start some crazy, restrictive, complicated diet. I don't have to start hitting the gym daily. Not that those things don't work for some people, but it isn't me. I have gained weight because I ate too much of the really calorie dense foods and I didn't move enough. I just need to do some form of movement that makes me breathe harder and sweat a little bit (or a lot) most days, and I need to add in some more nutritious foods that I enjoy eating. None of this requires me to make huge sacrifices or change my whole life around. Sure, it will be a change, but it should be a change that I feel comfortable making. I already have places where I can easily slip in some more exercise. I already enjoy lots of nutritious, good foods. I just need to make a conscious effort to work toward my goal without beating myself up about it. "
8bomv4,2,2018-04-12,"Me [22M] with my girlfriend [20F] of 6 years, are in bad shape because of my depression; Maybe leaving her would be what's best.",anpa4443,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8bomv4/me_22m_with_my_girlfriend_20f_of_6_years_are_in/,"I have been with M since I was 15 years old and for the most part has been a really great. We both go to separate colleges. I have always dealt with self-esteem issues and I think for most of the relationship, M was what gave me a sense of identity. I am not particularly skilled or talented in anything so I focused on being the best boyfriend I could be. M has always been incredibly smart, she goes to an engineering school and over achieves in almost everything she does. She doesn't have much time for me anymore but insist that she loves being with me. Me on the other hand, struggles in school, bounce from job to job, and for the most part I am pretty isolated from normal social interaction with people because I commute from my parents house. 


Recently I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 so their are days where I go from extremely happy to severely depressed and this affects the quality of my life. I am constantly struggling with staying positive and happy. I struggle with who I am. M has always been really supportive of the issues I face but I don't think she realizes how awful my life has become because of depression. I don't feel like I have anything to call ""mine"" besides our relationship. When I explain that to her, she doesn't see how our relationship isn't enough to keep me permanently happy. To be honest I just want to find more self-fulfillment in life. Because we go to separate schools, we have separate goals, different friend groups, and over all separate lives. I have very limited friends because of my commuting situation and it is hard to make genuine friends. I feel so alone at school, and seeing M with all her friends reminds me of how alone I am. Don't get me wrong, I love that she has friends. I just wish I had connections like what she has.


Here is the problem I am facing as of right now. M is about to leave for the summer for an internship at a prestigious school and she plans going their for grad school (She has it on good authority she can make it into this school for grad school). While I am happy for her, I wanted to take the summer as an opportunity to improve my life by setting up goals, making friends, and moving out of my parents house. When she leaves for Grad school, M was hoping I would follow her out of the state and live. The problem is that I dont want to move out of state because of all the issues i am dealing with right now. I want to take the time to really focus on myself and be a better person for me. This has led me to want to take a break with her and I feel so selfish for wanting this. 


I have made her feel so sad by telling her that I can't follow her out of the state. Telling her a long distance relationship probably would not be best for me because of how depressed I get. Her staying here is out of the option so now we feel like our relationship is on a clock. I kind of want to cut ties with her and explore other options but I feel so selfish doing that because of how unbelievably supportive M has been for me. She makes me want to stick this out with her but I also want to be on my own for a while. I don't want to break her heart and lose her forever but I also don't want to rely on her for my happiness or my identity anymore. I'm not sure what to do.


TL;DR: Thinking about leaving my girlfriend because I am Bipolar 2 and get severely depressed. I want to learn to cope with depression on my own and not rely on her for my happiness."
8borft,0,2018-04-12,[F4A] Black World Order,Dark-eyed-dragon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8borft/f4a_black_world_order/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the  girl! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match!"

I've got some struggles that I'm not able to overcome. Let me explain briefly my current situation.
I dated a girl when I was 17, in my Highschools years and we get in relationship about 3 years. That was my first ""true"" girlfriend, we made a lot of things together but I wasn't ready to be an adult, I had too much little things that she can't accept, the end of our relationship wasn't really ""healthy"". Months passed and I've changed a lot, reading a lot on self development, be more aware and conscious about my emotions, my feeling, in a way I was able to understand me more and anticipate, modify my reactions etc...

Anyways, a few month later we saw each others, she didn't want to be with me again, in fact, there is a part of my heart who wanted her, and another who knows that's not healthy and who doesn't want to get in the relationship with her again.

From this day, we spent 2 another years without be in relationship, we get layed, we visit a lot of things, in a good vibe, in a way of a kind of freedom.

In spring 2016, she was in internship for her last year of Physical Therapy studies and she met someone, since, they're in relationship. The firsts months of this I didn't want to talk with her because I was kind jealous and I didn't want to hear from her relation. I prefered to stay distant. We call each other from 2 to 3 months without seeing each others. In april 2017, she told me that she won't be able to talk with me again because of his boyfriend, and she told me that she will never come again, never text me, never call me. I was truly heart broken about this news, it was one of the hardest period of my life because I've injured my knee and get 3 months in hospital for the last summer. 

Since everything, she sends me a message at Christmas just to say ""merry christmas, enjoy with your family"", something like that, some shitty stuff but whatever I've answered a good thing, to talk about my current life hoping that she will enjoy reading me.

Anyway, I've dated girls, maybe between 5 and 10 since spring 2016, i've get layed with some of them, was in relationship for 2 month with a girl that I don't have enough heart for her but whatever. I do a lot of sports, a lots of activity. I'm enjoying the game of dating and want to talk to girls in the street, I'm polishing my socials skills, I travel around the world but. She miss me in my life.

There are some periods when I'm alone, in my mind, in my room, in my bed, there are some periods where I'm thinking about her, about her affection, about her presence, and I truly miss that. I feel that there is no one who will be able to replace her. When I succeed with a woman, I don't feel attracted, I don't want to spend time with her. I've got some mental mechanism that give me too much nostalgy about my past. And it makes me sad, even today, 2 years after our last meeting, 4 years after our break up, I miss her. I think a lot of her during the day and I'm not able to overcome my feelings.

I really need some advices to get rid of it because it makes me sad and I'm aware that's not healthy, but I don't know how to do overcome my difficulties.

Thanks for reading me, hope you guys will understand"

But now that’s how I feel about you. We were never meant to be together, but we worked well as friends, and you were such a dear friend to me. You killed yourself 3 weeks ago, and I wish there was a way to get you back. The first time I met you, it was the day before Thanksgiving and you were working and put groceries in my VW bug. All you said to me was “ I hate beetle bugs, my ex had a red one. “ You knew who I was because you worked with my ex. You added me on Facebook a few days later and we chatted. We tried to date but we both knew we weren’t meant to be together like that. But you still always had the biggest crush on me, even though you liked almost every girl you came in contact with - I was a special one to you. Another time, we were in your car in the mall parking lot just talking. The guard thought we were up to no good in the car, but we seriously were just talking. We thought it was funny every time we saw a mall cop after that. You always asked me to go out for food, I always said no. But now I sure wish I would’ve taken you up on those offers. One time I’m pretty sure you were about to tell me that you loved me, but chickened out. You said something along the lines of:” What would you do if someone just told you they loved you out of nowhere?” And I responded confused and you were just like “ Just trying to freak you out.” My favorite memory is when I was shopping at your store with my grandpa. You ran out from working in the back to say hi to me. You were so nervous and smiling. I think I gave you a hug. I was happy to see you too.  Time moved forward and I met an amazing guy. You met a girl. The girl wasn’t the best for you or maybe she was. It was hard to tell how you felt since you were getting to the end. Your mental health was declining and you couldn’t think straight. You always pushed me away which is why we couldn’t be closer friends, which is why I didn’t hear of your death until 3 weeks after it happened. You left knowing I was taken care of though. You loved my boyfriend even though you never met him, but soon you will meet him because we will be coming to your grave sight to say goodbye. You were looking forward to my boyfriend proposing to me soon, you said you wanted to be there when it happened. You saw me through my abusive relationship, you were so happy I met this boy. We both agreed he was amazing. It’s coming soon, I guess we will just have to come back by your site so you can see the ring. The wedding isn’t for a long time but we will have to have your picture there so you can be ‘there’. I still don’t like your girlfriend you had at the time you passed. She still doesn’t like me. You said we would be great friends and I’ve been trying but as you said she is distant. She was the one who told me that you killed yourself. She was nice to me though when she told me and answered all my questions - I’ll give her that.  Remember when you wanted me to go with you for your tattoo? And you never ended up getting a tattoo. Well, I found the picture of the one you showed me and I will be getting part of it soon in your honor. I have to have something for you. 
I will miss you so much. Sometimes I hate you for what you did , but you couldn’t help it. Mental issues ran in the family. It was your time. I can’t help but feel like you’re giving me signs. The day your visitation was, was the day i got my CS internship. You wanted to get a CS degree too, and you knew that I wanted a job that kept me away from home. Well, look what happened. I don’t know if I believe in signs and whatnot, but I’m taking it as one because it makes me feel comforted you’re watching over me. The boyfriend has been so supportive through all of this, and even he is sad that you are gone. I was afraid that he would get upset at me for being so sad over you since we dated at one point. But he is not like my abuser and is with me every step of the way while I grieve you. He even said the tattoo is a great way to remember you by. You left and you knew I was taken care of, but I will miss you every day. Especially now that the proposal is coming soon. We were so excited for it to happen. 

So I guess this is my way to say goodbye to you. Maybe I’ll see you again one day. "

I’ve managed to miss minimal days except for one with a doctors appointment and few with school assigned meetings. This is since January, so I feel like I’m doing pretty good.

The past few weeks my nausea has increased and my appetite has got drastically in the other direction. I’m eating very little and causing myself to become dizzy and light headed. Today I wake up with nausea, blood in stool and stomach pain in full force. The my nose started bleeding and I cough up blood. 

I decide today is not my day. I’m going to stay home. But yet, I still feel overwhelmingly guilty. Like everything is my fault and my teacher will hate me for taking a day to rest. She’s never misses and comes in even though she’s sick.

8bpd16,3,2018-04-12,Happiness rant,LeavingBird,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8bpd16/happiness_rant/,"So, short summary of my journey so far: Last year, February, after years of daily smoking, I hit rock bottom after losing my girlfriend (weed, of course, was only one contributor to that). I had heavy depression way before that and self-medicated with weed to somehow get through life. So then I decided to get a grip because I just couldn't go on anymore otherwise. I started seeing a cognitive behavioural therapist, started taking SSRIs (Escitalopram/Lexapro, it's the same), started meditation, finding ways to cope and work through my issues. I even quit smoking cigarettes (months after quitting weed). I'm thankful for my parents supporting me. In order to get a grip and focus on solving my problems, I quit all my classes that semester, but by the end, I got some things done that put me back on track (internship, exams, etc.). Come summer, I was in a great state. 

On my travels, I fell in love with a girl, it was more intense than anything before. We saw each other often in late summer months. Yet, she was far away in normal life (3000km+) and, while first staying in lovey-dovey contact, by winter, she had moved on for practical reasons, while still being in frequent (friendly) contact with me. Not the best idea for mental state. Also, she's involved in drugs - and I don't think she's responsible or anything, but with her my resolve crumbled and I slowly started to do stuff like smoking weed again. Then, without her, I relativized my resolve more and more.

Winter was horrible for me (I had worse winters, sure), but I couldn't do many of the things that kept me sane and clean. After a while, little by little, I turned back to chronic smoking and other unhealthy habits in order to cope with sadness, frustration, stresses.

So cue a few weeks ago, when I quit contact with the former lover, quit weed again (for good I hope), quit masturbation, started meditation and exercising again - and commenting here... I'm so fine these days. Yes, sometimes feeling sad, but overall I'm happy with MYSELF. I like to get things done, I have a vision of where I want to go and I'm going there. Doing good things I feel happy about. I'm in contact with people and not so much a prisoner in my head. And I feel confident. A few days ago I was totally overwhelmed by how ok I felt, it's better now. I'm relaxed, calm, serene.

So, question for leavers: How do you deal with winter? When clean, I'm a pretty outdoorsy person and in Central European winter, I just can't be like that.

Thanks for reading and being parts of an awesome community. Comments, questions? Happy to talk about that all."

So the dream holiday for my BF and me is to travel to Japan. We bonded partially over our shared love for anime, Japanese food and the beautiful scenery of the country. Every time we discuss an upcoming vacation, half that time goes to talking about Japan. At the moment I'm taking Japanese language classes and my parents even got me a Japanese cookbook this Christmas, so please note that this is important to me. He's actually been there before he met me with friends. The dream is to take a month or longer and see everything Japan has to offer together. So far we haven't been able to go, as spending a month in Japan including flying costs A LOT of money and we've opted on shorter, cheaper holidays nearby.

One of his close friends, one of the people he has been in Japan with before, has found a great deal for a flight and they want to go a week to Tokyo. Outside that week flights are going to be too expensive to go. I'm starting my internship at the hospital soon and there is just no way I can go with them. Now I know it's just a week in Tokyo and it's not the same as our planned month of traveling but somehow I just feel incredibly sad and honestly a bit betrayed that he is going to be there without me.

My BF knows how I feel. Before he told me about the trip he said I have to tell you something and you are going to want to kill me. Now, I can absolutely tell him that I don't want him to go and then he wouldn't, but that would be wrong. However, I also can't just feel okay about this. I can't feel happy for him at this moment, I just feel sad.

Reddit, I need some help coming to terms with this and being able to feel happy for my BF. Please give me some perspective.

tl;dr: BF is going to our dream country without me. I'm feeling sad

8bq4ki,1,2018-04-12,Did Rory become boy-crazy since season 4?,CaramelCold,GilmoreGirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/8bq4ki/did_rory_become_boycrazy_since_season_4/,"Do you think that we started to see changes in Rory's character since season 4, because she was suddenly becoming more infatuated with love and guys?

Rory always had a very eventful love life. However, up until season 4 I always viewed her as someone who will not prioritize romantic relationships over her studies and her personal well-being. She could point out the problematic aspects of her earlier love drama, even when she didn't vocalize them, and was able to break free from them emotionally (I'm mostly referring to Jess). 

I was disappointed to see Rory dragged into an emotional affair with a married Dean, and later accepting Logan's terms of casual dating. Yes, the latter relationship at first made her unhappy so she made an effort to change it. And yes, she did write that letter to Dean. 

However, I still feel like the Rory we knew from seasons 1-3 would have just ended these relationships, viewing them as somewhat toxic. Lorelai certainly seemed to see them as such, when she talked to Rory about the Dean situation and later about Logan. 

Instead, Rory chose to dive even more deeply into both relationships. Her affair with Dean made her become the other woman. And her infatuation with Logan I feel pushed her to do un-Rory-like things: mingling with the ""in"", rich crowd she always stayed away from at Chilton; wanting to please Logan's father really badly at the internship, etc. 

I understand the writers' need to shake things up a little after 3 seasons, but this Rory seemed too different from the character I knew and loved already, specifically with her approach to romantic relationships, which I didn't care for."
8bqsfh,2,2018-04-12,[Budgeting] Salary negotiation based on costs of living. I graduate in May and need some resources to help,KirkTheCaptain,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8bqsfh/budgeting_salary_negotiation_based_on_costs_of/,"First, here are the questions I am curious about. What are common budgets or rules of thumb that a fresh graduate should use?

I've heard of the 50/30/20 rule and a few other rules of thumb but I'd imagine that in certain cities some of this might need to be adapted. Such as I read the 50/30/20 rule in a San Francisco sub where 50% of income went to necessities (housing, utilities, food, etc.), 30% spending money, and 20% in savings. It seems realistic, I'll be spending 50% of my income there but I'm not sure about everywhere else or in other major cities. 

I want to give a brief description of myself to aid in the discussion without having to post my resume(which, if it is needed, I might anyway). I'm a 22m from a rural area of Southeast Missouri with 35k in student loan debt. I have 2 offers right now and am talking to many more companies at the moment. Almost all of them are Fortune 500 or included on some list by Fortune of being ranked within their industry. I'm going into a sales role for IT companies to work with SaaS, Enterprise systems, Cloud-services, etc. I majored in Computer Information Systems and four minors - Marketing, Business Admin, Management, and Computer Science. I have a highly decorated resume consisting of faculty nominated programs and honors along with completing two tech-related internships. I've also been a two-term Fraternity president among plenty of other things. I was really involved in college, to say the least.

I come from a blue-collar family and have self-supported myself ever since roughly senior/junior year of high school. I'm pretty good with money but with the amount of rapid change happening in my life at the moment, I need some quick advice to help me negotiate a salary. I hope you all can provide me with some tips/general rules of thumb on building budgets based on costs of living for recent graduates. On my applications where they asked for a salary, I put ""Negotiable + Cost of Living"". Meaning that I want cost of living plus something higher that allows me to save a little, spend a little, and live mildly-comfortably when I begin my career.

Most, if not all, of these roles, are going to start me off with an inside sales position but not all are just your typical ""cold-callers"" or ""prospectors"". I'll likely be managing my own book of business that is either handed to me or built up by myself. With that, most of the glassdoor salaries for these positions in these companies are between 55-85k. Which is on-point to what my job offers are currently at. My goal is to work up the management chain, sales chain, or move towards a sales engineering role.

The locations of these offices are all in these locations: San Francisco, Atlanta, Austin, TX, and Dallas, TX, and one in Fort Meyers, FL.

It's hard for me to negotiate a job offer at the moment due to the number of companies that I am in contact with and the different areas. I'm in the second round or waiting to hear back from the second round for most of these companies but some have already offered the job. Normally, I would just look at CoL and go from there but there are plenty more factors that come into play other than CoL when negotiating a salary such as company benefits, commuting/mode of transportation, neighboorhood crime rates (if the offer is too low to afford something in a nicer area), how comfortably can I expect to live on a given salary in a given area, etc. 

So, if you forgot the reason for this post by now, I'm just looking for resources, tips/common practices, and ways to better determine what I should ask for when negotiating a salary. Things like the 50/30/20 rule or other rules that may be applicable to one place but not another. 

TL;DR - 22m graduating in May seeking help finding common tips and tricks to budgeting to help aid my discussion in negotiating salaries. A pretty high-caliber student in Undergrad with lots of experiences and recognizable leader across campus. "

After reading everyone's stories about career change or going back to school to pursue nutrition (in my case, a MS in nutrition) I decided to finally post about my current situation. 

Some of my background:

I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Public Health about a year ago. I always had the passion to help other's achieve a healthier lifestyle by educating them about the importance of nutrition without giving up the foods they like to eat (it's all about balance!) So I love the aspect of community nutrition. 

Currently taking courses for biochem and fundamentals of nutrition before applying AGAIN to masters programs for next fall. I'm also working at a clinical research lab as a nutrition assistant.

Because my background is in public health, which does have similar prerequisites for nutrition, I'm concerned that it would be harder for me to get into a grad program for nutrition. My GRE scores were not that great, and my overall GPA is at a 3.4 for the science pre reqs. 

Am I wasting my time wanting to go to grad school to get an MS, or should I just look into DPD courses and find my internship through that route? Looking through each accredited program is very stressful so any advice would be greatly appreciated. "
8brdmh,3,2018-04-12,[Long Rant] Feeling Stuck and Stagnant – Is HR for me?,FarJackfruit,humanresources,https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8brdmh/long_rant_feeling_stuck_and_stagnant_is_hr_for_me/,"I started working as an HR Assistant right out of school, and have been in my current role for almost 1 year. I had completed 2 internships prior to graduating, one in recruitment, and the other in talent development. Like most new graduates, I was super energetic and keen about my first role out of school as this is more of a generalist role. Now that I’ve been in my role for almost 1 year, I feel like I’ve stagnated, and I no longer look forward to coming into work. My role is so administrative heavy and the same tasks everyday. Whereas in my internships, I worked primarily on projects (project roll-outs, developing reports, analyzing data for planning) with some day-to-day administration. I don’t mind admin tasks, but I feel like I’m no longer learning as much.

I support about 200 employees in the office. Our entire HR team is simply just my supervisor and myself. My supervisor started a few years before me (also right out of school), and was promoted to be the HR supervisor right before I joined.  Although just slightly more experienced, I find myself turning to the supervisor for support/guidance to interpret legislation, but often, they are unsure of the answer. In fact, they often come to me for HR policy guidance…This presents a learning opportunity to figure things out on my own, but I really do wish I had a stronger mentor that knew the ins-and-outs of HR. I am afraid of being wrong in my interpretation, especially when it comes to legislation.

In my interview process I had asked about growth opportunities within the company, and the recruiter said there would be room to grow into a HR Generalist. It has been made known to me the company has no capacity to have more than 2 HR employees – that meaning, I will be stuck as the assistant should I choose to stay with this company long-term.

I also feel that my voice is not heard in the company. When I first joined, I was always looking for ways to improve processes, or bring forward my suggestions. After being shut down so many times by business leaders, I am now afraid to contribute my ideas. It’s harder for me to develop relationships because I am very introverted and reserved in nature. I don’t feel like I fit in here because I’m always professional at work, yet the culture is very “shoot the shit”, almost casual. There are many young professionals similar in age to me, but it is very silosed and everyone only hangs out with their department. I just want a work friend to have lunch with, maybe rant to sometimes, but who would want to be buddy buddy with their HR? Our supervisor has work friends, but they have admitted themselves they feel they often cross the line as a HR professional – I don’t want to be that person.

The highlight of my job is that I conduct all the onboarding and it’s helped me to develop rapport with our new hires. They come to me with their questions which makes me feel like a trusted advisor, and the feedback I’ve received about my onboarding has been phenomenal.

At this point in time, I feel so confused about where I want to take my career. I am afraid of jumping ship to another company too quick because I haven’t even been here 1 year. On the other hand, there are so many HR postings available, I feel it would be good time to join a company where I have the support and mentorship that I feel I am not currently receiving.

Sorry for the wall of text, has anyone else felt this way before? I just want to feel happy with my job again. I would appreciate any advice, or insight you may offer. TIA.

8brryq,3,2018-04-12,What are my chances for JET right now?,Riceyz,JETProgramme,https://www.reddit.com/r/JETProgramme/comments/8brryq/what_are_my_chances_for_jet_right_now/,"Hello there,
I recently found out about this program in my university a couple weeks ago through a meeting in my school. I thought it was really interesting to teach English in Japan so I went up to their website and found out the acceptance rate is about 30% at most. So I kind of want to ask what are my chances to be accepted in the application for this program.

I am a 20 year old university student attending University of Washington (Tacoma campus). I am currently a 2nd year going into my 3rd year. I live about an hour away from Seattle.

I was not born in the United States, I was born in Vietnam and move over here at the age of ten. So I am fluent in both English and Vietnamese for reading and writing. I already acquired a permanent citizenship in high school.

I am currently working toward an Information Technology BS and I am interested in working at an international level if possible. I also plan to go back to get a teaching degree because I honestly really love teaching but at the same time I love the technology field.

I am working part-time at an arcade and it usually get a huge amount of kids mostly from kindergarten to middle school. So my experience with dealing with kids is pretty much my job somewhat.

I do not really have experience in teaching sadly, although I'll try to volunteer or get an internship in teaching in my next two years if possible.

I know this sounds kind of long and plain, but I just want to have some kind of answer if possible to not get my hope up because as so far I feel like I have a pretty low chance. I know this sounds like I want to go to Japan because of the ""cool anime"" and such which I do to a degree. But  I am genuinely interested in Japanese culture such as how people behave, the culture, the tradition, and the food. This is probably stem from the fact that I use to live in Vietnam and moving to the U.S is pretty much moving to a different world, I want to experience that feeling again. Thank you for the replies.

To make this question less vague, I'm looking for answers to the following questions specifically, which I couldn't find on Spotify's website:

1. Do they recruit fresh graduates? If yes, which universities do they visit? 
2. Which universities do they visit to hire interns? (apparently working as an intern is the best route to getting a full-time position at Spotify)

8bs5p7,4,2018-04-12,Male student looking for temporary housing in northern suburbs from May to August,bheinks,ChicagoList,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicagoList/comments/8bs5p7/male_student_looking_for_temporary_housing_in/,"Hey all. As the title says, I'm a student seeking temporary housing from late May to early/mid August.

I've accepted an internship in Northrbook and am looking to minimize the daily commute while not straying too far from the city, so northern suburbs (Evanston, Skokie, Des Plaines, Park Ridge, etc.) would be ideal, but not necessarily a hard requirement.

Another nicety would be if the room were already furnished, but also not a hard requirement if the deal is right. I'd love to stay with other students, so if you or a roommate are out for the summer, I'd gladly sublet the room and leave it in better shape than I found it.

I'm a friendly, responsible, laid back dude (but not so laid back that I won't do the dishes), and can provide plenty of references that can attest to my qualities as a roommate.

If you happen to have a room available, or know of someone who is trying to fill one, feel free to shoot me a PM.

Thanks!"

It took virtually nothing for her to poison the family against me.. and for context I’ll try to include a text fsil2 sent me on my birthday a couple months before this all happened and a text from my fiancés uncle, (fmil’s brother) right after it happened. It has really hurt how quickly and easily everyone has seemed to wholeheartedly believe these truly awful, and mean spirited lies about me. Oh and fmil told fiancés uncle that I was “using” fiancé and compared me to his uncles emotionally unstable ex wife, and preyed on the fact that his uncle is a bitter divorcee woman hater, to try to convince him how evil I am so he would “talk” my fiancé out of marrying me. 

One of my first conversations w my fmil after telling them our engagement plans was this-

Fmil- “So, who exactly is paying for this wedding?”

Op- “well myself and fh obviously, as well as my parents and my grandma.” 

Fmil- “ oh well since you’re probably going to have trouble affording everything.... you can just use fsil1’s wedding dress to save money.....” 

Op- “ I appreciate the gesture... that’s kind of you, but like I said we’ve already bought, and paid for my wedding dress. But thank you” 

Fmil- *gets a snippy, pissed off look on her face* “well like I said it’s there if you need it.”

Since early in mine and my fiancés relationship, my fmil has always made me feel as though she thinks I’m “less-than” mostly because I didn’t go the education route SHE thought I should.. for awhile while we were living there she stopped acting that way entirely, only to continue shortly before the conflict happened. I guess she wasn’t planning on us getting engaged while we lived with them. 

She knew we were going to get married, but I’ve come to believe that she found it insulting that we dared consider something as “stupid” as getting married while we were under her and ffil’s roof instead of our own.. when I told my grandmother what FH’s mom had said, she was offended and said “seriously.. who does this woman think she is, assuming that we can’t AFFORD a proper wedding?? She literally knows nothing of your families finances.. what a classless woman.” My thoughts exactly, Grandma.... 

The day that everything went down, when fmil first started everything, she said to me-

 “ I don’t know how you and (FH) think you’re going to afford this wedding you want, you’re not even WORKING, and you think you deserve a wedding??? You need to get real. It’s not a good look and you’re basically being lazy” 

It was honestly so insulting after everything I had done, and had sacrificed for my fiancé (her son) to help him get to where he needed to be. Before we moved in with them, I was working full time, trying my best to pay both mine, and my (boyfriends, at the time) bills, he hadn’t worked for 5 months, he racked up a giant speeding ticket that turned into a warrant because he couldn’t pay it, that was $950 dollars of which I paid over 80%, tried to keep our apartment, and utilities going as well as paying for my car insurance, and cell phone, with no financial assistance from him. His truck ended up getting repo’d, after he had finally gotten a basically dead end job because his car payment hadn’t got paid in like 4 months.. so I was also taking him to work every day and picking him up around my work schedule, sometimes having to leave work over an hour early just to pick him up.. So he had credit card debt, a warrant out for speeding that I had to pay to fix, and he had lost his truck. So due to those things when his parents offered for us to move in with them, I only agreed because I knew that it would take a lot of pressure off of my fiancé while he fixed his finances. I continued to work full time, plus over time for the first 9 months we lived with them, and I was making significantly more than my fh helping pay off his debts etc. and when I did quit my job, it was literally so that my fiancé could use my car every day Monday - Friday so that he could pursue his dream career. And the second he was making good money, and I was no longer contributing financially that some how means I’m using him... right? She literally told my fiancé that I was “stealing him away” and she asked him if he actually loved me or if he was just with me because it’s “comfortable”

The biggest irony of this ENTIRE situation is that in 2016, when my fiancés older sister (fsil1) got engaged, she had just about received her teaching degree, and made so little money (after my fil’s had paid to send her to a private college), that they were still paying the entirety of her living expenses for her, apartment, utilities, car expenses, phone, fun money etc. as they do for all their kids, except FH that is... and her fiancé (fbil1) was literally LIVING WITH MY FIANCÉS AUNT AND UNCLE FOR FREE.. and fsil1 didn’t even live there with him.. he lived there so that he could have a pathetic sports journalism internship that he made $0 dollars doing might I add. And no one had a single issue with that.... So while fsil1’s entire life was being funded by my fil’s, and her (fbil1) entire life was being funded by her aunt and uncle, and his parents, and my fil’s paid for their ENTIRE wedding. Neither fsil1 or her now husband paid one red cent for their wedding... and no one told them they were being selfish, or lazy, or “stupid” for wanting a nice wedding. 

TL;DR- realized that fmil snapped because we told her we were getting engaged, she planned out how to get rid of me.

8bsoie,18,2018-04-12,Additional details on Washington's 10-year apparel agreement with Adidas.,TanzaniaMagic,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/8bsoie/additional_details_on_washingtons_10year_apparel/,"https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-football/here-are-the-details-of-uw-huskies-massive-10-year-apparel-agreement-with-adidas/

Some things that stood out to me:

&gt; - Cohen told the regents that, in cash alone, Adidas’ offer was worth almost $20 million more than Nike’s best offer to UW. A source previously told The Seattle Times that Nike was not willing to offer the Huskies more than the 11-year, $88-million extension it gave the Oregon Ducks last fall.

&gt; - The Huskies will also receive a $3 million signing bonus from Adidas, to be paid when the contract term begins on July 1, 2019.

&gt; - Adidas will pay UW an average annual cash fee of $5.275 million (that’s $49.75 million in total through 2028-29). To add context: The Huskies are receiving on average $775,000 annually in cash from Nike in their current deal (which expires in June 2019), so the cash in Adidas deal is worth almost seven times what UW has been getting.

&gt; - Adidas has also agreed to hire two UW students per year as interns as part of its internship program at its Portland headquarters.

I may not have much experience on Reddit but I sure do have years of writing experience (where it matters). I took a hiatus from writing to get my assignments done for the final year of Master's (English Literature). I used to work in an office as a content strategist and it was a total chaos with a fair amount of exploitation. That work paid less, way less, for a 12-hour shift on an average. So, I decided to make better use of my writing skills.  

**The OneDrive link for sample articles and my published work:**  [SAMPLES](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AgzyQylLehphjCYZAcsnYXtZMO8b)

My specialization lies in **Marketing content**, digital or non-digital (Blog/Article, text on creatives, text on printables, campaigns, classified ads, social bookmarking posts, press releases, etc.). Apart from that I have also created **Mock Test Papers of Pearson Test of English** for an education company, wrote **sports &amp; fitness news**, and have a substantial amount of experience in **Creative Writing**. I never get terrified or agitated with the amount of work in hand, and better yet, the more challenging the work, the better the satisfaction of completing it. 

 

**Before you read ahead:** 

*If you do hire me at the end, I request you to give me honest feedback on the work. It will help me grow and will definitely aid the writing community.*

 

#**Synopsis:** 

******

I have not only written on **WordPress** websites, I have also worked on the **backend** of many. I have spent years of incorporating the right **SEO** practices in my writing. I started with Sports News and Feature Articles, where I learned to find a pattern in constantly changing **keywords** and hashing out an article or essay structure. I have also **trained interns** to write better using SEO practices. Then I worked as a **content strategist** where I added more to my knowledge of **Digital and Non-Digital marketing content creation** skills. 

#**Experience:**

******

Here are the types of work that I have experience in. 

* Digital Marketing content. 

* Writing/Editing Sports news and feature articles. 

* Fitness blogs. 

* Text for Printable. 

* Mock Test Papers of PTE. 

* Original scripts. 

You can go through the OneDrive link I have provided for the sample articles, articles that I have written for few of the clients and the links to my published work as well. **But you can also PM me if you want me to send you the links to my published work personally**. Also, you can check my LinkedIn profile *(Read how to contact section below).*  

#**Skills:**

******

* Refined research for increased effectiveness.

* No grammatical, continuity and structural errors.

* Basic photoshop skills, in case customized image for content is required. 

* Better efficiency to decrease the turnaround time. 

* SEO optimized content. 

* Fluid interaction with the client to understand the nature of work perfectly. 

#**Services and Costs:** 

******

**Blogs/Articles/Copywriting:** $0.08 - $0.1 per word. Depends on the amount of time and work required to complete the work. For example, if an extensive research is required, it will definitely take a lot of time, and hence, $0.1 per word. 

**Proof Reading/Editing:** $0.05 - $0.08 per word. Depends on the time it is going to take. Smaller pieces of work will cost about $0.05 to $0.06 per word, and longer pieces of work will cost $0.07 to $0.08 per word. 

**WordPress Backend:** $35 per hour. 

**Explainer Videos:** $80 for a minute of video. 

However, I'll happily negotiate whenever the nature of work/content aligns with my interests (for example, I have a fitness bug). But in any case, I would like to have a conversation with any interested parties, because I believe that everything is an opportunity to learn. What will I learn from a conversation, you ask? Well, let's just say, it will improve my conversation skills with a possible client. 

#**Estimated time taken to complete a Work:**

******

Generally, the quality of work depends on the availability of resources from the client's end and the time available for research. On an average, you can expect the best writing draft of 600 words in just 6 hours. Needless to say, I will be available here to make as many drafts/revisions, even after the payment is done until the client is satisfied. 

#**How to contact me?** 

******

You can PM me here and I'll definitely reply under an hour. 

You can also email me: Shadsaiddiqui@hotmail.com 

And if you want, you can also contact me on LinkedIn while checking my LinkedIn profile. The link is: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdul-razzaq-076b89134 

 

#**Why did I leave my day job? (Read it If you really want to know) (SOMEWHAT NOT RELEVANT TO THE POST)**

******

To be honest, I belong to a small city, and never really liked the concrete jungles, the pollution of every kind imaginable is too much for someone with a routine and a fitness bug. But that job at least got the bills paid. The hiatus was more of a reboot, to get my senses back, I had to unwind myself, and look at the prospects that were kind of contingent on my skills on hand. Actually, I've been writing for 8 years now, if you count poems and long stories that are not published anywhere, as a testament to the writing experience. But professionally, I've been writing for over 3 years now and I am still learning, that is why I require honest reviews from my clients. I crave for the work that will push me into learning something new or at least makes me aware of what I need to learn next. One of the reasons to quit office was also the stagnancy in learning. "

At the moment it has been a very hard situation. My best friend's birthday is on the 25th of april. He has been a huge NF fan for years now.
As a birthday present I bought him a hoodie. I also wanted to buy concert tickets, but he's in Bangkok for months now because of an internship. Which means tickets aren't possible.
He is going through a lot of sh*t at the moment and NF is his favorite artist, the person he always looks up to.
I wanted to contact Nathan and ask him, if he could possibly send him a message on his birthday. I thought that this might cheer him up a lot.
Sadly Nathan does not answer. I tried out emails, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat messages.
I know that he's probably really busy and receives a lot of notifications, but I still want to try my best to make it happen.
That's why I would like you guys to help me.
Any message, any word that he receives might be a step forward.
I would really appreciate your help.
Have a great day!"
8bss3i,24,2018-04-12,Southern Charm Rewatch Season 3 Everyone Sucks,MrsCPDuck,BravoRealHousewives,https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/8bss3i/southern_charm_rewatch_season_3_everyone_sucks/,"With the start of the new season I started a re-watch and need to discuss season 3.  Shep is probably the best person on the show at this point, which is somewhat terrifying.  
My random, probably incoherent thoughts:

Craig:  when I watched this the first time I thought Craig was an absolute moron and SO cringe-worthy.  He's definitely cringey, but I also now realize how scummy JD was (and that we probably didn't see the whole story).  How did I miss the 15,000 dollar check?! That's a ton of money for Craig at this point, so I can kind of understand why he was so delusional regarding his role with JD's company.  He invested money, that would imply he had some sort of partnership, even if it's a tiny part.. JD acts like he's his intern; but I wonder what he promised Craig to get him to write that check in the first place.

Cameron:  I love Cam so so much.. I've liked her since her RW days.  I still think she's funny and like watching her on this show, but she definitely comes across a little mean-girl.  My interpretation is that she (and Whitney, Pat, Landon,etc) wanted to get Kathryn off the show by icing her out, under-estimating her importance on the show.  I also think that Cam was trying to protect her image and didn't want to associate with her.

Kathryn:  I must admit, I don't like her at all now.. but I felt really bad for her this season.  She was definitely looking at T-Rav's bank account when she first got with him, and she thought he would be this white knight to save her and her family.  BUT, I think she genuinely loved him and he treated her like shit.. and I can empathize that maybe that made her go off the deep end and led to the substance abuse issues.  That being said, she was in her early 20s, not her teens, and at some point she needs to take some accountability. 

Landon:  I never really understood why this sub hated her so much.. I didn't remember her being nearly as horrible as everyone has mentioned.  In season 2, I liked her! I thought she was an interesting addition- I felt sorry for her marriage issues and family issues and kind of understood her struggle to find a career.  Then season 3 started and she is awful.  My theory is that she was playing nice first season, and then second season she got the producer push to play it up this season so she could stick around (and she wanted to be in Whitney, T-Rav, Cam, and Patricia's good graces). 

T-Rav: still gross

Whitney: still strange

Naomi: she and Craig are so sweet at this point :(

Shep: This was his most tolerable season for me, I think. 

I will end my babbling now. (I apologize if these topics have been discussed before, but I needed to chat)"
8bt7g8,8,2018-04-12,First real craving,xcvb1235,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8bt7g8/first_real_craving/,"Well, I haven't had a drink since last Thursday night. I have never been sober for more than 5 days, so I'm entering into new territory. I've never sat through a craving before and would love nothing more than a very large glass of wine right now. 

As I was driving home from my internship, I asked if I was hungry, angry, lonely or tired. I am angry and frustrated with my internship, just as I was last Thursday when I walked out the door, prompting an insane binge drinking episode the ended with me falling into the sidewalk, chipping my tooth, throwing bowls and plates on the floor, cutting my thumb and spending hours in the ER to get stitches. All while mostly blackout.

 I have spent 450+ hours there and have about 24 left to go. I am angry at my supervisor's complete disregard for my time. It is disrespectful. I was there 7 hours today and did about 1 hour of work, all of it administrative work that she didn't want to do. It is unpaid. I am so so so ready to be done. 

I know that if I start drinking now at 4pm, I will continue to drink until 10pm. Tomorrow for the team meeting, I will be foggy and look like shit. After my internship, I will be too tired to have a much needed sober hangout session with a friend who is also reflecting on her drinking. Playing that tape forward. 

I will not drink with you all tonight!

Edit: Knowing that I could come home, write out this post and feel connected to other people experience these same feelings is incredible and honestly, probably what is getting me through at this moment. So thank you all :)"

8bw0o9,15,2018-04-12,Have you ever been diagnosed with your own mental illness and how do you manage it as a clinician?,healedheart1120,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/8bw0o9/have_you_ever_been_diagnosed_with_your_own_mental/,"In what ways do you feel like it helps you in meeting with your clients, if at all?  To what extent do you feel like it hinders you?  Do you ever self-disclose about your own experience with mental illness and why/why not?

I ask these questions because I am an internship student with my own diagnosis, and wondering if there are others out there in a similar situation. As I have started meeting with clients over the past few months, I realize how much I understand about their symptoms based off my own experience.  Sure, my experience is not the exact same as theirs, but I can relate to it to some degree.  I have my own therapist and I don't feel that my own diagnosis is hindering me in my practice since I have overcome a lot of struggles over the years and gained skills to cope. However, if/when I go through a tough spot, I don't know how that would affect me and my work since I haven't crossed that point yet.  

Once I am established someday, maybe years from now, I would be interested in disclosing just to help fight the stigma, but I would definitely be mindful about how I go about it, if I were to do so.

But I was just curious and would appreciate any thoughts on others' experiences."

8bw2xr,1,2018-04-12,F-1 Student Tax questions,strawberrytiramisu,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8bw2xr/f1_student_tax_questions/,"Hello reddit,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask these questions, but I have a few issues with tax right now.

I came to the US on my F-1 student visa in 2013, and graduated in 2017. I didn't make any income so I recently mailed in the 8843 form to the IRS. 

HOWEVER... I for sure missed my 2016 tax filing, and made internship money that year, so I know I need to file taxes for that year. In 2015, I used Glacier to send something to my university's tax comoliance analyst as according to what Glacier told me to do, but don't remember sending anything to the IRS in particular. I don't recall 2014 and 2013. 

So here is my question. How on Earth can I find out what I need to file to the IRS as of today? I know I was lazy in college and ignored all this thinking that it's not important but realizing how important tax related stuff is, I want to make sure I stay clean once and for all. However, when I call the tax transcript record system, they tell me that the request cannot be made (reqeust for tax transcript). First, I don't know what that means. Second, since I can't find out what I need to be filing, I'm not sure where to start at all.

Can someone give me advice on this?

8bwe6r,1,2018-04-13,I don't have anything lined up to do this summer that is related to my academic and career goals and I feel like I will be left behind and never get a job. What do I do this summer??,ElephantsRTasty,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8bwe6r/i_dont_have_anything_lined_up_to_do_this_summer/,"I applied to over 10 programs for this summer that are related to my area of study in college (bioinformatics and molecular biology) and I got rejected from every one whose deadlines have past. I am only waiting on one more, I get the decision in the next couple of days, but I have no hope based on my recent rejections. I've applied to about 6 summer internships across 3 companies and had no responses.

I have pretty good grades (&gt;3.2 GPA) and a lot of drive to accomplish things and get the job I want after college. My resume is good and my letter of rec is good. So I don't understand why I keep getting rejected. Lots of people I know have gotten internships or research programs lined up for the summer but I do not.

I always hear how important internships are and how not doing anything over the summer makes you look bad. And without experience, trying to get a job after college will be extremely difficult. So I am incredibly worried that this is just the start of a downward spiral of me trying to get experience but failing because I have no experience, then in a couple years after I graduate I'll be without a job. It scares me half to death because I want to accomplish things in the world of science and get the job I really want but I am so worried it will never happen.

To make matters worse I am taking it out all on myself because I do not see myself as worthy of anything if others do not approve of me (i.e. accepting me for a summer program). Basically I have no self-worth unless I accomplish something or someone recognizes my efforts and stuff like that. So I want to believe in myself, believe that things will be okay and work out, but I can't because I have no evidence that what I am doing right now is enough to get me to where I need to be.

So what do I even do this summer?? I can't take classes for transfer credits back home because I'm at my transfer credit limit. ""Learning a skill"" seems irrelevant because how can I learn a biology skill when I'm stuck at home? I need money too, but don't want to waste my time with a pointless summer job like I did last summer (working in a restaurant, for example). I hate where I am at right now but I can't do anything because its up to the people reviewing my applications. What do I do so I don't get left behind? I really, really want to have a good job outlook after college but at this point I feel like all hope is lost."

After going on an immense diet. I lost over 56 lbs and counting. I go to the gym several times a week and do cardio every day. I count my calories. I even wake up early to go for a 15-mile jog. I also take a picture of myself every day.

But for some reason, my body composition just refuses to change. I would go to the gym every day, but Uni and my internship gets in the way.

I also have been seeing a therapist who has diagnosed me with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD).

What I hate the most about my body is my face. Even after losing so much weight, I have not gotten any face gains. I also have just shaved a 4-week “beard” because I have a huge presentation at my internship in a couple days and I want to look professional. However, I couldn’t help but cringe in disgust when I looked in the mirror [PIC 2]. But if I could change anything about my face it would be my nose. It just so bulbous! It is also ridden with blackheads, and for the love of god, no matter how many searing hot showers, painful scrubs from those Japanese loofahs, charcoal masks, or skin care products I use there is ALWAYS a fuckton left. Seriously I’m surprised my face isn’t red from inflammation with all the stuff I do to it.

8byrhc,3,2018-04-13,My Testimony / Spiritual Awakening,FadeyPerry,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/8byrhc/my_testimony_spiritual_awakening/,"**Was originally going to respond to the thread that asked what events led me to believe what I believe, but I've decided to make it a post.

Galatians 1:12. Hands down the verse that sums it up for me. I'll try absolute best to describe my experience.  I was raised a Southern Baptist and just went through the motions of religion because of my family. Never once actually opened my heart or mind to any scripture.  I went to college, and again occasionally attended our BSM, very rare. At this point, I occasionally drank alcohol and nothing else. Graduated, finished an internship and moved far away. Central AR, to South Texas. Landed a great job, met a girl, and moved my best friend from AR to South TX to work with me. This became a challenge because his Girlfriend lived in AR and my girlfriend had THE most strict parents I've ever met, deeply rooted into Catholicism, she hasn't even spent the night at a friends house...The challenge was that we had always lived in a very small town, population of like 10k and now we were exposed to everything.  Huge culture shock. Just a reminder, at this point I still have 0 interest in Church, Religion or any part of it. Religion came up, I would just opt out. I believe on a date or two before I met my girlfriend, I claimed agnostic. 
Insert Drugs and the beginning of a very radical change. Living 20 mins from Mexico, ANY AND EVERY drug available 24/7. The drug use started out very rampant. It began with Pressed Pills of Ecstasy. It wasn't my proudest times, and I know they weren't all pure MDMA. We would ingest 2-5 average every weekend for several months. Our main jobs were Fitness Related so being in the best shape was always a must which I believed helped to expedite the ""come downs"" from the pills.  When our performance started to slip at work, we both agreed to relax. Several months go by and then we were back at it. It was now a laundry list of drugs this time: Molly, Cocaine, Pressed Pills, and two very key drugs that we both haven't ever used. Acid and Whippets. Best friend immediately fell in love with Whippets , and I was right there with him. The combination of that and Ecstasy was/is unreal. Most intense body high ever.  We both took LSD together and sat on our couch one night and just literally did the most clique thing you could do and watched ""LSD Trip"" videos.  The one thing I remember the most was that I wasn't sober and that the back of my head hurt so much from laughing.  However, I personally didn't experience any visuals or hallucinations or mind trips that were life changing here, to be honest, I felt that the LSD was a let down from others had claimed it to have done.  Performance now goes down the drain, we both had been unfaithful to our girlfriends, and sadly best friend ended up losing his job and started going back and forth from AR to STX. Mental state was very unstable at this point and my stress was through the roof. Very scared to lose my best friend and be 16 hours from home with no family around. Combine that with an unhealthy relationship with my girlfriend...recipe for disaster. Best friend spent most of his time in AR now with his Girlfriend trying to fix things. I felt that I needed to get my head straight.  At the time I was responsible for putting food on the table for 15 employees which was my main reason for stress, and I started to do well for awhile, no harsh sides from the drug use, work was fine, but definitely still struggled with a lot that had happened so far.
Another important event: One of my newfound friends/coworker convinced me to experience Acid as he had taken it before. I took a tab with him at my house and honestly just never had ever been slightly interested in spirituality, concepts behind it, etc.. The entire trip he was trying explain the ""I am You, You are Me"" concept and kept telling me to trace it back. Whoever I was, just trace it back. He also kept asking me if ""I saw it yet."" Or ""Don't you see it"". I feel it's important to mention those because they consumed my thoughts. I was very confused with everything. He explained that Love is everywhere and to be honest, I didn't really feel too much from the Acid, I do remember that my floor tiles were making swirling patterns. And of course, when I just stared or gazed at one spot my mind was definitely trying to paint a picture. This entire trip left me curious and I was constantly doing research on interesting drug related topics, such as Thought Loops, The Universal Joke people describe from whippets, all kinds of experiences from LSD which included spiritual topics, Ego Deaths, Eastern Mysticism...I went down all the rabbit holes. The reading never stopped.

Another few weeks go by and I'm back at it, this time with my only other close friend in my area. I'll never forget, nor will this explanation do it any justice, but I was on Acid again sitting in my driveway with that friend in my car doing whippets. Keep in mind this is my 2nd Acid trip and I now had just combined that with another drug that dissociates you...I was coming back to life from a Whippet and experienced what you would call my first hallucination. My Car Gauges seriously came to life it seemed and basically was telling me to direct my attention to my friend who was mid Whippet, I didn't have one clue what was happening and was a little startled for a second.  I sat there, and then did another one...This time, as I was coming back, I don't know what caused it, but I ripped or pulled my E-Brake up so hard and fast and something was just directing my attention towards the skies.  In my head, I was very shaken at this point and my conscience was starting to lean towards the possibility of something great.  I felt so overwhelmed with anxiety, worry and everything else at this point, that I immediately stopped.  I didn't feel safe, the Acid was peaking and I just didn't want to be in the car listening to music anymore.  Having read many bad trip experiences, I tried to tell my friend as calm as possible that I'd like to go inside and lay down.  He was very confused, as he was having the best time ever but agreed and we both went inside.  

Here's where my life changed:

This LSD was still hitting me in the face, and my friend and I were just laying there on my bed.  I felt very safe again, but obviously still had so many questions, my mind was just in overdrive...I did a whippet and BAM.  This is what I remember, I was laying on the side of my bed closest to my wall and my friend was to the left of me...This was actually the first time I had not been in a car doing a whippet and I always had closed my eyes.  Kept my eyes open and on my ceiling fan.  I kid you not, everything felt like it was almost like a sketch/cartoon and at the very top left corner right above our heads, there was what I still to this day believe was God.  The only way I could have described it at this time, was that it looked like a figure holding a lantern of light with an arm out, and every time I tried too look at him, the figure would notice and I would immediately look away.  I know this sounds just insane, but after I was back from the Whippet, I jumped up from my bed and was literally crying tears of joy, it was unreal how happy I felt at that time.  My friend was so shocked and confused, and I kept telling him ""DUDE, THERE IS A GOD"" ""I HAVE A PURPOSE"", lines similar to that.  Another important detail that I'd like feedback from is the description of the figure I had seen.  All I could clearly describe to anyone was that I seriously thought that God was holding a lantern of light.  I've never have or will probably be into Tarot Cards, but I ran across an image of The Hermit and that is the most accurate description of what I had seen.

Here's where it got a bit interesting, every time I tried to talk about the experience or about the  belief in god to my friend, I seriously felt that God was basically thumping me in the back of the head.  It's as if he was directing my conversations and wanted me to shut up when it came to any direct conversation about religion.  The rest of day was filled with silence, everything was different from this point.  My life was seriously completely changed.  I felt so many emotions, and I didn't even know how or where to being.  Looking back, I had more convictions than ever before and didn't know that I had to face those convictions and get my life together if I was to start this new life.  To be honest, you could consider this as Part 1 of my entire testimony because between then and now, A LOT more events happened that just solidified my faith but really led me into some very rough times/trials/mysteries.


I've got to get to work, but I figured I'd post this maybe as an interesting read for some.  I still am disappointed in a lot of my past actions and have had countless nights crying and praying for forgiveness for everything I have done and the fact that I basically have 20 years to make up for (Currently 26).  I will say this though, this started in May of 2016, I had that spiritual awakening in May of 2017.  Haven't touch any of those drugs since then.  I've never been more close to Jesus in my life and I've also been blessed with a similar job with better pay and benefits, I've remained faithful to my girlfriend since I gave my life to Jesus and I 100% agree with the scripture being our source of life.  I'll have to go into detail in another post, but reading the bible along with notes and signs from the universe literally led my life for awhile right after that experience happened.  And all of this that I listed didn't happen easily, right when that experience hit, I quit my job and moved back to my hometown where I remained jobless until September.  The events that happened between are also very influential to my beliefs. So this will be where I put up the To Be Continued.

8bzlvm,1,2018-04-13,My Undergrad Degrees Are Worthless,feelingScammed1,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8bzlvm/my_undergrad_degrees_are_worthless/,"I went to a state university as an undergrad - and ended up with a double degree in STEM, and in retrospect, it felt worthless and I'm bitter towards my old university for burdening me with 10s of thousands in debt. Add to that one of the top students in my program had died in an apparent suicide in our senior year and that destroyed me at the time since he was a good friend of mine and we had worked on a lot of assignments together. This can be a big problem in the ""hard"" sciences and engineering, but I partially blame the faculty and environment at my old university for this. 

I'm generally used to doing well in school, but my grad program has been kicking me in the ass - I need an extra year just to get my masters, and in my first year it seemed impossible to even pass my classes. Luckily I decided to go somewhere with no tuition fees, but it's not as good as getting a full time job or even a funded PhD position and it's really far from home so I can't just live with my parents. 

My professors at my new university have pointed to me lacking the background in certain subjects and have questioned me and where I went and what was covered in my previous courses. Getting the experience of being a TA at my new Uni has also shown me a lot of what I should've gone over in my undergrad years.  

I feel betrayed and scammed by my state's college system. Looking back, I should've seen how my courses weren't doing a good job of building on each other or making me retain what I learned. I also couldn't get a single internship in my time as an undergrad despite applying every summer and forming good relationships with my professors, which killed my ability to get normal person job after graduating. I also wasn't a particularly good PhD applicant for anywhere but lower tier state universities I didn't want to attend - so I figured I'd be better off at a much higher ranked masters program than a lower tier PhD program. I also didn't feel ready to commit to a particular sub-field or the long term commitment that comes with working on a PhD. 

I've cut off the majority of my old college friends who I didn't see as going anywhere with their lives - blocked them on social media, etc. because I felt like they drag me down and I didn't want to deal with what to me seems like childish complaining about their day-to-day goings on or their unrequited crushes (we're in our 20s, they should just fucking deal with it). Many of my classmates, on the other hand, were actually really satisfied with their degree leaving me to wonder how that could be and what I could've done wrong? I've only kept in touch with them since I don't want to unnecessarily burn bridges within my career, but I feel like none of them understand what I'm going through. I still feel like I did my best to get what I was supposed to get out of my 4 years as an undergrad, but I'm deeply dissatisfied with the result. 

I've learned a lot, kept up my goals and ambitions, and made a small group of new friends that I value, but I've become a bitter recluse who'd rather study in the library than go out on a Friday. I've noticed I'd ghost/block people over minor annoyances, I'd be rude to strangers, or I'd just act cold and unapproachable. I just want to move forward without being bitter and putting the blame on others and to also start going out and being extroverted again without feeling guilty for ""wasting time"" with engagements outside of studying and work."
8bztly,2,2018-04-13,At a bit of a crossroads--trying to decide if i should reapply this coming cycle or not,jovialplutonium,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/8bztly/at_a_bit_of_a_crossroadstrying_to_decide_if_i/,"Sorry if this would be better in the what are my chances thread but since this situation is a little different I thought maybe it would be better to post this as a thread of its own.

For some background: I applied to med school last cycle and I didn't get in anywhere (or get an interview). I have a 3.7cGPA, 3.5sGPA, MCAT 525, no publications but two poster presentations, experience with a few different labs at my university as well as internships and volunteer experiences both clinical and non-clinical that center mostly around mental health. I decided on the medical track a little late (my junior year of college, I graduated in may '17), so while I was/am happy with the types of volunteering I was doing, I may have lacked the hours or continuity of someone who has been actively working towards med school for a number of years.

Since August of last year I have been working as a clinical research coordinator and research assistant at the med school of a prominent university, but I have only recently started to volunteer again as this job required a move to a new state and I guess I just took a while to feel equilibrated with my job and surroundings. I should have started earlier but, oh well.

I am now trying to decide whether I should reapply this coming cycle or wait a year before reapplying. I am worried that if I reapply this coming cycle that my lack of volunteer experiences would be a red flag for ADCOMs, and also that my application may not be substantively different to the extent that I should risk applying again when it may not be realistic to expect a different result. I knew I would be starting this job in the spring of last year, so it was mentioned on my applications, though of course that is different than having actually been working for a year.

I do not really have an issue with working and volunteering for another year before reapplying save for the fact that my MCAT will expire after this upcoming cycle. If I want to reapply during  the 2019-2020 cycle, I would need to retake the MCAT. I don't expect to do nearly as well as I did in the past but I guess if anything this experience has showed me that maybe that does not matter too much. I know that in a medical career I would deal with things much more challenging than the MCAT, so ultimately retaking it would suck but if that would be too big of an obstacle then I have no business pursuing med school to begin with. Still, its demoralizing to imagine having to retake the MCAT not because I scored too low, but just because it expired.

Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble but as I said above I'm at a bit of a crossroads and trying to figure out the best move. I'm curious as to what y'all think I should do/what you would do in my position. Let me know what you think!

8c19hc,3,2018-04-13,First ayahuasca with the Shipibu,Toffe_tosti,Ayahuasca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/8c19hc/first_ayahuasca_with_the_shipibu/,"As I was networking to find an internship in the cocoa sector of Peru I got into contact with José, a member of the Shipibu family near Pucallpa. Even though I had made an internship in Piura region, we still held contact. When I expressed my interest in their culture and ayahuasca, he invited me to visit him in his house in Pucallpa.

After a journey of 1,5 day (from my rural town in Piura), I arrived at at the airport. We went to his house and I got to meet his family, we would visit 2 communities in the next day and have 2 ceremonies at José's home. The next day we left for the first community, where we'd meet up with José's uncle and return home with him. After 1 hour of travel by car and boat, we arrived at a resort with huts on the outskirts of a small town. Here, the uncle said that I was invited to partake in the ceremony there with them.

As it became evening, I became a bit nervous. It didn't make me sick, but I was aware that I would step into the unknown soon. At 8 pm it was time to enter the ceremony building. It was a big hut (the size of a small classroom) with a roof of dry leaves and 360 degrees open windows with mosquito nets. In the far distance a storm creates flashes of light, the thunder did not reach us. After a while of patient waiting, the group was complete. There were 9 people in the room, 5 of them were Shamans. Once if them decided it was time and commenced to pour the medine and bless the servings.

I made myself comfortable and tried to concentrate. There was no purge with any of us, but I did leave the room to urinate for about 3 times that night. It was as of the medicine chose my kidneys to dispose of the venom. After about 45 minutes the first Shaman started singing, others would soon follow. It took me a while to learn to appreciate it, but the reward was big. There were two moments when all of them sang at the same time. It surprised me that the singing was not harmonic, but chaotic, with each shaman singing their own song. It's like navigating in the jungle with no clear path. It soon became clear to me that partaking in the tradition itself offered a stable pathway through the night. 
By now, the medicine was in effect. The trip was gentle and allowed for many different thoughts. I prepared a long time to confront my inner resentfullness, but this felt to complicated to tackle. My mind rendered itself more useful for topics as friends and pop-culture. The shamans would move around in the dark room and sit in front of us to sing songs. It's hard to describe how this really affects you. I concentrated on the medicine and allowed my body to wobble along on the rytm. 
Questions became really powerful. As soon as they have been asked or thought of, there would be a sequence of reactionary thoughts that were partially predetermined, this occurred in seconds after the question. This seemed to be the ""ayahuasca-effect"" to me, the most distinctive trait of the medicine that I have not experienced before. If I got anything from this first experience, it is to ask with caution. I think there are two aspects that are fundamental to not let this effect spiral out of control. Firstly, you have to do your homework. In order to navigate through your soul, you need to have mapped it out sufficiently. And secondly, tell the truth. The lie has infinite potential follow-ups, and will unavoidably lead to the void. Which is also unavoidable to do, but you can at least try not to expose yourself to it unnecessarily. 

When the candle was lit, I stayed for about an half an hour more and talked a bit with the shamans, they said that they worked on removing my bourders. José's uncle said that I responded quite well and that a slightly increased dose would be good for me. He will host my second and last session this Sunday. 


I want to add to this that there is an idea that has kept me quite busy the last couple of months and it certainly helped me during the ceremony. 
The book of Genesis in the bible tells of how the world had been created by God. He spoke being into existence by creating order out of chaos. Of all the different ways that this could have happened, it was speech that were the most powerful to the Christian God. This implies that the true word, is a word of magic with the potential to generate structure as you move forward into time and space. 
I don't consider myself a true practicing Christian, but the biblical old testament stories have received my respect lately due to their psychological significance. "
8c1ak3,53,2018-04-13,Just finished the entire series! Here are my Top 10 Episodes.,SammyK123,blackmirror,https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmirror/comments/8c1ak3/just_finished_the_entire_series_here_are_my_top/,"Holy shit was this an amazing, yet f*cked up series. I watched the first episode by myself, then instantly forced my girlfriend to watch with me and then we fell in love with it.

Before I get on with the list, I have a few honorable mentions;

-Fifteen Million Merits (S1E2)
-Metalhead (S4E5)
-Nosedive (S3E1)


As promised, here are my top 10 favorite episodes.

**#10: Hang the DJ (S4E4)**

I knew I would like this one after reading the synopsis of it. It had a very intriguing plot, a couple that I was rooting for, funny moments, and (of course) mystery. It was one of those feel-good episodes and I really enjoyed the idea that all of it took place in their phones in order to match them up on a Tinder-esque app. 

Overall Score: 8/10

**#9: The Entire History of You (S1E3)**

This one f*cks you up on so many levels. At first you blame the guy who just seems to be overprotective and insecure. Then you find out that the girlfriend has been hiding something, but it was only the length of time she dated the douchebag. A few bad drunken decisions later, Liam finds out that the baby isn't even his. This episode was written so well, and it was one of the first ones that I fell in love with. I would soon compare the next few episodes to this one in terms of quality.

Overall Score: 8.5/10

**#8: San Junipero (S3E4)**

I don't know how this one goes down in terms of people's favorites, but I really liked it because it just felt like an actual movie to me. I usually am not a fan of huge romance movies, but this one really had a great atmosphere to it. I loved the idea of them traveling to different eras and I really enjoyed the portrayal of both main characters (especially Kelly). Her backstory was tragic, but she ended up staying in San Junipero with Yorkie. I will admit that this one nearly brought a tear to my eye, which is very rare. 

Overall Score: 8.6/10

**#7: White Bear (S2E2)**

The entire plot for this was just so damn intriguing. It was very similar to The Purge and I just wanted to know what the hell was going on! It was very suspenseful and had me questioning so much until they finally revealed everything at the end.. and what a twist that was. I was so torn because I didn't know whether to feel sorry for her or not. I guess that's what you get with a lot of these episodes. This episode is the point in the list where the episodes start to get ""great.""

Overall Score: 8.9/10

**#6: Playtest (S3E2)**

I love scary and suspenseful movies, so I knew this one was going to be good. While it wasn't too scary, it was creepy enough to make me feel uncomfortable, especially that f*cking spider thing... dear Jesus. It had a great plot and a tragic ending that left me so speechless. Great episode.

Overall Score: 9.2/10

**#5: White Christmas (S2E4)**

This episode... holy hell was it amazing. The 2 stories that Jon Hamm (Matt) told were brilliant enough, but then they revealed Joe's whacky ass past and it was absolutely insane. Towards the end, I started to piece together that Jon Hamm was trying to pry information out of him, but it was a damn good twist. And to top it all off, Jon Hamm's past comes back to bite him in the ass as he is blocked by everyone. This episode had me SHOOK. 

Overall Score: 9.5/10

**#4: USS Callister (S4E1)**

Another crazy episode that had me biting my nails, wondering what would happen next. I know that Robert Daly was neglected at his workplace, and I did feel bad for him, but torturing digital versions of the people who don't treat him well is just too far. I never expected the good guys to win in this situation because it is Black Mirror after all. Either way, I didn't know whether to feel bad for Daly (as it was only a game) or if he deserved it. Overall just a spectacular episode.

Overall Score: 9.6/10

**#3: Shut Up and Dance (S3E3)**

What. The. F*ck. This episode left me absolutely speechless. When me and my girlfriend finished it, we just sat there and didn't say a word for a few minutes. Never has an episode left me feeling so satisfied, yet uneasy, sad, and overall conflicted. Poor Kenny is getting blackmailed just for jacking off, which I thought he was just gay, but then they dropped that bombshell that he was looking at young girls and I was just blown away. That ending was just absolutely sad, and I honestly didn't know whether to feel bad for him or not! They just made him out to be so innocent that I couldn't help feel for him a little at the end. I mean he is going to get charged with child pornography, robbery AND murder...

Overall Score: 9.8/10

**#2: Hated in the Nation (S3E6)**

This episode was absolutely amazing all throughout. I literally felt like I was watching a Hollywood film. I am terrified of bees, so you can only imagine how squeamish I was when freaking MECHANICAL KILLING bees were the culprits to all the murders. The ending to this episode is what elevated it to one of my favorite episodes of the series, when they tried to retake control of the bees, only to have them reverse programmed to kill everyone who used the #DeathTo... And when we see the intern chasing down the guy who was responsible for it all.. chills everywhere. What an amazing episode.

Overall Score: 9.9/10

**#1: Black Museum (S4E6)**

This episode was just perfect. It had multiple tragic backstories, easter eggs to previous episodes, and a perfectly foreshadowed twist that ended with sweet justice and satisfaction. I have never been so satisfied to an ending of this show as I had been with this episode. When she takes the Care Bear (get it?), and we find out that her mom got to experience the revenge for Clayton as well, I just lost my mind. Definitely a strong finish to an amazing season and series (for now).

Hope you all doing good.
I am a student in university majoring in Informatics. I am really interested in web development, I applied to agencies and startups around my city and got accepted in an agency. I told them that I am looking for a part time job and they said its cool. 

They said I should do a month long internship first with them to check out my skills (self taught web developer). I just finished the internship and I will be talking to CEO next Monday and I am really not sure how I will go with it and what should I say !(Hey, I just finished the one month internship, do I get a job now or do you still want test my skills)

I really have no idea what I am gonna tell him or like talking about contracts of work and like salaries and things like that.
Like why don't they teach us these type of things in school ?

If you have any type of advice, please hit me up with it. i really don't know what to do."
8c2tw7,8,2018-04-13,"Bank statements, evidence of bona fide marriage on I-130 form: how much is enough?",MrDanhattan,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/8c2tw7/bank_statements_evidence_of_bona_fide_marriage_on/,"I [28M] am a US citizen who married my wife [29F], a Swiss citizen, last month in Switzerland. We are preparing the I-130 application and do not yet have joint bank accounts, lease, etc. because we just got married. 

First, some context. I am living with my wife for a few months here in Switzerland while writing my PhD dissertation remotely for my university in the US. We met while I was living here in Switzerland for a PhD internship. I went back to my university and am temporarily back in Switzerland again. Right now, we are waiting on my Swiss residence permit, which will allow us to open a joint bank account together here in Switzerland. In a few months I go back to the US to start a job. Obviously I want my wife to join me as soon as possible.

So, my questions. 1) Is it really necessary to wait for the joint bank account before submitting the application? We have photos of the wedding where we are both present along with her parents, my parents, friends, family. There is nothing suspicious about the marriage. But, I don’t know how firm a requirement it is that financial documents like the joint bank account are included in the application. 2) Will including one joint bank account statement really even help the application? The person processing the application will see that the account was only opened just prior to the application being submitted. Then, I would likely have to take myself off the account when I move back to the US in a few months. 3) I spoke to a financial advisor who told me it might be best to just write my wife into my will and include that in the application (I’m 28 so I don’t have a will yet, but I have some financial investments, so maybe this will satisfy the evidence of bona fide marriage requirement?).

Any feedback is appreciated--thanks all.

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

We met and things started off amazingly. We were from the same cultural background (rare), had similar values, both on the same career path, he was very good-looking, charismatic, and helped me in a very rough patch of graduate education where I was dealing with a LOT of self-doubt. And he reassured me, taught me to believe in myself. I believe I helped him too, he had issues with his family, mom was on psych meds and had some mental problems and he had an absent dad.  We ""fell in love"" and it was amazing. He'd show up with random gifts. Tell me everything I wanted to hear. We talked about marriage, kids, getting old together. That lasted for about 5 months... 

Things suddenly changed when he found out that I had drunkenly kissed a male friend before me and Nex even started talking (as in I was single at the time)!! I was made to feel immense guilt, shame, I had to cut the male friend out of my life completely, and felt like I had totally messed things up. Which I accepted, I repented, I did everything I could... never felt like enough. I even found out he had drunkenly kissed someone that same weekend I had kissed my friend, but when I tried to bring that up, suddenly it became my fault again?

Then, what was once the warmest sunshine of love and commitment started becoming cold and sunless. He started to chip away at my self-confidence. He told me I was too thin, he wasn't sexually attracted to me. Btw, I am confident in myself, and would consider myself an ""attractive female."" He would make snarky comments that I am a ""spoiled rich kid."" He never complimented me, or told me I was pretty, or made me feel good. Random girls started popping up on his instagram, and when I would get mad/ask who they were, he would make up some insane story about how theyre his ""sister's coworkers"" or that I am just imagining things....

I had now spent 2.5 years investing in this relationship, and he goes on to step 3: dispose. He pulled the rug out from under me, says that he has not been ""feeling this"" for a while and he needs some ""time to figure things out."" I went over it again and again in my head: what did I do wrong? What can I go back and change? I can fix this...! 

Sometimes he would do things that would push me to my limits, and I would be like fuck this, I'm done, I've had it BYE. Every single time: A few days later, he would text me ""I'm not a bad guy, I don't know why you think I am."" or something that would make me soften up and start to give in again. Every single. time. But then once I'd actually start responding or seem interested again, he would go cold. 

He drove me, a pretty well-adjusted and normal adult... to an obsessive point of insanity. I tried EVERYTHING!!! gained healthy weight, got a 3 month internship where he lives, showed up at his apartment unannounced and hooked up with him (multiple times). I just craved that warmth and sun of his love... and I would get high off of it, for a few days. I knew I was being emotionally reckless but I didn't care.

The worst part in dealing with an N is the gaslighting. He severely distorted my reality, to the point that even NOW, 1 year after breaking up, i feel like I don't know the full truth. I think he started dating other people while we were still long distance, but always, always made me feel crazy for inquiring. So many stories do not add up. I'm finally recovering, but sometimes, thoughts will pop into my head and I'll just wonder.. what WAS the truth??

This sub has really helped me because now I know the relationship failing was not really a reflection of my own failure (I am very type A and that has haunted me), but rather someone else's pathology. It's really helped me gain peace instead of obsessing over ""what I did wrong."" The amount of stress this roller coaster has caused me has led to physical manifestations: I developed skin rashes I think because of the stress on my body. I started taking anti-depressants 1 week ago and plan to see a therapist for the first time next week. I have implemented strict no contact (blocked on all means of communication) and I finally feel really good and strong about it. I know there will be ups and downs but I know that you can't cure this disorder and that I need to just *run for the hills* essentially..."

In order to be at least somewhat close to my family, I plan to work in Cali.

I have offers from both Canadian and American schools—while I would ignore these US schools because of their outrageous price, my wealthy aunt is offering to pay a portion of my education if I go south. This means that no matter where I attend, the price will be comparable.

**Offers:** I have an offer for the CS/BBA double degree from the Laurier side (yeah no access to WaterlooWorks is a huge downer but I will graduate with a Waterloo CS degree). In the US, I have offers from UCLA Math of Computation, UCSD Data Science, and Cal Poly Software Engineering.

**My thoughts on US:** US schools definitely have the edge in terms of recruiting and networking. Most students who I would go to school with will likely end up in California. The weather and school environment will be nice too (though that would be secondary). 

On the other hand, despite how F1 Visa students have work authorization, employers still discriminate with them (""why should I hire this kid who's gonna stay here for 4-5 years when I can just hire a citizen?""). In addition, having someone pay for a part of education can be risky (what if my aunt decides she doesn't want to fund me anymore?).

**My thoughts on Waterloo:** I guess I'm kinda biased because I've always wanted to go here since like grade 10, ever since I saw the Waterloo anime opening. Anyway, from what I've heard, Silicon Valley recruiters love Waterloo so going to the US and spending all that money isn't worth it. Plus, as a Canadian, I can find internships in Canada much more easily.

**Final Thoughts:** In the end, I really can't decide how beneficial going to the US will be, especially when compared to a highly regarded school like Waterloo. There are benefits here and there, and I would love some insight on my university choice."

8c5p7j,9,2018-04-14,Update 2: How Should One Work with Monkeys at a Zoo? More Questions.,helpmesavethem,CaptiveWildlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaptiveWildlife/comments/8c5p7j/update_2_how_should_one_work_with_monkeys_at_a/,"Good news is that I got the internship for the AZA-accredited zoo! Thank you to everyone who gave me advice for the interview and the zoo. Now I am in need of more advice, sorry this is really long. I’m just trying to give more context and a lot has happened… at the bottom of all of this text, I will put a summary of my questions at the bottom. 

From my last post, I told Reddit that I was still working at the private zoo and that I had reported them to OSHA, the USDA, and the Humane Society. Well, about a month later I received a note in one of my last paychecks written by the female owner. In the note, I was told that I was being let go because their family member who had previously worked at the zoo was being let go from her job at the Humane Society so they were hiring her instead, but if they needed any more help in the summer when the zoo opens back up to the public that they would contact me. The owners let me keep working until the beginning of April. 

To be honest, I think the owners and the main zookeeper found/figured out I reported them or I am being fired due to the head zookeeper not liking me since I ask a lot of questions like when is the vet coming, is the vet coming to see this injured animal, when are we cleaning this pen, when is the last time we cleaned this pen, etc. One day I actually with the head zookeeper about changing a soiled exotic cats' water. I wanted to change it since the cats pee and poop in their water daily and she told me they were fine. Being gutsy and annoyed with how things were at the zoo, I said, ""according to the animal welfare act waters should be changed daily especially when soiled. We also technically should be scrubbing out waters every 2 weeks, which we don't ever do."" The head zookeeper angrily said, ""helpmesavethem, you do not want to get into this with me today."" 

Now you might be thinking how come the owners don't know about this and why are you being fired for speaking up. Well, the head zookeeper lives with the owners (who are really old approaching 80’s) and I rarely see the owners. When I do see the owners it is always when they are about to drive away to go do something and the head zookeeper is right by me. I am assuming that the head zookeeper is talking bad things about me to the owners. The owners rarely check on their own animals (possibly because of age, but if they can still drive then they should be able to check on their own animals) and I have never seen them take a step inside the winter facilities for the animals (which also happens to be on the same plot of land their house is on), so all of their intel about the zoo (more than 200 animals including birds) and workers (4 including the head zookeeper) comes from the head zookeeper. 

Anyways, my last week at the zoo we were cleaning literally everything from the giraffe barn to the monkey room. Things we haven’t cleaned in over a month. The main zookeeper’s 70-ish-year-old mom (who comes in usually every day to cut up fruit most likely without pay) even scrubbed the insides of the primates’ water bottles, which we haven’t done since we first put them in for the winter. The owners’ family member also has not started yet to my knowledge (or to the knowledge of current worker/friend). So these things were leading me to believe that somehow the zoo received a heads up or that someone came (or it could be the head zookeeper being petty), but I haven’t heard anything from OSHA or the USDA. I also haven’t heard from other coworkers that the USDA or OSHA stopped by for a visit. 

Anyways, when I finished my last day at the zoo, I called the owners asking to do an exit interview and I asked them to send me an employee application for my records since they were mailing me my last paycheck anyways. I really just wanted to see the contract at the bottom of the application, which I’m sure they knew about because it’s really the only important part of the application (she highlighted it on the paper she sent to me). Well, when I received my last pay check, I not only received the blank employee application that I asked for but I also received a note again from the owner saying they couldn’t meet with me anymore and that I would need to reschedule the exit interview. Now that I have to reschedule it, I am wondering if I should meet with the owners to discuss the problems I have with their zoo or should I not meet with them because they might figure out the USDA is making a visit soon? I should also mention that they were against meeting with me in person for the exit interview and really doing an exit interview altogether. They reiterated that the only reason I was let go was that a family member was taking my place, but I told them I wanted to suggest some improvements that I had for the zoo (where I would also tell them about the problems I had with the main zookeeper). I know past workers have brought up the problems they had with the zoo and the head zookeeper with the owners, but it always seemed like the head zookeeper just gets a slap on the wrist. Maybe things will improve for a day or a week for the animals but then things return to the normal, poor conditions. So I am hesitant about doing the exit interview because I don’t think anything will happen and it might just let them know that I definitely reported them.  

I’m still talking with someone from the Humane Society and she is writing a formal letter to the USDA about the conditions of the zoo. It comprises of things she has heard from me and from other previous workers. I asked a family member who is a lawyer about the contract I signed with the zoo that said “no cellphone photography or video allowed unless approved by the owners.” He said that the intent is clear that it’s to cover all photos but that an argument could be made otherwise. He then directed me to the Animal Legal Defense Fund page. I emailed them telling them that I used to work for this road-side zoo with animals with terrible conditions and that I sent a USDA and OSHA report (I forgot to mention in the email that I already contacted the Humane Society), but I want to do something more. Someone from their organization contacted me and told me that PETA is working on them already and asked if they can contact me. I said yes. However, what I did not say is that I am kind of hesitant with PETA due to their reputation for not always doing the right thing. Should I tell them everything too or should I jus tell them that I already contacted the Humane Society?  

One reason to tell PETA is that they might be able to get something done about the zoo. It’s not that the USDA and OSHA are not doing anything (because I’m sure they are working hard on this case and on many different cases). It’s that the USDA and OSHA work on a random inspection basis and I do not know what else the Humane Society can do besides inform the USDA. Past workers have informed me that the USDA inspections are never a surprise because somehow the head zookeeper hears about the USDA investigating zoos in other counties or that they are coming to visit this specific zoo. When she hears about it, she makes sure the zoo is up to standards (maybe a few minor things are still off) until the investigation comes or week goes by.  

I have been doing a lot of research into the zoo and through a specific shutdown this road-side zoo page I found 2 previous workers from around 2015 who share similar experiences with me (meaning nothing has changed). A few years later one of the ex-workers, Rosa (not real name), started this shut down the zoo page after she stopped working for the zoo. Rosa posted a picture on the page of a gross food bowl filled with maggots. Sarah (head zookeeper) found the page and came to Rosa’s new place of work and threatened to sue her for defamation if she didn’t take the page down. Rosa told Sarah that it’s only defamation if it isn’t true. Sarah then proceeded to tell Rosa that she better take down the page and watch her back. I told Rosa that there are fake facebook profiles trolling the page she created and that one of the fake facebook profiles that keeps posting against the page is the head zookeeper, Sarah. This profile has also reached out to Rosa over messenger threatening defamation. The other ex-worker, Tori, started posting things to the page as well including pictures. Tori gets a creepy Facebook message from a random stranger who claims to be from Australia saying that he heard about her telling the cops and that he was coming for her. His advice to Tori was to retract what she did because she is young and has her whole life ahead of her. Does anyone know if anything can be done about this? It's pretty clear that the zoo is trying to hide stuff and will then threaten ex-workers who try to speak up about the conditions at the zoo. So far I haven’t received anything threats, which makes me think that the zoo doesn’t know I reported them. 

For anyone just hearing about this for the first time here are my previous posts: 
First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/CaptiveWildlife/comments/7ya6mk/how_should_one_work_with_monkeys_at_the_zoo/?st=JFYR1C1G&amp;sh=c5a527f1

TL;DR: Do I report the zoo to PETA even though I told the Humane Society? What are /r/CaptiveWildlife ‘s thoughts about PETA? Should I do an exit interview with the owners even though it might not do anything at all? Can anything be done about the threats past employees received from the head zookeeper and an anonymous person on Facebook even though it is from 2015/2016?

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

It's exceptionally busy right now, to the point of absurdity. Senior sales staff outnumber the operations staff 2 to 1, so we are a top heavy company. However, in the past months, the calendar has gotten really intense for trade fairs and exhibitions. All of the shipping logistics fall to me. I am a solo shipping department in a sea of important and expensive moving parts. We are a company that is too busy for meetings. I try to schedule meetings and they often get pushed and due to the impromptu nature of our show room, suddenly a client will visit and the meeting never happens. I get maybe 50 emails an hour from clients, shippers, brokers, who need answers within that business day. I am also the inventory manager of our stock and responsible for public copy of the information about the product. This is not always readily available and may need to be manually confirmed by me.

So! On to why I am writing- I am overcommitted and extremely stressed and overloaded. Keeping track of all the minutiae of the emails and even trying to make excel spreadsheets of projects that will suddenly just expand by 30% in an hour before they are due (making any tracking or record keeping purposes really a waste of time, since the principal will just scratch most of the project and add on new material) is a ridiculous prospect. I likely have 100 projects right now that are changing every day. It's also quite hard to dedicate time to memorizing every aspect of each project so that I don't need to ask questions, so yeah, I do ask questions if things aren't entirely clear or if the date changed 8 times for a deliverable and I am confirming the last date. The ""final"" list is literally never final and there is no respect for how much work it takes just to manually update the inventory system (no barcodes baby, I am manually updating inventory locations in addition to all my other projects). Honestly, this place is making me crazy.

So my coworker Kaitlin is part of the ops team trying to make this all work out. She manages the trade shows and many other complicated projects. The reason for this post is that her coping skills in dealing with my questions are slipping and the woman is being flat out rude to me. If I dare ask a question that had been in the 200th email that I got yesterday, she will loudly say that it was in the email that I got. If I confirm something that appears to be changing radically and I dont know all the information, she will sigh, basically say she doesn't know anything right now and that leaves me to scramble to figure out how to resolve things. While to a degree, last minute changes are the nature of our type of trade shows, I can't live or work like this. And Kaitlin's attitude lately is making me feel like a child. I wasn't getting sales reports in the typical manner yesterday and I asked her if I am getting them in the traditional format and she just started laughing, saying that she was really busy right now and that she can't answer every single one of my questions. Later that same day, a really large project that had no shipping resolution on the originating end had finally been shared with me in a meeting led by Kaitlin. It was a really big relief to understand the parameters of the job and to have a plan in place for properly inventorying the product. When I mentioned to Kaitlin that it was great to have this plan in place, as a means to maybe talk about it more but primarily to try to have a friendly rapport with her, she shut me down hard and said, ""yup. Yup. Yup."" after every word until I just slowed down and walked away. That was so demeaning and rude. Even during the meeting, when she was describing (finally!) the parameters of the project, I was asked how much I thought the destination charges would be. I said ""it sounds like it will be 3 pallets"" to which she immediately said ""Oh I think its more..."" as if I didn't know what I was talking about and she looked through her printed emails and then said ""Oh it is 3 pallets"". I feel like she doesn't respect me because of my communication style because I am so overloaded but so is she. I guess I am more team oriented than the structure of the company allows for?

It is not possible to not have a work relationship with her since she is the trade fair manager and I need to ship all inventory to the trade fairs. This requires that I work with her really closely.

Thanks I needed to vent about her rudeness and just the shitty state of everything in general. I cannot manage all the tasks asked of me at this job, have informed the principal, and was told to train the intern. I need another professional to assist and it isn't going to happen. I am looking for a new job.

**TLDR: Coworker is condescending and treats me like a child. I need some insight of either to cut her slack, try to stay away or both**"
8c7k61,171,2018-04-14,Answer Is: Morning Joe’s Worst Nightmare-(Question) Who was Lori Klausutis ?,CaptainRoyD,greatawakening,https://www.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/8c7k61/answer_is_morning_joes_worst_nightmarequestion/,"Now is the time Patriots to start to hit back hard, all the “Mockingbird” MSM. One perfect candidate is the early voice of the Deep State-Morning Joe.

On November 29, 2017, POTUS sent out a cryptic Tweet message referring to Morning Joe and the mysterious death of one of his interns at his FL campaign office almost 2 decades ago. That campaign aide was Lori Klausutis-R.I.P.

Post **Q# 1515** on 6/16/18 (in part):

**MSNBC-Joe Scarborough.**

**MSNBC-Mika Brzezinski.**

**THE BRIDGE: PODESTA GROUP.**

On July 20, 2001, the dead body of 28 year old Lori Klausutis was found at her place of work. Lori worked for US House Rep. Joe Scarborough at his Ft. Walton Beach office. Klausutis was a daily runner of 5 miles and the picture of perfect health-no drugs/alcohol were found in her system from the autopsy.

Bizarre as it seems, Scarborough had just announced he would not seek another US House term, this is just after winning re-election. Joe claimed then to need to spend time with the family.

Rumors had swirled around the Florida panhandle about “affairs” involving Joe. Local tales connected past promiscuous activity, as the real reason Joe would never run again, despite his recent public announcement about his family.

Coroner report had Lori passing out due to rare (previously undetected). This heart condition caused her to suddenly fall over hitting her head on a desk corner, causing her death. 

Autopsy could not confirm this rare  “heart issue”. Primarily because it can only be detected while the heart is beating (victim is still alive). He was able confirmed the head trauma did kill her.

What confounded a local WGTX reporter was right after Lori’s body was found, in the first official statements given out by Joe and several key staffers, they told the narrative that Lori was “sticky” and not a healthy/well  person. 

Joe and his team were scrambling to build a false narrative about Lori’s “ill health”. This incorrect theme was shot down instantly by all the Klausutis family members and her friends. Scarborough/Aides were then forced to retract their public original statements on Lori.

Dr. Michael Berkland was assigned to perform Lori’s autopsy and had a history of unethical conduct. Berkland was fired within a year due to faulty/incomplete official reports. 

In 2008, authorities found a “House of Horrors” rental unit by Berkland. Discovered were various body parts of over 100 cadavers, stored in Tupperware containers and garbage bags.

8c7kxe,1,2018-04-14,"I [33 M] have significant interpersonal issues, rarely been able to make and keep friends",izolirovanniy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8c7kxe/i_33_m_have_significant_interpersonal_issues/,"Since I was young, I have almost always been the outcast. In high school, I had two friends, but I would never meet them outside of school (but they would meet each other). I went to my high school reunion five years ago, and everyone was discussing parties that I wasn't invited to and stories that I had never heard. I left after an hour. 

In college, I made two more friends that I thought would last, but one of the friends moved back to Seattle and became a management consultant. I moved to the East Coast. We lost touch, and when I talked to her much later, she had become somebody rather different than the person I had clicked with so well. The other friend was in my field of work, moved to my ""hometown"" (the city where I live usually on the East Coast), and then promptly lost my number. When I asked her about not hanging out after over a year, she said she had gotten busy with her boyfriend. At the same time, I see pictures on her Facebook page with a large number of friends. 

At an internship I had, I made a friend who was substantially older than I (he was 28, I was 23). He also said to me that I was quite unique and never met anybody quite like me. He also said that he could not ever see befriending anybody like me outside the context we were put in when he was in a more honest state. A few years later, knowing of my problem, he asked if I ever found my crowd, I responded no. I asked him what he thought my difficulty was. He said I didn't have one. 

At my first job (a dead-ender), I made friends with some of my co-workers, but suddenly many of them turned on me when I was admitted into grad school. They said I was the opposite of them. I asked two people whom I liked quite well what went wrong. One person said it was jealousy that I realized that the job was leading nowhere and decided to leave. Another sympathized with the crowd of friends had turned on me, but he also said I shouldn't worry about it.  

In grad school, I made acquaintances, not friends. People would invite each other to bars and get-togethers, but they would never invite me. Seriously, not a single invitation. When I would extend invites, they would say ""I'm not free,"" and then I would hear they went to a large party. When I ran into someone much later, one acquaintance said, ""You never bonded with us,"" to which I thought, ""But I never got the chance to."" Another acquaintance (who became a friend... see below), two years later, was more upfront, ""Most people didn't know you, but there were quite a few people who couldn't stand the sight of you."" When I asked why, she said, ""I really have no idea."" I believed her. 

After grad school, I've had a string of jobs. To warn you, my field is marked by high turnover, close quarters with work colleagues, and a lot of moving around. 

The first job, I worked for a woman who was roughly my age. We got along well. She was happy with my work and has given me multiple references; however, when I asked her for a job recently, she said, ""You're amazing, but I don't know where I am is the best for you."" When I asked how did you mean, ""I just don't think this is a culture fit for you."" While I was in that job, I made three friends (one was the upfront acquaintance from grad school). At the same time, it was in a stressful context in close quarters. I left that job soon after my boss left as I was told the company was closing my division. My new boss, who had already known me, asked me to stay in another role, but one that was very isolating with no contact with anyone but my new boss. I left that job for another one. My new boss was not very understanding when I left. After I left that job, I moved from that city and my three friends faded away. 

My second job out of grad school was a complete disorganized mess (also a hallmark of my field). After moving to a new city very far away, I was on a team of four (Me=Izzy, ""Sara"", ""Michael"", and ""Olga"") with different people reporting to us four. Sara and Michael were 4-6 years older than me, and Olga was 15 years old than me. At first, I really liked Sara. We would chat, she would complain about her job, we would commiserate and then I would suggest things to make it better. Michael didn't like me from the start, and I was told much later after I left that Michael told Sara that I was after her job. Sara then turned on me, and both Michael and Sara tried to get me out. They spread rumors, they told lies about me, and suddenly it seemed everyone at that organization was trying to get me out. Olga also turned on me, but then, after a few months and one too many lies, she realized that what Michael and Sara were doing. She reported them to my boss (I was in the room when this happened), but my boss was lazy to do anything about it and said it was my fault. Olga then counseled me to leave, which I did. Olga left six weeks later. In an exit interview with one of my boss's colleagues - I didn't want to talk to my boss - he said that one of the observations he had was that I didn't handle the politics well. I still get notes from Olga, who lives very far away, every once in a while wishing me that I'm happy wherever I am. 

While I was working with Michael, Sara, and Olga, I did find acquaintances outside of work, but they disappeared once I left that city. I tried to confide in one or two of them about some of my stresses at work, but when it was ignored, I stopped.

After some contract work, I came back to my home base I went to work at a small firm of 20 people. I made friends on the executive team and with one of my colleagues, but we never had more in common than the problems that had to do with the small firm. So, I call them up for networking and if I need a job or contact, but we don't share anything beyond the surface level stuff. After being sick of the war between the number 1 and number 2 in the firm, I left my home base for another city very far away for my next job... 

At this job, my boss completely disliked me, took credit for the work I did and the ideas I had, would try to gaslight me into believing he did the work himself despite emails to the contrary, sent me all over to expand this project I led, and then created ""problems"" for me to solve (and would advertise these problems far and wide). He said I was absent too much due to me trying to expand the project too much and fired me after a year there. The good thing is that while I was there I did make friends and I had a friend group that made me happy. I could have fun with them and I think they had fun with me. But they are very far away now. 

After that job, I moved back to my home base. I found another job in a completely different field, which is where I'm at now. At first, it was fun, but seven months in, I realized it was very cliquey. And I was left out. I found out that there was a group chat with everyone in the office between 25 and 35 on their personal phones, and I was left off of it. Everyone on this chat group was invited to go on a long weekend except me. People go to happy hours but don't invite me. It's like the cycle has started over again. 

One person whom I like at this job has said, ""I think you should look beyond the office."" I asked if I did anything wrong and she said, ""I don't think you did anything wrong, but sometimes, certain people don't click with other people. You're too opposite of that group."" She didn't elaborate on what that meant despite me asking.  

In the city I live in now, I've tried groups, I've tried clubs, I've tried sports leagues, but while I'm warmly welcomed within the purview of the club/league/group, it never goes beyond that. People who start after me are invited to things outside of the club, but I'm not (and I do say I would like to be invited). I ask people for lunch or a drink, but I'm not taken up on that either. 
 
Usually, when I am friends with someone, I'm not invited to their larger events, and I'm kept to the side for one-on-ones. 

I went to a few therapists over the years, and one put me in group therapy to see what the interactions were like. He said, ""I don't know what happened but there were a few people who just didn't like you and it was plainly visible from my vantage point."" Another one initially said Aspergers, but after 12 sessions said, ""You definitely do not have Aspergers or anything on the autism spectrum - that I'm sure of."" 

I've had girlfriends while this has been happening, and they say (even after the breakup) that have no idea what the issue is; however, they have seen the same issues. Their friends have liked me, but their friends are their friends. I hang on to girlfriends for longer than I should mainly because they have friends that I interact with, and I typically don't have anyone to talk to once they're gone. One girlfriend, during college, asked a few people to try to take me on as a friend, but they invariably said, ""He's a very nice guy, but we don't click.""

I'm just tired of not clicking. I don't get into fights with people. I'm not unpleasant, according to me and other people who have given me feedback. I just don't know what to do.   

tl;dr: I have a very hard time interacting with people and making and keeping friends for the past 33 years, and I have no idea why.   "

8caeul,5,2018-04-14,Advice for possible IT Students,patriot1829,UNG,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNG/comments/8caeul/advice_for_possible_it_students/,"Look, I attended here for a good amount of time and let me start off with saying that I like the school, most of the faculty, and the campus (Main Dahlonega Campus). 

That being said, any future prospective IT students should be wary about coming here right off of high school hoping to get into the field with a degree. DO NOT be swayed by a BBA/BS InfoSystems degree or BS CyberSec degree from a RESEARCH University and not a TECHNICAL University and/or Technical College. There is a misconception out there that an AAS from the 2-year tech schools particularly in Georgia are subpar or that they're not worth the paper they are printed on. 

That is not true, first lets look at UNG.... aside from possibly a couple (and I mean like 1 or 2) courses you will not get much hands-on experience in IT at UNG. Furthermore, many people still put weight into a BS in CompScience but let me be the first to tell you that the courses they require (and have continued to require for decades) are not the best to really prepare you for a career in IT. A BS CompScience prepares you maybe for a software development or programming job and with just the degree you won't get very far. It takes a lot of work to get solid jobs in the field with this degree and most schools don't tell students this. 

Most students don't like programming but like working on computers, networks, and systems. You get experience in that from getting an AAS in CIS or Networking and actually getting hands on experience at school. You get hands on CISCO, Microsoft, and UNIX classes at tech schools (these are systems and equipment that EVERY company or place uses in some fashion or another). 

I once was swayed by a degree at UNG in IT and after a time there I realized that I wasn't going to learn what I needed to, to be employable after I graduate. Internships or not there is a lot of preparation that goes into getting into IT the right way and not all the time are people able to skip the bottom jobs by getting a BS instead of an AAS. In light of that realization I decided to leave. Now, I am not saying the school is bad, or is lying. There are great business degrees and many others. For IT, however, you really want to go elsewhere. I got an AAS in IT and now work in IT over people with just a BBA in InfoSys. Not every case is the same and obviously not every situation is bad. 

You just need to be informed before you waste money on something you didn't know about. Take it all with a grain of salt and remember, life is what you make it! "

8caved,1,2018-04-14,47[M4F] Weekend with my daughter’s friend,ClearlyALoon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8caved/47m4f_weekend_with_my_daughters_friend/,"I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa you can choose a different name, if you prefer).... I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

Sometimes I have a lot of time, sometimes I can only write once a day. "

First of all, allow me to say something I hardly ever say but have never meant more: [Goddammit](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/accordingtomatthew/2018/04/david-silverman-officially-fired-from-american-atheists-after-allegations-of-sexual-assault-and-financial-conflicts/).

You were one of the best of us. You're funny, smart, not unduly harsh but uncompromising. You know the art of a good [counter-religious troll](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/11/atheist-billboard-on-nativity-scene-you-know-it-s-a-myth/343234/) that hits the right balance between funny and thoughtful. You got Bill O'Reilly to give us ""[The tides go in, the tides go out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb3AFMe2OQY&amp;t=137s)"" meme. You actually seemed to be on the right side of feminism.

And now this. I'm not much in a place to judge the financial allegations. Had it been but that, I would have thought, ""that's a shame. Greed can get the better of anyone, I guess."" You would have left me room to still actually *like* you. 

But then there's the sexual assault allegations. I so want to be on your side that even after the first account I found myself trying to rationalize on your behalf, and I *hate* when people do that. ""Oh, maybe it was mixed signals, and hey, he backed off when she said 'Red' so maybe it's not that bad..."" 

And then I read about the second allegation, and it was even less defensible, and all the reports about how predators tend to be a minority group of repeat offenders came flooding through my head, and I had to come into full on confrontation with me: you're trying to find a way to excuse him for this. Because let me be honest, if this were some hypocritical Focus on the Family asswipe I wouldn't waste a second trying to play that game, and I'd be right. 

Regarding the first allegation, wherein you went full BDSM dom on a woman who it turns out wasn't into it, you don't come on to someone that strong without being *damn* sure they want it. There's no such thing as, ""oops, I only started slapping her and stuck my finger in her because I thought she wanted it."" If you got that far and you weren't absolutely fucking sure the answer was yes, and it turns out the answer was actually no, you're already committing assault. There are ways of making sure without killing the mood; you got to do the fucking work to make sure. You didn't.

Regarding the second allegation, wherein you slept with a drunk admirer and then told her not to apply for your (internship, I believe) because that would be a ""conflict of interest,"" that's just straight up being a jackass. 

I know, I know. Of course you're denying these allegations. I'm sure there will be scores of people who will give you every benefit of the doubt until there's video footage, and even then there will be excuses. I can already hear the dulcet tones of the people who will inevitably say, ""Oh, we're atheists, we have to wait for the evidence"" no matter how much actual evidence already exists. 

But let's be real; when a guy has multiple accusations of sexual misconduct against him and those stories have corroborating testimony to back them up, they happened. And I desperately wish some exculpatory detail or fuller explanation *would* exonerate you. Because you were kind of a giant hero to me. 

But I can't forgive my heroes when I wouldn't, for a second, hesitate to condemn this in someone like Moore or Trump. Sometimes our heroes just break our hearts. Fuck you for breaking my heart, David Silverman. 

Love, Lee"

She managed to not lose her job and has taken classes to change from a nurse to a paramedic.  Tonight was her first night in an ambulance and she was more nervous than anything.  Her nervousness is quickly set aside when she realizes that, not only has she done this before with her hero friends, she's actually kind of a natural.  However, as her shift starts kicking into gear, Lisa's shift comes to an end.  As she walks to her car, however, she suddenly gets an uneasy feeling.  Constantly looking over her shoulder, she drops her keys in a panic and goes to pick them up.  When she looks up, she thinks she sees a black blur moving on the far end of the parking lot.  She quickly moves to her car and gets in.  As she looks in her rear view mirror, she thinks she's a person in her back seat.  She turns around and looks around.  Nobody in the car with her.  She takes a few deep breaths and shakes her head as she starts the vehicle.*


""I need to get my hours changed...""


*As she leaves the garage, a man in a distinct suit is standing outside the hospital, fixing his tie.*


""...Show time.""  *He says.*


_____________


*When Jessi returns to the hospital, she's greeted by a solemn atmosphere.  Alissa, a nursing intern and usual scatterbrain, quickly approaches.*


""Jess..."" *She says as she pulls the vampire aside.*


""Hey... uh... what... why is...""  *Jessi starts questioning, but Alissa stops her.*



""....Lisa's dead.""


*The vampire falls silent.  Alissa keeps explaining.*


""There was a car accident... she hit a telephone pole... she uh...""


*She swallows and the vampire nods, listening.  She doesn't quite believe what she's hearing.  Her brain already filling with questions.*


""...And she's... in the morgue?""


*Alissa pauses and nods.*


""They... told me to tell you when you got back.  I.... Fuck Jess, I'm... I'm sorry.""


*She nods and pats her shoulder as she walks towards the staircase to the morgue.  However, in the stairwell, she receives a call.*


*From Lisa.*


*Needless to say, she answers.*


""Hello?""


""Did you get my message yet?""


*Stanley asks nonchalantly.  If Jessi had blood, it'd be boiling right now.*


""...I should have known...""


""Of fucking course you should have, dollface.""


*Jessi punches a hole in the wall.*


""Don't *fucking* call me that!""


""And what are you going to do?  See, the last time I tried to extend an olive branch, you tried to hurt me and then I turned you into a fucking ragdoll, dollface.""  *His voice playful.  This further enrages Jessi.  Stanley continues.*


""....You never answered my question.  Did you get my-""


""Yeah I got your fucking message, my friend is dead, *probably* thanks to you!""


*He just chuckles.*


""You didn't get my message then if you think that's all I did.  See, I've been following you the past... eh, week or so, and I know your routine.  And I know your friends.  And I know who to hit to hurt you the most.""


*Jessi thinks about what he said and her eyes go wide.  She starts making her way down to the morgue as Stanley continues to speak.*


""...This will all go away....  *I* will go away... If.... *you*.... go away...""


""Oh what, like you want me to leave the city?""


""Or... stake yourself, whatever's easier for you.""


""Go fuck yourself, Stanley.  The next time I see you-""


*Stanley laughs.*


""...The next time you see me, it'll probably be the last time we ever see each other.""


""Too fucking right you asshole.""


""...Catch you later, dollface.""


*Jessi and Stanley simultaneously hang up as Jess makes it to the morgue.  She quickly looks through the drawers to see if she can find Lisa.  In one of those drawers, a pile of ashes surround a skeleton, which causes Jessi to suddenly recoil.  She covers her mouth and coughs a little before inspecting the corpse more.  Amongst the ashes, a piece of silver in the ashes that was her chest.  Jessi realizes what Stanley had done.  He had turned Lisa and placed a piece of silver in her heart.  Jessi knows silver is just agonizing for vampires.  She did not go peacefully.  And that is the part that sent Jessi over the edge.  She was mad.  And she was on the warpath.*"
8cbfuz,8,2018-04-14,I've been crying all week because I miss him so much,crmmn,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/8cbfuz/ive_been_crying_all_week_because_i_miss_him_so/,"We live in different continents, it's been three months since the last time we saw each other and at the moment we still don't know when will be the next time. Last two times it was me who was visiting and now it's his turn but he will be flying stand by and that worries me a lot :(

He started a new job in March so he wants to let some time pass before he can ask for vacation days for either June or July. This past weeks have been very hard for me, I hate not having a specific date to look forward to, I've been so stressed with work, and masters applications (to study in his country), I think I've cried from being stressed and sad from missing him every day of this week. He has seen me cry when we video call and I'm worried that he could get tired of it, or just think that I'm too dumb for him because I'm having such a hard time with the applications process, and since we haven't booked any tickets he could just decide not to come anymore.

I'm also very scared of not getting accepted for the master and therefore not being able to get a visa to stay in his country for longer than 90 days :( I can't stand being away from him anymore, I'm tired of living 9,000 km away from him. He tells me that I should look for a job or internships while I can start my master but I don't feel that hopeful about it since I'm still a beginner on his language and would need to find a place where the working language is English.

I really wish I could just quit my job, fly to him right now and not having to come back in a long time :("

First of all thank you so much for all the hard work you do here (publishing articles &amp; helping other people out here). Instead of writing my whole story here - I want to give you some bullet points about my life:
Me:
- turning 27 in a few weeks 
- European (still living in parents home)

Positive things: 
- Recently finished my Masters's Degree in economics as the 2nd best in class
- Built up a small Internet Start-Up (self employed atm) where I earn around 1,5k€ (Maybe not a big number but I am still proud that I created something with my ""own hands"")
- bought a brand new car years ago
- Was raised by my lovely grandfather and he teached me about the things like discipline, helpfulness, punctuality &amp; more (old prussian family values)
- I don't drink, don't smoke and ain't do drugs. To have a clear mind is very important for me. Some old friends in the past just drank alcohol and made car crashes, my ex fucked with a drug dealer after me... I just hate drugs!
- I care about the way I look. I buy new clothes every 1-2 months, go to the hairdresser, skin care etc.

Negative (and some of them I am very ashamed of, but I want to be honest with you here because I need some help to TO CHANGE MY LIFE):
- Would like to take a new challenge (job-wise) &amp; to earn more money. I did one internship only besides my self employment in the past (at the goverment). Unfortunately I get always declined that ""other people are better"". Very tired of this bullshit... Even smaller paid jobs decline me ... it's very frustrating for me.
- Had to quit the gym after 5 years of hard work (because of health problems and the doc said I had to)
- 6'1 and 145pounds (underweight) at the moment.
- I got small tits like a woman.. :( I had a plastic surgery last year but the result isn't very satisfying. It bothers me a lot... shit genetics (father and grandfather got the issue as well). I could never undress my t-shirt with a girl or at public at all... it bothers me so much...
- Never really had sex in my life so far. I had a girlfriend years ago (1 year relationship). But she only gave me a few times a blowjob and was scared of it because she was a virgin. One day when I was  to put my dick into her pussy my mother came in ... well after that our relationship just went downhill and she leaved me. 2 weeks later she slept with a drug dealer... and even stayed overnight there...
- My last date was in 2011(!!) and since then I got declined by every girl. Last time I wanted to meet up with a girl she just didn't come. We never talked again...
- Had my last blowjob with a hooker in 2012... couldn't get a real boner and didn't cum.
- I don't have any friends - didn't get any birthday wishes for over 5 years... but really... fuck BIRTHDAYS... It's just a number.
- Last time I met with a person in real life was around 6 months ago. I met with 2 girls (did know one girl from the internet). But she has a boyfriend and the other one wasn't my type at all. Never received a message from her again.
- very depressed and I even got antidepressant (but I don't take them)
Alright, that's a small ""view"" into my life. 
Especiallythe ""woman"" part bothers me a lot! I really want to enjoy a sex life (that I never had). I don't know how I should handle this... I did read some old pua book stuff years ago... but I guess all these things are kinda ""outdated"" now.
In addition to that I am very ashamed of my body image... 

What I plan to do in the next weeks &amp; this year:
- I made an appointment with my previous plastic surgery doc... and we will look into my case again. I really need another surgery to have a ""flat"" chest. I mean did you ever see a guy in his mid 20s (with underweight) and has some tits?? I guess no... When this is finally out of my life I want to grind the gym so hard again... I miss it a lot!
- Apply for an internship (I even got declined for this because I am not a ""student"" anymore). I thought about sending my documents to 50 companies around the whole country (I am flexible).
Additionally I thought about going to university again. Really interested into some political stuff like european studies (but I need some ECTS in political science... which is fucked up as well).
- I really want to have sex this year.. at least once. 

What would you do (in my case)? 
I started reading the ""red pill book"" and recognized some mistakes I made in the past. 
Moreover really want to be a successful person in life, but I need to catch up a lot + especially LEARN a lot. 

Do you have some recommendation for me? I will start saying ""Hi"" to 20 random people next week... to improve my social behaviour and skills. 
Maybe I should create a new tinder profile? (I got 4 numbers in the past but never met someone). Any recommendations what I should write into my description?
I do have some older pictures with girls and some pictures with the 2 girls a half year ago... should I use one of them as a profile picture there? 

Thank you so much for reading my ""bumpy"" text. 
I do want to change my life and be finally happy &amp; achieve my goals (be in a management of a top company, do plates (2-4 different girls), have my own house, learning new stuff, have fun in life &amp; more)

23yo/College enrolled -

I have been working with a company as an IT (related; more of a technical support) intern, with a shelf life of 12 weeks. I was told at acceptance that I would be eligible for permanent employment with positive performance and attendance (The usual; don't be punk standard). 

Present Position:
I am about to begin my seventh week of work with said company, and I was supplied with some information that, as long as everything continues to go well, I will be asked to join the company permanently after the duration of the assignment. 
Now this all comes from a fellow employee of the company, and not the management/administrative staff. Now I regard this information to be trusting, as they have not been misleading in the recent history of my assignment.

Moving Forward:
Now I am a student of Computer Science/IT, and this job has been both a new adventure and a use of some of the newly acquired domain. I have been doing well, and I feel like it says enough that this has come as a report from a fellow ""co-worker."" I have a skillset that is different from the job requirements, and I plan to continue school online as well as individual education to grow myself. Now..

I am wanting to get some different perspectives on the likelihood of gaining a pay increase as part of this potential transition. I am learning to fulfill the job to excellent standards, and I still have more to offer. Would I be within my right to request increase pay, as I have skills to offer the company to potentially increase efficiency and ease needs in office and in production. As well, the employee also mentioned that with this transition to permanent employment, I would receive benefits which may include Investment matching, PTO, Health/Wellness, and possibly a tuition reimbursement program.

As just starting my career in this field, I know I shouldn't ask too much, but I feel as having came in with quite a bit of technical knowledge and superb soft skills I do need to ask for an increase of some sort as I am about to pay for school."

I guess my first question is. What should I wear? I know I’ve had some friends who wear there Chef jacket and a nice pair of dress pants and dress pants or wear a suit? 

Also I would really love to continue this as a career and I’m curious as to what I should ask to let them know that I’m taking it seriously and want to continue with the company after the internship ends?

Also just some friendly advice or things I should brush up on to make sure I can stay ahead of the game! Or also some advice from other R&amp;D chefs.

***


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Let me begin by telling a story.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; At approximately 1:35 p.m., in an utterly ordinary suburb, inside an overcrowded classroom of a remarkably typical high school, a universe is born. Characterized by its aesthetic perfection, it sharply contrasts the space that it was meant to inhabit: the grey, uniform pattern of the cement walls, the dimly lit and low humming fluorescent lighting, and the grid-like pattern of wooden desks, occupied with tensed students on the verge of breaking, their only indication being the sound of their pencils scrawling against paper. 
	
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “10 minutes left.”
	
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The proctor’s words made me present, not because they meant anything, not to me at least, but because they acted as a sharp stimulus in an environment that would otherwise border on giving you sensory deprivation if you stared off for too long. I looked down at my paper and had that modern-day equivalent of humans’ evolutionary internal fight or flight response. You know the one, where you go into a test knowing you’re going to get your ass kicked. So, you struggle just to write something halfway intelligent as you internally cringe your muscles. Then, when you’re nearing the end of your futile effort, you’re allured by the thought of just dropping the pencil, tearing that paper up, and spending the rest of your time trying to justify to yourself how it couldn’t possibly be your fault, or how the test was bullshit anyways. Well in my case, I chose neither. I chose to reject my reality at that moment, actively dissociating from it, as if to give that packet of paper the mental middle finger. At first, I started small: thinking about what I’d eat later, what my plans were for the weekend. Then it started to become more abstract: why are we here? What’s my purpose? What happens after you die? If Buzz Lightyear thought he was a real Space Ranger, why did he still freeze when Andy played with him? But after enough time my mind wandered back to it. Its shape and form, its content and history, and my place within it: all factors under my complete control. It was a universe, a reality really, of my imagination so beautiful that it would be a disservice to try and describe it in the context of this one. I was someone else, and everything was something else. It had a quality that was spontaneous and dynamic, yet flawless and everlasting, like the way you wish you could erase something impactful from your memory (a book, a song, an event, etc.), just so you could have the pleasure of experiencing it all over again while its meaning is still foreign to you. In that memory, in that moment, the forms are ideal, and the context of anything else present is lost. Nothing is subjective, because your experience is the only thing that matters. You get exactly what you want because you know what you want.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; “Times up. Please close your exam booklets as I will now come around to collect them.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And with that announcement, I’m mentally back to square one. I look down at my packet to take one final glance at my work for the essay portion of the ACT:

Name: The Ugly Barnacle

______Technology in the classroom is important because_______________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not bad, but a bit shorter than I had hoped. I was banking on my multiple choice boosting my composite, but seeing as how I only answered about 40 questions out of a mind-numbing 215, and seeing as how I wasn’t too confident in the accuracy of my answer selection process (C never fails… except for about 75% of the time), I’d end up writing this one off as a fluke.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It’s a few weeks later. I’m home, heading toward the fridge, latest issue of *Batman* in hand, in search of anything sugary and/or caffeinated. As if I had set off some hidden trip wire, my parents ambush me from both sides, like they had coordinated this shit prior to me coming downstairs. This time they don’t open up with a “subtle” allegory; no rhetorical questions, no “is there anything you want to tell us?” They start laying into me right away, barely giving me enough time to don my heaviest set of metaphorical armor to combat their verbal blows.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It seems they didn’t interpret my ACT score as a fluke. They chew me out pretty good about my poor performance. They yell at me about how I’m not taking school seriously, how I’m screwing myself over, and how I won’t go to college with results like these. Talk of laziness, talk of disciple. Talk of failure, talk of shame. Talk of future, talk of consequences. In my head I argue back, trying to look at what I did well during the test. After all, I was able to make the most boring room the most exciting, beautiful place to be. That’s a pretty impressive feat in my opinion. Their intensity doesn’t wear down though, so I start to feel bad. But I don’t feel bad because I think I did something wrong, I feel bad because of the consequences. I feel bad that I spaced the ACT because now my parents are yelling at me. I feel bad in the way grownups want to make you feel bad, and it works. Like, you have people screaming in your face, so now your soul feels like it’s been sapped. You’re not a psychopath, so you know that if you did something immoral or hurt someone you’d feel bad for doing it. Here, I just feel deflated and blurred, as if my environment, not my conscience, is in control of my emotions. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On and on this goes until eventually the one-sided bickering between my parents and me turns to in-between my mom and dad, because you know, parent logic. I see my opportunity for escape and seize it, retreating back upstairs, into the attic where a sad creature such as me belongs. I yank the cord that turns on the central lighting fixture before heading to a corner of the room which has a low-level makeshift seat out of old couch cushions. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The walls are covered in posters, some still as pristine as the day I bought them, others blatantly creased or poorly cut out from gaming magazines. The posters depict all types of fiction, be it comic books, fantasy, sci-fi, anime, or cartoons. Each one of them acts as a catalyst for my daydreams. I could be listening to music, doing homework, or watching TV when I unknowingly shift my gaze towards one of them. Sometimes I get so wrapped up in my head, and I stare for so long, that I begin to look through the posters. It’s as if all details of them are lost, and instead they act as portals to another world, allowing me to break the space in-between them. I then blanket my consciousness, replacing every perception in the waking world with the one I seek. The space is universal in scale, but I am God, and everything is mine. I’m the most powerful force to have ever existed. Fear me or worship me, but I am in complete control of the outcome, manifesting one true destiny. Sometimes I get anxious after having thoughts like those, or rather, those around me have made me to feel anxious of having thoughts like those. Venture far enough down the rabbit hole of your mind, and you may not like what you find. But hey, living inside your own head can just be like that sometimes.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I sit down in the corner of the room. I still have the comic book, but in my haste, forgot the Dr. Pepper I had grabbed out of the fridge. Unfortunate. The continuing shouting match between my parents acts as mild white noise underneath the floor of the attic. I’ll have to wait awhile before venturing downstairs again.
 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I start to think about what I’ve done and where I’m going academically (seeing as how that’s all I did have going for me). I think, *this is not me. I’m a smart kid. I mean, if I work hard I can do well. Why did I have to daydream then and there? Any other time than then would have been fine, but I needed this. This was a crucial part toward getting into a good college: doing well on the ACT. Just like when I was told I had to do well in Jr. High to be successful in high school, and before that elementary school, I had to find a way to succeed here. It will be just as important that I finish this year strong, do well on my applications, and succeed in my internship to be successful in college. Then I’ll work super hard for four years to earn my bachelor’s degree in physics, trudging through class after class, doing undergrad research, applying myself in extracurriculars, powering through volunteer work, and securing more internship opportunities so I can be successful in grad school. Grad school, that’s going to require a ton of focus and commitment if I’m ever going to be successful in obtaining a PhD.*

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I snap out of it for a moment before shifting my thought process, actually saying out loud to myself, “wait a minute…” *This is totally me, the me that’s been complacent to drag his feet along for years, working his ass off to be successful in order to set myself up to be successful. Is it just me, or am I missing something here? When do I actually experience the success?! When do I get affirm that feeling inside me that I made it, that I was in control and I accomplished something? I’ve just been “successful” for other people, keeping my head down and turning out results to avoid the consequences from my teachers, my administrators, and my parents. I’ve lived such a boring life. The relief from the constant stagnation only manifests itself in my daydreams. There, I’m in control. There, I’m not subject to the wills of others who lay out my path before me, you know, the same straight path that millions have followed before me, and millions more will continue to follow after I do. In my daydreams everything is perfect and undying. In reality, all my experiences have been derived from imperfect approximations of the things I imagine in my head.* 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe there are two types of truths to reality: empirical and personally-derived. Empirical truths are the ones we can objectively prove and all agree on. Let go of an apple near the surface of the Earth, and it will fall to the ground. Decrease the price of a good in an economy, and the demand for that good will increase. Personally-derived truths are the ones we as individuals synthesize and affirm over the course of our life experiences. They may not be able to be proved true, but we still affirm them the same way we expect the Sun to rise in the East and set in the West. Once affirmed, our outlook on reality is reasserted to accommodate the truths that we found to be self-evident. These personally-derived truths are fluid in that they can be edited or erased completely, but this attribute does not take away from the influence they have on our lives. On that particular day in the attic of that model home in that utterly ordinary suburb, I hit upon three personally derived truths which I thought to myself.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *1. In the real world, nobody ever really gets what they want. We can imagine the ideal form of any idea, person, thing, or situation, but it can never exist in such a form in reality. What we get may still bring us happiness, but it will never be what we estimated it to be in our heads.* 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *2. Life isn’t meant to be good, it’s meant to be static. Most good things break down over time. The more joyous the occasion, the quicker it fades, because it must always lead back to that path of stagnation. Alternatively, most bad things take too much energy for us to dwell on, so we work until we once again reach that state of automated complacency.* 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *3. In order to treat the dissonance we face in the real world, we employ a combination of imagination and revisiting of impactful memories, both of which allow us to view what we want in perfect configuration and focus. A good delusion is its own reward.* 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *Even as I think this, I know that nothing will change. I will continue along that path, going to college, getting a degree in a technical field, making that entry-level salary before getting married, settling down in a cookie-cutter suburb like this one, having 2.5 kids, then eventually growing apart from those around me, getting divorced like my parents soon will. The realms of imagination and reality are non-permeable. What I create for myself in my mind can never be perfectly translated into reality. You don’t make the rules here. You don’t get what you want.*

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Those were the truths that I found to be evident in my experience. Once I understood these, my frustration with the reality was put into perspective. I looked down at the comic book in my hands. Opening it up to the inside cover revealed Batman standing alongside the extended Batman family. Nightwing, Batwoman, Red Hood, Red Robin, Batgirl, and Robin: all powerless characters who were recruited by Bruce Wayne to be a part of something bigger, to take control of their fates, to become more powerful than those around them, and to assume a new, dynamic role. Their paths were paved by the decisions *they* made, filled with action, adventure, friendship, betrayal, and all that other great stuff we love in our fiction. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now is the part of the story where that indifferent, miserable boy in attic, who’s probably too old to still be reading comic books, thinks that Batman will call upon him to be something greater. He imagines Batman knocking on his window, asking for his help. He imagines the argument he has with the Dark Knight, saying something to the effect of, “No, I can’t leave my family and life behind” (even though it’s all just an act as he would follow Batman without hesitation into his new life, never looking back). He imagines that he could be Robin number six, being taken away to Gotham city to live in Wayne Manor, and be trained by the Caped Crusader himself to physical and mental peak. He imagines dedicating his life to fighting crime against the endless number of villains that threaten his city. He ultimately wishes that life, while not relatively so bad, doesn’t always have to be so pacified and deterministic. But none of that happens. In reality, I finish that comic book, drink that Dr. Pepper, then begin to study for the next ACT.

* * *

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This recollection gave me some initial insight toward my relationship with daydreaming. However, I wanted to look deeper into the nature of daydreaming, particularly in the experience of maladaptive daydreamers and fantasy prone individuals. Through my experiences and research that I’ve done on the topic, I discovered much about the daydreaming process and subsequent interpretations for meaning in the phenomena. What I ultimately found though in trying to gain a fundamental understanding for individuals’ motivations behind extensive fantasizing at the expense of societal functioning was that we as humans utilize daydreaming in almost a paradoxical sense. That is, daydreaming is meant to allow us to imagine a desirable reality which we subjectively define as perfect with a yearning for it to be real, yet at the same time can never be directly translated into our real lives. An unhealthy appreciation for daydreaming, as shown to evident in maladaptive daydreamers, can only be achieved as a result of a strict delineation of the nonpermeable elements of imagination and reality. The reason for this is because of a difference in attributes and scope that each element offers. That’s why scenarios including fantasy elements, preserved memories, absolute control, and defiance of space and time parameters are valued in imagination, but are completely disregarded when trying to produce the same within the frame of reality. It should also be noted that within this model the polarization between imagination and reality being formed is the subsequent result of some previous trauma (of a varying degree) which catalyzes the process.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the strongest evidence for this idea is the work done by University of Haifa in Israel psychology professor Eli Somer. In his study published in the Journal of Contemporary Psychology in 2002, Somer presents clear and descriptive evidence for the motivations behind maladaptive daydreaming (MD) in the participants he studied. Somer’s study, *Maladaptive Daydreaming: A Qualitative Inquiry*, not only informs audiences within the topic of dissociative disorders as to the experience of MD, but also argues for the legitimacy of its causes, and its multifaceted purpose in these patients’ lives.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In his abstract, and as he restates multiple times throughout his study, Somer begins with a clear definition of what is considered maladaptive daydreaming. Though this definition serves as a hypothesis for his study, it is significant that readers gain a clear understanding of it in order for Somer to later validate his definition. Somer states that, “Maladaptive daydreaming (MD) is extensive fantasy activity that replaces human interaction and/or interferes with academic, interpersonal, or vocational functioning” (Somer, 197). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One snapshot of his qualitative methodology includes a series of one-on-one interviews with his participants designed to reveal more about the personal effects of the MD experience. One account comes from the participant referred to as Subject 3, a 24-year-old single female who experienced severe sexual and physical aversive experiences as a child, and who spends up to 8 hours a day in MD (Somer, 204). She states, “It’s an escape from what is happening in the here and now. There are many circumstances in daily life that frighten me. Daydreaming helps me not feel the fear...I feel so powerful in my fantasies. Too bad nothing of this power stays with me when I leave my imaginary world” (Subject 3 qtd. in Somer, 204). Here, Subject 3 relates how reality often makes her feel uncomfortable, which could be interpreted as her feeling powerless. As a means to treat the dissonance of what she is versus what she wants to be, she envisions herself as an individual with great power. We as readers sympathize with Subject 3’s constant fear and some of us may be gladdened by the fact that she is able to feel so strong in her daydreams. But Subject 3 knows that this is not real. She states how she wants to be powerful in reality, but from her standpoint, what is theoretically perfect is practically impossible. Because she affirms this, she draws a strict border between what she likes to fantasize about, versus what she can physically exist as. This distinct polarization between imagination and reality creates a harsh truth to people who experience MD. Since their fantasized desires cannot translate to their actual lives, sufferers disregard the significance of the latter in favor of the former. From this, Somer shows that in MD, mood enhancement can only be accomplished through strict disengagement from one’s reality. Notice how Subject 3 never mentions how her daydreams gave her the vision/confidence to get over her fears. That’s because she has no intention of actually facing them, because to her, they can’t be beaten. She exists as weak and imperfect as she does, but was given the ability to picture herself as something better. So, this instant gratification of extensive fantasizing wins out over trying to replicate her strength in reality, since the impermeable distinction between the two was drawn long ago. This herein reveals the *maladaptive* component to MD. Once the divide between reality and imagination has been drawn, and one is affirmed as broken, harsh, and unforgiving, while the other is viewed as perfect, everlasting, and limitless, then sufferers of MD will always choose imagination over reality. As their daydreams intensify, their reality withers. The problem, however, is that reality demands that we be present at certain moments throughout our daily lives, not allowing us to live completely inside our own heads. So, when the polarization between the two worlds has reached maximum, then the next time a person experiencing MD is called back to reality, we can imagine that results are quite disastrous. This is the influence that Somer claims MD has over people, which he brilliantly illustrates through first-hand statements from the participants of the study. Later on, in his analysis of the results, Somer explicitly captures this idea, stating that:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ""This study sheds preliminary light on the subjective 
experience and meaning of malignant fantasy in a group of psychotherapy patients. Analysis of the participants’ verbatim transcripts leads to the conclusion that these bright persons may have had a creative but normal imaginary disposition that preceded their childhood predicaments. Painful interpersonal experiences encountered during a time when basic assumptions about the world and their self-images were developing, sent these young persons into their much safer imaginary world."" (Somer, 210)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As Somer has shown, the presence of maladaptive daydreaming is a unique experience, that, although develops from similar, measurable causes, is highly subjective in its execution. However, what can be drawn from all experiences is the idea of polarization between imagination and reality which motivates suffers of MD to further invest themselves into sustaining their obsessive relationships with daydreaming.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Though Somer’s groundbreaking work has empirically revealed the underlying motivations for maladaptive daydreaming, we can also see the same themes presented in other works. One example comes from professional magician Nate Staniforth’s book, *Here Is Real Magic*. In it, Staniforth details his journey to India to rekindle the sense of wonder and awe that once captivated him when he started practicing magic. During his many experiences with doing magic, Staniforth reflects on the motivations and implications for pursuing his line of work. Ultimately, the purpose of his novel is to convince readers as to the role magic plays in breaking down our affirmations about reality in order to feel like a kid again: full of mystery and wonder. What is perhaps most interesting, however, is Staniforth’s breakdown of why some people react with such disdain toward magic. Staniforth describes that:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ""People have hard lives, and something like magic that promises a moment of real joy or even a new way of seeing the world threatens to unseat whatever insulation they have managed to erect between themselves and that hardness… The cultural resentment toward magic comes from the sadness found in the space between the universal human longing to believe in magic and the overwhelming evidence all around us that there is no such thing."" (Staniforth, 69)

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Though Staniforth is describing a cultural frustration in the context of magic, we can relate his ideas to the motivations for maladaptive daydreaming. Magic is a power which inherently extends beyond the natural, making it a fantasy element. This is one such element that we can perfectly envision in our imaginations and affirm its authenticity without question. In fact, the idea of wielding magic is attractive to a large population that finds itself invested in works of fiction, such as the *Harry Potter* series or *Dungeons and Dragons* role-playing game, just to name a few. The point is, within those imagined contexts, the fantasy element is normalized. Contrast this to reality, where people affirm that no such thing exists. It is because of these people’s affirmation of the apparent “imperfectness” of the world, that any attempt to introduce some magical element into it is met with disdain. This argument seems to paint all nonbelievers as intrinsic nihilists, born to hate the world for what it is. However, this is technically not the case. We as humans are not predisposed to believe that the world is as random and imperfect as it, rather throughout our lives the world shows *to us* its true nature, which slowly breaks down our own view of it to fit with the stagnate reality of the situation. That is why any fantasy elements (including magic) can only be accepted under the explicit pretense that it’s an illusion, otherwise you’re just a fool raging against an unforgiving world that will break you down eventually. Connecting this to daydreaming, maladaptive daydreamers must accept a nihilistic view of reality in order to engage in an imaginary realm where they can see themselves as they want to be, otherwise they feel like they’re just lying to themselves. This once again furthers the argument that daydreaming calls for distinct polarization between an imperfect world and an everlasting imagination in order visualize the things we want in their truest form.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Another example comes from fantasy novelist R.L. LaFevers. In her article titled, “Why Fantasy Matters” LaFevers aims to inform readers as to the role that fantasy plays in our society, specifically during childhood, and why fantasy has become more important now than ever in revitalizing our sense of wonder. One point LaFevers makes is that fantasy allows writers to explore topics such as violence, death, and other forms of evil by separating them from reality and imposing them in a context of their own making. This then allows readers to take in these topics that, in their real-world forms are unappealing, and make them dynamic and interesting, empowering the reader rather than terrorizing them (LaFevers). This idea correlates to how we as humans synthesize such irrational daydreams (which parallel fantasy elements) as a means of strictly dissociating from our reality, to create one where we can still enjoy all the harshness that the real world offers, but through the scope that we control all the outcomes, unlike real life. Fantasy encourages us to create for ourselves scenarios of power, but still offers us forms of struggle and randomness which we interpret as excitement. Sure, if you want something random go live in the real world, but if you want something difficult where you ultimately control the outcome, then create for yourself an idealized scenario where you utilize these forms of evil and virtue to create the resolution you seek. However, if the scenario were to be translated to reality, then we as the creator would lose all control over the outcome and suddenly violence and death would scare us, and we’d be back to square one with being dissatisfied with our present situation. Ultimately, the importance of fantasy reveals that we daydream under the pretense of what we want to be real, but if in fact it was real that would mean it would be imperfect, unlike how we envision it. So, what we really want is absolute control over all outcomes (even if we don’t want to be presently aware of them), which is impossible in the real world, therefore making translation between daydreaming and reality impractical. Maladaptive daydreamers understand this perceived impracticality and combat it, albeit maladaptively, by disregarding any attempt at translation of fantasy for as much absorption of the fantasy itself that they can perceive. This once again shows that unmonitored daydreaming truly contributes to the polarization between realities as a means of treatment for the dissonance that we face in the waking world.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So as we have seen, maladaptive fantasies operate upon the paradox of the dreamer wanting something to be real so bad yet would disregard it if were to come true in some form. Be that as it may, the cycle of engaging in elaborate fantasies to escape reality only seems to be self-sustaining, not a means to a resolution. People who find themselves increasingly detached from reality already know this, but I thought it would be important to give people an understanding of what I found makes the act so appealing in the first place. We as daydreamers seem so beautifully entangled in a conflict of our making, struggling to fight against the grasps of reality which order us to be present, if only for a few moments of true perceived elevation. However, frustrating though the struggle may be, we must remember that it is a harsh fate we seal for ourselves if we choose to live the remainder of our lives caught up in it. A close approximation of a sensation felt in the real world beats a perfectly envisioned one any day. All we can do is try to find a balance between the two which allows us to be at peace in a reality that changes faster than we can imagine. As I have stated before, I still to struggle to find this balance in my life, but I don’t think I would be consciously aware of if I ever did find balance. Ultimately though, I’ll continue to work toward the day when I fully awake from that daydream and make something I’m content with here in reality, because after all, *a good life is its own reward.*

Hi! I hope you guys are doing great. I am EpicChiguire and I'm am a 22 year old Venezuelan guy who studies Modern Languages. I lived all my life in Venezuela up until this year, because I am currently in Argentina taking an Internship as a Spanish as a Second Language Teaching Assistant. My interests are not only gaming, but History, Writing (I have a blog with short stories and poems that I update every once in a while), and Filmmaking (in fact, I am planning on shooting a short film in the following hours with a couple of friends, God willing). A friend from this sub gifted me AC Origins (I am so thankful, /u/Dhexodus) and it has been the game that I've played the most in my life (I've put 75 hours on it), lol. Now, as I'm a broke son of a gun, I would like to ask for the DLC.

If you don't wanna read the whole text, I'm gonna put the TL;DR right here... but come on, give it a read (I really hope you enjoy it, it took some effort to write this lol).

TL;DR: I tried to make this post as elaborated as possible, but at the same time, let's simplify this matter. So... the idea of getting Assassin's Creed: Origins, a good game from a saga that means a lot to me, set in a period that is arguably my favorite of all time; a saga that takes me back to when I lived better days in a better country... I know videogames aren't the answer for personal crisis, but I think that they can help to cope with some stuff (like the pain of seeing your country being run to the ground, the melancholy that comes when being separated from your family, that void that cannot be healed easily). So that is why I want to have Assassin's Creed: Origins - The Hidden Ones. Here's my Steam ID and here's The Hidden Ones page.

PART I: An Introduction to Assassin's Creed, or the story of how EpicChiguire got obsessed with a saga that came out of the blue

As many of you may know, Assassin's Creed is one of the biggest sagas of the last years. Groundbreaking and recognized for its incredible renditions of many cities and places of the ancient worlds (from the Middle East to the Caribbean), it has many followers and haters alike. I, for one, am one of the fans of the saga. I played the first Assassin's Creed back in 2008 when I was in High School, and I was hooked on with it ever since. The possibility of playing as a badass Assassin during the Third Crusade (one of my favorite periods) was super cool, and then trying to uncover a conspiracy in the Modern Day at the same time... man, those were the days. Going back and forth from Altair's douchey character to the insecure Desmond Miles, and ending up with that wall full of riddles... just wow.

I remember I'd play AC1 on my dad's PC with his GeForce 8400GS of 512mb DDR2 with all graphics set to minimum and still have lots of fun. I still can remember that melancholic Sunday when my relatives came over and I played a bit after I left (not that it's a meaningful memory, but it really takes me back to when everything was better... no economic crisis in my country, not having to live separated from my folks, etc). Then came Assassin's Creed 2. First time watching an E3 trailer. 14 old me was ecstatic. That's when I was introduced to Ezio and the Renaissance. Up until then, everything I knew about that historical period was a couple of random facts and paintings and that was it. Now armed with my dad's powerful GPU on my own PC (yep, still that 8400GS), I submerged myself into that beautiful world of Florence and Venice (and still had one of my nerdiest moments when I played with Desmond in the MD). Running through Florence's red rooftops, just to get to the Villa Auditore, then relax while peacefully comandeering a gondola through Venice's waters; ending up in the Campagna to fight with the Condottieri for the liberation of those beautifully rendered lands from the grip of the Borgia... my dad would come to my room and ask me what was I playing, I just show him the gameplay and he would look at it, and leave, seemingly uninterested. He's more of an Age of Empires fan (he finished AoE3's campaign before me and he was the one who introduced me to gaming in general).

Sometimes my routine in my last year of High School would be getting home early (10 or 11 am) after class and play AC2 until my parents came, we had lunch together and then I played some more before doing any actual homework. It was because of this game that I fell in love with the Renaissance as a historical period. I've always been a huge history nerd, but up until that point, Ancient Egypt had been the main focus of my interest, but thanks to AC1 I got interested in the Crusades (the 3rd Crusade, specifically), and now this wonderful period.

Queue to E3 2010. Ezio in Rome. Holy crap, the hype. Those trailers were just soo goooood!!! I loved the one where it seems like Cesare Borgia starts rapping ""Nowhere in this city have I met a man equal to myself. A soul willing to die in the name of destiny..."" But nope, he wasn't rapping. Playing that game was kinda hard because my GPU was already staying behind and it was normal for the game to play at 15FPS in most places. Anyway, I managed to complete it (and be surprised with that freaking cliffhanger in the MD). AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE DA VINCI DISAPPEARANCE DLC. Those trailers were good as hell, ""Leonardo your master requires your presence."" ""I am done playing! So are we!"". Just great marketing. (Did I say that I learned most of my English with videogames such as AC and COD? Also, 80% of the few words that I know in Italian come from AC lol). Now, AC Revelations was kinda good but the performance was a little bit lacking (my GPU was struggling a lot with it), so I played it on my dad's new laptop at the time (its specs were simple, i3 and HD3000). Still, the E3 trailer was super dope and I really wanted to see how Ezio's story ended. (I may or may not have shed a tear with AC Embers, when we see Ezio die).

Come AC3, and even though I wasn't that interested in the American Revolution setting (I mean, I am Venezuelan, I would have preferred to see the South American Revolutions led by Bolívar and Miranda), and of course, my poor PC couldn't handle it. I had to wait until the Christmas break in order to go back home (my university is 8 hours away from my parents' house) in order to play it on my dad's laptop (an i3 with an HD3000). It was something, and it allowed me to experience that game (and have one of the biggest nerdgasms when playing as Desmond in Abstergo... and feel extremely disappointed with how they finished Desmond's arc. Seriously? More than 70-80 hours into that saga and that's how they dealt with Desmond? Such a waste of potential...) Come the next AC Black Flag and my dad's laptop was still able to hold up (with all in minimum at 15-20 FPS, the resolution was 800x600), and regardless of the terrible performance, I completed both those games because I was really into that saga (again, even though I hated what happened with Desmond).

PART 2: REAL LIFE STRIKES AGAIN

E3 2014. It had been leaked that the next AC was going to be set in the French Revolution. Ironic. That was the year where I started to learn French, and the same year were the biggest wage of protests in a long time took place all over the country. It was the Government and its paramilitary groups against the people. I lost a whole semester of classes thanks to the protests. I am not mad at the protesters though (I even took parts in the demonstrations, we were speaking out against our Government's corruption, the hunger that was starting to spread all across the country and the economic crisis). After a while I refrained from going out to the streets, I saw the police and the paramilitary working together in front of the house where I lived, I saw it with my own eyes. Many students died (almost a hundred) and their deaths are an omen of what my country is like. The Government just washed their hands on their blood, saying that they got killed because of their ""irresponsibility"". Now, let's be honest: I was super hyped with Unity, but when your country is crumbling and falling to pieces, a videogame is the last of your priorities. The money I had wasn't going to be used on getting a new PC or an XBox One, I had other things to take care of.

I wasn't able to play Unity and Syndicate up until a couple of months ago (thanks to a couple friends that let me play on their consoles while I was able to upgrade to a better machine), and even though both were underwhelming, they're still not that bad. I remember being really hyped with Syndicate (the Victorian Era is one of my favorites in History), but Syndicate's rendition of that era seemed a little bit too cheery and wasted for my personal taste. Now, Assassin's Creed: Origins has earned good reviews and has been praised by critics and fans alike. On the other hand, don't kill me for this, but I loved the Assassin's Creed movie. I remember going to watch it alone on purpose (and one of the reasons was because I was in a bad moment and I wanted to enjoy something alone), and it really lived up to my hype.

PART 3: EGYPT

You may know for sure at this point that I love history. I must have been 7 years old when I got obsessed with Tuthankamon. I loved all things related to Egypt. My parents had many History books, and I would read about Greek, Roman and Egyptian History and Mythology (it was almost as if I could tell you most of the crazy Greek myths as part of a lunch conversation), but my true love was Egypt. Reading about Karnak, Abu Simbel, the Piramids, the images of the Sphinx and the Piramids... 6 or 7 years old EpicChiguire was just mesmerized. When he got a chance to have a project in 2nd grade (I think) about any topic, I chose to talk about the Egyptians. It was in my research when I found out about King Tut, and all the mystery and grandeur that surrounded him. His reign wasn't that important, and he died really young (some Archaeologists say that he died in his 19s other in his 20s) after a brief period of 10 years of ruling over the Nile. But what made him really famous was the discovering of his tomb in the beginning of the XX Century, by Howard Carter (and if my memory serves me right, under the funding of Lord Carnarvon).

The conditions surrounding the discovery of his sarcophagus, the perfect state of his tomb and the rumor of a millenary curse were more than enough to enthrall the mind of a young child. Egypt has been my favorite history period ever since (and if you were to ask me, the 18th Dinasty is my favorite). I've forgotten lots of things that I used to know and I have given up on my dream of becoming an Archaeologists specialized in Egyptology, but my love for Egypt remains the same. I was able to get a hold of this book a couple of months ago and I'd say that it is one of my dearest belongings. I mean, it's a book about MY FAVORITE PHARAOH, WRITTEN BY MY FAVORITE ARCHAEOLOGIST (besides Howard Carter, lol). I loved the fact that I was able to plant the seed of the love for Egypt in my baby nephew when I showed him this book while telling him tales of Egypt. Since that day, every time that I'm skyping with him, he asks me to keep telling him about ""the book of the mummies"".

Now, close your eyes (not really because otherwise you won't be able to keep reading this) and imagine that your favorite saga is going to publish a game set in your favorite place. That's how I felt. I mean, the only I could have even more hyped was if they announced an AC taking place in Venezuela (and South America) during our Revolutions in the 19th Century. I wasn't a big fan of the Ptolemaic period, but after thinking about it, and seeing the reactions from the fans, I really, really want to have this game. Walking through the Egyptian desert, traveling through the Nile, getting into fights in Old Egyptian ruins, getting to know the FREAKING LIBRARY OF ALEXANDRIA?! A nerd's dream. EpicChiguire's dream. Now, this dream has been fulfilled (and more than satisfied) with a game that freaking blew my mind and made me nerd a lot.

PART 4: ""BRUH, DO YOU EVEN BUY A GAME WITH YOUR OWN MONEY?""

Why can't I get it by myself?

Now, I can't buy this game because it's worth 40 bucks right now (with the Steam discount). I'm taking my Internships in Argentina (and I basically moved here from Venezuela... I could say that I'm self exiled at this point), and I literally can't get a job at the moment because said Internships are full time and I don't have the time to work somewhere else. Given the fact that this University is giving me food and accommodations, they deemed necessary to give me 100$ a month in order to pay for my personal expenses. Now, 100USD is 2000 Argentinian pesos. I am undergoing some therapy at the moment, and between the sessions, the meds, and my personal expenses (like shampoo, soap and deodorant, because I may be a pig, but at least a clean one), those 2000 pesos fly away very, very easily (This week I spent literally 1300 in some medication). I can't complain because I get food and a place where to sleep, but taking into account the fact that I am from Venezuela (my country is in the worst crisis of its history, to the point where the minimum wage is 1 DOLLAR A MONTH), and I am living in another country on my own (away from my parents and my siblings, whom I miss with all I am), I need to save every single penny I can in order to start maintaining myself while I get a job and a place to live after I'm done with these internships.

I didn't even have the money to go back to Venezuela for Christmas, and I just spent my first Christmas day away from my old folks and my brother and sister, which, I won't lie... it was a bummer. I admit that I cried, but I only did it after I spoke with mom over the phone because I knew she was gonna start sobbing too. Imagine the idea of not being able to return to your country because if you do, you'll very likely to face starvation, the biggest inflation in America, the highest crime rate in the continent... and the list goes on. The sole idea of my Homeland going through that situation breaks my heart and really depresses me, to be honest. Getting this DLC won't make the depression go away, nor will it make my country get out of this situation. It won't even be able to make me worry less about how is my family doing in my country... but it could help.

EPILOGUE, or TL;DR

I tried to make this post as elaborated as possible, but at the same time, let's simplify this matter. So... the idea of getting a DLC Assassin's Creed: Origins, a good game from a saga that means a lot to me, set in a period that is arguably my favorite of all time; a saga that takes me back to when I lived better days in a better country... So that is why I want to have Assassin's Creed: Origins. Here's my Steam ID and here's Assassin's Creed: Origins page. Thank you for reading this!"

I'm a third-year 20/F student going to a good UC school. I study computational biology, which is a mix of CS and bio, and have maintained a 3.8 GPA. I'm a good student on paper, but the reality is that I don't feel passionate enough about any subject to pursue it as a career. (I've stopped believing that I NEED to be passionate about something, after reading ""Too Good They Can't Ignore You"", but the passion mindset is hard to change). After getting rejected from 20+ summer internships, I've been feeling very discouraged and generally lost. I've heard the ""just do something you're interested in!"" mantra many times and it's just cliche to me at this point. Right now, I'm just taking classes to do well in them, and working out to keep in shape, but otherwise growing quite bored and perhaps depressed at my lack of summer plans/direction. Any suggestions? Does it get better? Do I choose something and go for it? "

(Some Cheating, BDSM, and maybe eventual Cuckolding)",AthletesLonelyWife,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8cd69v/f4m_these_damn_headaches_some_cheating_bdsm_and/,"*Fuck my head hurts. These headaches are killing me...* I rub my forehead as I turn off my computer. Finally finished with the brutal day of work, and a failed presentation. I was the VP of marketing from sheer hard work and determination, but these damn headaches were getting in my way. Thank god I was going to be able to see my boyfriend tonight. For some reason whenever I was with him I felt somewhat better.  

It’s been two years since you left me. Two long years of these damn headaches. 

We had met in the elevator at work. I was just an intern and you were the big boss of the marketing department. I was standing in the corner of the elevator as you came in. I instantly caught your eyes and it felt like they were drilling into my very soul. My knees were shaking and I could feel the sheer heat from my pussy against my thighs. 

It was barely a day before I was on my knees serving you for the first time. Barely a week before I was bent over your desk late at night every night. Until we moved onto the hotels. Eventually you started bringing me to your place. The sex was unlike anything I’ve ever felt before. 

It started as vanilla and loving as it could have been. Missionary, soft romantic cuddling. It didn’t last very long. Soon it was doggy style. Then it was riding your cock. Eventually it turned into a full blown Master and Sub relationship. You forced me to do more and more lewd things. 

Not wearing panties at work. Forcing toys inside my ass all day. Cumming inside of me while I walked to our next meeting. At home it was even wilder, collars, chains and whips. Leading me around your upper floor penthouse and floor to ceiling glass windows. Anyone high enough would have been able to see me lewdly sucking your cock in all parts of the night. 

It was all fun, at least thats what I told myself. I didn’t realize how much I’d be depending on you, how much my body would be depending on you. 

I didnt realize it until suddenly you just left. “I’m leaving the country, I don’t need you anymore” those were the last words I heard you say which broke my heart and made me cry for ten days straight. That’s when the headaches started like massive withdrawals from the sheer sexual lust we had. 

I focused on work and even got a boyfriend. He was amazing, loving and caring. Always attentive and put up with my bitchy moods when I had headaches. He felt good to be around but these headaches never fully went away. 

I left my office and headed for the elevator. Going inside and curling into my usual corner as I tried to think about my boyfriend. Feeling his hands massaging my head. Sometimes if I was up for it I’d even let him pet my pussy until I came. Those were the days I felt the best. But it was never that easy to cum. He couldn’t make me cum like you made me. 

I groaned hearing the elevator stop on a floor halfway down the building. Seeing it open and a large tall handsome man step inside. We locked eyes and I felt my whole body shiver. My knees were weak as I grabbed my coat and held it tightly against me. My eyes opened wide, jaw dropped and pussy already flooding. It was you! 

I tried to call out. I tried to ask why you left. I tried to say anything. Nothing came out as you waiting as we went down the rest of the floors. I could feel my face burning. Was it excitement? Anger? Lust? My pussy was throbbing between my legs as I bit my lip. 

“Westin Room 1200. You know what to wear...” I hear your voice and it sends shivers through my spine. If I could touch my pussy at this moment I would have came. 

“Yes Master.” You hear me whisper as my cheeks flow crimson. I watch you walk away as the elevator doors open and stand there speechless. I watch the doors close behind you on the floor I needed to leave on. 

It was barely two hours later. The elevator carrying me up to the tallest suite in the hotel. There were three rooms at the top and I knew exactly what it looked like. I’ve been here many times before when you really wanted to take me. I had crimson red heels on and my make up and hair was done like I was going to a romantic dinner. A trench coat covered my entire body but stopped just above my knees. I stepped out and went to your room, giving it a soft three knocks.

I see the door open and your towering figure covers the whole frame. 

“Take it off.” Your voice makes me shiver with pleasure. It’s been so long since I’ve heard your voice. Since you’ve given me commands. 

“But... someone could see...” I whisper as I look around nervously and you were already closing the door. 

“Wait!” I cry out as I quickly pull the Coat off my shoulders and let it fall. I was left in a pair of crotchless lace panties and a lace corset with the breast area cut out so my bare tits were hanging out. 

“Spin.” I hear you say and I could feel my pussy leaking as I spinned slowly for you and I bit my lip as my hands subconsciously folded behind my lower back pushing my tits out towards you. 

“Good bitch.” I hear you say as you move away from the door and I quickly step inside. 

My headaches were gone...

8cdu3m,8,2018-04-15,"I’m an Australian Psych Undergrad, and I’m kind of confused as to what I should do for my post-grad degree. Advice from Aussie mental health workers or those who know the system here would be a godsend.",sixdollardress,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/8cdu3m/im_an_australian_psych_undergrad_and_im_kind_of/,"**Short version/TL;DR**: Is there a way of becoming a therapist in Australia without doing a ton of research (ie. designing and running a study, or working with a professor on theirs)? I want to be able to work with clients, but hate doing research. Specifically I am wondering if Australia has a position similar to a LCSW or Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner; how feasible 5+1 or 4+2 pathways to APS registration are; if doing a Masters Of Counselling or similar will make me employable: or if there exist MPsych degrees that focus mainly on practice rather than research. I have googled, but the answers to these questions still aren’t clear. Thanks so much to any who can help. 

Also, if anyone knows of any Australia-specific psychology subs that would be good to post this to, I would love some recommendations. :) 

**Long version:**

I am finally completing my third year of a Bachelor of Psychological Science at Griffith University in Brisbane. My grades have been good so far (GPA tends to stay between a 5.5 and a 6, honours entry at my uni is a 6), but I am feeling a bit confused about where to go from here.

I would ideally love to work as a therapist of some kind. The thing that most appeals to me is work in hospitals - running inpatient/outpatient groups and/or doing individual sessions with inpatients is something I think I would really enjoy. However, as long as I am in a job where I am doing some kind of counselling or work with clients, I would be happy. My primary areas of interest are addiction/substance abuse, trauma, and eating disorders. I also have a lot of interest in working with teenagers, or even becoming a school counsellor of some kind.

My program is APS-approved and thus I have the opportunity to move on to honours and then theoretically to a Masters or phD...however, I absolutely hate doing research. I love *reading* research, and I think it’s extremely important to use a scientist-practitioner perspective and evidence-based treatment in practice, of course....I just really don’t enjoy doing research myself. I know most post-grad degrees involve some kind of thesis or dissertation, which is okay...but the idea of spending the next 3-4 years devoting at least 50% of my time to conducting or analysing research, as I have heard you do while in post-grad psych degrees, makes me want to cry. 

Of course, if doing research is the only way to get where I want to go, I will just suck it up and do it. I am wondering if there are any alternatives, though? Specifically, I have been wondering:

- I have heard in the US there is a position called a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) which allows people to do counselling etc without having to become a full psychologist. Do we have this position here, or an equivalent? Are there any social work degrees here that would make you eligible to perform therapy, or are they more likely to end with you working at centrelink?

- I have also read about the APS pathways to registration that involve less research and more practical work - the 4+2 (honours + 2 years of supervised practice) and 5+1 (honours + grad dip + 1 year supervised practice) really appeal to me. However, are these pathways to registration a good idea when it comes to pay and employability, ie. are you less likely to be hired or are you paid significantly less than a psych who used a masters/phD path to registration?  I have heard some people saying that these pathways are looked down on. Also, is getting a position in which you can do the supervised practice required of these pathways achievable, or are those positions hard to find?

- Are there psych post-grad degrees that don’t involve a lot of research? I heard that a PsyD used to be more coursework than research, but then they were phased out or something? Do there exist any coursework Masters that are mostly placement and training rather than research, or does the APS demand that research be a large component of all psych post-grad degrees?

- Are “Counselling” degrees a good idea, or are they a waste of time? They offer a Masters of Counselling at my university, which focuses a lot more on performing therapy than doing research, but given that anyone can legally call themselves a “counsellor” here, I am a bit concerned about it not adding much to my employability.

- I have also thought about doing a nursing degree, with a view to one day becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner - again, in the US I have heard they work alongside psychiatrists a lot of the time, helping to prescribe meds and even running groups with inpatients. I again have no idea what their status is in Australia, though - is this a job that exists here, or are PNPs not really a thing here?

If anyone could give any insight into any of those questions, I would be so thankful. As a bonus question, too: At uni we are encouraged to do internships and voluntary work with mental health organisations - eg. Lifeline, Headspace, etc - because it makes it more likely that we’ll be accepted into a post-grad degree. Does anyone know if doing this kind of thing actually improves your chances of a post-grad admission? Or is it more just a way to see how organisations like this work, have a taste of the job we’ll eventually be going for, and to network a bit?

Thank you so so much to anyone who read all this and can offer advice. &lt;3

Our party had spent the majority of our time tracking down a cult that worshipped an ancient figure of folklore, associated with plague and decay. We'd dealt with small gangs employed to disrupt the work of the Clasp (the main Thieves Guild of Tal'Dorei) as well as a mad scientist lurking beneath Emon. We'd partnered with and eventually rescued a cleric of the Stormlord, and tracked the cult to an abandoned manor above the Foramire Basin. After one or two attempts to survive the dangers inside, we succeed in thwarting the cults machinations. However two of our party members, the Warlock Kozaint and the Barbarian Draski, found themselves indebted to an elven noble/warrior named Aeredrin, and were forced to leave the group to ensure our safety. The party now returns to Kymal, to recuperate and to reflect on recent events.

*Link to Session 01, if you want a more detailed recap* (https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6yo83o/explorers_of_taldorei_campaign_journal_session_1/).

**Party Members:**

* Tyrix (my character): Dragonborn (*Ravenite*) Paladin - Oathbreaker, follows the Everlight

* Naxibis: Abyssal Tiefling Bard - Collage of Lore

* Pluff (player absent): Human Wizard - School of Conjuration/Artificer (Revised) - Mechanist

* Roran: Human Cleric - Tempest Domain, follows the Stormlord.

After a few days travel, we make it back to Kymal and try to get some work done in the brief bit of downtime we've been granted. 

* Roran visits the local temple to the Stormlord and swaps out his blue vestments for some red ones. Roran has some connections to a few of the temples to the Stormlord in Tal'Dorei, specifically the one in Emon.

* Tyrix, Naxibis and Pluff go to trade in some of the gems they acquired in the manor. The three of us were able to get a pretty good deal on the gems by having Tyrix play the silent muscle and Naxibis the overly excited escort. Either he was too flustered or freaked out to play the shrewd businessman he was last time, since we were able to get an extra 120 gp out of him.

* Pluff spends some time working on some plans in his room, but doesn't get enough time to finish whatever he is building. He did however take some time to make some cloth tags for the group to tie onto their belts, each with a symbol of a rat impaled by an arrow. As such, our party are going by the moniker ""the Ratcatchers"". He also made two spare ones, in case Kozaint + Draski show up.

* Tyrix and Naxibis take to drinking, lamenting that without Draski and Kozaint, the party isn't freakish enough for them to fit in.

After a day or two of rest, the party (sans a busy Pluff) are making plans over breakfast and hangover cures. With the plague cult dealt with, we have a couple of options; The reports of missing woodcutters near the Bramblewood, recovering people or bodies of people that have dissapeared near the Ironseat Ridge, or following up on a lead from the plague cult in Bronbog, regarding the mysterious Aergusarth. Since the Ironseat Ridge is nearest, and the Bronbog is a ways off, we decide to follow up on that bounty. 

As the three of us are preparing to leave and grab some resources, Roran spots a young figure looking at the group, specifically Naxibis. When he tries to leave, Roran moves to intercept him and gets given a note to give to Naxibis. Reading in, Naxibis says she needs to see someone about a meeting and sends the others off into the town. After Roran and Tyrix depart, she follows the instructions in the note, arriving in a secret loft, alongside the messenger from earlier, and Marco (also known as the Maul). Apparently they've been spending some time trying to locate her, and when Naxibis asks why..............

So after Tyrix and Roran get back from shopping for equipment, they find Naxibis back at the inn, alongside the messenger from earlier, who introduces themselves:

* Astar: Tiefling Vigilante - Technological Might. Light grey skin, scruffy black hair and short horns. Wears a cloak, with dirty clothes underneath, and carries a couple of daggers.

So apparently Astar and the Clasp had been hired to locate Naxibis on behalf of her father. Not the halfling from Emon, but her actual biological father that Naxibis has never really known. According to him, her mother has passed away and he's funded the clasp to locate her. No one in the party thinks this is on the level, as they don't trust the Clasp and the last group of people who were looking for Naxibis were the Plague Cult. Because of this, no one trusts Aster, and even a *Zone of Truth* didn't tell us much about him, other than him not trusting the Clasp either. To try and get some more info out of him, the party offers him a counter deal; Assist us in our mission to the Ironseat Ridge, and if he proves up to snuff, Naxibis will go with him to this meeting with her dad.

With a deal made with our new intern and introductions out the way, we go to get transportation for the journey and run into another new face.

* Dench: Half-Orc Barbarian - Path of the Totem Warrior. Grey/purple skin, medium brown hair, and several scars across his upper body, including one that resembles a tally mark. Also has a necklace with animal bones, and carved symbols.

While some of the party are purchasing horses and discussing our upcoming work, Dench overhears us and being both bored, and absurdly tough, asks for an opportunity to tag along. Some of the group point out that we could use the extra muscle, as well as someone that has experience in the local terrain. So now with two interns in tow, we depart of the ridge.

After a few hours, we make it into the outskirts of the ridge, and are almost immediately beset by Orcs, including a pair of Nurtured Ones, and two Tanarukks. Given a chance to shake of the dust, we are able to take them out fairly quickly, but half of us had to keep the horses under control. However, despite Tyrix getting ganked by both Tanarukks and the Nurtured Ones, the party clear out the orcs without burning too many resources. Props go to Roran's max damage *Call Lightning* spells and Dench being both insanely durable and insanely strong.

Following this skirmish, we took a short rest to recover and rifle through our attackers things.

And that's where the session ended.

**Highlights/Notes:**

* God, it feels good to be back.

* During the parties us of *Zone of Truth*, Tyrix decided to ask Roran if he'd experienced anything embarrassing. Apparently the cleric considers his wife dying in a shipwreck and him blaming himself for it to be embarrassing rather than simply tragic. Says a lot right there.

* Astar almost immediately made at least 2 kinda racist cracks at Tyrix for being a dragonborn. So he's on the shit list for now.

* Dench mentioned that one of his hobbies was kicking in doors throughout Kymal. Since his player is unfamiliar with Critical Role or it's in jokes, he doesn't realise this essentially makes him the Siatama of Tal'Dorei.

* Tyrix has changed the command word for Aegrusarth's Gift to ""Snowflame"", but in Draconic.

* Roran finds an Abyssal sigil tattooed on the neck of one of the Tanarukks. Naxibis translates it to Heerius.

* This is also the first session of this campaign where none of the players rolled a Nat 1.

* Post game the subject of whether or not Dragonborn, being lizards, are lactose intolerant. Someone in the comments get back to me on this.

**Loot/Rewards:**

* 375 gp from selling the gems from the Bag of Holding.

* 12gp, 26 sp, 2 blue quartz from the Tanarukks. Each quartz is only worth about 10gp cos they have been chewed on.

* 3 *Potions of Healing*, purchased while in Kymal.

* 6 Wheels of Cheese, also from the Tanarukks. Apparently they will take bites out of gems but not actual food. Go figure.

**Author's Note - Regarding the hiatus:** So our original DM said that we were going to take a few weeks off before continuing the campaign, however right before we were due to start again, he vanished. His Roll20 account, Discord account, Reddit account, and the server we used on Discord all were deleted. And since we're all in different countries, we had no way of physically contacting him. So we reached a new arrangement amongst the groups members; Draski's player is now DMing, since his character has departed for pit fights unknown, and he's got the most experience out of all of us. We're also only going every 2 weeks from now on, so hopefully we'll be able to manage longer sessions too. That being said, it's still really good to be back.

As we have seen time and time again in recent years, some company name or public figure does/says something mildly offensive, the internet has a cow, and said company/public figure is in my news feed until someone fingerblasts a Hollywood intern on the set of a movie without consent. 

With the exception of the extremely appalling cases ( Kevin spacey, Cosby, Weinstein, and so on) a lot of these incidents end up with an apology and a boost in free online marketing, clicks, views, and followers( Logan Paul’s subscriber count skyrocketed after hanging incident)

Does anyone else think there may be marketing firms that specialize in outrage marketing? Similar to what radiolab and reply all discover with Russian and Mexican companies who hire young internet savvy people to make certain political topics trend online in attempts to sway an election. It wouldn’t surprise me if we found out there were a companies who staffed bloggers, social justice warrior tweeters, and even right wing free speech advocates to fight back in forth over a manufactured incident to promote a business or piece of entertainment media.

I started thinking about this after realizing a lot of online personalities I enjoy I was introduced to after some kind of scandal. Jordan Peterson, Colin moriarty, and Owen Benjamin to name a few. I’m not at all suggesting they would have hired this hypothetical service I’m just giving an example of public outrage actually aiding in acquiring new fans.

So my dad has been made redundant for a year now.. I grew up under a very privileged family but yeah shit really does happen and we’ve gone from living more than comfortably to very uncomfortable.

Times are very hard and my parents are going to sell our house in London where I currently live to help basically all of us be able to survive better.. atm it’s really rough. 

My parents are planning to move to a house which we can afford and is a lot cheaper than London. That means I obviously won’t have my London home when I graduate.

It’s really stressing me and breaking my heart.. everything is here for me... my job in the city ( I’ve been offered a grad role), my boyfriend, my friends.. but I won’t have a house now.. I feel selfish. I know my parents are doing this because we have no options... money is short and the only way to get it rather easily is to sell our house which is worth a lot of money.

I’m driven to try and save as much money so I can live in London when I graduate.. but I mean I really don’t see it happening which a graduate salary.. :/ Id like to buy a house but let’s be real.. that’s not going to happen unless someone can advice me otherwise? I’m willing to do absolutely everything I can to try and save money to be able to stay in my City.

My current thoughts are renting somewhere.. which sucks but it’s all I can do... 

I’m just really sad about this.. I feel like I’ll have to sacrifice so much to be able to afford living in London and it kind of sucks... I’ll quit the gym and train at home/Park.. I’ll cook at home and not meet friends for dinners out.. I won’t drive I’ll use public transport.. I’ll get a part time job if I have to when I go back to uni ( I’m currently on an internship).

Is there any advice you guys could give me? I just feel like there’s no hope in being able to go about this comfortably..

I’d b really happy to hear back from you all :)

Thank you so much."

Firstly, the position of chief resident is talked about as being a reward to honor the best surgeon, but realistically it’s more of an admin/management type role. We see this when Callie gets the position. She is a very good surgeon, but she wasn’t very good at the position, because her focus was on being the absolute best in her field. Bailey actually cared about how the development of the interns and residents, and that is vital to doing the job well. I feel like Webber should have already understood this given that he’s been at this hospital for so long, but then he doubles down on this mistake later on when mer’s year is competing for it. He explicitly sets up in the same way. He tells Cristina how great she would be for the role, but we know she doesn’t have the skill set for it, and not once are the requirements for the job discussed with any of the candidates. If chief resident just meant you get some kind of honor or plaque I would absolutely understand them all going for it so strongly, but april is likely the only one that would actually be a good fit for the role, because she is the only one who seems to enjoy that part of the job. 

And then his insistence on being on the cutting edge of medical research severely undercuts his goal of being a good teaching hospital. This is definitely a criticism of the writing here, but it just bothers me so much that he puts so much focus on the attendings to push for intense medical innovation when they could be looking at how to better train the doctors coming in. Teddy and Arizona are the only two attendings that put any real emphasis on training. 

He is always very concerned with the status of the hospital as a leader in medical research but I feel like that kind of stuff really distracts him from overseeing the growth of his surgical team. 

I generally love the idea of project/career motivated storylines, but I just feel like too often Webber neglects the main purpose of his job for a lot of other bullshit. 

And I know a lot of companies just promote their top performers, but it irks me so much more that they do this at a hospital that is supposed to be focused on the education of the surgeons. 

ETA: I also want to note that the main person he mentored was Meredith, and he did it to insure she didn’t talk to anyone about his drinking. Him and Mer bonding like that would have been great if he wasn’t manipulating her. "

By David Michael Thurston

“One of my goals is to be able to write in every genre. While I’m not a huge fan of horror I do admire the great stories and great writers of the genre. This is my attempt to write something in the genre of horror.” –David Michael Thurston

This was the third weirdest things that I saw happen at the morgue. Usually when I place a body in the morgue it stays just the one body. Not today. I took one body in and when I came back there were two.
I swear I rolled one body on a gurney in through the dimly lit morgue entrance, over the gray carpet squares, past the stock plastic fake rock counter top that is a front desk with no one working it, into the incredibly slow elevator \(maybe all elevators are slow if you are in it alone with a dead body\) and finally into the embalming room. I left the body there and went up the steps into my bosses office. Mr. Flattly is my boss. We chatted for a few minutes about the news, weather and how uninteresting sports are. The weather part was the most interesting even though there is no reason to talk about the weather in Arizona. It’s hot. It’s always hot. It’s never a surprise that it’s hot. 
I’m always hoping my conversations with Flattly end quickly. He’s the type of guy who wanted to work at a morgue. He never combed his short gray hair that matched the doom of a morgue. His wrinkled 56 year old face showed the crevasses of a lonely man that never found love, but badly wanted it. He wears thick black rimmed glasses and he still squints. He’s comfortable with a shower every three or four days and wears plaid pants that clash with his stripped polo shirts. I always want to ask Flattly if he steels his clothes from his manly female corpses. He’s five foot six with voice of a man four foot nothing. He would draw out his words when he talked for no reason. He seemed to never been in a hurry. He would say things like, “Hi Naaaathan. Howwww is this semmmmmmesterrrrrr goinggggggg?”
I’m Nathan by the way. I’m a sophomore at Mesa Community College. I don’t want to work at a morgue but it’s the only thing that pays enough to cover my rent and chipotle habit. I feel like I tower over Flattly at five foot ten. I just got contacts so I don’t wear glasses anymore. I also squint but only at night. I feel like most of the bodies that come in here have more meat on them than me. Every once in a while I get a body at the morgue that is a starvation death. Compared to those bodies I feel like Mr. Muscles. One time a girl broke up with me because my cheek bones were too exaggerated caused by me not eating enough. Her name was Suzi. She also made fun of my family and slept with my brother. Every once in a while I pull back the sheet on a new body hoping it’s hers. 
This brings us to the third weirdest thing that happened at the morgue. I left Flattly’s office and went down a flight of cement stairs. The edges of the stairs are marked with blue grip tape. They are shinny in the middle from wear. There are no lights in the stair well but there is plenty of light from the basement fixtures and the ground floor. Coming out of the stair well into the embalming room I see there are two bodies, on two gurneys, with two sheets over them. What am I doing? Why did I start to work at a morgue anyway?
I ran back up the stairs two at a time. I’m a little out of breath as I speed walk into Flattly’s office for the second time in what I’m sure 11 seconds or less. “What seemmms to be the matter younnnnng mmmmmmman?” Flattly asks. 
“I took a body down stairs. When I went back there was…it just seemed like. I may have…you know. I’m not sure. I just thought I saw a thing. It’s so weird how it’s September and it’s still hot. You know,” I stumbled into a finishing thought. 
“Yes, it’s a desert,” he said. 
I left awkwardly. There had to be a body down there the first time. I just didn’t see it. This is dumb. I’m going down there and I’m just going to do my job. I walked slower than last time down the stairs, stepping carefully on the rough right side of the steps instead of the smooth middle and into the embalming room where I saw four bodies on four gurneys with four sheets over them. 
“Mr. Flattly!” I screamed as I ran up the steps. “Flattly. There’s a problem.” I stormed into his office. “I took one body down stairs and then there were two and now there are four bodies. Come look.” I heard a girls laugh behind me. Behind the stock counter top that was vacated now sat Bridget, the front desk intern. I couldn’t see her but I could hear her giggle. I must have sounded crazy. “I’m not joking. This is crazy. I know it sounds crazy but there are four bodies down stairs and their used to be one. They are multiplying,” I said.
Flattly and Bridget walked past me out from the lobby area and down the stairs. I met them down stairs just in time to see one body on one gurney with one sheet over it. It was just like I left it. Bridget spoke first, “You got me all excited for a minute. This would have been weirder than all but two of the things I’ve seen here.” 
The three of us got back in the elevator and rode back up to the top floor. Elevator rides always feel slower when it’s with a pretty girl that thinks you are crazy and a weird short guy in plaid pants. Bridget got off the elevator first and went back to her desk behind the counter. Flattly was exited and told me to come into his office. 
“Close the door behind you,” he said. I closed the door. “I believe you. I’ve been working on a little project. I can’t tell you much about it. Just know I believe you and if anything else happens, anything at all you can tell me. Tell me everything and be honest. Do you understand?” he finished. 
“Yes. Thank you,” I said and went back down stairs to work on the body. Half way down the stairs I realized that was the first time Flattly spoke at a normal pace. Not one word was stretched out. I got to the bottom step, walked into the room and saw eight bodies on eight gurneys with eight sheet over them. I turned right around and walked up stairs walking on the right side not wanting to step on the shiny middle. At the top of the steps I stopped. I have no idea what to say to Flattly this time. 
The fear of not knowing what to do morphed into courage to go back down stairs. I glanced into the embalming room down stairs and saw sixteen bodies on sixteen gurneys with sixteen sheets over them. That many bodies in a room that small filled the room. Gurneys touched each wall. I got in the elevator, pushed the button to the top floor. Elevator rides seem slower when you’ve just seen dead bodies multiply exponentially. 
“Mr. Flattly, you said to say something if I saw something unusual. I saw something,” I said.
“Go on,” he said. 
“The bodies are multiplying. There was 1 then 2 then 4 then 8 and now 16 bodies,” I said.
“Splendid. Let’s take a look,” he said, standing up from his desk and walking over to the stairs. I went first walking on the left side of the stairs to avoid the shiny middle of the steps. “Why are you on the side of the steps?” asked Flattly.
“The middle of the steps are worn and look shiny, probably slippery,” I answered. 
We walk into the downstairs room and viewed one body on one gurney with one sheet over it. 
Mr. Flattly said, “That would have been weirder than everything I’ve ever seen here…except for those other two things.” 
I’m sure the expression on my face was blank. I tried to smile under the blankness. We walked back up the stairs and I didn’t care what part of the steps I stepped on shiny or not. 
I turned right around and marched back down stairs, not to do my job this time, just to avoid the most unexplainable conversation ever. Down the stairs in to the basement I was greeted by thirty two dead bodies standing shoulder to shoulder with sheets over them. No gurneys. I turned and ran up the stairs, three at a time, stepping right in the middle. I entered Flattly’s office and said, “What do you think I’m going to say right now?” 
“I have no idea, but if they are standing up this time give them a directive. If they do it they are your soldiers and they will do whatever you say,” he said. That went much better than I thought. I rode the elevator down to the basement. Elevator rides feel slow when you are about to take control of your first army of dead people. The door opened and I greeted sixty four dead bodies with sixty four sheets over their heads and no gurneys. “Stand on one leg like a flamingo,” I commanded. Sixty four dead bodies lifted one leg and tucked it away. “Take off your sheet and throw it on the ground,” I said. As quick as I could say it sixty four sheets were one the ground. Sixty four pale skinned bodies with light pink eyes and blue veins all over stared directly at me. I walked up stairs and told Flattly everything was fine. 
I walked back down stairs where one hundred and twenty eight dead bodies with sheets over them and no gurneys crowded a small room. “Follow me to my house,” I said. I marched them up the ground floor and over to my house. I told them to paint my house. They did. I told them to add a back patio. They did. I told them to dig a pool. They did. 
They started arguing among themselves about how cruel their leadership was. Half said they were treated well and half said they were treated poorly. They argued that they had no opportunity to create their own destiny, yet none of them left to fulfil their desires. They argued that they did not have equality yet none of them went back to morgue to create their own armies to provide for themselves. They did not eat food, they did not drink water, and they did not sleep. When they got tired they sat and looked at their Iphone for a time. Then they went back to work. The neighbors called them, “Americans.” 
It started out a scary day, but at least it wasn’t as bad as those other two things I saw at the morgue."

IMO the biggest issue with this thing is f we have to grind 3 straight semesters with literally no breaks and then a semester of internship. 


Which means we will have like 2 years without vacation and considering many sophomores will be taking the core weeder classes like Orgo, Data structures, Circuits, etc I am scared some might lose their sanity. On the other hand maybe the internships might be pretty good and it could end up like a little vacation. Anyway other than the forced summer classes and no vacation, why do people hate ARCH so much?"
8cibev,6,2018-04-15,Recruiting career options help,AshfireMead,humanresources,https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8cibev/recruiting_career_options_help/,"Some background: I graduated with a degree in Management with an HR concentration, did a 6 month internship in recruiting, got my first job our of school working as an HR Assistant (doing mostly HRIS work), and have been in my current position as a Junior Recruiter for 3.5 years. I was a finalist candidate for my first job out of school working in their recruiting department where I would have been extending offers, but narrowly lost out to another candidate (I'm glad they offered me another position though). My internship was with a staffing agency and my current position is in-house. The opportunity for me to move up to a Sr. role with my current company hasn't been there due to a company integration, pay freezes, and now they're restructuring our HR department which will include offshoring plus a freeze on new positions until they figure out how they want to size our department (which won't be for another 6 months or so). 

Since my role is about half admin with a good chance of that being offshored, and I only recruit for temps/interns/entry level positions and want to do more than that, I've been interviewing externally for other recruiting positions but haven't been having much luck getting past phone screens. My lack of sourcing experience is really biting me since the majority of my positions are referral-based, so I end up just managing the recruiting process instead of actually sourcing/screening/building pipelines. I kind of feel like I made a mistake by not doing agency recruiting right out of school which is where most recruiters gain their chops before moving to in-house. I've been asked before in an interview how I progressed as a recruiter with no real agency experience and it caught me off guard since honestly, I haven't been given much opportunity to progress in my current position and learn those core recruiting skills.

With my lack of agency experience plus my lack of sourcing/recruiting for Sr. level roles, I feel like it's a futile effort trying to move to a Senior role with another company when there are so many other candidates companies can look at who have agency experience and/or more experience recruiting for higher level positions in-house than me. I love the company I work for but it's a perfect storm of conditions right now for looking at outside positions.

What does /r/humanresources suggest I should do? Stick it out with my current company to see if a Sr. level role for me pops up after the restructure? Keep trying to get a position with a new company? Leave recruiting entirely? I do plan on getting my PHR by the end of the year. "

When I found out I was pregnant I was devastated. I agonized over what to do for a couple of weeks.

I eventually came to the conclusion that an abortion was the reasonable, responsible option. I have two kids already, am about to begin an important internship and our financial situation, while okay, could be more stable.

I felt like I had really come to terms with things and after I had the abortion I only felt relief. I was so, so relieved not to be pregnant. But the last couple of weeks have been rough.

Basically my situation is I wouldn’t want to say ""yes"" to internship offers (if they will be given out) from some of my *“Plan B”* firms (still good &amp; attractive options) during their SLP’s soon coming up when I know there might be a better opportunity to earn an internship with my primary choice later during fall recruiting.

I’ve built up a pretty good relationship with the *primary* firm with some of the managers and recruiter. They told me they **still want to** keep in touch after not making their SLP this year.

**Question:** Would it still be better to go the *Plan B* firms SLP’s - **I wouldn’t want to burn bridges with them right now by saying “No” to an internship offer, just in case on the chance that my primarily plans for some reason might not work out in the this coming FALL qtr and I may end up trying to apply for these Plan B (but still good options), firms afterwards.** 

*It’s in the US. To specify, the primary choice is a B4 that I’ve developed a pretty good relationship with, and the Plan B are some still attractive medium and local firms I’d very much still would be interested in.*

What would you do?

Or how’d y’all approach SLP’s in the winter and then later Fall internship recruiting?

My experience is primarily in a field dominated by ST type people. My biggest fear is not being able to keep up with the pace due to lack of Ti and inferior Te, and getting called out for poor performance, lack of attention to detail, and eventually fired. The disparity between my personality and the personalities of my former coworkers at internships was crazy at times; I felt so out of place, both in terms of mindset and intelligence. Sometimes, it felt that my critical thinking skills and problem solving abilities were simply not up to par compared to my peers. 


All that being said, theoretically, every MBTI type should be able to accomplish the same tasks. However, I feel like the only way I can fit in with the typical engineer type is with caffeine or adderall. Does anyone have any advice on how to mimic Ti, bring out Te, or simply get better at learning complex subjects in a short amount of time? I'm typing this out and I realize it sounds pretty dumb but it's a question that's lingered in my mind ever since I discovered MBTI. I could also be doing life completely wrong and the answer has nothing to do with MBTI. I appreciate any and all advice! Thanks

8ckjqe,4,2018-04-15,I think my experiences with bad relationships now outweigh the possibility of a good one,1032throwawaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8ckjqe/i_think_my_experiences_with_bad_relationships_now/," I've had four relationships, only one of which was official. All four have ended so horribly, some worse than others.

First was a coworker and neighbor at a restaurant in a college town. We hit it off but I was young and nieve and didn't move in when she said we should see where it can go. I didn't know what that meant and let it slip it through my fingers. And she ended up banging the abusive, crazy manager and I quit soon after.

Second is a girl I met in my drawing class and may be the best person I know. We got pretty close while I was with the first girl and came onto me right as that ended. We clicked better than anyone I've met, possibly tied with the first girl. She wasn't looking for a relationship but wanted to fool around. About a week after she was raped at a party and wanted nothing to do with sex. We kept in touch and were still good friends when we came back the next semester. I asked her how she was feeling and if she wanted to kinda pick up where we left off. She tells me she has a boyfriend she met in the spring. I really liked her and stung but we stayed friends until one night we went out and ended up making out on my couch. Residual feelings and whatnot.

I was depressed and would really latch on to anything that came my way after. A girl at work (I know...) that came back from a internship came onto me hard and I went with it. She caught feels and let it escalate into a six month relationship with mild emotional manipulation from her. I liked her but did not feel any romantic feelings for her.

And the last girl. She came onto me at an after work party (I don't learn apparently...) and we clicked sexually right off the bat. She was into everything I was and we had a casual relationship from then on but she was graduating and traveling around the world when she did. She volunteers all the time, has a rescued lab rat as a pet, and volunteers at the church, wife material stuff. She is very touchy-feely and I am too so we ended up doing a lot of intimate hand holding and cuddling. It got to the point we were doing relationship type stuff, like getting groceries and running errands together.

I fell for her over those three months until a couple weeks before her birthday she said we had to stop since it was getting too intimate and wasn't fair to me. Fast forward two weeks, we talk about and I ask why we can't just let it be what it is. She says a guy she met volunteering in nepal over the summer dumped his heart out to her on her birthday and now they're going to travel the world together. We don't talk for about two weeks until she asks what I'm doing after work and we end up drinking together. She is very flirty and bringing up things we used to do in bed. We end up banging for another two months until today, when her true love is supposed to come next week.

While the fact that she's been sleeping with me for the past two months while keeping him in the dark is coming to a head, she says she wants a threesome with this punching bag of a coworker. Meek guy, always gets shit on. I thin she wanted to be the aggressive one and said she can't do that with me. She gets a lot closer with him and eventually fucks him while lying to me about what she was doing. We weren't technically exclusive but she still went behind my back rather than just telling me. 

So she has her ""one true love"" coming to take her away while we've been sleeping together and she's trying to get some action on the side too. And she is one of the best people you'll meet on the surface. 

All of these have been horrible and emotionally jarring almost the whole time. The girls I actually like and click with end up being nuts and/or leaving me for other guys. It's not worth it. I apparently have a fatal attraction to girls I can't be with or am just horribly unlucky.  I honestly can't even imagine a healthy relationship. Open and honest about feelings. Want to be together for the foreseeable future. It's surreal. So semi-voluntary celibacy it is until I find a reason  to stop. 

Tl;dr: Feelings suck"
8ckqxb,19,2018-04-15,"Six years ago, I was unmedicated and posting enough suicidal thoughts to this subreddit that people knew me and were genuinely worried. I'm back with updates after avoiding this sub since then.",CashingOutInShinjuku,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/8ckqxb/six_years_ago_i_was_unmedicated_and_posting/,"I have avoided this subreddit because it is highly triggering since 2012. All of a sudden though, I feel compelled to come back just once and share the rest of my story with you all because it is becoming one of hope instead of hopelessness. In case you've been around for a while, that old account was called ""ContradictionMachine"" and is now dead. I deleted it after that period of my life as part of your typical post-shitshow cleansing procedure. 


It turns out that I have some combination of Type II and rapid cycling. That said, if I learned anything from my psych minor, its that terminology is a bullshit generalization from the DSM for your therapist or P-Doc to look up whose sole purpose is to help them help you. Our experiences are what define our issues, not a single technical term. Studying my fucked up brain while things were really bad was a trip, that's for sure.  


Ah yes, college. I got through it all by being my eccentric and fucking unstoppable self. I ran half marathons. I did a fuckload of psychedelics, which I'm totally over, but that was unforgettable and informed my open-minded perspective on life. It must be said that some of this success is due to the way my type A personality combines with the bipolar side of my manic depression, and I use my anger as a tool to eviscerate it with if things need to get done. Coping in ways that your therapist would never suggest is not something I recommend, but some methods really aren't harmful at the end of the day. For example: sniffing one line of adderall on the hour every hour to stay up all night for a paper. I haven't touched that shit in years, but I'm certainly grateful for my 3.5 GPA that I attained despite a semester's worth of shit grades while manic. So  where's the harm in that? And why shouldn't I watch combat footage if I'm too depressed to work out without, but totally can with an artificial adrenaline high from watching people watch their friends get killed/murder people (yeah, I'm a pretty fucked up...). I'd rather NSFL my brain a little bit than be fat and unhappy and eat like shit. Fitness/nutrition is a nice lifestyle and helps me feel good about myself.


I digress... you'd think that graduation would be a turning point for me, and I'd just be taking victory laps now, enjoying my twenties. Nope! I got fucked *really* hard by the working world. Despite several marketing internships, including one at MIT, it took me a year to find a job as a business analyst. What shitty soul-sucking dream to have too! Yikes. I wasn't aware of this at the time, or how lucky I was to have even landed that business job in the first place as someone with a non-business degree. 


It took getting laid off when my position was eliminated because the company was going under to figure that one out. I had only been there for a year, and just eight months prior to losing my job, had *finally* moved out of my parents' house. And I had to move back. 


That destroyed me in a way that my bipolar disorder never did. See... I had taken this cheap month to month rental in the same town I grew up in, hoping to save a little more while also being out of my parents' house (I was doing quite well financially) before moving to an expensive place in the city. That whole time, rumors of the company not doing well were spreading, and my worst fear - the excruciating pain and embarrassment I would experience if I got laid off, and hadn't even made it a year in the real world, or out of my hometown - came true. 


This whole incident left me truly out of control for 5 or 6 months. I blew all of my money on substance abuse, lost a wide variety of close friends, squandered opportunities, and spent all my time wallowing in self-pity. *The universe was out to get me.*


It took me 8 months of job searching (during this period of time, I got to the point where I could search for jobs *while sobbing* ...impressive!) to figure out there was no fucking way I was going to land another marking job. I didn't have a marketing degree, was overqualified for entry level positions, and a total chump compared to those gunning for 3-5 years of experience roles too. What an awful period of time. I'm still not sure how I snapped out of it. 


I now have a new direction, a new dream to chase, and its really ambitious but I am extremely excited about the whole thing. I'm also trying really fucking hard to be a better person because now I have no close friends anymore due to my irritable behavior. It didn't help that they were all druggies and I was not anymore, that is a problem too. Good riddance you fucks. And thanks for being there for me when it was convenient for your lazy asses, I guess. 


All my weekends are spent alone. I just live in this bedroom, interacting with nobody, studying for the test I have to take in June. I may as well not exist. The dream, the new direction, is very exciting though; its something people have been telling me I would be good at for my entire life. However, I will not share that with you today. I hate almost everything anyone has to say about my plans, even though its almost always positive. So I can't tell you what I'm up to, but I'm very nervous about it. YOLO motherfucker!! I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself. Its time to really kick ass like I know I can if I take good care of myself instead of tearing through 2 bottles of wine and a couple of grams of weed every day. Jesus... just typing that... YIKES. I have since dropped all 40 of the LBS I put on with that bullshit.  



Anyway, I *can* tell you that in trying to fit in at my therapy group and over on r/depression, I have discovered that there is a reverse caste system of sorts among the mentally ill: The more fucked up your life is, the more seriously your problems are taken. The more awful the symptoms, the more sympathy you get. God forbid you are doing better in some way than someone else in the room, because that will make them jealous, and your problems will receive the same responses from certain people over and over again: Frontloaded with false sympathy, and then the punchline at the end is "".... but at least you aren't [insert how much worse that aspect of their life is here]"" 


Every. Fucking. Time. Anyone with an office job and a college degree is feeling super down, someone has to communicate the idea that they should suck it the fuck up because they have it good compared to others in the room. How awful. *Its a reverse dick measuring contest.*

All of this has me feeling deeply alone. I don't connect with most mentally ill people because they view me as lucky or privileged. As I already mentioned, thanks to my many years of self-centered living, I now have no more close friends. I have have also abstained from/failed at dating off and on. I'm dying to fall in love but haven't had a real girlfriend since I was diagnosed. I was just busy thinking about myself and how bad my problems were, but nothing else. Nobody else. I am a very bitter and hateful person who still struggles with empathy to this day. But I am working on it.


**So, what's the moral of the story? The TL/DR of the past six years of my life? Well, I thought I was going to jump off of a parking garage on the one year anniversary of the layoff, but that never happened because I discovered this new dream. Thus, the lesson is that no matter how hard you've been fucked, no matter how many times, NEVER GIVE UP. You really don't know what's around the corner and you won't find out by taking horrible care of yourself and wrapping your existence in a blanket of depression for so long that you start to think its comfortable. Do whatever it takes to motivate yourself, never listen to the haters and the doubters, and love yourself.**"
8cl8j1,82,2018-04-16,Insight into Japan's foreigner glass ceiling,toxichousetony,japanlife,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/8cl8j1/insight_into_japans_foreigner_glass_ceiling/,"This came through in today's [Terrie's Take](https://www.terrie.com/). I thought it was fairly well written and offered some insight into the challenges that a lot of us face at work here. 

**Below is copied content, not my own**

I came to Japan 7 years ago for a internship with a small company in Kyoto. I didn’t speak Japanese at all back then. Japan felt like a next-generation country, everyone was so kind and polite that I immediately fell in love with it and decided that Japan is the place I wanted to be. The same company offered me a full-time job post-internship. After graduating back in India, I came back to Japan as a full-time employee.

Over time, all those kind and friendly people turned in to horrible foreigner haters for reasons I never knew (I believe it was a cultural acceptance thing). You know how Japanese local grads are treated like babies and given so much training and support? Well, I was never offered training and in fact I had to learn and develop my work by myself, getting customers from overseas etc. To my surprise, my colleagues had a negative reaction to my hard work and gradual success. So I left after a couple of years.

Since my Japanese had improved, I found a new employer (a large company) which seemed to be promoting globalization and had a serious target of hiring foreigners (about 10%). Somehow, I was convinced that as a big global company they would be more accepting of foreigners, and so I joined one of their divisions. True to their words, there were indeed about 12-15 foreigners and 200 Japanese in my division. Unfortunately, I was placed under a horribly abusive boss, even though everyone knew about the personality of this person. He never trained me or shared any necessary information with me. I would work hard on weekdays and study in the weekends, so that I could become  skilled and competent. Indeed, my colleagues were surprised how I was able to deliver results despite this rather crazy guy - who hated me even more when senior management  raised my grade after the first year. But the most shocking thing about that company wasn't just my experience, it was that ALL the foreigners had similarly very unpleasant experiences. EVERYONE was abused in some way or another...

It became apparent that the local Japanese staff viewed the foreigners hires as someone convenient to off-load useless work to, without any training or support, so that the Japanese young people taken on at the same time could be slowly trained like babies and become future, loyal assets. So, of course, most of the foreign employees left. One guy was abused so badly that he left without notifying the company. I remember one senior Japanese guy saying something terrible about my colleague, completely without justification if he had bothered to research the reason, and this compelled me to leave both that firm and Japan three months later.

I left Japan for the following reasons:

1. Although, I still love Japan, I could never feel a sense of belonging there. When you live and work in place, you want to connect yourself to its social environment. The constant feeling of, ""Hey, you don’t belong here!"" can become very tiring. I wonder how long-time foreign residents deal with this feeling? For me it affected my self esteem and emotional well-being a lot.

2. My Japanese did improve a lot in seven years. In my personal opinion: one can learn the language through textbooks and become proficient in Kanji. However, conveying emotions and feelings with your colleagues and friends can really only be done effectively through the spoken word. And to do that properly, you need to be a native speaker. I wonder how some long-timers bridge this gap? Especially those in senior positions in Tokyo. Do you go native or do just accept that you are permanently a foreigner?

3. In case anyone thinks I might be a mis-fit, I'd like to state that before I left Japan, I had 2 solid offers from gaishikei companies. Unfortunately, these were only made on the basis of my then-intermediate language skills. In the seven years with my Japanese employers, I never had a single opportunity to do any formal professional development. I'm now based in Australia, I love the social environment here, and I have recovered my ""gaijin genkiness"". The economy is not so great, so that's a black mark, and in comparison, Japan offers unmatched work stability. But I'm not sure that I could return and try a second time to call Japan ""home"""
8clflm,2,2018-04-16,"I'm unemployed, my wife is half-time, we have $100 in savings, and I just finished our taxes and we owe almost $600. What do I do?",itsthekeming,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8clflm/im_unemployed_my_wife_is_halftime_we_have_100_in/,"My wife (22) and I (23) are in a difficult position. Here's some background:

In January of 2017, we were both still attending college. I was a faculty child and she had a huge scholarship, so our school expenses were negligible. I took a part-time software dev internship (contractor) at a small startup in the area, she worked for a couple of university offices.

Fast forward a few months to May 2017. She graduates and is unemployed until September, at which point she got a half-time job at a local library. We move to a new apartment in the same city in June. The startup I'm still working for decided to make me a full employee in September, and I decide to take a semester off of school to work full-time (spring 2018 semester) for them because I'm really enjoying the work and felt like my university program was deteriorating (best professor resigned, small program). My gamble didn't pay off, and I was asked to resign in February, which was mostly my own fault. I have on and off again depression and it was having a negative effect on my work performance. My wife also suffers from anxiety, depression, and PTSD, which is why she had a hard time finding a job after graduation.

We have $100 in a savings account and about $250 in our checking account as I write this. Most of our bills for this month are paid except for the credit cards. I plan on calling most or all of our credit card companies tomorrow to ask for some leeway.

As far as debt goes, we owe several thousand in student loans for my wife (before we got the scholarship), and we have 4 credit cards, none of which we use now and all of which were racked up by my frivolous spending habits in college:

USAA: $1372

Chase: $706

Discover 1 (under my name): $1052

Discover 2 (under my wife's name): $287

My wife brings home just under $1000/month after taxes. She has applied for a few promotions that would take her to full-time. As I said above, I am currently unemployed and actively seeking employment. I've also been accepted to a more robust program at a larger university.

Here are our monthly expenses. We don't keep a budget (I want to. It's hard to do when our lives feel so tumultuous). so some are estimates.

Rent: $700
Internet: $54
Electric: Varies between $90 and $150 (our area's weather recently is super varied, no gas)
Car Insurance: $43
USAA Credit Card: $15 minimum
Chase Credit Card: $25 minimum
Discover Credit Card 1: $45 minimum
Discover Credit Card 2: $75 minimum
Groceries: Usually around $100-$150
Pets: Around $100 (food and litter for 1 big dog and 2 cats)

A lot of our money goes toward fast food. We were only able to make rent for March from my last paycheck at the startup and April because my parents were willing to bail us out.

I finished our taxes on TurboTax tonight (I know, I waited far too long. Stress.) and because of my contractor status at the startup for the majority of the year, we owe $404 in federal taxes, and TurboTax is charging me $160 (I used it so I could deduct some work expenses like a computer I bought for work). I was not good (at all) about saving portions of my income during my contractor stint.

So we owe $564 for our taxes. On top of all the debt we have and the income we don't have. To say I'm panicking is putting it mildly. I'm really at a bit of a loss what to do. I've always been pretty bad with money but we've always managed to survive, but now I feel like we're in a bit of a crisis and I have no idea where to go.

What should I do moving forward?"

I graduated from college last year in June and I haven't found a job yet. I'm beginning to think I will never find a job in my field (engineering) even though I did well in school and my school is known to have very good placement rates in jobs. With another set of engineers graduating in June, I feel like I can't compete with them for jobs because they're not stale like me.

I'm currently staying on a camping cot in my parent's storage room so I'm always surrounded by boxes. I hate it so much. My life has been standing still for 10 months and I am so ready to end it.

I feel like I really messed up everything and it's too late to turn back. While I was in school I never took any internships, but while I was in school my depression got even worse than it is now. Had I gone on an internship at that time and lived on my own for 3 months, I would not have survived. My parents don't know this, so they attribute my lack of internships with laziness. 

While I was in school I was able to see a school counselor which helped a lot,but now that I'm out of school I am on my parent's insurance which doesn't cover mental health. My dad also doesn't believe depression and suicide are real; he says it's for people who are looking for attention (he doesn't know how much I struggle with it).

As much as I enjoy my friends, I don't feel like I can open up to them about this. I've never really been one to open up to anyone about my emotional issues so that's why I'm writing this here. I feel so stuck. I hate myself and my life. I feel like such a failure and my life is going nowhere."

If you are coming to China through an internship/volunteer/study aboard company like Go Abroad China or CRCC, please stop, take your money, never give them a dime, and run the other way!
I personally went to Beijing through Go Abroad China and had to pay so much money for 2 months for them to find me an ""internship"" at a shitty company. They promised weekly activities, good living accommodations, and a general overall great experience. But this experience has left a very bad taste in my mouth, one that has left me with a negative image of china in general. The other GAC interns have all said the same things. We know they pocketed our money and pretty much left us to fend for ourselves in a country we know nothing about and amongst people we do not know how to communicate with.
I have so many examples I could share but those could easily take a post each, so i will this here.
We are trying to find out how to stop this company's business but that might be a hard thing to do since I heard most of these types of companies are scams. 
!!!!GoAbroadChina goabroadchina.org totally fake company. Don't trust!!!

(Some Cheating, BDSM, and Maybe Eventual Cucking)",AthletesLonelyWife,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8co5c5/f4a_these_damn_headaches_some_cheating_bdsm_and/,"*Fuck my head hurts. These headaches are killing me...* I rub my forehead as I turn off my computer. Finally finished with the brutal day of work, and a failed presentation. I was the VP of marketing from sheer hard work and determination, but these damn headaches were getting in my way. Thank god I was going to be able to see my boyfriend tonight. For some reason whenever I was with him I felt somewhat better.  

It’s been two years since you left me. Two long years of these damn headaches. 

We had met in the elevator at work. I was just an intern and you were the big boss of the marketing department. I was standing in the corner of the elevator as you came in. I instantly caught your eyes and it felt like they were drilling into my very soul. My knees were shaking and I could feel the sheer heat from my pussy against my thighs. 

It was barely a day before I was on my knees serving you for the first time. Barely a week before I was bent over your desk late at night every night. Until we moved onto the hotels. Eventually you started bringing me to your place. The sex was unlike anything I’ve ever felt before. 

It started as vanilla and loving as it could have been. Missionary, soft romantic cuddling. It didn’t last very long. Soon it was doggy style. Then it was riding your cock. Eventually it turned into a full blown Master and Sub relationship. You forced me to do more and more lewd things. 

Not wearing panties at work. Forcing toys inside my ass all day. Cumming inside of me while I walked to our next meeting. At home it was even wilder, collars, chains and whips. Leading me around your upper floor penthouse and floor to ceiling glass windows. Anyone high enough would have been able to see me lewdly sucking your cock in all parts of the night. 

It was all fun, at least thats what I told myself. I didn’t realize how much I’d be depending on you, how much my body would be depending on you. 

I didnt realize it until suddenly you just left. “I’m leaving the country, I don’t need you anymore” those were the last words I heard you say which broke my heart and made me cry for ten days straight. That’s when the headaches started like massive withdrawals from the sheer sexual lust we had. 

I focused on work and even got a boyfriend. He was amazing, loving and caring. Always attentive and put up with my bitchy moods when I had headaches. He felt good to be around but these headaches never fully went away. 

I left my office and headed for the elevator. Going inside and curling into my usual corner as I tried to think about my boyfriend. Feeling his hands massaging my head. Sometimes if I was up for it I’d even let him pet my pussy until I came. Those were the days I felt the best. But it was never that easy to cum. He couldn’t make me cum like you made me. 

I groaned hearing the elevator stop on a floor halfway down the building. Seeing it open and a large tall handsome man step inside. We locked eyes and I felt my whole body shiver. My knees were weak as I grabbed my coat and held it tightly against me. My eyes opened wide, jaw dropped and pussy already flooding. It was you! 

I tried to call out. I tried to ask why you left. I tried to say anything. Nothing came out as you waiting as we went down the rest of the floors. I could feel my face burning. Was it excitement? Anger? Lust? My pussy was throbbing between my legs as I bit my lip. 

“Westin Room 1200. You know what to wear...” I hear your voice and it sends shivers through my spine. If I could touch my pussy at this moment I would have came. 

“Yes Master.” You hear me whisper as my cheeks flow crimson. I watch you walk away as the elevator doors open and stand there speechless. I watch the doors close behind you on the floor I needed to leave on. 

It was barely two hours later. The elevator carrying me up to the tallest suite in the hotel. There were three rooms at the top and I knew exactly what it looked like. I’ve been here many times before when you really wanted to take me. I had crimson red heels on and my make up and hair was done like I was going to a romantic dinner. A trench coat covered my entire body but stopped just above my knees. I stepped out and went to your room, giving it a soft three knocks.

I see the door open and your towering figure covers the whole frame. 

“Take it off.” Your voice makes me shiver with pleasure. It’s been so long since I’ve heard your voice. Since you’ve given me commands. 

“But... someone could see...” I whisper as I look around nervously and you were already closing the door. 

“Wait!” I cry out as I quickly pull the Coat off my shoulders and let it fall. I was left in a pair of crotchless lace panties and a lace corset with the breast area cut out so my bare tits were hanging out. 

“Spin.” I hear you say and I could feel my pussy leaking as I spinned slowly for you and I bit my lip as my hands subconsciously folded behind my lower back pushing my tits out towards you. 

“Good bitch.” I hear you say as you move away from the door and I quickly step inside. 

My headaches were gone...

(Play as the Master or Boyfriend, either works for me. I’m also open to playing whenever in the timeline of this.)"
8cojwr,2,2018-04-16,Torn Between 2 Options,KiwiWithAHat,studyAbroad,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/8cojwr/torn_between_2_options/,"Greetings!

I am thinking of studying abroad with an internship either during February - May, or June - August. The two locations I'm thinking of are New Zealand or Australia.

NEW ZEALAND: I'm thinking New Zealand during the summer (June - August) because it's such a beautiful country and I've always wanted to go [look at my username] - BUT it would be cold/during their winter.

AUSTRALIA: During the spring sem (February - May) so I could have a summer free, but I don't want to fall behind with my academics. OR, during the summer [June - August]. What pulls me to Australia is 90% of the artists I listen to are all Australian, and there is a big music festival in Australia in July where some would potentially play. It is my dream to see these artists live and I feel I won't get another opportunity as bands only stay together/play for so long.

I'm not sure how I feel about February - May just because I would miss my friends dearly. I love them and would miss them badly and miss being close to people I love. However, I wouldn't miss out on my summer.

If I were to go during June - August though, I could get an internship and not worry about falling behind on my academics.

If someone can't find a job after college it means (to me). 

1. You chose a degree with poor job prospects. Not all degrees are worth the same. A bachelors in Psychology is not as marketable as a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering.  
2. You did nothing in college. That's 4 years where you could have done internships or work-study fellowships. A lot of people treat college as high school 2.0 (but without your parents) and then choose to hang out and party much of the time. The occasional party isn't bad but it's about prioritizing. 

I have friends majoring in Computer Science and French and they haven't done anything those 4 years, so now they're shitting themselves over what's going to happen after graduation in May because they're having trouble finding jobs."

I already posted my post in r/Jobs but nobody has responded. I am trying to follow up with someone properly and I really don't want to mess this up! I had two interviews (one was three weeks ago) the other one  is about to be (two weeks ago). Both interviews went very well it almost felt like a fluent conversation and I was asked simple questions like why I majored in IT, what are my interests in the field, and a couple technical related to IT.



Now here is where I need your help! I had an interview in NYC where I was interviewed by two people and then when I was finished interviewing with the two people, one of the HR ladies told me that the 3rd person that wanted to interview me was busy in a meeting and that my point of contact (another HR lady whom I've been emailing throughout the entire process) would follow up with me next week (last week as of 4/16/18). I have not heard back at all from her. How should I go on about this? I really would love to speak with the 3rd person that wanted to speak with me, and for a moment when I was there I though maybe should have I waited? Or does that seem a bit weird to wait for someone to finish his or her meeting. Anyways leave your thoughts below any help is appreciated! Thank you all!

Best Regards,

8conox,4,2018-04-16,Catholic Mom/Protestant Dad: newborn baptism?,dangerhaynes,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/8conox/catholic_momprotestant_dad_newborn_baptism/,"**Background**
Mom raised Catholic. Hasn't had a home church in a few years as she's moved around a TON for med school, rotations, internship, and residency. Not super devout, but is a believer. She is not anti-protestant, but has 30+ years in the Catholic church (and doesn't know much else). 

Dad is a former minister (in his early 20s) in an evangelical, protestant church. Currently a believer, but doesn't attend. Has a bad taste in his mouth from being burned by several churches, boards, etc. He is not anti-catholic by any means, but doesn't share all of their beliefs. 


Mom is finishing residency in about 3 months and everyone is moving out of state for her FT job. They'll stop being on the road (after about 5 years of never staying put too long). Both are excited to find a new home church are open to exploring all denominations in their new town (looking for a good community of believers and not just a place with a particular name/denominational title on the sign). 


They have a 2 month old son. Mom wants to have him baptized. Dad supports this. Even though his denomination doesn't baptize babies (they dedicate them), he believes the ceremony is a good way to start the kid's life on the right foot. 


The challenge they are running into has a couple of layers. 


1) They do not currently attend a Catholic church. I've read a number of stories of priests who refuse to do the baptism until the family attends mass consistently for a period of time. The bigger challenge is that attending may not be possible until after they move. Mom is currently a pediatric resident and works a ton of hours, often overnight, 24 hour shifts, and most weekends. Dad works a full time job from home and takes care of the baby. Any time they have off is spent cleaning the apartment, preparing food for the week, and trying (and failing) to catch up on sleep. While they would certainly try to attend a service when they could, it wouldn't be easy and certainly wouldn't be consistent. Child care becomes an issue as well. Since they are only in town for her residency program, they do not have many close friends who they'd ask to baby sit. Also, because mom works in a pediatric hospital, she sees the worst in child sickness and is vary careful about having him out in public until his immune system develops. Leaving him in a church child care facility won't be an option for another couple of months. Mom won't budge on this.


2) One of the major purposes of the Catholic Baptism is to commit to raising the child in the Catholic church. The dad isn't comfortable making that promise. He's not opposed to attending a Catholic church (if it's the best option/fit), but can't imagine officially converting and doesn't want to just say what the priests want to hear. 



I'm curious what to think of all of this? Does this family have options? 


On the first point: would a local priest be willing to do the baptism knowing that the family would have a hard time attending mass with any consistency...and they they are moving in 3 months? 


On the second: what to families of mixed denomination/faiths do in these situations?


I get conflicting information from different people. Many of the Catholics that I know believe that one must be baptized to get into heaven. This is why they recommend doing the baptism as soon as possible after the birth (in case something happens). I've also read a defense that suggests this isn't the true tenant of the Catholic church...baptism is super important, recommended, etc., but that a child wouldn't be denied heaven because of a lack of baptism. 

Can anyone clarify? In either case, wouldn't a priest be happy to baptize a newborn even if the parents weren't Catholic (why potentially punish the kid because of the parents?). 


What advice would you give this family?"

What should I do?",ExactAtmosphere1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8cp546/ive_23m_been_having_casual_sex_with_a_older/,"So I'm posting on an alt for obvious reasons but here I go


So around a year ago I met a man we'll call Gorge. He's a co-worker of my dad and I met him when my dad got me an internship at their company. We became pretty good friends as we share a good amount of interests and started to talk outside of work. I'm out of the closet and my family has been pretty cool about it and eventually Gorge found out about it and. I've always been into older men so when one thing led to another we began sleeping together. I made it pretty clear at the time that this was just casual and I didn't really want anything lasting from it and he seemed to be alright with it. When I left the internship and went back to school we stayed pretty good friends and kept having casual sex. 


Now about a month ago things became, complicated. Now like I said I thought that it was no strings attached so I've slept with a few other people this last year of college. When Gorge found out about these encounters he started to become angry and jealous at this (I'll admit I handled this pretty bad and just brushed him off.) Along with this, Gorge has become a bit more weird and affectionate. While before we've just acted as good friends, now he's started to try to get ""closer"" to me and has been wanting to spend more time together.


It was pretty clear what he was but i'm not a socially smart person so I just brushed it it and ignored it. Last night however, he made his feeling clear. I really don't feel like going into the full convo but he pretty much told me that he ""really cares about me"" and ""wants me to be more than just a friend."" When I asked him how long he felt this way apparently since the beginning despite the fact that this was just supposed to be casual. I really haven't talked to him since last night but he's wants to meet again ""soon.""


I honestly blame myself for this. It's not like I didn't see this coming but I really just didn't want to deal with it at the time and just thought of the relationship as casual. I probably should have cut it off or made it clearer when this started but it's too late. I really don't know what to do here Reddit. Gorge is a nice guy and he is a really close friend. But I don't know if I feel the same way about him. There are a lot of factors I'm taking into account too like the age gap (Despite the fact that I am attracted to older men, I don't know if I can keep up a relationship with him) and his relationship with my father that i'm not really comfortable with. While it's not that I'm opposed to trying this out it's more that I don't think it will work and I really don' want to hurt him. What do you guys think I should do? Any advice appreciated. 

***

**Tl;Dr:** Older friend of mine that I've been having casual sex with has apparently seen the relationship different that I have and want's to be ""serious with me"" while I don't know if I feel that way."

### Thank You

Before we get started I need to thank the people without whom this event, the records, even the attempt, wouldn’t have been impossible. First and foremost, I want to acknowledge my parents: Tim “Mr. C” Andrews and Valerie Cummings (and my Aunt, Ceil, and my other anonymous relative – who doesn’t like to be named on the internet and definitely wasn’t flying a drone around without permission during the race – who were there in person). Not only did Mr. C handle the live splits on twitter like a boss, but he and my mother have been rooting for me, well, literally, longer than anyone. Thanks as well to my #1 partner in life, running, cat-parenting, and everything, Mariana, without whom I would be a sad, lonely, shadow of a man; I’m sorry you couldn’t be there in person for this one, but you’re in my heart always. I also can’t forget my coach, Jon Waldron, who’s been with me for more than a decade (!) since our first meeting at CA in fall of 2007; thank you for always being there and pushing me to be the best that I can be. HUGE thanks to Rajpaul Pannu and Chris Frias who provided the best pace-making I could ask for and went well above and beyond what I’d hoped for. Thanks to everyone at HOKA for the amazing hospitality and truly world-class event, especially Mike, Christian, Craig, Cory, Sunny, Sam, everyone from USATF, Leo, and all the NJNY crew (particularly Tommy for getting my legs working after the race), and the myriad others I met over the course of the week. To my Ecuadorian running crew – Franklin Tenorio, Miguel Almachi, Jose Luis, Jean, Erik, Isra, Edi, Angie, Anita – ustedes son parte de mi familia; gracias para recibirme como un chasqui del grupo y para empujarme cada día en el entrenamiento. Thanks to my partners at STRIVE, Nic and Rob, who’ve been there for so long, and for all my students and interns who keep in touch and have sent kind words along the way. Thanks to the good folks at nuun for keeping me hydrated (and cooled – yes, it’s all the same bottle and some of it just goes on my head). To Alta Andina – y’all have become family to me over the past months; I love you and I run with the AA spirit in my heart; thanks for inspiring me with your incredible hard work and dedication to making the world a better place. Lastly, to all my other friends, family, fans, anyone who’s ever said hello to me at the airport or wished me luck on Reddit – it really means something; thank you.



### Pre-race


“Each day seemed evidence of something, and I counted them. I’d add them up. Line them up end to end… And soon it would get… improbable. As if each day was a car Evel Knievel had to clear. One car, two cars. By the time I’d get up to say like maybe about 14 cars, it would begin to seem like this staggering number. Jumping over 14 cars. And the rest of the year, looking ahead, hundreds and hundreds of cars, me in the air trying to clear them. Who could do it? How did I ever think anyone could do it that way?’

Abiding again between heartbeats; [he] tries to imagine what kind of impossible leap it would take to live that way all the time, by choice, straight: in the second, the Now, walled and contained between slow heartbeats. … Sarge, says it all the time: It’s a gift, the Now: it’s no accident they call it The Present.” – Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace.


6:50am: Here we go!

I wake up around 2:30am and doze fitfully for another two hours or so until my alarm finally wakes me three hours before the gun. The wind has been howling all night and as I get out of bed and peek outside, I see that the hotel’s pool umbrellas lay helter skelter and the palm fronds still whip in the pre-dawn dark.

I swipe open my phone and see that wunderground still predicts the wind to die down around dawn. Fingers crossed.

This part I’ve done before – the waiting. I make coffee, snack on some animal crackers, check my email and reddit, and make my way through a few lessons of DuoLingo Japanese. Before I know it, it’s 6:20am; the sun still rests behind the horizon but HOKA’s star intern, Craig Lutz, waits in the parking lot to drive me the two miles to the Santa Barbara City College Track.

We arrive and, as if on cue, the wind halts, the flags fall still, and the white caps on the beach across Cabrillo St. settle into the ocean. With no direct sunlight yet, the air is cool and crisp: perfect for a long-distance race.

Mindlessly, I go through the usual pre-race routine. Getting the lay of the land: where are the important landmarks? The bathrooms? The start, finish, bag-check, etc.? But, this race is a bit different. Today, the powers that be have arranged this morning essentially for me. So, I leave my backpack on the infield, I tell Christian where I’d like the bottle table placed, and I sit and wait.

I meet Chris and Raj – our pace-setters for the day – as they arrive and we discuss the plan for the race: starting a bit behind world-record pace, accelerating slowly over the first 5-8km, and then settling right around 3’14-15/km for as long as they (and I) can hang on. With the business out of the way, we jog a few laps and talk about everything except the upcoming 125 laps – their day jobs, upcoming race plans, where they stayed in town last night.

After 2km, I pull off and let the liebres continue. Even a 2km warmup seems garish with 50 more coming up shortly.

I continue to run through the motions: changing into my racing shoes (from an old beat-up pair of Clifton 4s to a brand-new, fresh pair). I take off a few layers as the sun begins to warm the track. I run through the normal series of drills and a few light strides. My legs feel great. My feet pop off the track like golf balls on a concrete sidewalk. We’re ready.

As the clock ticks past 7:30am, the sun climbing higher with every passing second, we line up behind the starting line (facing “backwards”, down the home stretch) and our USATF Official Mr. Bill Handley calls “take your marks”, and, with a crack and a puff of smoke, we’re off.

### Race

We begin running clockwise (i.e. the opposite of the normal direction you’d run on a track) for the first 8km of the race.

(Aside for those who are interested in why we ran 8km in the opposite direction to start – skip this paragraph if you don’t care. Originally, we’d thought that we’d have to run the entire race counter-clockwise. It wasn’t until about 10 days before the race that I was told that we could switch directions if we wanted, but we could only do it once and had to tell the officials before the race exactly when the switch would occur. Since we’d thought we’d have to run the race in one direction, I’d done essentially all my track training in one direction up to that point and so it seemed like a big risk to split the race in half, even though that might seem the most logical, half CW and half CCW, because if it felt, like, weird to run in the other direction because of not being used to turning right all the time, it’d be a long time to be stuck with said weird feeling. So, 8km seemed like a decent amount of time in that it’d give my left-turning muscles and bones a bit of relief but wasn’t so long that it’d be an issue if it felt awful, especially since I’d be running it at the start. Plus, after 8km, you’ve got a marathon left, which is a nice natural dililenation in and of itself).

We’re off the line and I tuck in behind Raj and Chris who run more or less two abreast in Lane 1. We cover the first lap in 80 – exactly what I’d asked for: a few 80s, a few more 79s, before settling in at 78s (3’15/km – a second under WR pace) for as long as we could. There’s a clock at both the finish and at 200m, so as much as I’d like to ignore the splits and focus on the tiny piece of synthetic (epidemic) fabric between Raj’s shoulders, it’s hard not to glance at the blinking numbers that we pass every 40 seconds or so.

Someone had asked me before the race what I was going to think about while I was running. I replied that for the first two hours or so (two hours!), I’d mostly try not to think at all. And so, that’s what I do. I focus my gaze on the nape of Raj’s neck and try to revert my brain to its most reptilian form.

And so, we run some 80s, and at some point, maybe around 2km, I’m starting to think that this feels really slow and we should pick it up to 79s. And so they do that and we pass 5km, probably around 16’3x, and before I know it the officials are putting the cone out and we’ve got do our little U-turn and now we’ve run 8km and we’re running the so called normal direction and we have less than a marathon to go. How hard could that be?

We’re running 78s now and while I’m not keeping track of the exact pace, I have told Raj and Chris at this point to settle into 3’15 pace and just get into a rhythm. Mike McManus is on the sideline and calling out our splits relative to each 1600m (so, each 400m, 800m, 1200m, etc.). I’m not hearing too much as I’m very much “in the zone” but a few splits sound quick. At 10km, I decide to split my watch just so I can get a sense of how fast we’re going.

Our 11th km is a 3’11 and I let Raj and Chris know.

“Hey. We just ran a 3’11. I don’t want to go any faster than 3’15, so let’s settle in there.”

The pace slows and yo-yos a bit as Raj and Chris find the perfect rhythm but it feels much more comfortable. This is often the part of the race where I feel the best – between the 10 and 30km point. I’m truly enjoying myself. I’m smiling as I actively avoid looking at the clocks and instead focus on the beautiful mountains above the stadium, the clip-clop of our feet, the knowledge that we’re sneaking up on WR pace exactly as planned, the thought – for the first time – that I really think I’m going to do this.

Chris had told me beforehand that he figured he’d make it to 10 miles and Raj would make it to 15 miles. The 10 mile mark (just over 16km) sneaks up on me and we pass it around 52’30 (now under world record pace). Chris and Raj are talking between the two of them, but I can’t really hear and just continue staring at Raj’s bouncing shoulder-blades.

I keep expecting Chris to drop off at any moment and so it’s an immense positive feedback loop every lap, every kilometer, that goes by where he’s still pulling us along. We pass 11 miles, 12 miles, and then the half marathon mark (about 1’09’10). We pass 15 miles and then I think it’s right around the halfway mark (25km), more than 5 miles beyond what he’d committed, that he pulls off and wishes us luck. Thank you, Chris.

Our 25km split is 1’21’47 (2’43’34 pace – 4 seconds under the overall world record). I’d expected to be slightly further ahead of this and so I know that we’ll have to put in some work for however long Raj is planning to keep running in order to build a bit of a buffer for the inevitably brutal last 10km.

In a normal, ideal race – say, a marathon on a cool day – I’d always hope to negative split, i.e. run the second half faster than the first. But today, I was almost certain, before we even started, that if I wanted to set the overall world record, I’d have to be under pace going into the last 10km. Between the temperature (which would rise along with the sun over the course of the race), the pounding my feet would take from the 210 consecutive left turns, and the long solo final stage of the race, I knew it’d be extremely difficult to accelerate in the later stages. Looking at both my own and others’ 50K results, I’d hoped to have about a minute on the record at the 40km point.

And so, in seeing that we’re just about exactly on WR pace at 25km, I’m already a bit nervous. I’m feeling good, strong, but I know that, from an effort perspective, there’s still significantly more than halfway to go. I keep my fingers crossed that Raj will stick around for at least a few more miles.

He does. Like Chris, Raj absolutely earns his MVP status as the kilometers tick by and Mike continues to call “76-77, 2’33-2’34, etc.” We’re perfectly on pace and every lap we’re building a bigger cushion on the record. We pass 30km in 1’37’58 (16’10 for that 5K) and are now about 30 seconds under pace. But things are starting to feel hard now. We’re running consistently, but I’ve lost the feeling that I’m just on a comfortable run around the park. No, now, this feels distinctly uncomfortable, and it’s taking an exponentially increasing amount of focus to stick with Raj.

As we come up to the 20 mile mark, I can tell we’re going to be just off the 20-Mile American Record. With a few laps to go, I briefly consider surging ahead for the bonus that comes along with the mark, but since we’re still under overall WR pace and shit is starting to get extremely real, I decide against it. We pass just over 1h45 – only 10 seconds off.

But still, Raj is dragging me around and around. I’m going through a dark phase where the logical side of my brain is begging Raj to just slow down a bit, to maybe ask Mike if we can, like, change this race to just be a marathon or even 35km; gosh, that sounds nice. But I’m thinking of Joelle Van Dyne and Don Gately and trying not to think of all those buses lined up. I’m taking this one step at a time, one lap at a time.

I don’t remember exactly when Raj steps off, but I think it might have been at 35km (1’54’19). We’re still under WR pace at this point, but I already know it’s going to take a miracle to hang on. It’s one thing to chase Raj but entirely another to try to judge pace and effort on my own all of a sudden. Within just a couple of laps, I can see that I’ve already slowed down despite the fact that the effort feels the same. The overall record is slipping away second by second.

At 40km (2’11’16, a 16’57 solo 5k, 20 second OVER world record pace now), I know I’m not going to get it. It’s not defeatist but simply realistic. The solo running under the blazing Californian sun is simply too hard; I’m not going to do it today.

But, instead of feeling sorry for myself and jogging it in, I simply re-adjust. I try to stay positive; what’s the next mental check-point? I’ve got the marathon mark coming up and unless I really baby out, I’m going to snag an Olympic Trials Qualifier. That’s pretty sweet.

We pass the marathon in 2’18’42 and that’s a hugely positive datum. I’ve already gotten something great out of the day. And now, while I’m not thinking about the finish yet, I’m trying – with great strain – to do some mental math and think about the track WR of 2h48. I know I’d been 2h11 at 40km, which makes me think the track mark should be in the cards (again, barring some monster implosion), and every kilometer and lap that go by, I’m reassured of that again.

Finally, a switch in my brain clicks and instead of thinking of what kilometer I’m running, I’m thinking of how much is left. 45km goes by in 2h28 and I know I’m not going to run a 15 minute 5K and set the overall record. But that’s okay, because there are only 12 laps to go and that just seems so reasonable. Plus, I only have to run 19 minutes to hit the track WR mark, which, as well, seems entirely reasonable. I know I’ve slowed down; I’m running over 80 seconds per lap. The previous 5K had been just over 17 minutes. But I’m not thinking about that. I’m just running one lap at a time. Good job. That one’s done. One more.

I think it’s at 10 laps to go that the officials actually start flashing lap counters at me. Up to that point, I hadn’t heard a single lap count (thankfully, because who wants to hear lap, like, 75 of 125 when you’re 30km deep?); but, now as with so many workouts, I’m counting down from 10, 9, 8. The math is getting harder, everything fuzzier and more abstract, less real, but I’m almost certain I’ll get the track WR unless my mind is leading my astray.

I can feel the outside of my foot screaming every 20 seconds as I take another left hand turn. I can feel my form disintegrating as I awkwardly drive my arms in a state of near-complete exhaustion, an early Boston-Dynamics robot struggling for linear motion. I can feel the sun beating down on me, the cool water from my bottle that Mike hands off every few minutes seeming to accomplish nothing except blurring my already foggy vision. Still, I’m putting one foot in front of the other.

With 1km to go, I really try to push. I know I’m not beautiful and I know I’m falling apart, but I’m turning my legs over faster, driving my arms higher. I’m counting down the seconds.

And then Mr. Handley is ringing the bell. One more 400. One more 200. 30, 29, 28. And finally it’s all over. 

### Post-race

I cross the line and collapse in a heap. My muscle spasm; my whole body throbs. Everything hurts but the pain is so omnidirectional that it somehow seems to dull the effect. I just want to be here and breathe and not move. I roll from my knees onto my ass and promptly throw up all over the track (a moment forever immortalized by Kyle Merber and Erik Boal from Dyestat). Mike is there; NJNY’s Tommy is there and the two of them help me off my feet, literally lifting me up as my muscles have decided enough is enough for today, and they heft me onto the infield where I’m deposited onto a hard plastic chair.

2’46’06 is the final time. A new World and American Record for 50km run on a track. 2 minutes and 28 seconds off the overall 50K World Record, making me the second fastest American in history at the distance.

I’d lost just under two and a half minutes during those last, lonely 15 kilometers. And as much as I’d like to say I just had an off day, the truth is that if we ran this race 100 times under the same conditions, I’m not sure we would have gotten a better result. HOKA put on one of the most professional and well-supported events I’ve been a part of. Chris and Raj both went well above and beyond the call of duty. But when it came time to drop the hammer in the last 10km, I simply didn’t have it. Maybe if it were 30 degrees cooler (the temperature was over 70F for the last hour of the race), the overall fatigue wouldn’t have taken so much out of me. But, I know, today, on this track, in these conditions, I squeezed every last drop out of the orange. I left everything out there.

As Jon had said to me before the race, “You can do this; you can run this pace; but everything needs to go perfectly.” There’s a reason this record is 30 years old (and it’s not just that it’s easy and no one cares about it, as much as the Let’s-Run trolls will, I’m sure, insist); it’s because it’s hard. 50km is almost 20% longer than a marathon and that 20% correlates to an extremely nonlinear exertion of effort.


Chris Frias (left) and Rajpaul Pannu – y’all the real MVPs

Is it on par with an Olympic distance record (marathon, 10,000m, etc.)? Of course not. I’ve never claimed to be Eliud Kipchoge and – even if I had smashed the record – I never would. That’s never been my claim nor my goal when it comes to running. I’ve always sought to push my own limits, to find my own personal ceiling.

I discovered where my limits lie for today, on this track: 2’46’06. 3’19 per km for 50km. 5’20 per mile for 31.1 miles.

Yet – like so many distance runners – I’m not satisfied. I don’t feel that I’ve found my absolute limit. I think on a cool, windless day, that 2’43’38 mark could go down, even with my current fitness. I don’t know that I’ll ever do it; but, I do know that I’ll try again. I’ll continue striving to find the best version of myself. I’ll keep training and pushing myself for those extra 3 seconds per kilometer. And I’ll hope that the teenager who reads this who might think of himself as an uncoordinated, unathletic, music-nerd will find a new passion in self-improvement that will take him literally around the world, will teach him the science of training and greetings in a dozen languages, will introduce him to hundreds of people – from chemical engineers to Olympians to flight attendants – and will leave him in moments of agony so beautiful he can’t help but weep. That’s all I can hope for.

My prof where I am doing an internship now offered me a PhD and I was wondering (many many things) what would be an acceptable amount of time that I can 'think about it'. It wouldnt be immediately, I'll be finishing my masters mid-end of this year, so probably start next year and finishing this internship in 3-4 months

Background:
Yes the subject is cool, its organoids meet single cell sequencing, I don't know too much about it, and I think it can be useful in the future and I'll have to ramp up my computer /math skills and yes I would be fully funded. I do not want to stay in academia, I wasnt looking for or planning a PhD, but open for anything. My gf would be open to move with me, but there should be enough cashflow to get by.

ANy other things I should consider are also welcome."

A little knowledge of Rainbow Six (more specifically siege) would be helpful for this roleplay, but not necessarily required! 

---

""Six, new intel's just come in."" The intern was holding a stack of folders, placing them on the Director's desk, rushing through the door with a dangerous sense of urgency. 

Each of them labelled with a name of an operator. 13 of them. Ash, Hibana, Valkyrie, IQ, Dokkaebi, Caveira, Ela, Zofia, Frost, Twitch, Ying, Mira &amp; Finka.

Opening up Ash's file, the american redhead FBI agent was pictured with holding her own sidearm to her head, bruises and cuts on her abdomen, wearing a red, white and blue american flag bikini.

Checking the other files, they were almost identical, from the French callsign ""Twitch"" to Hong Kong's ""Ying"". Thirteen women operating in 5 different continents, and 7 different countries, all captured and forced to pose...

Somebody was playing a game with Team Rainbow.

""They're all women... all the same way, even Caveira."" Caveira, the stubborn BOPE interrogator, ready and posing to take her own life. ""I want the last rendezvous with each and every one of these Ladies, when and where we lost them. NOW - and get me every. goddamned. operator. we. have."" Six barked as she stood up. 

---

Studying the intel further, Six noticed an engraving on the wall behind each photo, out of place - but the same one in each. They were all in the same location. The pictures had been found by MI6 agents scouring the darkweb. No connection was made on the 13 women to Rainbow 6, but whoever had them, knew that the 13 were connected to something more than just special forces.

Rainbow 6 was the world's *elite* - the best of the best, and 13 of 40 of the world's elite had just been captured by an unknown force - with absolutely no discerning qualities or motives. 

As call sign Six moved to leave her desk for coffee, something she turned to in times of pressure and duress, her desk phone began to buzz. ""Go For Six."" she said, to ensure communication and identities were secure, her call sign was used even verbally. The line buzzed for a moment ""Do your girls look broken, six? Do they look afraid? Cant you see the fear in their eyes as they look into the camera? Have you *ever* heard of an elite special forces unit break? SAS, FBI, GIGN... I thought you were supposed to train them to *resist* interrogation, not have them fold as soon as they're caught on their knees - I'm going to personally enjoy training these pretty young ladies... Ash and Valkyrie have already rehearsed their little strip-show... What do you say to that, *Special Forces Strippers: The Movie!* I can see their names - not just their callsigns - their real names on Walk of Fame Stars, cant you, Six?"" Six cut the line. She'd had enough.

---

Six spent the next day meticulously looking through user permissions on Hereford base to find out how the operations database was compromised and the operators were located and targeted - All male operators called in secure one way or another, whether it be by getting in touch with their mission handler or through other means of communication.

All operators on standby were gathered in the theatre, arranging themselves around the intel on a large projected screen at where the hall comes to a narrow. Commander Ramirez stood before them all on the stage, behind him the high-definition scans of the girls pictures, found on the darkweb ""Gentlemen, today is the day that we all feared - A targeted attack on your colleagues and friends. The 13 women that we are aiming to recover on this mission are fellow operatives. The best in the world, the best at what they do - And some how, some way, they've all fallen for *something*. We cannot be sure what that is.

""Gentlemen, what you see in this hall is for your eyes only. Nothing you see here can be spoken a word to anyone, rainbow clearance or not."" A video started playing. A still steel pole in the middle, behind that 11 of the girls stood at attention, their bodies shadowed but the silhouettes obviously identifiable as each girl. 

Slowly, a familiar tune got louder - easily recognised by english-speaking operators as the [Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E) two sets of high heels stepped into frame, The long legs of Valkyrie and Ash followed, both of them in blue and white striped platform shoes, red lace thongs and white star pasties over their perky breasts, they embraced each other and forced their tongues down each other throats, spitting and swallowing the exchanged fluids and not caring for the dribble that ran down their breasts and onto the floor. A clear insult to the female American operators, regardless of their consent.

I have suffered from low self esteem for a lot of my life. I am only 21 yet it feels like the past 10 years I've been feeling insecure, anxious and lonely. There are sprinkles of happiness and being proud of my achievements. I am going to be graduating college this year and I can't say I'm happy with where I am. I did not have a great college experience \- I chose my college because my ex \(who had just broken up with me\) went there and turned down a very prestigious school for it. I was placed in a themed dorm that I did not belong in and struggled to do well in classes \- I've had to repeat 5 of them. I had two very hurtful events happen in succession to each other. I was publically humiliated when I was fired 20 minutes after being publically announced I had gotten a certain job at my campus newspaper due to a ""miscommunication."" I had dedicated 2 years there and could not understand how they could treat me that way, since I had little dorm friends they were my main friend group. I left and was feeling so lonely and leaned on my then boyfriend at the time. Then I found out he had been cheating the entire relationship. My grades sank even lower. I wanted to disappear.

I wanted to quit school. I wanted to erase everything. I wanted to start over. But I knew I put myself in my situation \- I chose the school because I was co\-dependant on my first love \(how stupid \- my dad told me he did this when he was younger and warned me but I didn't listen\), I wasn't paying attention when I signed up for my dorm and I tried to do a stem major while balancing newspaper work \(essentially a full time job \- not recommended\). I ignored glaring red flags in my relationship and my anxiety held me back from making better friends. My mother sent me away out of state to clear my mind, it sort of helped. I went back to school.

I joined a new organization, made some new friends and did better in my classes. I'm about to graduate with that stem degree and have done three internships. But I am still not happy. There are experiences I did not have that many people did. They had people take them downtown on their 21st birthday, they live on the popular ocean\-side street with some of their best friends, they are applying to law school, have been involved in amazing research, have gone abroad, have gone to music festivals with a large group of friends, thrown big parties for their birthdays. It seems like they have it all figured out and I have just.. survived. They look so loved and so successful and so happy. And I feel like I am just existing.

I am awkward in front of a camera. I am not ugly, I think I'm pretty but I don't know how to smile in front of a camera. I do not own cute clothes or have a wonderful body. I am a bit awkward when I tell stories. Sometimes, even when I don't feel anxious, I still do not know what to say so I stay quiet. I do not know how interact with some people. I am bad in groups. My social media prescence is non existent. I feel like this all feeds into itself. Happy people here seem to be photogenic, sociable, well dressed and extroverted. It feels like I'm trying to fit in and I just can't. My parents didn't have a lot of money for things like that, I never knew how to do make up, I dealt with trauma in my childhood \(both parents had cancer scares\) so its hard to connect with people.

I guess I just needed to vent this. It seems like people are either rock bottom or very high and happy/successful. I feel very mediocre. I'm not a complete failure \(I am graduating college, I have some friends\), but I didn't have a happy experience. And that hurts. A lot. And it also makes it hard to feel love sometimes. Logically I know my parents love me, my friends care for me. But I don't know. Why can't I feel it?"

-struggling with the random and exhausting anxiety from it.
-struggling with feeling like a terrible person because depression gives you this false magnifying glass to see the world through, that nobody cares about you and people are out for themselves and now so are you.
-convincing myself that life is worth living and texting a hotline at least three times a week from the shame and emptiness I experience on a day to day basis.
-watching the people around me succeed and get better.
-watching people around me struggle and still feeling they're doing way better than me.
-never feeling attractive and making jokes about it.
-dark circles from insomnia and because I'm pale.
-wiping tears in conversation and passing it off as if I heard/understood the joke and thought it was just as funny as the other person.
-watching bad movies and making dumb snapchats where I act hyper and goofier than I feel most of the time.
-feeling hopeless about ever doing big things and slowly realizing more and more everyday that life isn't about that.
-scrolling through Instagram and not understanding how people even fall in love or look that happy when life is not that great.
- realizing that I would feel comforted with arms around me and pretending for a second that there's somebody for me.
-getting frustrated at myself for not outlining a book that I've wanted to write for years, but don't know how. Not even having two pages to show for it. Scared to commit to a routine.
-being told and made to feel like I am an inconsistent and flighty idiot.
-feeling unlovable and like I don't belong in the world.
-feeling like my mistakes are so much greater and more awkward than everyone else's. That I am just an anomaly.
-literally having to talk myself into sticking around every fucking day.
-shaking and not being able to get out of bed.
-randomly having PTSD triggered over normal things and then having to make jokes about it.
-constantly apologizing and people telling me to stop apologizing.
-second guessing the fuck out of every message and every text because I feel incredibly shitty about myself to the point I just don't text people and they send me breakup texts about it.
-not knowing what I want or what my mind/body needs right now to feel better. Trying a lot and being momentarily distracted before this feeling comes back.
-deciding that if need be I'll sleep in my car in the student lot rather than go home. Parents hating the fact I exist.
-guys asking me where the bathrooms are or happy college room mates asking if I could take a picture of them.

From major heartbreak, my mother passing away, and more. There has always been some absolutely horrible experience happen to me and luck was just never on my side. The thing is that when these experiences happened, i became better. After something tragic happened i would sort of fall apart and go on a drinking bender and never sleep and have too much casual sex. But while all that was going on i would do unbelievably well when it came to school and my career. I can recall one example which was in college one semester my mother died and less than a month later my girlfriend cheated on me. I went to class drunk, i hardly slept, but i would always take that sadness and be productive and in that semester i took 21 credit hours of classes and got through it with a 4.0 and just knocked it out of the park. I had internship interviews and nailed them too and got offers from all of them. I published my first book in that semester as well. All while essentially being torn up inside and sadder than i have ever been in my life. This pattern has always existed. Something horrible goes wrong and i just end up doing absolutely amazing at whatever it is at that time. But now my life has been going well for about a year and im not doing as amazing as i was. I never do that well when things are good i only do that well when my life is a wreck and chaotic. I guess im looking for any advice on how to keep doing so well when things are going good. I know its kind of the total opposite problem that most people have but for some reason i just thrive in chaotic situations when my life is a mess and when my life is great i do not thrive. Is there any literature about this behavior that anyone knows of? and can anyone at all give me some advice on how to thrive when things are going well?

Backstory:

*My amazing girlfriend and I have been together for a decent stretch and she is all around great. I am currently 3 years into a 5-year Engineering degree, while she is also in a University program. Young love completely aside, she is a keeper. We met just as I was starting an internship for 8 months (May 2017 - December 2017) doing consulting. I was working 24 days on and 4 days off in complete sh1thole rural towns that were filled with hardcore crime, living out of disgusting hotel rooms without stoves/microwaves for 24 days in a row. Even though we had just struck things off, she stuck by my side the whole time. She would write and send me letters, always kept me calm and collected and just supported me through the hell that my life was for the whole internship. I lost contact with almost all of my friends because I was working out of town so much. Even though I had just met her, she was truly the only person to care about my situation and what I was going through. I also did make the stretch to make things work as well, though. For the last 3 months of my internship, I drove back and forth from a city 2.5 hours away every day without my boss knowing. I was already working 10 hour days on site so door to door I was working 15 hours, at one point for 35 days straight before a break. Even though she would always tell me I never needed to do that, and that she could wait until weekends, I really felt that it did keep things alive. Any long distance relationship is tough, especially when you consider the fact that we are both in our primes at 19 and 20. Our friends have new boyfriends and girlfriends every 3 months, but we stuck it out.*


Anyways. **I am back at school now doing a very very intense semester, but I am only 15 minutes away from her. Since I am so close, I push to hang out with her every single day.** My friends are consistent with seeing their girlfriends once a week, but she stood by me in some seriously tough times and I want her to know that I will do the same for her. **She always tells me that I don't need to hang out with her every single day, but if I don't then I get a decent amount of messages like ""I really miss you"" and whatnot.** It makes me feel sad and somewhat guilty. 

**Example:**

* Last night, I told her that I was too busy to study with her the following day, and she was kind of jokingly sad but accepted. However, while texting me later that night she again asked and was wondering if I wanted to study with her today. At this point, she had asked twice and rather than create distance during a stressful time, I told her to come over. Upon studying, we were going to spend some short time in my bedroom. The ADHD meds that I am prescribed and ONLY use during stressful times at school make it nearly impossible to maintain a solid stiffy and thus it was bad. This bad sex on my part has happened a few times in the last month and has been very stressful. She has been saying that she feels like she doesn't turn me on, which is the furthest thing from the truth. I consistently tell her that it is the medication and that I am just stressed out, which is the real truth. I always comfort her and consistently go the extra mile to tell her she is special. After this made her sad this past time, it made me stressed that I had put aside the time to see her, and it only had a negative outcome. 

**Sometimes I feel like even though hanging out every day isn't necessarily extremely special, I really push to get it done and that she doesn't fully appreciate it.** Not asking who is at fault here, but how do I go about this? I want to tell her that I seriously do need more space and time away from her to study, but it just doesn't seem like the best time as the bad sex/stress situation has made her have self-doubt. I can't leave her hanging just feeling like that.

**tl;dr - I am extremely busy with school and push extremely hard so I can hangout with my gf everyday. Sometimes I feel like she doesn't respect my intense schedule and or the work I put in to hangout with her so often.**"

I am graduating college now in August and already got a job offer with this great company. Its an entry level position that I am very qualified for. I currently have 1 1/2 yrs of experience (I did an internship full time for a year) so I am experienced for this position I will be entering. 

Before the offer letter, the recruiter asked me what my salary expectations for the position were to which I answered by saying that I would like to see what they would offer me and if I have any problems with it, I would let her know. Currently, they are offering me $38k and I would like to ask for $40k. 

The problem is, that I don't know if this would be ""too much to ask"" since the median salary is around $38k. I have seen on some websites for the starting salary to be $40k but it's not that many. 

I feel like this is a good salary starting out but if I could get more I would like to. How would I say this and should I even ask for more?

Any help/tips are appreciated! Thanks :)

UPDATE: Went ahead and asked for the increase and got approved! Thanks everyone :)"
8cu4v2,2,2018-04-17,Dilemma: advertising vs PR?,butterdaisies,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/8cu4v2/dilemma_advertising_vs_pr/,"I’m a fresh communications grad and I’ve just been interviewed by 2 companies who seem keen to hire me. One is a renown advertising/PR agency, and the other is an insurance company. 

The agency wants to take me in for an internship, where I would probably be focusing more on agency advertising (social media, etc), and the insurance company wants to hire me for a PR/HR role, where I would be liaising with vendors for events and recruiting/interviewing potential insurance agents (they are very stringent with their hiring process so it’s a specific role). 

I have no experience in either industries, but already know I want a role where I would actively be moving around, meeting and speaking to new people or clients.

At the same time I’m not sure if I should go for the internship to learn as much as I can. But on the other hand, the HR/PR role seems to be more in line with what I want to do, and would definitely have a higher starting salary. However, they did mention there is quite a low ceiling in terms of career progression. 

I have to give my answer to both pretty soon, so I’m quite stressed. 

Can anyone let me in on the difference between the two industries (advertising and PR)? Any advice on which I should pick is greatly appreciated! Thank you! 

Edit: would it be difficult to make a switch between the two if I decide I might like the other better? "
8cu9aa,3,2018-04-17,I wrote a cover letter for a summer engineering internship. Would really appreciate some criticism.,Clever-Username-123,CoverLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoverLetters/comments/8cu9aa/i_wrote_a_cover_letter_for_a_summer_engineering/,"I have never written a cover letter before so I am not sure if I did it correctly and would greatly appreciate some help (don't be afraid to hold back). Some main points that I am unsure about are the spacing of the letter, if I included too much fat, or if I should even include the last paragraph. Also, I do not have any work experience in this field yet, so I tried my best to pull what I learned from school and previous jobs and make it applicable to the position I am looking at.


Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the summer engineering internship position that I found posted on LinkedIn. I will complete my Bachelor of Science degree in Physics and Spanish from X College in X year. I am looking for engineering positions in which I can use my academic background in addition to what I have learned in previous work experiences, where I developed communication skills, a close eye for detail, and the ability to work as a team.

I have obtained a great amount of experience in conducting and reporting on experiments during my time at X College. Some of these experiments measured the bandgap of a semiconductor, the speed of light, and the mass and charge of an electron, among other physical constants and phenomena. The conduction of these experiments taught me how to follow experimental procedure, obtain and interpret scientific data, and use various types of lab equipment/chemicals, while the reporting of them taught me how to analyze and organize data and communicate technical information effectively.

The past two summers I worked as a lifeguard at the X pool in X city. As a lifeguard, it was fundamental to work as a team and pay attention to detail. Not only did I have to keep careful watch over the pool area for any attendants who needed assistance, but I also had to keep an eye out for anything that could lead to a dangerous situation. Furthermore, I had to communicate with my coworkers as quickly as possible so as not to have any distractions for too long of a period.

Although I may not possess the engineering skills one would normally obtain from an engineering program or previous internships, I believe that my education and work experience, along with my aptitude and eagerness for learning, make me an asset to your program.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely,
Name"

I graduated in December and she still has 2 years of school left. Back in November, we slowly started to not talk to each other because of our busy lives. I was working but also looking into internships And getting  interviews with many companies, and she was busy with her sorority, applying to grad school and also internships. I accepted a job back home and moved only 2 hours away from her. We decided that this stage in our lives was hurting our relationship because we didn’t see each other or talk as much. Our relationship wasn’t toxic at all, we didn’t fight much, had similar interests, could even finish each other’s sentences and knew what the other person was thinking. About a month and a half ago I realized that I want her back and that breaking up was a mistake. I’ve reached out to her and tried to get her back but nothing is working.  She keeps giving me the whole “this is my problem, not yours, and I’m sorry about this.” This is our first time being single after 5 years and she tells me that she is having fun and wants to figure herself out and grow individually. We both have talked and have a lot of love for each other and about getting back together in the future when we have our lives figured out and a more stable situation but I don’t want to wait years for her and I want to get back together now. I honestly think that she could be the one and all that. We are both doing our own things but I can’t stop thinking about her every single day. Any advice on what I can do to get her back?

8cvgcc,29,2018-04-17,"Thoughts about the last updates from someone playing since Launch, and (my) reasons to quit.",MikedeKokkie,ACPocketCamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACPocketCamp/comments/8cvgcc/thoughts_about_the_last_updates_from_someone/,"Hello everyone, 
I am quite unfamiliar with this place (and to reddit in general), but I simply had to make this post seeing as it will be my legacy for spending somewhere between 500 and 1000 hours of the last half a year of my life into this game.

So my name's Michael, and I've pretty much played since the week of launch. Today, I realised only now that I've been telling myself a huge lie which kept me going and going up to this point, whilst neglecting my other hobbies and even my career. And that lie is that all this playing for months could lead me to ""a perfect game"". Now what do I mean by this? Imagine having all the categories fully explored, including the event ones. There is literally no more work to do. That's what I dreamed of.

Now I've spent half a year of my life trying to get the complete catalogue for clothing and furniture before this update, the biggest projects being growing 145 of each type of flower for all the floral furniture (which, with all the cross pollination you have to do, you can imagine how long that takes) and leveling every animal friendship to lvl 20 for the pictures. And while I've gotten extremely close to the ""climax"" of completing both those projects, the latest 2 updates stabbed my efforts in the back, pretty much.

Let's go over the new content that has been added to the game the past half a year.
The previous ""events"" have always been a nice thing you can do on the side. Simple crafting materials you get from requests you are already doing, which you turn into furniture. The gardening/bug events which required some gardening on the side (pausing the gardening project but hey, could be worse). The fishing tourney which only required you to fish a bit more for completion. Good content, in my opinion. Now let's get to the new stuff.

So let's knock out Gulliver first. He's not too bad really, but my problem with him is the RNG. Gulliver is refusing to give me any more villagers than O'Hare, whom I got on the first day, despite me giving literally every double furniture I've ever had to him (and I tried to get as much of the dupe furniture from events as possible). Now I have run out and I need to constantly craft to get more chances for villagers, and it's just not happening. This is beyond frustrating, because I also know that, despite having nearly every villager to lvl 20, I will need to fully raise the new villagers who I don't even have yet to 20. What a chore. The candy helps, but that too is a pain to get for its minimal effects. I get a horrible feeling that Nintendo just keeps adding more animals every few weeks when people like me are nearly done, making us start from scratch again and keeping us playing.

Now for the elephant in the room; the Fortune Cookie update. As other posts have described, this is nothing more than ""gacha"", more commonly known as loot boxes. You need to ""unbox"" 10 furniture pieces from three different ""furniture set lootboxes"". Some of the furniture has a 3% unbox chance. As these boxes cost 50 leaf tickets each, you can imagine you need an unbe""leaf""able (sorry) amount of leaf tickets to get every piece of funiture. (500 per set, 1500 total, assuming you get incredibly lucky and get everything first try). People have stated that you can get the cookies through the daily, rewards  (1 a week), cookie stand (0 or 1 a day), but I honestly do not wish to spend another 2 months stressing out and wondering if all furniture can actually be unboxed through sheer luck (Personally, I do not believe so, and I've done the calculations). The stamp system is a great way to solve this but as people have pointed out, you need 50 cookies/stamps (2500 tickets) for the rarest furniture, and I believe you won't be getting 50 of each cookie without spending leaf tickets.

Now, I am aware people have stated that the fortune cookie furniture fall under the ""special"" category and thus do not affect the main catalogue screen, but for someone like me who has always been able to complete each special category and has always kept a very likely chance of ""perfecting"" the game, this update basically threw those chances, and the game with them, down the shitter.

It may be important to note that before this update, during the half a year where I spent time gardening and raising levels, I was already questioning whether it would all be worth it. What if I DO get everything? What then? An empty outlook on how much time a single mobile game has cost me? I know no real life friends who play this game except a streamer I've added. The game has seriously harmed my 40-hour workweek internship considering how much time it has made me slack off. So this update was basically a dealbreaker for me. 

Please don't understand me wrongly, I've enjoyed this game a lot. The anticipation of working towards my goals was great and my time was not ""wasted"". But the fact that it would have this outcome was just disappointing. Also, I am not looking to blame this subreddit or its users, and I am not looking to start a flame war, I just need to get these feelings and opinions off my chest.

So I am officially quitting Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. People have described they felt ""free"" after quitting this game, and now my chance has arrived to test this hypothesis. Now, I can finally fully focus on my career as a scientist and other things in my life again, without the pressure from fully completing this game. Because that pressure, sadly, is to remain, and the completion, too, is to remain but a dream.

Ask me anything in the comments, I'll try to answer questions.

EDIT: I was made aware that the newest update of 23/04 adds ANOTHER fortune cookie set which costs 80 leaf tickets instead of 50. My response to this is prefectly summarized by this quote from /user/kittenbun: 
&gt; 80 leaf tickets for the new cookie? haha. this is the BIGGEST 'fuck you' from nintendo to the players. ""whine about our prices? okay, cool, we'll put them up, see how you like them at 80."""

Audio Systems in Mercurys,njrajio,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/8cvhax/help_audio_systems_in_mercurys/,"Little background that's a bit necessary: I'm a snobby audiophile (yeah, I know, might be stupid to some, but I do enjoy really good sound quality and listen to a wide range of music) and my internship calls for me to finally get my first car ever (junior in college wooo). 

The car I'm purchasing is a 02 Mercury Sable LS (paperwork still needs to be completed but a gentlemen's agreement has been made) and being I am very concerned with audio quality, and that not much information on the internet turned out to be useful, I am turning to you, literally the internet, to ask your experience, what type of stock sound system is in the Mercury? Does it sound good (well balanced)? 

If everyone has a lot of input in this I might consider compiling a huge spreadsheet/log of car audio systems and quality. 

Edit* 
I should also note that this car used to be my friends grandmother's daily and she was the only owner....put 60k on the odometer but they had the engine rebuilt for some reason at 40k..because of this I'm pretty sure the wear and tear on everything in this car is going to be very low.

A little knowledge of Rainbow Six (more specifically siege) would be helpful for this roleplay, but not necessarily required! 

---

""Six, new intel's just come in."" The intern was holding a stack of folders, placing them on the Director's desk, rushing through the door with a dangerous sense of urgency. 

Each of them labelled with a name of an operator. 13 of them. Ash, Hibana, Valkyrie, IQ, Dokkaebi, Caveira, Ela, Zofia, Frost, Twitch, Ying, Mira &amp; Finka.

Opening up Ash's file, the american redhead FBI agent was pictured with holding her own sidearm to her head, bruises and cuts on her abdomen, wearing a red, white and blue american flag bikini.

Checking the other files, they were almost identical, from the French callsign ""Twitch"" to Hong Kong's ""Ying"". Thirteen women operating in 5 different continents, and 7 different countries, all captured and forced to pose...

Somebody was playing a game with Team Rainbow.

""They're all women... all the same way, even Caveira."" Caveira, the stubborn BOPE interrogator, ready and posing to take her own life. ""I want the last rendezvous with each and every one of these Ladies, when and where we lost them. NOW - and get me every. goddamned. operator. we. have."" Six barked as she stood up. 

---

Studying the intel further, Six noticed an engraving on the wall behind each photo, out of place - but the same one in each. They were all in the same location. The pictures had been found by MI6 agents scouring the darkweb. No connection was made on the 13 women to Rainbow 6, but whoever had them, knew that the 13 were connected to something more than just special forces.

Rainbow 6 was the world's *elite* - the best of the best, and 13 of 40 of the world's elite had just been captured by an unknown force - with absolutely no discerning qualities or motives. 

As call sign Six moved to leave her desk for coffee, something she turned to in times of pressure and duress, her desk phone began to buzz. ""Go For Six."" she said, to ensure communication and identities were secure, her call sign was used even verbally. The line buzzed for a moment ""Do your girls look broken, six? Do they look afraid? Cant you see the fear in their eyes as they look into the camera? Have you *ever* heard of an elite special forces unit break? SAS, FBI, GIGN... I thought you were supposed to train them to *resist* interrogation, not have them fold as soon as they're caught on their knees - I'm going to personally enjoy training these pretty young ladies... Ash and Valkyrie have already rehearsed their little strip-show... What do you say to that, *Special Forces Strippers: The Movie!* I can see their names - not just their callsigns - their real names on Walk of Fame Stars, cant you, Six?"" Six cut the line. She'd had enough.

---

Six spent the next day meticulously looking through user permissions on Hereford base to find out how the operations database was compromised and the operators were located and targeted - All male operators called in secure one way or another, whether it be by getting in touch with their mission handler or through other means of communication.

All operators on standby were gathered in the theatre, arranging themselves around the intel on a large projected screen at where the hall comes to a narrow. Commander Ramirez stood before them all on the stage, behind him the high-definition scans of the girls pictures, found on the darkweb ""Gentlemen, today is the day that we all feared - A targeted attack on your colleagues and friends. The 13 women that we are aiming to recover on this mission are fellow operatives. The best in the world, the best at what they do - And some how, some way, they've all fallen for *something*. We cannot be sure what that is.

""Gentlemen, what you see in this hall is for your eyes only. Nothing you see here can be spoken a word to anyone, rainbow clearance or not."" A video started playing. A still steel pole in the middle, behind that 11 of the girls stood at attention, their bodies shadowed but the silhouettes obviously identifiable as each girl. 

Slowly, a familiar tune got louder - easily recognised by english-speaking operators as the [Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siwpn14IE7E) two sets of high heels stepped into frame, The long legs of Valkyrie and Ash followed, both of them in blue and white striped platform shoes, red lace thongs and white star pasties over their perky breasts, they embraced each other and forced their tongues down each other throats, spitting and swallowing the exchanged fluids and not caring for the dribble that ran down their breasts and onto the floor. A clear insult to the female American operators, regardless of their consent.

---

Hi! Thanks for reading! Sorry it was a long prompt but I have so many silly humiliating ideas for all of the Rainbow Six girls I couldn't help but give a taster. So... Drop me a line if you want to play! I'm down for anything - really, anything. 

The prompt was written from the perspective of Rainbow's Director, but that gives you  a chance to write out your ideas for the terrorist organisation that has captured these unlucky 13

I’ve had several interviews. Got a no from three. But the one that really got to me is the agency I had been talking to for literally months. I interviewed with them more than a few times, meeting some pretty important people there. Thought everything was shaping up to be a fine deal until I got the denial. 

At this point I’m worried I won’t get anything. I’m waiting to hear back from one agency a friend helped me interview at, and I’ve got two other interviews this week. Normally I try not to let it get to me but it’s super disheartening. I’ve been told that I have a pretty good resume/portfolio, but I’m seeing my peers land stuff quickly with no experience at big shops and it’s rough.

First and foremost, I want to acknowledge my parents: Tim “Mr. C” Andrews and Valerie Cummings (and my Aunt, Ceil, and my other anonymous relative – who doesn’t like to be named on the internet and definitely wasn’t flying a drone around without permission during the race – who were there in person). Not only did Mr. C handle the live splits on twitter like a boss, but he and my mother have been rooting for me, well, literally, longer than anyone. Thanks as well to my #1 partner in life, running, cat-parenting, and everything, Mariana, without whom I would be a sad, lonely, shadow of a man; I’m sorry you couldn’t be there in person for this one, but you’re in my heart always. I also can’t forget my coach, Jon Waldron, who’s been with me for more than a decade (!) since our first meeting at CA in fall of 2007; thank you for always being there and pushing me to be the best that I can be. HUGE thanks to Rajpaul Pannu and Chris Frias who provided the best pace-making I could ask for and went well above and beyond what I’d hoped for. Thanks to everyone at HOKA for the amazing hospitality and truly world-class event, especially Mike, Christian, Craig, Cory, Sunny, Sam, everyone from USATF, Leo, and all the NJNY crew (particularly Tommy for getting my legs working after the race), and the myriad others I met over the course of the week. To my Ecuadorian running crew – Franklin Tenorio, Miguel Almachi, Jose Luis, Jean, Erik, Isra, Edi, Angie, Anita – ustedes son parte de mi familia; gracias para recibirme como un chasqui del grupo y para empujarme cada día en el entrenamiento. Thanks to my partners at STRIVE, Nic and Rob, who’ve been there for so long, and for all my students and interns who keep in touch and have sent kind words along the way. Thanks to the good folks at nuun for keeping me hydrated (and cooled – yes, it’s all the same bottle and some of it just goes on my head). To Alta Andina – y’all have become family to me over the past months; I love you and I run with the AA spirit in my heart; thanks for inspiring me with your incredible hard work and dedication to making the world a better place. Lastly, to all my other friends, family, fans, anyone who’s ever said hello to me at the airport or wished me luck on Reddit – it really means something; thank you.



### Pre-race


“Each day seemed evidence of something, and I counted them. I’d add them up. Line them up end to end… And soon it would get… improbable. As if each day was a car Evel Knievel had to clear. One car, two cars. By the time I’d get up to say like maybe about 14 cars, it would begin to seem like this staggering number. Jumping over 14 cars. And the rest of the year, looking ahead, hundreds and hundreds of cars, me in the air trying to clear them. Who could do it? How did I ever think anyone could do it that way?’

Abiding again between heartbeats; [he] tries to imagine what kind of impossible leap it would take to live that way all the time, by choice, straight: in the second, the Now, walled and contained between slow heartbeats. … Sarge, says it all the time: It’s a gift, the Now: it’s no accident they call it The Present.” – Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace.


6:50am: Here we go!

I wake up around 2:30am and doze fitfully for another two hours or so until my alarm finally wakes me three hours before the gun. The wind has been howling all night and as I get out of bed and peek outside, I see that the hotel’s pool umbrellas lay helter skelter and the palm fronds still whip in the pre-dawn dark.

I swipe open my phone and see that wunderground still predicts the wind to die down around dawn. Fingers crossed.

This part I’ve done before – the waiting. I make coffee, snack on some animal crackers, check my email and reddit, and make my way through a few lessons of DuoLingo Japanese. Before I know it, it’s 6:20am; the sun still rests behind the horizon but HOKA’s star intern, Craig Lutz, waits in the parking lot to drive me the two miles to the Santa Barbara City College Track.

We arrive and, as if on cue, the wind halts, the flags fall still, and the white caps on the beach across Cabrillo St. settle into the ocean. With no direct sunlight yet, the air is cool and crisp: perfect for a long-distance race.

Mindlessly, I go through the usual pre-race routine. Getting the lay of the land: where are the important landmarks? The bathrooms? The start, finish, bag-check, etc.? But, this race is a bit different. Today, the powers that be have arranged this morning essentially for me. So, I leave my backpack on the infield, I tell Christian where I’d like the bottle table placed, and I sit and wait.

I meet Chris and Raj – our pace-setters for the day – as they arrive and we discuss the plan for the race: starting a bit behind world-record pace, accelerating slowly over the first 5-8km, and then settling right around 3’14-15/km for as long as they (and I) can hang on. With the business out of the way, we jog a few laps and talk about everything except the upcoming 125 laps – their day jobs, upcoming race plans, where they stayed in town last night.

After 2km, I pull off and let the liebres continue. Even a 2km warmup seems garish with 50 more coming up shortly.

I continue to run through the motions: changing into my racing shoes (from an old beat-up pair of Clifton 4s to a brand-new, fresh pair). I take off a few layers as the sun begins to warm the track. I run through the normal series of drills and a few light strides. My legs feel great. My feet pop off the track like golf balls on a concrete sidewalk. We’re ready.

As the clock ticks past 7:30am, the sun climbing higher with every passing second, we line up behind the starting line (facing “backwards”, down the home stretch) and our USATF Official Mr. Bill Handley calls “take your marks”, and, with a crack and a puff of smoke, we’re off.

### Race

We begin running clockwise (i.e. the opposite of the normal direction you’d run on a track) for the first 8km of the race.

(Aside for those who are interested in why we ran 8km in the opposite direction to start – skip this paragraph if you don’t care. Originally, we’d thought that we’d have to run the entire race counter-clockwise. It wasn’t until about 10 days before the race that I was told that we could switch directions if we wanted, but we could only do it once and had to tell the officials before the race exactly when the switch would occur. Since we’d thought we’d have to run the race in one direction, I’d done essentially all my track training in one direction up to that point and so it seemed like a big risk to split the race in half, even though that might seem the most logical, half CW and half CCW, because if it felt, like, weird to run in the other direction because of not being used to turning right all the time, it’d be a long time to be stuck with said weird feeling. So, 8km seemed like a decent amount of time in that it’d give my left-turning muscles and bones a bit of relief but wasn’t so long that it’d be an issue if it felt awful, especially since I’d be running it at the start. Plus, after 8km, you’ve got a marathon left, which is a nice natural dililenation in and of itself).

We’re off the line and I tuck in behind Raj and Chris who run more or less two abreast in Lane 1. We cover the first lap in 80 – exactly what I’d asked for: a few 80s, a few more 79s, before settling in at 78s (3’15/km – a second under WR pace) for as long as we could. There’s a clock at both the finish and at 200m, so as much as I’d like to ignore the splits and focus on the tiny piece of synthetic (epidemic) fabric between Raj’s shoulders, it’s hard not to glance at the blinking numbers that we pass every 40 seconds or so.

Someone had asked me before the race what I was going to think about while I was running. I replied that for the first two hours or so (two hours!), I’d mostly try not to think at all. And so, that’s what I do. I focus my gaze on the nape of Raj’s neck and try to revert my brain to its most reptilian form.

And so, we run some 80s, and at some point, maybe around 2km, I’m starting to think that this feels really slow and we should pick it up to 79s. And so they do that and we pass 5km, probably around 16’3x, and before I know it the officials are putting the cone out and we’ve got do our little U-turn and now we’ve run 8km and we’re running the so called normal direction and we have less than a marathon to go. How hard could that be?

We’re running 78s now and while I’m not keeping track of the exact pace, I have told Raj and Chris at this point to settle into 3’15 pace and just get into a rhythm. Mike McManus is on the sideline and calling out our splits relative to each 1600m (so, each 400m, 800m, 1200m, etc.). I’m not hearing too much as I’m very much “in the zone” but a few splits sound quick. At 10km, I decide to split my watch just so I can get a sense of how fast we’re going.

Our 11th km is a 3’11 and I let Raj and Chris know.

“Hey. We just ran a 3’11. I don’t want to go any faster than 3’15, so let’s settle in there.”

The pace slows and yo-yos a bit as Raj and Chris find the perfect rhythm but it feels much more comfortable. This is often the part of the race where I feel the best – between the 10 and 30km point. I’m truly enjoying myself. I’m smiling as I actively avoid looking at the clocks and instead focus on the beautiful mountains above the stadium, the clip-clop of our feet, the knowledge that we’re sneaking up on WR pace exactly as planned, the thought – for the first time – that I really think I’m going to do this.

Chris had told me beforehand that he figured he’d make it to 10 miles and Raj would make it to 15 miles. The 10 mile mark (just over 16km) sneaks up on me and we pass it around 52’30 (now under world record pace). Chris and Raj are talking between the two of them, but I can’t really hear and just continue staring at Raj’s bouncing shoulder-blades.

I keep expecting Chris to drop off at any moment and so it’s an immense positive feedback loop every lap, every kilometer, that goes by where he’s still pulling us along. We pass 11 miles, 12 miles, and then the half marathon mark (about 1’09’10). We pass 15 miles and then I think it’s right around the halfway mark (25km), more than 5 miles beyond what he’d committed, that he pulls off and wishes us luck. Thank you, Chris.

Our 25km split is 1’21’47 (2’43’34 pace – 4 seconds under the overall world record). I’d expected to be slightly further ahead of this and so I know that we’ll have to put in some work for however long Raj is planning to keep running in order to build a bit of a buffer for the inevitably brutal last 10km.

In a normal, ideal race – say, a marathon on a cool day – I’d always hope to negative split, i.e. run the second half faster than the first. But today, I was almost certain, before we even started, that if I wanted to set the overall world record, I’d have to be under pace going into the last 10km. Between the temperature (which would rise along with the sun over the course of the race), the pounding my feet would take from the 210 consecutive left turns, and the long solo final stage of the race, I knew it’d be extremely difficult to accelerate in the later stages. Looking at both my own and others’ 50K results, I’d hoped to have about a minute on the record at the 40km point.

And so, in seeing that we’re just about exactly on WR pace at 25km, I’m already a bit nervous. I’m feeling good, strong, but I know that, from an effort perspective, there’s still significantly more than halfway to go. I keep my fingers crossed that Raj will stick around for at least a few more miles.

He does. Like Chris, Raj absolutely earns his MVP status as the kilometers tick by and Mike continues to call “76-77, 2’33-2’34, etc.” We’re perfectly on pace and every lap we’re building a bigger cushion on the record. We pass 30km in 1’37’58 (16’10 for that 5K) and are now about 30 seconds under pace. But things are starting to feel hard now. We’re running consistently, but I’ve lost the feeling that I’m just on a comfortable run around the park. No, now, this feels distinctly uncomfortable, and it’s taking an exponentially increasing amount of focus to stick with Raj.

As we come up to the 20 mile mark, I can tell we’re going to be just off the 20-Mile American Record. With a few laps to go, I briefly consider surging ahead for the bonus that comes along with the mark, but since we’re still under overall WR pace and shit is starting to get extremely real, I decide against it. We pass just over 1h45 – only 10 seconds off.

But still, Raj is dragging me around and around. I’m going through a dark phase where the logical side of my brain is begging Raj to just slow down a bit, to maybe ask Mike if we can, like, change this race to just be a marathon or even 35km; gosh, that sounds nice. But I’m thinking of Joelle Van Dyne and Don Gately and trying not to think of all those buses lined up. I’m taking this one step at a time, one lap at a time.

I don’t remember exactly when Raj steps off, but I think it might have been at 35km (1’54’19). We’re still under WR pace at this point, but I already know it’s going to take a miracle to hang on. It’s one thing to chase Raj but entirely another to try to judge pace and effort on my own all of a sudden. Within just a couple of laps, I can see that I’ve already slowed down despite the fact that the effort feels the same. The overall record is slipping away second by second.

At 40km (2’11’16, a 16’57 solo 5k, 20 second OVER world record pace now), I know I’m not going to get it. It’s not defeatist but simply realistic. The solo running under the blazing Californian sun is simply too hard; I’m not going to do it today.

But, instead of feeling sorry for myself and jogging it in, I simply re-adjust. I try to stay positive; what’s the next mental check-point? I’ve got the marathon mark coming up and unless I really baby out, I’m going to snag an Olympic Trials Qualifier. That’s pretty sweet.

We pass the marathon in 2’18’42 and that’s a hugely positive datum. I’ve already gotten something great out of the day. And now, while I’m not thinking about the finish yet, I’m trying – with great strain – to do some mental math and think about the track WR of 2h48. I know I’d been 2h11 at 40km, which makes me think the track mark should be in the cards (again, barring some monster implosion), and every kilometer and lap that go by, I’m reassured of that again.

Finally, a switch in my brain clicks and instead of thinking of what kilometer I’m running, I’m thinking of how much is left. 45km goes by in 2h28 and I know I’m not going to run a 15 minute 5K and set the overall record. But that’s okay, because there are only 12 laps to go and that just seems so reasonable. Plus, I only have to run 19 minutes to hit the track WR mark, which, as well, seems entirely reasonable. I know I’ve slowed down; I’m running over 80 seconds per lap. The previous 5K had been just over 17 minutes. But I’m not thinking about that. I’m just running one lap at a time. Good job. That one’s done. One more.

I think it’s at 10 laps to go that the officials actually start flashing lap counters at me. Up to that point, I hadn’t heard a single lap count (thankfully, because who wants to hear lap, like, 75 of 125 when you’re 30km deep?); but, now as with so many workouts, I’m counting down from 10, 9, 8. The math is getting harder, everything fuzzier and more abstract, less real, but I’m almost certain I’ll get the track WR unless my mind is leading my astray.

I can feel the outside of my foot screaming every 20 seconds as I take another left hand turn. I can feel my form disintegrating as I awkwardly drive my arms in a state of near-complete exhaustion, an early Boston-Dynamics robot struggling for linear motion. I can feel the sun beating down on me, the cool water from my bottle that Mike hands off every few minutes seeming to accomplish nothing except blurring my already foggy vision. Still, I’m putting one foot in front of the other.

With 1km to go, I really try to push. I know I’m not beautiful and I know I’m falling apart, but I’m turning my legs over faster, driving my arms higher. I’m counting down the seconds.

And then Mr. Handley is ringing the bell. One more 400. One more 200. 30, 29, 28. And finally it’s all over. 

### Post-race

I cross the line and collapse in a heap. My muscle spasm; my whole body throbs. Everything hurts but the pain is so omnidirectional that it somehow seems to dull the effect. I just want to be here and breathe and not move. I roll from my knees onto my ass and promptly throw up all over the track (a moment forever immortalized by Kyle Merber and Erik Boal from Dyestat). Mike is there; NJNY’s Tommy is there and the two of them help me off my feet, literally lifting me up as my muscles have decided enough is enough for today, and they heft me onto the infield where I’m deposited onto a hard plastic chair.

2’46’06 is the final time. A new World and American Record for 50km run on a track. 2 minutes and 28 seconds off the overall 50K World Record, making me the second fastest American in history at the distance.

I’d lost just under two and a half minutes during those last, lonely 15 kilometers. And as much as I’d like to say I just had an off day, the truth is that if we ran this race 100 times under the same conditions, I’m not sure we would have gotten a better result. HOKA put on one of the most professional and well-supported events I’ve been a part of. Chris and Raj both went well above and beyond the call of duty. But when it came time to drop the hammer in the last 10km, I simply didn’t have it. Maybe if it were 30 degrees cooler (the temperature was over 70F for the last hour of the race), the overall fatigue wouldn’t have taken so much out of me. But, I know, today, on this track, in these conditions, I squeezed every last drop out of the orange. I left everything out there.

As Jon had said to me before the race, “You can do this; you can run this pace; but everything needs to go perfectly.” There’s a reason this record is 30 years old (and it’s not just that it’s easy and no one cares about it, as much as the Let’s-Run trolls will, I’m sure, insist); it’s because it’s hard. 50km is almost 20% longer than a marathon and that 20% correlates to an extremely nonlinear exertion of effort.


Chris Frias (left) and Rajpaul Pannu – y’all the real MVPs

Is it on par with an Olympic distance record (marathon, 10,000m, etc.)? Of course not. I’ve never claimed to be Eliud Kipchoge and – even if I had smashed the record – I never would. That’s never been my claim nor my goal when it comes to running. I’ve always sought to push my own limits, to find my own personal ceiling.

I discovered where my limits lie for today, on this track: 2’46’06. 3’19 per km for 50km. 5’20 per mile for 31.1 miles.

Yet – like so many distance runners – I’m not satisfied. I don’t feel that I’ve found my absolute limit. I think on a cool, windless day, that 2’43’38 mark could go down, even with my current fitness. I don’t know that I’ll ever do it; but, I do know that I’ll try again. I’ll continue striving to find the best version of myself. I’ll keep training and pushing myself for those extra 3 seconds per kilometer. And I’ll hope that the teenager who reads this who might think of himself as an uncoordinated, unathletic, music-nerd will find a new passion in self-improvement that will take him literally around the world, will teach him the science of training and greetings in a dozen languages, will introduce him to hundreds of people – from chemical engineers to Olympians to flight attendants – and will leave him in moments of agony so beautiful he can’t help but weep. That’s all I can hope for.

8cy707,0,2018-04-17,"Me [32 M] with my partner[33F] of 5 yrs, have frequent arguments about commitment and the future;Am I lazy and not supportive, or is she over reacting and should ask for help instead of arguing?",yellowbrick123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8cy707/me_32_m_with_my_partner33f_of_5_yrs_have_frequent/,"I (M 32) and her (F33) have been together for 5 years. We met through friends, we have been living together for about 2.5 years and this past June we bought a house together. I feel that we are at a crucial time in our relationship, some days I feel like we are a perfect match and other days I’d rather spend time alone. 

We have been having arguments about commitment, trust and the depth of our connection together. The arguments are almost always started by her (95%). I would love to get some feedback from an outside perspective, I really feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to about this, there is no single incident or trait that makes me think this relationship is destined to fail, but at the same time I question my own willingness to continue. 

My doubts are for a few reasons.

- should I be having to convince her that I care about her and love her so often ? Some days she knows I do but some days she questions it and has to ask “do you love me?” that puts doubt into my mind. Do I? I think I do. Why does she not see it? Is it because I am not showing her the attention/affection she craves? Am I not doing that enough or do I really not care about her as much as I think I do? I know that she loves me, she wants to spend as much time together as possible but she doesn’t trust me as much as she loves me. I hope some examples will give you a sense.

Personalities

- Me. I’m a pretty easy going person. I have a good job but I don’t love it and it doesn’t consume by life. I am active with sports in my community, I enjoy making art and I have a decent social group (that seems to be fading as we progress through our 30’s due to kids, work, busyness of life…)
- this is my first relationship over a year in length. Since it has happened late in life (started at 27), there is a thought in my mind that I haven’t ‘experienced’ enough, to be blunt. That said, I know I could be happy with my partner, it is not an overpowering desire by any means to experience more partners. I am mainly concerned that I don’t have the experience of knowing what to expect from another person and what they expect from me. That inexperience has shaken my confidence. What do I “give up” to make the other person happy, what is fair, what is too much, what balance is going to allow us both to be happy and continue to grow as people and as a team?
- Her. She is an immigrant to this country, came for university and stayed. She is a fun, caring, energetic person. She enjoys being active, going out to try new restaurants, travelling, dancing, cooking, trying new things (like skiing and downhill mountain biking). She is beautiful, she is not too serious about everything, she is fun and she is well liked. She is a catch, she’s become my best friend. Last summer I travelled with her to her home country to meet her parents and some friends. Her parents don’t speak English so we used a lot of Google Translate, they are nice people, they welcomed me and it wasn’t surprising to learn that she came from good people.

Recent Argument

For the last month, I have been going through the interview process to move from Canada to the USA for what could be an excellent job opportunity. She is currently not working and has been frustrated (as some of you can relate) to the struggle of job searching (university grad, decent work experience in professional settings, recently her term position at the location university ended and she hasn’t found the next gig). In the interview process, I have not put much effort into figuring out how she will be able to also immigrate. This caused a fight. When I step back from the situation, sure, I could have done more to start figuring this out. I’ve been focused on actually getting on offer. On my current job. On having fun (we went on a date this Friday, she went out with friends Saturday and we hung out all day on Sunday). Then on Monday, after I have a call with the company, she really escalated the situation about her ability to move. When I told her I don’t know how we will do it, she basically started yelling at me, accusing me that I don’t want her to come. That is hard to deal with, because I do want her to come. I think I do atleast. Again, I acknowledge that I could have done more. But I didn’t, she knew I didn’t. This didn’t come up all weekend. I expressed to her that the company told me they would help with it. I don’t enough know how I can get down there, and what relocation looks like. I think that is a reflection of me, I haven’t really looked into it for myself or her. I’ll admit that seems lazy. I think its more of a “stick your head in the sand” and hopefully this works out, which is a bit immature for my age and the situation. 



This situation is similar to others, two come to mind. 

She will express the same disappointment that I don’t do more to help her get a job. I will do anything she asks of me. I’ve spent countless hours writing resumes and cover letters. I have done everything asked, but I haven’t taken very much initiative. I don’t think she is working as hard as she could be. I encourage her to volunteer somewhere so that she can interact with more people, or work as an intern to get her foot in the door. I know those things take time/effort but they are better approaches to the job hunt than just sending our resumes.
Similar situation when it comes to her drivers licence. She doesn’t have it. We went out and practiced a number of times, always by her initiative, never mine. Again, I’m happy to, but it’s not something I want to do. I got my license 16 years ago and this is boring. I have taken time off work on 3 occasions so she could take the test but she failed every time and hasn’t tried again in 6 months. 

This is a source of tension between us. She wants more in but she doesn’t put the effort it. I want more for her and I don’t put the effort it unprompted. I feel that her frustrations around these things gets unfairly directed at me. As I’ve said, I will always do what she asks to help her, but I am concerned that I don’t do more of my own volition to help her. I do feel that I need more time to myself, do work on my own interests and just to have time to myself (I really enjoy that time, and I need it to recharge). Does this mean that we are incompatible? I find it tiring that I am the one to help her with mostly everything related to career, education, taxes, drivers license not to mention continuously improving her language/communication skills. There is very little that she helps me with there. She is helpful 


My Problem

Why am I not more proactive? Does this suggest that deep down I don’t love her, or at the least that we are  not compatible? Things have changed for me over the time we have been together. I was not in the best place when we met, and she really got me to enjoy life again. I was depressed when we met and being with her changed my life for the better. My life has changed professionally where I have made good progress and am now being offered this opportunity that could really change my (our) lives. I think she feels depressed that this isn’t happening for her but I think her expectations are unrealistic. (I have a background in compsci whereas her general business experience is less desirable). 



Please, I would really value your interpretation of this disorganized story. Am I just being a lazy partner and I should do more on a regular basis. Have we grown apart? Can we both do more? 



TLDR; I can do more to help with her job and our immigration to the USA but so can she. This becomes a point of argument. She thinks I should want to help her more, I think she can do more to help herself. "

The summer going into our junior year things turned romantic, and it was one of the most natural transitions I’d ever experienced. She was everything I could have asked in a girlfriend and we both shared our firsts for nearly everything (I’d never “dated” anyone more than 2 months before her). Our relationship had the occasional bump in the road, but otherwise remained really strong. Near the end of our junior year, she got an internship in Florida, while I remained in Georgia.

The long-distance, even for just the summer, was really hard on us. It was my first time trying anything long distance, and I didn’t visit as much as I should have. We saw each other maybe 3 times over the summer. At the same time, she made a lot of other intern friends, including a guy named Tyler (back to him later). During times that would have been good to call/FaceTime, it was difficult to get ahold of her because she hung out with this new friend group so much, and particularly with him. She started pulling away, but I felt like I couldn’t ever confront the issue because anytime we argued she either became angry with me and/or shut down completely to where I couldn’t get any of my points across. I don’t think anything truly terrible like her cheating was going on - this was just how she responded to most arguments or things that upset her. Anyway, the combination of a terrible long-distance experience and an existential crisis of me not knowing exactly what I wanted out of life, my career, and where I wanted to go, led me to break up with her at the start of our senior year. She was shellshocked. I know from talking with her friends that she was a complete train wreck after it happened, and that haunts me.

The next 8 weeks were arguably some of the worst in my life as well; to call anything in my life before this a ‘heartbreak’ would be naive and stupid. After those 8 weeks, I came to the conclusion that I had made the worst decision of my life and asked her to give us a second chance, to which she said she’d give it a try. The physical aspect of our relationship immediately came back in full force, but everything else just wasn’t quite the same. A few weeks after that (late October now), she said she just couldn’t be in any relationship right then, which I said was fine, yet the physical aspect still continued. Then, near December of last year, I found out that she had been going on dates since September with that Tyler guy from Florida. The past several months and over the summer I had been told over and over that he was just a friend and meant nothing to her, so when I found out I freaked out and did the worst possible thing - I gave her an ultimatum. Me or him. The FWB thing we had going on quickly went away, and by January of this year she was literally dating the guy she said “you don’t have to worry about.” Since then he’s flown up and she’s driven down to see each other several times and it’s gotten serious, and thanks to an unwarranted drunken confession from one of her friends I know they’re now having sex. In these next few weeks she’ll be graduating and either working full-time in Florida near him, or working at a city closer to where I’ll be.

I don’t know what else to do anymore. We’ve tried to remain close friends - we talk daily, occasionally go on a walk or get a donut, and are both highly involved athletes on our rowing team. But anytime I see or even just hear about her with this other guy, it feels like a hot iron is pressed up against my chest. The first time I saw her kiss him I went off on my own and drank until I passed out because I felt so out of control. A year ago before that summer began, we were planning on being engaged right around now, and everything since then has completely burned to the ground thanks to my decisions. I haven’t felt truly happy in many, many months. At the same time I recognize the flaws we had in our relationship, and the fact that we were messing around while she and her new boyfriend were establishing their new relationship doesn’t sit well with me. I want to get over her, but if she came running back to me today I’d probably say yes to everything without skipping a beat because I still really, really love her. All the reasons I initially ended the relationship are moot points today. And I’m terrified that I won’t ever connect with or love someone else the same way that we did.

tl/dr: Ended first real relationship and it wasn’t a clean break; want her back, but she’s with someone new"

8cydnv,2,2018-04-17,Help with recommendations?,InvisibleStudent,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/8cydnv/help_with_recommendations/,"So I’m a junior and Im still trying to understand the application process. I plan on taking the LSAT this upcoming November and my gpa is pretty decent (3.6), so I’m not that worried about those because I know the necessary steps I need to take to maintain them. 

But as far as the recommendation letters required for the application, I’m at loss and very concerned. Due to my family situation, I’ve focused most of my hours outside of class working (at a job unrelated to the legal field). Also, I haven’t been involved in any extracurricular activities or clubs at school at all. I have done an internship for a law office, but not long enough for it to develop into a fruitful relationship. So, I haven’t really had the chance to interact with my professors and superiors to the point where anyone would write a recommendation letter for me. I mean yeah sure I attend office hours and have good conversations with my professors, but every time the semester ends that connection mostly ends. 

So my question is how do I go about developing concrete relationships in order to obtain that recommendation letter? What are the steps I need to take? And how can I transition my time at office hours into something more concrete to the point that someone will actually write a letter for me?

Seriously, any advice I can get would help.

Thanks guys! "

We have a database managed by our parent organization which we use to collect our service data. I've been download excel reports from the database and doing relatively simple data manipulation and cleaning before exporting .csv files for use in reports created in Tableau. 

Everything is running great and going smoothly, however, I'll be leaving the organization in August and no one else on staff is prepared to learn R to manage the scripts and run the workflows. I'm trying to create a solution that will allow our less computer savvy staff to generate the required .csv files so they can use them with Tableau.

In my head, I'm imagining a simple website that will allow users to upload the required .xlsx files, run the R program, and then allow users to download the .csv files generated. 

I have a few questions though. 

First, does that seems like a possible solution that is somewhat stable? 

Second, I currently know a bit of Python and am in the process of learning Django, so I'm hoping that the web server portion of this can be somewhat easily done with that language/framework. If so, are there any recommendations on how to get started with that? Specifically using R scripts in conjunction with Python/Django.

Third, are there any obvious things I'm missing that will cause this solution to be more difficult for myself or my team once I leave? I'm hoping to train an intern or my hopeful replacement on how to manage the code once it is hosted somewhere, but I'm not sure how difficult it will be to access and manipulate the files once they are hosted. 

Any ideas are greatly appreciated! "

My mom is choosing to not look at me, talk to me, or recognize what I have accomplished and it is driving a wedge between my family and I because they think I have done something. **

So a little backstory: 
Last May, my mom forced her way into my apartment and decided she had the right to throw my things away and belittle me in my own home. Since then, I have not treated her the same (for good reason) and have not been treated the same by her. 
In December, I decided to go on a week long trip with my boyfriend's [22M, 1.5yrs] family, which she took as a personal attack. She saw that trip as me choosing his family over my family, when in reality I just wanted to go to the beach for a few days.
In January, she was planning on helping me with my taxes, as I am still new to this. She decided that the third day of my new internship was the best time for her to ask for my information, giving me a 3 hour deadline to collect all of my materials. I told her that I was at work and wouldn't be able to get her the stuff until the end of the day and her response was
&gt; ""Clearly, you are pushing me away and to respect your wishes, I will do my best to stay back.""

Since that point, I have received nothing but rude glances from her. She refuses to acknowledge my presence in a room, and most of the time will leave a room as soon as I enter.
On Friday, all in the same day, I got a job offer, an interview at a major healthcare company, and a prestigious award at my university. I was overwhelmed with all the good news that I have been working so hard for and decided to call her to let her know. She just responded with ""Is that it?"" and then hung up on me. Everyone else was supportive, including my boyfriend's family, and I feel like I deserve to be treated better.
Yesterday I was at the hospital for my grandma's [71F] surgery with my mom and the rest of my family and she wouldn't even sit on the same side of the waiting room as me. When our family went down to the cafeteria to eat, she wouldn't eat with us because the only open spot was next to me so she took her food up to the waiting room. During this time when she wasn't near me, my sister [19F] and dad [48M] decided to both tell me that I need to apologize to her and figure out what is going on because they don't want to be in the middle of it. When I went in to see my grandma after she woke up from the surgery, my mom was already in the room with her. Her eyes went straight to her phone screen and I never saw her glance up, even when the nurse came in with discharge instructions. 

I don't know what I did or said to make her hate me, and she won't talk to me or be in the same room, so I feel no need to apologize. I just don't know how to move on from here and I feel like the ball is in her court. The whole situation is causing me a lot of stress and unneeded anxiety. Any advice on how to move forward? "
8cytlt,3,2018-04-17,Voids we fill by relationships (toxic or not),raould00ke,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8cytlt/voids_we_fill_by_relationships_toxic_or_not/,"I'm in my junior year of college &amp; I've found myself at a standstill. This happened especially during my one year relationship, I poured all my attention into my SO &amp; left myself behind. Now after the breakup I have no clue what to do with myself, what problems I need to address or what growing up I need to do. I used the relationship as a distraction from what I really needed to do with myself. 

I realized in a session with my therapist, that I crave the validation relationships give me. That I feel validated when someone loves me or wants to be with me, but then I also (in a weird fucked up way) enjoy toxicity of relationships. I always tend to choose the most emotionally unavailable people in order to gain the most validation of their love, but then it bites me on the ass because fairy tales don't exist &amp; people will never change for someone else. 

Some of us get so far with our instant gratification needs and the superficial validation we get from relationships, but none of it is substantial. Until we learn to validate &amp; be proud of ourselves, we can't have healthy relationships. We will need more validation than our SO can give, creating toxicity. Either distance, arguments, or manipulation will occur. 

It's hard to figure out how to do this, how to gain self esteem or self validation. It's such a vague concept that is easier said than done. But I've made a few changes today, some lifestyle changes, that I think will set me on track to being more independent &amp; proud. 

I made a friend today, which to some people doesn't seem like much but for me, it's nearly impossible. I've probably made 3 friends my entire college career &amp; I don't even talk to any of them anymore. I also am attempting to sign up for my college student government, so I can try to get into a good internship next year &amp; establish myself in the university I want to transfer to. I've also applied for 3 jobs so far, I've been unemployed for a while so there's a ton of anxiety behind this but it is a needed change. Lastly, in order to help my health I've decided to cut out dairy (slightly lactose intolerant) &amp; begin exercising regularly.

We can all do little things like these to help us get better, day by day. Making ourselves active &amp; just taking the initial step towards healing ourselves can be so beneficial. The first step is always the hardest, getting started while you're so low &amp; depressed seems so impossible but it's not. We can all do this, we can all prioritize ourselves because we deserve it. We're all strong enough to pick ourselves up again &amp; become better than we were before our breakup or even the relationship itself. "

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurance, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

I'm looking for some advice as to what to wear to an interview I have next week for an internship interview at Intel in Oregon. 

I [22F] currently work at a business casual law firm (jeans on Fridays but non denim other days) as an admin assistant but have a full sleeve blazer and slacks and dress flats. I know they are pretty casual in general there-my boyfriend interns there and wears jeans and a t-shirt but he's useless with this question and says to wear whatever (which doesn't help me!). 

I don't want to come across as super uptight in full business formal wear like I did for my interview at my current job (which was appropriate), but don't want to look like I'm crazy casual. I've heard women walk a fine line when it comes to clothes at a tech place. I'm totally freaking out over this (it's also my first tech interview ever). 

Thanks for reading!"
8czlkq,3,2018-04-17,I [20F] was going to start an arrangement with this SB [M50s] but got nervous and decided not to. Want to give things a try after gaining a bit more experience but have allowance concern,throwdatsplendaaway,sugarlifestyleforum,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/8czlkq/i_20f_was_going_to_start_an_arrangement_with_this/,"First post on Reddit and this forum so please bare with me. 

About a month ago I joined SA and met up with a very wealthy man at his penthouse (yes probably not best idea but we had skyped beforehand and he was older; made it clear his profession would not allow any sort of scandal or else his career would be over so my safety was #1 concern. I knew his full name and all before meeting). 
This SD, let's call him Rich is well, very rich. Very very rich. He's a wine collector and has great career. 3 homes. He made it clear money was not an issue to him. Keep in mind this would be the first SD I met and was unsure how to negotiate allowance. 
So we had wine and talked and he offered me $400 per meet, saying that is what him and his previous SB had agreed upon. He raised it to $500 per meet once he realized how far I'd have to drive to his place each time (a little under an hour). I figured that was decent, and said I would think about wether or not I wanted to pursue an arrangement or not because I was unsure (in regards to intimacy). Ultimately I chose not to because although we get along great and he's super respectful, I was not really attracted to him. And honesty I thought considering his income, he could afford to give me A LOT more. And I don't necessarily expect me to give me the max he could give, but this man made it clear money was not an issue and I've come to see that this allowance is quite low. 
I was unsure how to go about talking about it seeing as how he had told me what had given his previous SB and I was just too chicken to give a higher price after he had raised it a bit for commute purposes.
Since meeting him I have met a few others and they all offer 300-400 per meet, but I have not pursued anything further with them because they get overly clingy or creepy or allowance is just not what I want. 
Fast forward to yesterday. I messaged Rich asking if he has found an SB, and if he hadn't, if he would still be interested in pursuing an arrangement. He said that yes he was still interested and was glad I reached out, that this could be great for both of us. 
After seeing what's out there and losing my initial nervousness, i think this would be my best arrangement to go forward with, however, now that I know what I know I would like to ask for a bigger allowance. I'll also be taking on an unpaid internship this summer and a few more expenses have come my way so I could use the additional income. 
How would I go about that? I respect him and his time and don't want to overstep my boundaries, but I feel like a bigger allowance is definitely feasible.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

8d0sql,1,2018-04-17,Reunited but no time?,heartinstuttgart,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/8d0sql/reunited_but_no_time/,"My boyfriend (22/Stuttgart) is coming to visit me (20/Las Vegas) from late July to late August. I‘m so excited. I‘ll be visiting him from May to June.

However when he is coming to me I‘m going to be at an internship which has me working 8-5, Monday through Friday for the first three weeks of his stay, leaving us with only two weeks of when I don‘t have work. 

He keeps getting really upset when it comes up and I totally understand why. He had work when I came to visit him last summer and he was always tired and didn‘t want to do things. 

However I think I can balance this because I‘m balancing work and a full time student life now, and still manage to find time for myself. I think it’s especially doable because I work an office job now, and I always want to go out when I am out of the office. 

He told me to take the internship when I told him about the offer because I thought it would be a wonderful opportunity I would rarely see again for this company. I can tell he wants to support me. 

However he keeps getting upset when it comes up and refuses to talk about it. When it becomes a topic of serious conversation he gets angry until he realizes how sad I get when I feel like I‘m letting him down, and then the conversation ends. I understand where he‘s coming from but I don‘t know what to do. His feelings are valid, but sometimes I feel like his response to me isn‘t- if that makes sense. I‘m trying to plan his stay here so it won‘t feel like we have trips and fun things to do, but it is hard when he won‘t talk to me because the thought of afternoons only makes him upset. We only see each other 3-4 times a year if we‘re lucky. We are closing the distance in 2019 if that matters to you all in your responses. 

Am I wrong for taking this opportunity? Or maybe in my thinking and reactions? I‘ve always tried to make my relationship one of my top priorities but I feel like it was important to me and my career to take this opportunity. I just feel like I‘m letting him down. 

TL;DR: my german boyfriend is coming but I have to work for a large portion of that time. He‘s upset and I don‘t know what to do/feel/make it better

Edit: punctuation- I‘m on mobile, sorry!"
8d0z74,2,2018-04-17,Is it time to start HRT or should I wait?,maybri,ask_transgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask_transgender/comments/8d0z74/is_it_time_to_start_hrt_or_should_i_wait/,"Hi all, I’m in a really rough situation and could use some advice. I’m a totally pre-transition trans woman who is financially dependent on extremely transphobic parents. I’m a year away from getting my master’s degree and between classes and my internship I would have to drop out of the program to get even a part-time job. I have a couple thousand dollars in savings, but no real income, so I’m effectively totally dependent on my parents for health care, my cell phone plan, car insurance, and a place to live. I’m out to them but they have made it clear that as soon as I take any steps to transition, I’m going to be kicked out and cut off.

Come January, my internship is over and I’ll be able to work. The plan has been to just hang in there until then, get a job, move out, and start transitioning. But that’s 8 months away and things are starting to look pretty grim for me. I’m binge drinking 2-3 times a week, self-harming and just generally emotionally unstable from dysphoria that has been getting progressively worse for the past year.

I’ve been thinking about starting HRT in secret at a sliding scale health center near where I go to school. I believe it would get the dysphoria down to a level where I could get the drinking and cutting under control, but I sat for 45 minutes today trying to work up the nerve to call and make an appointment and by the end of it I was sobbing and so panicked that I felt like I was going to vomit. I’m so paranoid that my parents are going to find out and kick me out before I’m ready to leave. Eight months on HRT is a long time and I’m afraid the changes will be too hard to hide. But I honestly feel like either option is a death sentence. Either I start HRT and my parents ruin my life, or I don’t start HRT and I die in this repressive shithole sometime this year.

I’m looking for advice or just moral support. I feel like I’m trapped in a burning building and the firefighters are 8 months away. Is it possible to hide 8 months of HRT from people you’re living with? How do I cope with this dysphoria if I don’t start HRT? And just hearing stories from people with similar experiences would help. "
8d1ja6,7,2018-04-17,Has any Pathways Intern on this sub-reddit ever get Non-Competitively converted to A job at an entirely Different agency from where you interned?,122forve,usajobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/usajobs/comments/8d1ja6/has_any_pathways_intern_on_this_subreddit_ever/,"Currently, I am working at DOS as a Pathways Intern. Unfortunately, State has suspended the conversions of interns, thus giving me no choice but to apply for government jobs outside DOS. 

I tried speaking with my supervisor, and he doesn't even make any attempts to talk to me about conversion. I am also not getting any more invites to the bi-weekly meetings that my division has. So it's safe to say my division cannot convert me. 

My only concern as of now is what's going to happen to me after I graduate from graduate school on May 6. I do plan on asking my supervisor if he would still be able to keep me for 120 days before I find a non-competitive position at another government agency for me to convert to.

I have applied to many GS-07 jobs and I haven't heard anything back. This is why I do feel like I would be better off getting a GS-09 job non-competitively, as my graduation is less than a month from now. Is it worth the wait?

For any former Pathways intern who has converted to a government job at a different agency from where you interned, how was the process? Was it easy, and should I worry?"

So, where do CPSC majors go for co-op? What are the favourite CS co-op/internship employers at UBC? Either within Metro Vancouver or outside of the region. This also applies to CPEN majors who do non-engineering work terms (e.g. Amazon instead of Ballard, Osi Maritime, etc.)"

Currently I am a sophomore stats major, but I am not sure when I want to graduate yet. 

I either want to graduate spring 2019 or winter 2019. 

I have a 3.7 GPA and should have 2-3 exams passed by next spring. 

I am working on beefing up my extracurriculars.

However I do not have an internship this summer. I passed an exam in January and applied some places, but it seems my chances are slim to none now. What this means is that I can either graduate next spring with no internship, but hopefully a strong resume otherwise, or I can graduate 7 months later with an internship.

I would prefer to graduate earlier, but I don't want to be stuck in a limbo for a year+ with no job. 

Any sort of advice or insight, even if only tangentially related would be appreciated, thanks."
8d2bfu,4,2018-04-17,Newly-Graduated College Students,blurpenn,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8d2bfu/newlygraduated_college_students/,"Hello! Girlfriend (22) and I (22) are both graduating with BS degrees at the end of this month (her in dietetics, me in IT). She's moving into a masters/internship combo program, and I'm already working full-time.

Combined income: $49,000 pre-tax

Assets: $5,500 in savings (will be start of emergency fund), $1,200 in retirement account, $750 in other investments. 15 year old beater car.

Debts: $4,000 in public subsidized student loans at 4.5%.

We're figuring out our expenses for the duration of her internship and want to make sure that we've got everything covered.

Combined Monthly Income (post-tax): $3,266

Combined Monthly Expenses: $3,255

Rent and Utilities: $1,700. Food: $550. Entertainment: $100. Phones: $50. Health insurance: Both covered under parent's plans for at least 2 more years. Car Insurance: $325. Emergency fund contribution: $300. Car Repair/Replacement fund: $175. Gas: 55$

Other expenses: 

-We only have 1 pretty old car right now, and having another beater or money for a backup would be ideal.

-We'll be taking out ~$15-20,000 in public student loans @6.75% to pay for her graduate degree program, so we'll need to start contributing to at least the interest on those.

-We want to start paying down our current loans, but we didn't want to pay them off too quickly, in case something happens and we need to use our savings for a car repair or something that we need to buy.

I guess our question is: Is there anything that we're forgetting or need to worry about in the short to medium term? Do we need to consider anything else? Does anyone have any advice on how to plan for the short term in a better way?

We're not too worried about the long-term because our combined increase in earnings should be significant in the next couple of years. The only thing that we're worried about long-term is the possibility of an economic collapse that results in a multi-year underemployment problem for one or both of us, but I don't really think there is much we can do about that one right now. Unless anyone has ideas?

Tldr: What are some things that recent college grads need to consider when budgeting?

We appreciate the help! Thanks for the advice!

8d31ap,1,2018-04-18,"W-4 Questions for Future Internship, confused with dependent status and self employment income",JayWhyOkay,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8d31ap/w4_questions_for_future_internship_confused_with/,"To start the discussion, I am a full-time student and claimed as a dependent on my parent's tax return.

From mid-June to late August, I will be working at an internship and earning a total of roughly $6300. The location I am working at has requested a W-4 from me. Based on my initial research, my research tells  me to claim allowances of 0 due to me being a dependent. I would normally call it a day here, but some interesting things have come up.

I know I have to file my taxes for 2018 because my current part-time job considers me as a contractor and issues me a 1099-MISC at the end of the year (I am estimating $2000 on that form), since it's over the $400 threshold for self-employment work. I have filed a tax return in 2017 for the same part time job with roughly the same amount on my 1099-MISC.

What gets me more confused is the 2018 W-4 calculator on the IRS website. Typing in information that I believe applies to me on that calculator says that I should input 7 allowances. This conflicts with both the general advice of having 2 allowances for single, 1 job taxpayers or 0 for dependents.

I have never had a W-2 handed to me in any part of my life. I don't have any other deductible that I am aware of, other than whatever follows the self-employed forms.


I'm not expecting someone to hand me the straight answer (though, if you can, that'd be great). However, could someone point me to the right direction and help me decide how many allowances should I claim on my tax return? "

We don't know what stage, they need to perform more imaging, pet scan etc. Tomorrow I'm taking him to a great cancer treatment facility where some pretty cutting edge stuff is going on, but I'm just so ... unprepared I guess if this goes bad. 

He told me that what he cares about most is what I'm dong in school and with my life, he wants me to keep on and go to the MSW program no matter what. It's a very intense program at a pretty well known and challenging school that I'll need to commute to about 65 miles each way several days a week for academics and I'll intern the other week days probably a little closer to home.

I'm just freaking out, this is a really great person and I really love my dad and just... I have to find a way to keep going, it's just overwhelming to think of that full time program and him experiencing, failing health if God forbid that is what happens. I'm a strong person, I do think I could possibly soldier on, but it's going to at least be the most simultaneously emotionally hard and academically challenging time in my life. I do have support, I'm in recovery so a sponsor, friends, meetings and a family, but I'm an only child, my parents are divorced, and we all live across the city from eachother and LA is a big city, it all just adds to the stress. 

Worst case I can defer a year, but he wants me to stay in, and honestly I do too, it's just been a few weeks now and maybe this is a normal place for me to be in my head, really feeling uneasy.

Has anyone been in this situation or know someone who was, how did you do it? Any other thoughts please share. Keep your SW fingers crossed for him and send some good vibes please, thanks."

He’s the stereotypical boss’s son who took over the company when his dad retired. I don’t think he even has a college degree yet is in charge of people who work with millions of dollars on a daily basis. The way he words his emails makes him sound like a complete dumbass because doesn’t bother to check spelling or use complete sentences unless he’s talking to someone high up in the company. At the moment he’s slowly transitioning into this position but his dad is still involved in the company. 

As the rookie I’m always given the bitch work, which is fine. Usually people are respectful of me but my boss couldn’t care less. I get the understanding that he doesn’t care about anyone younger than him and sucks up to the older guys (I’m 23 and he’s in his early 30s) and that he doesn’t care about minorities. He hardly ever remembers my name and constantly asks me if we’ve met before or if I’m the new intern. There’s about 200 of us in our office with high turnover in some departments so I understand people can be unfamiliar but still it’s irritating. 

One of these side tasks is to distribute a certain report with comments from different execs. I'm a financial analyst but am given this task this because I understand the content more than the assistants, and someone has to do it and none of the older people want to. It doesn't take much time and most people don't read it anyways. Usually I just record a meeting where they go over this report and summarize it into a commentary on the corresponding parts. I usually end up asking a few questions over email as well. Most people look through the report but don’t care about the commentary. Think of it as watching a movie with the commentary on. You can usually figure out what’s happening for yourself. 

This particular story took place a week ago. I walked into the office one morning and my boss was standing there in a hallway, coffee in hand, staring at his phone. I said good morning and he looked at me, stared for a solid five seconds, took a sip, and then looked back down at his phone without saying a word. I would’ve been less upset if he hadn’t even looked up and pretended he didn’t hear. To make the morning worse, I came into the meeting where I take the commentary notes and he scolded me and said this was confidential information (not true) and I shouldn’t be in there. Another exec had to explain to him that I indeed am an employee and am supposed to be in said meeting. 

After the meeting I sent out my follow-up questions. This guy hardly contributed at  all to the meeting, so I had to request the basics from him. The responses were pure gold. Spelling errors left and right, but still very blunt answers. Usually my commentary includes equal length contribution from each exec (4 of them) and I format it to be cohesive. This time I was fed up. I purely copied and pasted his responses into this document and ended everything bad with [sic]. This is the notation for when the original quote is erroneous and the author is acknowledging it but not fixing it. Basically my report made him look like an idiot. It also showed that he didn’t say much in the meeting because the spelling would have had to been done over email. 

I fixed up everything else the other execs said, sent it out as an addition to the main report to all 200 some employees including my boss’s dad, then logged off my computer and left for my vacation without checking my email once since. I know he’s still in transition and everything he does and says is under review until his dad fully retires. 

I can’t wait to come back to work. 

TL;DR: My boss is rude to me so I made him look like an idiot by not correcting his spelling and grammar and adding [sic] behind everything in a widespread document. 

EDIT: Since everyone is criticizing me and saying I’ll get fired, I should probably clarify that this is not a major task at all. It’s probably comparable to sending around an update memo. I’m a financial analyst and spend all day running numbers and producing documents for those. The report I’m talking about here is basically an overview of the different projects the company is working on as a whole.

I’ll also give an example of what one section of commentary looked like. It wasn’t extreme sabotage, just subtle whenever I noticed a mistake. There were probably 30-40 sections of comments and [sic] was needed in a third. 

A: This project was halted on the 1st of March. 
B: We are still in contact with the appropriate personnel and are working on an exit strategy. 
C: Team 10 is moving on to project XYZ and are having trouble transitioning, which will be reviewed shortly. 
D (my boss): We should of canceled this earlier [sic]. 

I’ll let you all know how it goes once I get back Friday. 


UPDATE:

I’m actually amazed by how many people thought I was going to get fired or how many people thought that this was my main responsibility at work and that it would cause an uproar. Nobody really reads the commentary and they would hardly notice who said what unless they knew what they were looking for. Thus why I called it petty revenge. 

I returned to work this morning after my vacation. I walk in, am greeted by a few people who ask about my trip, and I go to my desk and catch up on emails and crank out some simulations over the next few hours. I didn’t have time at lunch to make an update. 

Around lunch time I asked a coworker who works in my department if he read the commentary. He said no. I told him to look at it and see what he thinks. He read it and said it’s fine. I asked if he noticed the [sic] and if that was too harsh. He chuckled and said “nah, -boss- is terrible at writing.”

I talked to the other execs on and off throughout the day with meetings and conference calls. When I had some one on one time with one of the guys I asked him if he got my commentary last week since I didn’t hear anything back and he said “yeah thanks for sending it out before you left!”

And that’s all I heard about it. "

8d5hbq,1,2018-04-18,Me [21/F] cant get over the guilt of ruining friendship with my ex-best friend [21/F] and I still check her socials. I want to move on.,gcpz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8d5hbq/me_21f_cant_get_over_the_guilt_of_ruining/,"So I was friends with this girl, we'll call her H for around 10 years. We went to high school together, and then sixth form, and she's the best friend I ever had. In our last year of sixth form, when we were 18, H got pregnant. Big scandal because we were all still so young but she decided to keep it and honestly I was happy for her.


Here's where I fuck it up. H was about to make the announcement but my impatient and excited self can't really keep secrets, so I confide in another mutual friend we've known for around 5 years about how H is pregnant and I'm really excited, but I'm scared and concerned for H about how she'll handle the pregnancy since around six months previously, she'd gotten pregnant and had a termination.

I know this was wrong. I was 17 and stupid and didn't understand the gravity of how much I'd just stabbed H in the back until later, when I got a text from H.


Turns out the mutual friend I thought I could trust had told another group of her friends not only that H was pregnant, but about her previous abortion too. I was so angry at the mutual friend and heartbroken and guilty that I just didn't reply. H had left sixth form to do an internship so there was no way to speak to her face to face and explain that I wasn't being malicious, so fast forward a few weeks of being too scared to talk to H about the situation, and I go on H's blog.


There's load of stuff about how I'm a terrible person, I'm scum, and she's afraid I'll hurt her and her child, even though I've always been anxious and shy rather than violent, so I'm sure she's gotten this twisted information from someone else or me neglecting to tell my side of the story has just led her to believe that I'm malicious and a danger to her.


I reached out to her and texted her around 6 months after this all happened, explaining, apologising, and wishing her the best of luck with the baby. I said that I didn't expect her to forgive me and didn't expect her to want me back in her life, but I wanted her to know that there was no bad blood and if we were ever to be in a situation with each other again, I wasn't a danger and there would be only love and kindness coming from me. She didn't reply, so I took that as a sign that it was over and finished between me and H, and that I probably deserved it.


I'm now 21, so it's been over three years, and I cant stop thinking about our friendship and getting sad. Sad I don't have anyone as close to me as she was any more, and that I missed out on meeting her family and seeing her kid grow. I check her socials probably every few days and I wish I could just gain some sort of closure, or a way to move on without closure. Since our friendship ended, all my old friends sided with her, and don't speak to me, and I've been put off making new friendships ever since, and I really want a way to just accept the situation, accept the guilt that I ruined it, and move on to be able to make new friendships.

Thanks for reading. 

TLDR: I told a mutual friend that my best friend was pregnant and she spread that info and now me and best friend aren't friends anymore. It's been 3 years and I want to learn how to live with the guilt and move on."

I'm a freshman in college and I'm spending every day completely alone, and honestly I think I'm going fucking ballistic. I broke up with my ex because while we loved each other, it was one of those ""right person wrong time"" things. I'm in college, she's in high school. But I can't move on because I'm so fucking worried; she doesn't have many friends and shit and has a shitty home situation. She also might have cancer again (she had stage one last year) and honestly I want to be there for her if she does. But the more I talk to her, the more I feel like I slowly kill both of us inside. I went back home and my closest friends seem to have changed, or I've changed, idk, but something seems off and I feel completely alone. I have an amazing opportunity as an intern for a job I love but it's stressing me out because it might be the only opportunity I have, if I fuck it up then I don't know what I'll do. 

But I noticed that my problems all stem from one thing: my extreme insecurity/extremely horrible self esteem. I'm just incapable of believing in myself. 

I've heard compliments, especially in recent years. I'm good at what I do, I'm nice and funny, whatever. But for some reason the only person who can't love me is myself. I just don't see anything good about myself, and I just hate everything there is to about me. If you ask me I can make a list of all of my flaws, but I'll have a hard time making a list of things I like about myself.

I honestly think this shit stems from growing up around a group of friends who didn't give a fuck about each other: all we'd do is make fun of each other, and you were ostracized if you had life problems and showed it. I got made fun of a lot, and it became a part of me. I got bullied, in short. But part of me feels like I don't deserve to be a depressed fuck right now. I know I need actual professional help rn, but I seriously question the validity of my problems. Like, other people go through WAY WORSE shit, why am I sitting here moping? I don't deserve to be upset, to be sad, to be fucking miserable. 

The way I grew up affects how I am today. I don't know who I am, I've always been defined by the words of assholes. I still think I'm fat as fuck (I used to be pretty overweight as a kid), and my body image is down in the dumps. I tend to put myself down a lot because it's how I dealt with people back then, but it's bleeding into my life in which people I just meet notice that I have shit confidence. I get extremely defensive at things people say even though it wasn't meant to be an attack towards me, but I'm so used to being scared of people and words that I automatically assume everyone who says anything a little negative towards me is trying to attack me. 

I want to love myself. I can't, and it ruined so many things. It ruined my social life. It ruined the only good relationship I've had. It ruins any chance of me taking an opportunity for something amazing, all because I just can't believe in myself. 

Not being able to love myself, to be confident with myself, as ruined my life in every aspect. I don't know where to go from here. I'm just camping out until the end of the semester so I can transfer out of this shitty college and go to the university I've always wanted. to. I'm tired of feeling alone as shit and questioning everything. 

Sorry for such a long post, I've been holding this shit in for so long. "

Been together 4 years. Lived together 3. Communication about sex is awful and leads to arguments. I do a lot to try to make things better. She doesn't. Sex once a month. I'm not satisfied. What do?

I'll try to keep this as short as I can, but I know that even then this post will be longer than I would like. First of all, it should be noted that this is a throwaway account because a lot of IRL friends and my GF keep up with my usual posts.

Where to begin?

My background:
This is my (M22 HL) 5th relationship or so. My 3rd ""serious"" one. The first one I had during my (a private religious) highscool. Broke up with me after feeling guilty about the one time we sexted and then used that as a valid reason to cheat on me with my best friend. The second relationship, also in highschool, was my first experience with actual sexual encounters (I recieved a few handjobs and gave her oral). I ended that one because my family was encouraging me to date around while I was young, and I felt guilt over my religious background. Queue relationship 3. This is her (F20 LL). I'm only her second BF. The first one cheated on her after a few months, and she likes to pretend that it didn't even happen. So in that aspect, it's almost like I'm her first.

Our Background:
We were high school sweethearts my senior year of high school. Had a picture perfect love story. Were each other's first time having sex, so I guess we lost our virginity to each other after a few months of dating. We took it seriously. I was going to college that fall, and so for the year we were together before that, everything was perfect. Sex and all. Then I left for school and we tried long distance. It was hard. I hated it. We argued, but we made it through. Every time I would come home to visit (about once a month) we would have very passionate sex.

She ended up going to the same school as me. I got a job as an RA, to get rid of my shitty roommate, and she moved in with me. Then it started going downhill. I noticed she never initiated, and we never tried anything new. It was always hard to get her to orgasm, and even at this time, she only rarely did. She never masturbated. Only twice in her life. Once when she was curious as a kid, and then again after an argument where I regretably pressured her into it so she could ""get to know herself"" because I felt as though maybe she just didn't know what she liked yet. We still had sex... occasionally, but less often. I got tired of feeling like I was doing all the work. Its made even harder when she turned me down. Eventually we had an argument about how she never initiated and I told her I was done initiating. I thought this would make things better. Of course, it turns out, that just means we'll never have sex at all. We had sex around once a month with my initiation anyway. She found out I masturbated and wasn't telling her. She was offended. But eventually ""came to terms with it"". No! You aren't supposed to be alright with that! I would say in my head.

That summer we moved into an apartment together and the problems continued. By this time, we were together for 3 years. 2 were living together. Our arguments got worse, and worse. To the point where I started seeing a therapist for my ""anger issues"" and resulting depression. I did this to prove I was trying to be better for her, and hopefully make her more comfortable with me in hopes that maybe I was turning her off from sex altogether with all of this. Well, the campus therapist was shit. Maybe I got the wrong idea about therapists, but I needed someone to tell me to get out of the relationship. But he seemed to just sat there and went ""mmmhhm, yeah. Tell me about that"" so I spent all this time just telling some dude about my shit relationship without him ever giving me advice on what to do. Anyway. I stopped going once I realized that my expectations to have a good sexual relationship are nontrivial and I had a right to be a little upset. I'm not happy jerking off.

Things I have done:
I lurk DB and r/sex often and try to find other people's solutions and make more effective communication with my partner. But starting conversations leads to her getting defensive and feeling attacked. I really try to have calm respectful conversations about sex. But she gets instantly defensive and it almost always leads to an attitude of disrespect when she feels like I'm ""attacking her"" when I'm really just telling her what I would like. So below are some attempts to break the ice that have ended in arguments.

I downloaded the ""Periodic Table of Kink"" and asked that we mark them up and rank things as ""into it, not my thing but would consider trying if you were into it, and never ever going to ever try that ever no matter what."" I was open minded about my kinks and things I wanted to try. The table mostly reflected that. Hers was completely marked off except for a few open spots on the ""vanilla"" column. My disappointment and shock lead to an argument.

Asked how often she thought was healthy for a couple to have sex together. (once a month she says). She was tearning up before I got the question out. Just knowing it was a conversation about sex made her defensive enough to cry. This insulted me an lead to an argument.

Encouraged her to watch porn or research how to do certain things to help please me in bed. (You know, like instead of a dry deathgrip handjob, maybe google ""how to give a good handjob"" instead.) I don't tell her outright that what she's doing is bad because I don't want to insult her, but I strongly encourage her to research things and get interested in things at every opportunity. No direct arguments from this, but it's obvious she never has never ever done what I suggested. This does come up from time to time in other arguments. How much it would mean to me if she would put in even this little bit of effort.

I attempted the NoFap challenge. Went 3 months without the expectation of sex or masturbation to see if we could focus on other problems during that time. Probably the best time in our relationship since that first summer. Because it turns out, aside from sex, there are no other problems and I really do love her. The whole time though I built up this expectation that we would have something really good when it was over. She was on birth control, and I was hoping she would keep up with it. I told her this. Of course, when the time came for us to start having sex again after 3 months of abstinence... Oops! She couldn't have been bothered to keep up with it that week. Super disappointing. Had an argument.

Suggested an open relationship under the assumption that she's perfect in every other way, but I need to have my needs met because I want to be happy too, and I meet all her needs, but she never meets mine. I love her, but I need the sexual satisfaction and emotional connection. As anyone would expect, this did not go over well. I have kinks, I have needs, and I have things I want to try that I know she's not open to, and don't want to force those things upon her.

Things she has done:
She once entertained a kink of mine. I told her I wanted her to be submissive while I be dominant. We established boundaries. I was careful not to go over them. During aftercare, I asked if she liked it and she told me yes. It was obvious she didn't though, because she never made an effort to be submissive. (see ""googling"" above) She just expected me to do all the work and tell her exactly what to do and when like a robot. No effort to play along on her part beyond complying when I said ""do this.... okay now do this... okay now this...."" which isn't what I was expecting. She told me later that she hated it and only did it because she felt as though she had to or else I would leave her. ""Why did you tell me you liked it when I asked?"" I asked.
""Because that's what you needed to hear"" she replied. Talk about crushing.

In four years together, she initiated once. A few months ago. Of course, this was another one of those times in which she ""initiates"" but doesn't really have a plan. Doesn't really want anything from me, just wants me to tell her exactly what I want so I can get my physical needs met, she's not really participating. Regardless, I asked her what made her want to do it, and told her it would be great if she could do it more often. She never did again.

The summer is coming up again. She has an internship. I don't. She has to move and she expects me to move with her, but for the first time in years I have the opportunity to leave. This is the last month for things to get better. If things aren't better by May 14th, I'm either going to stay with my lease and let her move, essentially breaking up with her, or flat out inform her we're done having sex together, cram an open relationship down her throat, and let the relationship desolve that way. I don't really know what to do.

Had a conversation with her this morning and asked ""Please be honest, I can take it if you are... Are you sexually attracted to me?"" To which she said yes.
""Then why don't I feel like you are?"" I ask
""You tell me""
*Proceed to tell her*
""Well I am"" she says.
""I feel like I'm masturbating with your body.""
She got offended by that. And I guess she has a right to be. But I don't think it'll make any difference."
8d6oub,1,2018-04-18,Arguments about meeting friends of opposite gender (M25/F25),agermanguy,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/8d6oub/arguments_about_meeting_friends_of_opposite/,"Hey,

I would like some advice on how to handle me meeting friends of the opposite gender and my girlfriend's reaction to it. It could very well be that I am totally in the wrong here and maybe I can get some perspectives. Either way, I would be happy for advice on how to approach this topic with her.

I have been in a LDR with my Korean girlfriend for over 2 years now. I really want us to live together as soon as possible but alas, it still seems quite far away if I think realistically. In those 2 years we were only able to spend a total of 3 months together, hopefully again this Fall. We Skype every day for multiple hours and constantly stay in contact via messages.

I am very introvert and don't have many social outlets outside of my girlfriend. However, during my semester abroad in Korea last fall (ironically one month after my arrival my GF went to Europe for her Master studies, she dropped out though for financial reasons and is back in Korea...), I  met a Korean girl as a language partner once a week. My girlfriend knew about it and was extremely upset about the idea of meeting her and I assured her we were just studying which is true (she did propose other plans like hiking but I refused when my GF got upset over it). She also got upset frequently when I went out to drink with other students  or met other Korean female friends. That kind of made me question things a lot because I finally went a bit out of my shell and met other people and she seemed very scared about the idea of me becoming more outgoing and meeting other people. So it's not just that one specific person which would make it more understandable and I would be willing to reduce or cut contact in that case but so far just the idea of being one-on-one with other women is anbig issue to her.
So that semester abroad nearly made us break up but in the end we reconciled when she returned to Korea and tried to find some compromises. My GF even met my friend when we went to dinner together but afterwards she told me meeting her made her feel even worse. Actually, after my semester abroad I continued language exchange via messages and calling once a week for questions and corrections for convenience but when I told my GF she asked me to stop and stick to messages.

Anyway, cut to today. That language partner which I consider one of my few friends now is visiting Germany and asked me to meet for a day to do some language exchange and sightsee around my city. I brought it up to my girlfriend (after we reconciled she said it's okay to meet her if she visits although I already doubted that) and she was furious. She hates the idea of me spending time with other women (especially Korean) and experiencing things we experienced together in my city, or even worse, making experiences she didn't yet have with me.

I totally understand how hard the LDR is to her and how it sucks if we are so far together and another person, especially of the opposite gender, gets to spend time with your loved ones. I understand that it is very upsetting. 

However, I never gave her a reason to doubt me, I am always upfront and update her regularly what I am doing etc, we are truly in constant contact. The past few months I never went out except for company related events during my internship, so to me it feels unfair and controlling that she wants me to give up on meeting one of my few friends for one day on the rare chance she is in Germany. I mean, I would totally understand the issue with meeting another woman regularly for no real reason but just meeting once to practice language, sightsee a bit and catch up? That seems too much I feel I am being too submissive. I feel I need to take a stand and thus I told her I will meet her and to be more trusting etc.

TLDR: Meeting female friend to catch up and do language exchange. Girlfriend upset. How to handle it?

Has anybody had similar experiences and could give me advice? Or perhaps I am selfish since she obviously is really hurt by me meeting her but I still told her I will do it? I know that the easy solution would be to cancel meeting the friend but I feel I shouldn't encourage that and ""instead take a stand""? 

Thank you!

I have a bit of experience thanks to an internship, but every entry level position I apply for says they want someone to begin working right now and that I don't have enough experience.
Is there something different I should be doing or should I just go to grad school and try to find another internship?
Any advice would be great since I'm beginning to worry, and wonder if I'll ever get hired at this point."

This is a temporary account, since my main might be recognized by my friends and family.

In 2016, I worked under my mom as an intern, and I earned $1000 for the entire year. She gave me a single check of $1000 during August 2016. I was a full time student at that time attending university, so my parents most likely claimed me as a dependent for the 2016 tax year.

However, I did not file taxes and did not report that I earned $1000 in 2016, because I was told that a dependent who made under ~$5k did not have to file.

Now, my upcoming 2018 summer internship is doing a background check, and the company that they are using are requiring a paystub, tax form, etc. for proof of employment.

However, the income I earned was in Georgia, and far as I know, Georgia does not require a paystub, and I obviously do not have my tax form for 2016.

So 2 questions:

1. Do I still have to file 2016 taxes?

2. For the background check, my mom found her bank statement where it shows that a check was taken out. I also found my own bank statement where it shows I received a check of $1000, but it does not state my mom's company. Will this be enough proof?

Thank you everyone for reading!"

It's slowly sucking my life away from me, but I'm close to being done and it would be a waste of my parent's time and money if I dropped out now. 
The administrative office promised me that I'd find a decent internship at a place where I could start my career, but it isn't working out.  30 of us are still jobless.  Last year, only 10 students were unemployed at this time.  I don't want to work for the same start-up company with no potential for growth.

I'm exhausted from the relationships I've built.  I have been transparent and honest about my experiences, my life, and interests.  While others don't exactly do the same.  I try so hard to let my SO know that he is my top priority but I feel like I come fourth place at times.  Some of his actions make me question his loyalty.  He doesn't answer some personal questions upfront, even when I approach it lightly.  Sometimes he unintentionally makes me feel bad about my appearance.  When I inform him of this, he will steer the conversation away from my concerns and talk about his hardships.  I often suspect that he only wants me around until he finds someone more suitable.

I regret giving my dog away (to someone reputable and able) because I didn't have the time or capacity to raise him properly (due to school). I never felt so much love and joy until I brought him home, no matter how short it was.  That was the last time I was truly happy in the past year."

Advice for a soon-to-be grad?,cerealrus3,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/8d8sta/things_not_looking_too_good_advice_for_a_soontobe/,"Finishing up my last term and graduating with a BS in ChemE from a top 10 school. Applying to jobs left and right but to no avail... because my GPA is horrible and I don't have any internships...


How bad you might ask?
Cumulative: 2.66
Upper Division: 2.88 

Probably going to finish with ~2.72 and ~2.95, respectively.



I had a rough start to my undergrad, which pretty much screwed me for the rest of my time at university (both academics and motivation). I couldn't get into research because of my grades, and for the same reason, couldn't get internships. The only thing I have are a few part-time jobs to pay for groceries and bills (albeit one of them is tech-y).


Does the ranking of the college really matter (i.e. would anyone look at my application and say ""Oh that's a good school, maybe I can give him a little more wiggle room grade-wise?"". I'm wondering what kind of advice anyone has aside from just shotgun-ing applications? Any sources that a graduating senior can use to find a job that doesn't require experience, seeing as most entry-level jobs always ask for some? Alternative job titles I can look for that can eventually lead me into a ChemE or process engineering job in a couple years? Can I apply to jobs that have a 3.0 cumulative cut-off or ask for 1-2 years of experience?


I'm really trying to get a job ASAP so I can start mid-July (graduation is mid-June and I'm probably going to find a place to relocate to)


Thanks in advance everyone, anything helps :)

8d8vr7,166,2018-04-18,My New Life,OwnKindheartedness7,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8d8vr7/my_new_life/,"It’s been a tough few months since I split with Eric. We had been together over two years, first in college, then in NYC after we graduated. We had some great times, and some great sex. Met him at a Halloween party thrown by a mutual friend. Who goes to a Halloween party in a pink speedo, and says he’s Tom Dailey? Well…Eric did. I not only admired his smoking hot body, but the ease at which he carried himself practically naked in front of a bunch of gay guys. I wasn’t the only one hitting on him, but we clicked and ended up back in my apartment. It honestly rivaled some of the best sex of my life, as we grunted, strained, rolled and pawed each other. I talked him into staying the night, and fucked him again in the morning. Within 2 weeks he had moved in.

The warning signs were all there, but of course, I ignored them. In the fall, the frequency of sex began to decline. For well over a year, we fucked almost every night and every morning. Weekends could go more. He’d give me that “come hither” look, over his shoulder, and leave for the bedroom. I’d be hard before I hit the bedroom door. I’d awake to his hand or mouth working my morning wood, and we’d go at it again. On more than one occasion, I’d walk by the kitchen and see him at the sink, his cute ass inviting me, and take him right there. In other words, the sex was outstanding.

The first problem arose in October. I slid into bed next to his perfect naked sleeping body, nuzzled his neck, and ran my hand across and down his muscled smooth chest while my cock nested between his sweet ass cheeks. He said he was tired and had a headache, and could we wait until the morning. That had never happened. I rolled on my back, my cock still hard as a rock. Figured if I started to jerk off, he’d get interested, and least help me out. I figured wrong. He never even rolled over and watched me. I stared at his soft ass, the curve of his waist, and spewed all over myself. It was the first time I’d jerked off in ages. Eric had always been there for me. 

He told me he was under huge stress at work, and was piling up the hours at night and on weekends. I was falling asleep alone, only to awake at some late hour as he slipped into the bed. Sex went from daily, to 3x a week, to once a week if I was lucky. I took him out for a romantic dinner on Halloween (our anniversary), and rather than the expected result, a wild reenactment of our first time, (I’d even found his pink Speedo and put it under his pillow for later) we ended up in the biggest fight of our life. I told him I needed him more physically, and he told me I needed to support him emotionally. He told me I was using him as my own personal “cumdump”. 

I bought him a makeup present, flowers and made him dinner. He texted me he had to stay late at the office at 7:00 just as I was finishing dinner. I ate alone and brooded, then wrapped up a plate for him, left him a note saying I was sorry about Halloween, and telling him his dinner was in the oven. I heard the door shut around 11:30, his shoes on the hardwood as he walked to the table, and the silence as he read the note. The oven door creaked open and closed, the footsteps started again. The bedroom door opened, and he whispered “I’m so sorry, too.” The next 45 minutes was as passionate sex romp as we had ever had. I kissed and licked every each of his perfect body, and he reciprocated. I fucked in every conceivable position, and he urged me on. When he tensed up, made that cute little noise he always made when he came, the crescendo flowed from my core like a Roman Candle. I just held him as he stroked my back, and stared into my eyes, still lodged deep inside him. I felt we were back. 

I cleaned up quickly, and went and got him his plate, and a glass of wine. When I returned, he was giggling like old times. I asked him what was so funny, and he pulled the hand towel away from his ass. “You’re still leaking. I’ve never seen so much cum” he said with a sly smile. He wolfed down his dinner naked in bed. I admired his perfect physique, then cleaned up the remains and fell asleep with him in my arms. “We’re back”, I thought. 

Unfortunately, we slid right back in the “I’m too tired for sex” routine. I felt anger over having to constantly ask for it, when I never had to before.  It was Tuesday, December 12 at 7: 00. I had decided to “woo” him again, made dinner, and put his favorite music on. The text came in 5 minutes later. “Stuck until 9:00 at least”. 
I decided to pack it up and surprise him with a nice meal at his office. 

Derek the Doorman waved me through with a smile. His law offices were to die for. An old renovated Brownstown, his office was on the third floor. The only light was from Eric’s office, the other four were black. Hoped the partners knew how much harder he was working than his peers, I thought. I heard voices, and I paused, thinking maybe this was a bad idea. Eric told me everyone accepted him as gay, and often asked how I was doing. They had always seemed friendly to me as well, so I opened the door.

Eric was on his knees, with the new intern Jon’s cock in his mouth. Jon’s button-down shirt was open, and one of his hands was moving from nipple to nipple, the other on the nape of Eric’s neck, guiding his cock into him. 

The sound of food crashing to the floor caused Jon’s eyes to fly open, and Eric’s head to whip around. Both had the fear of God look on their faces. I just turned and bolted; my heart racing, and my stomach about to regurgitate whatever was in it.  I flew back to the apartment, packed as much of my shit as I could, and texted one of my friends for a space on their couch. 

I was devastated, and cried like a baby in Paul’s arms, as his husband James just held my hand. The texts started coming, and I ignored him. I didn’t get a wink of sleep, and bolted upright at 3 in the morning. There was a bottle of lube on Eric’s desk. No doubt Jon was going to fuck the little slut after Eric got him primed. But, there was no condom. Fucker had been barebacking and then fucking me bareback. I was at the LBGTQ health center when the doors opened. Fortunately, everything came back negative. 

I stayed with Paul and James through New Year’s, and got a new apartment (and roommate) in early January. I still hadn’t spoken to Eric, and did not intend to. Paul had cleaned out the rest of my crap for me. 

January, February, and early March slipped by as wallowed in my misfortune. Angie, (my roommate) couldn’t have been better at supporting me. Even her super -macho boyfriend Rocco (who fucking names their child Rocco? He’s not even Italian) was empathetic and supporting. Rocco informed me I was going to a St. Patrick’s party at his cousin’s in Brooklyn. Told me, didn’t ask me. I told him I really didn’t feel up to schlepping all the way the fucking Park Slope to hang with a bunch of straight people I didn’t know. He gave me a crooked smile. “They’re not all straight, which is why I want you to go.” I rolled my eyes. Was I really that pathetic? Rocco pulled out his phone, scrolled through, then thrust it at me. That’s him on the far left. They were on a beach somewhere, Rocco on the far right, Angie next with her arm around Rocco’s waist, her tits spilling out of her micro-bikini, a tall smiling guy next, and finally him. “He’s my cousin Adrian, whose having the party”. Adrian? Adrian and Rocco? What was with this fucking family and names?

I just stared at him. He was stunning. His hair slightly too long. Beautiful blonde tresses parted in the middle that spilled over his ears down to his jawline. His eyes appeared blue, but hard to tell from the distance. Fine dimple lines highlighted his dazzling smile. His chest was smooth and tan with the perfect amount of delineation of his pecs and abs. Below his blue shorts, his legs appeared muscled and downy with light hair. I asked who the other guy was as I handed him back his phone. “his fucktard ex” Rocco muttered with disdain. “No, I meant the stud on the end next to Angie. I’d date him.” It took Rocco a split second before it sunk in I was kidding, and he punched me a little too hard in the arm. “So you’ll go?”  Wild horses wouldn’t keep me away from meeting this guy. “Sure” I said with a shrug. 
Angie gave me the inside skinny later that night. Adrian just found out the douchebag next to him was still fucking his college ex on the side. I told her he wouldn’t last long on the open market, and how gorgeous I thought he was. She snuggled up next me like the sister I’d never had. Yeah, well he is even more beautiful inside. You two will really hit it off. I made him promise not to see anybody until he meets you. 

I was nervous as fuck. I think I’m attractive, but Adrian is seriously model material. I was afraid he’d be let down when he met me. I made Adrian show me the picture of me she had shown him. I looked good. Too fucking good in my opinion. I made her promise to show him more pictures, of the “normal me”. She said she would. 

We arrived “fashionably late”. Adrian was in the kitchen, pulling food out and looking harried in a powder blue apron. He looked up and spied us, broke into that perfect smile, gave Rocco a hug, then Angie, then a more casual “lean in, pat the back, head above shoulder” hug, with a cheerful “Patrick. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you.” He pulled back, pointed to the keg on the small patio outside, and told us to throw our coats on his bed upstairs. 

His space was small, but impeccably decorated, and nothing with Ikea on it. This shit was some serious coinage. I went back downstairs, and offered to help him. He seemed pleased, and I ferried food to the living room, and empty plates back. He was a natural conversationalist, and my jitters quickly allayed. We talked, sipped beer, do a few chores, then repeat. I caught Angie out of the corner of my eye, staring at us. She had a huge grin, and hands clasped tightly over her mammoth breasts. She was so excited, she was rising up and down on her tiptoes. I leaned into Adrian, caught a light whiff of a sensuous scent, and whispered “Don’t look now, but I think Tevye is about to have an orgasm” I was impressed he got my obscure “Fiddler on the Roof” matchmaker reference, when he glanced over and said “better get over there and tell her any pussy juice gets on the carpet, she’s paying to clean it up.” I don’t know why at the time I found that so serious, but I thought I would cry I was laughing so hard.

Angie dragged Rocco into the kitchen, and started untying Adrian’s apron. “Rocco and I have this for a while, you guys need to go take a walk away from this noise so you can get to know each other.” And then shooed us out of the kitchen. 

We ambled slowly through down the street. As we neared Prospect Park, the noise abated. We were still talking about nothing, when he stopped and said, “Sorry if I seem weird or nervous, been a long time since I’ve been setup with someone.” I had a little life, “You? My last time was Agnes Nelson in the 8th grade”. That made him laugh. We sat on a bench at the edge of the park. 

“So I hear your ex really fucked up big time”, he said looking at the grass, then at me for a reply. “Who? Dickbreath?” His jaw dropped, then he smile flashed. “Dickbreath? You call him Dickbreath?” I said “I do now. Seems appropriate since the last time I saw him he smoking an intern’s fuckstick.” Adrian slowly shook his head, and with a laugh told me I had a great way with words. 

I got the lowdown on Adrian’s ex, and it was equally not pretty. He looked at his phone and popped up suddenly. “Holy Crap! We’ve been out here over an hour!” we hurried back to his “neglected”, none of whom seemed to have noticed our absence, and all of whom were well on their way to total shit-face-dom. 

It was well after 3:00AM when the 4 of us finished cleaning up the mess. We assured Adrian it had been an epic party. Rocco pulled out his phone to get an Uber back to Manhattan, and Adrian told him to just crash at his place. He looked at Angie, told her the sheets were clean on his bed, but if they weren’t in the morning she’d have to wash them, with a wink and smile. She asked about us, and he said I could take the couch, and he had a blow-up for himself on the floor. 

I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth with a borrowed brush, when he walked by and leaned against the jam. He was in just a pair of light loose pajama bottoms. They hung low on his hips, bowed down across his abs, the vee of his abs disappearing behind him. He looked even hotter than the picture. “I hope you had as good of a time as I did tonight.” My eyes on him in the mirror, darted up from his sculpted chest. “I really did. Nice to put the shit behind and you. Feel like I can move forward for the first time in a long time.” His face seemed to relax. I spit out the toothpaste. “Your Ex has to be the dumbest shitass on the planet”. He seemed to be uncomfortable when I added, “You are truly the whole deal. Funny, nice, smart, and fucking hot as fuck.” So I told him I was sorry if that made him uncomfortable, but for sure his ex was a dumbfuck. He said, “Thanks, Hope he finds Dickbreath, because they deserve each other.” 

I pulled off my shirt, and pulled the blanket on the couch back. I glanced over to see him checking me out. “Try to workout as much as I can, but don’t hold a candle to you” I said apologetically. He smiled “How did you put it? Fucking hot as fuck?” I mumbled a thanks and pulled the covers over me. “You tired? Or you want have just one more beer? It’s ok if you want to sleep.” I sat up, and told him I’d love to have another beer. 

The unmistakeable cadence of a bed headboard tapping against the wall accompanied by the squeak of the coils spilled down the stairs. “Guess someone’s doing laundry, in the morning” I said with a smile. “He shook his head, “I really didn’t think they’d do it, I was just joking”.  I looked at the ceiling as the thumps increased in pace and loudness. “Won’t be long now” I said looking at the clock on my phone. There was a soft high pitched moan from Angie, and I turned my head to Adrian, whose eyebrow was lifted as he listened. I then mouthed “Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!” to Angie’s voice, followed shortly by Rocco’s low pitched groan. 

“All done” I said to Adrian’s laughter. We talked another hour, and 5 AM was approaching. I told Adrian we should turn in. He stared at me. “Would it be ok if I kissed you goodnight?” OK? Was he fucking kidding me? I put my hand on his bare waist, and leaned in and brushed my lips against his, I felt his hand lightly caress my chin, and his lips parted and his tongue light pressed for entrance into my mouth. I relented, and our tongues danced. His hands moved to my back, leaned back and pulled me prone on top of him, as we kept kissing passionately. His chest was hard against mine, his soft skin warm against mine. My cock was rapidly inflating in an uncomfortable position, pinned down my inseam. I felt Adrian harden in his looser pajamas, and press into my stomach. “ I pulled back, and told him I needed to adjust, or I risked breaking off my favorite appendage, then sat up to give my hard cock the space it needed. I felt Adrian’s hand on my thigh. “Let me help”. I tingled when he moved to my belt and unbuckled it. He unzipped my and opened my pants. His hand slipped into my boxers, and across my pubes. He wrapped my boy, and slid him up to a normal position. He looked at me with a stare. “Is this too fast?” 

I just dove into that sexy face, and slid my hand down his pajamas, and wrapped around his warm hard cock. I kissed down his perfect chest in search of his dick. I tugged on the drawstring, and he raised his hips as I pulled them off and discarded them. There he was in all his fucking incredible naked glory. He was perfect. I dove on his cock with a vengeance, determined to suck his soul and very essence out of him. We moved to the floor, and his talented mouth went to work on mine. I knew I was close, and told him, he said the same, so I went into overdrive until he briefly pulled away, whispered “oh my fucking God”, and began to filled my mouth with his warm tasty seed. He relaxed and went back down on me, and I quickly exploded as well. 

We feel asleep naked on the blowup mattress in each other’s arms. I awoke spooned against Adrian, my morning wood pressed against his soft ass. I lightly kissed the nape of his neck, and traced my fingers around his sexy nipple. “Morning beautiful.”

We both jumped when Adrian’s voice filled the room. “Well somebody got to be close friends pretty fast” she said with a gloating, knowing sneer, her arms floded under the continental shelf she called tits. Adrian groaned. “So, my cousin is the only one that deserves some hot sex?” he chided her. “and remember, you owe me some clean sheets”. She huffed. “Got Rocco on that right now.” 

I couldn’t take my eyes off Adrian as we all sipped coffee. When Rocco got an Uber, he pulled me aside and asked me to stay a while. As soon as they left, he grabbed me kissed me hard, and said “Let’s go mess up those sheets again.” 

It was a top ten orgasm. He was a born bottom, and told me exactly what he wanted me to do, and turned me on by telling me how fucking good a fuck I was. We showered together, enjoyed one more orgasm together, and I went home.

I couldn’t stop thinking about him. It has been an incredible month with Adrian. We get together almost every night, and I’ve spent more time sleeping in Brooklyn than Manhattan. Last night after some incredible sex, he asked me if I’d move in with him. The U-haul is booked for Saturday.

8d98oi,3,2018-04-18,"I've been buying the shittiest androids for a few years because It's just a phone, but now I need a (hopefully) budget phone",not21forayear-_-,PickAnAndroidForMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/PickAnAndroidForMe/comments/8d98oi/ive_been_buying_the_shittiest_androids_for_a_few/,"Hi, so I've only owned 3 phones, the first one was a budget LG that I don't remember, but it was pretty popular for my carrier (metro pcs) at the time. Had to upgrade because when they switched to T-mobiles network it wouldn't work anymore, and got the phone that was free for me (LG Leon) which was awful. Eventually bought my current phone, HTC Desire 626s. I've had it since October 2016 and it's been crashing since I bought it , lol. I put up with it because it was $80 and realistically, I just need it to call and text and it takes ok pictures. I do use apps alot especially browser + social media so it's frustrating when they don't work/are slow/ can't update, but I always shrugged it off as ""I don't NEED those, and I can use a desktop if I really need to check"". However, recently I've been moving up in an internship and my phone has been crashing A LOT lately (recently deleted all my contacts and a lot but not all of my info) and it's embarrassing that my e-mails won't always come in, calendars won't sync and update well, don't have space to download apps I need (despite deleting all of my apps except spotify and a period tracker lol). 

Basically I need a phone that is in the USA, easily streamlined (ease of syncing calendars + email), will actually work, and unlocked so I can put it on MetroPCS. I would LOVE to have a decent camera if possible. I also would prefer it to be on the lower price range, around ~$200 if possible, willing to go up, but not willing to go up to the level of phones like the Pixel or Galaxy s8 cause at that point I'd rather just buy an iphone because I prefer them."

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

(Xposted to careerguidance ),thepurplekitten,humanresources,https://www.reddit.com/r/humanresources/comments/8d9lnf/should_i_take_the_internship_or_stay_where_i_am/,"I am currently a full time online student, studying Business Administration in HR Management (about to be in my Junior year). I have also been working full time as a bank Teller for the last three years. 
I really like my current job. I am comfortable there, they let me do homework during down time, and they even offer tuition reimbursement. However if you leave within two years of them giving you assistance, you have to pay some or all of it back.  Luckily I have been putting everything they reimburse me in a separate savings account, just in case I leave. 

I recently interviewed for an HR internship. It is paying about what I make now, and will be for about 2.5 months. However it is full time and I would have to quit my current job. I really need experience in my field of study. I’m afraid I will graduate and no one will want to hire me because of lack of experience. 
My husband makes enough to cover the bills without my income, but we’d have to make some sacrifices. I’m just afraid I quit my job that I really like, do the internship, and then struggle to find a job once it’s over, or get stuck accepting a job that is not as good as my current job.

Basically I could really use some advice. If someone who has gone through this before could share their experiences and recommendations, I’d really appreciate it. "

Where should I look?,AffectionateTwo,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/8d9og6/moving_to_nyc_and_apartment_hunting_where_should/,"After months of trying, I've finally managed to land an internship in the city. I'm so excited! Anyway, I'm from out of state and have about a month to look for apartments before the internship starts in mid May. I'm planning on flying out and staying in an AirBNB for a week or two beforehand so I can apartment hunt. 

Can you guys help me figure out which neighborhoods I should look into? The office is located between Lower Manhattan and Tribeca, so if I want a short commute I guess  I'll be looking at apartments somewhere in Brooklyn. My budget is $800-1200/month, and I don't mind sharing an apartment, but I'd prefer not having a shared room. I'd also like to live in an area with other people in their 20s, and with decent access to restaurants and an active cultural scene, though not necessarily parties.

Where should I look?

Edit: More information. The office is at 7th Ave and W 27th St. I’m looking to sublet for the first few months. I will be making $18/hr., but will probably pick up a part time job on the side. Ideally the commute would be 30min to an hour, but please let me know if I’m being too optimistic about that."

8db1wr,3,2018-04-18,Need Advice? I am a 21 year old male. Last April i broke up with my girlfriend of two and half years. How to move on?,anonyruag01,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8db1wr/need_advice_i_am_a_21_year_old_male_last_april_i/,"We started dating when I was 18 and we were really happy. She was a really intelligent girl. After one year of living together in the same city, she had to move abroad to complete her studies. I was in a decent college in my home country but the time difference of her country and my country was 12 hours. So her studies and her career were getting affected due to this. We remained in an LDR for one and a half years. Then in December 2016, I decided to take the tough step and asked her to break up with me because I was really worried about her health and her studies. I didn't think that I could be as successful as she was about to be. So for her own betterment, I decided to end it on 21st December. But in a few days we both realized that it was not helping either one of us. We both cried a lot and then decided to get back together in January during 10 days. Things were back to normal but then on 2nd April 2017 she decided to end things for once and all.

 She didn't know the reason why I ended things in December. And she just told me that we have no future in April.

In June I came to know that she already has a new boyfriend which just destroyed me completely.

In the past I had seen a hell lot of my friends completely destroying their life due to a failed relationship. So I decided that I will not be that guy. So I asked my female friends what should I do and all of them told me that the best way to get over a relationship is either success or being in a new relationship. So I was depressed and I was studying my ass off since the break up. I decided to spend the summer term in college and just kept on studying. All I used to do was study and cry. Then on September 16, I finally got an internship in Microsoft. I'm a mechanical engineering student but I wanted a career in tech and I got it within 5 months of hard work. 

And the first thing I did was call my sister, then my parents and then her. We had blocked each other so I sent her a mail and ask her to not reply. Till date I don't know if she even read that mail. The success made my parents really happy but I was still the same inside. So I decided to talk to other girls. I installed tinder and started talking to a few girls. And by December 2017 I realized that even this is childish.

I'm still very much sad. Yeah now I do not want her to enter my life again coz I know that things will never be the same as before. I have made my peace with a life without her but I need advice what should I do to move on completely? How can I end this suffering? I seriously loved her and all it took her was 70 days to find a new guy. Yeah I know that it was my fault in December to end things but I really thought it was a mistake that could have been forgiven for the love and caring we shared for each other.

P.S. I also need advice on whether I should meet her someday? I told my mom everything and she said that just use this experience as a lesson and make her realize what she has lost. Reach heights in your own career and then you can go and meet her.

I know that if I would have taken more mature decisions, life would have been much better. The only reason I broke up initially was because I thought that It will take me time to reach US and I should not drag her career down.  Little did I know that life will get me into the second biggest company of the world in months or else I would have never ever ask her to leave. Please give me advice on how to move on??? "

Anyone who takes the time to read/skim through this I really appreciate your time.

*General info about me*

* I am about to graduate from a prestigious high school after doing well and working hard at making connections as my school really stresses this with past alumni.

* I am planning on going to my parents alma mater because they are willing to pay for the amount covered by scholarships of course. 

* I am going to major in computer science as it has always been my interest, I have a lot of experience and it seems lucrative early in your career. The school is well known and ranked highly in computer science (I do not want to give a number because then it is easily identifiable).

* My goals post college include getting a good starting salary as a developer or related. I am positive I do not always want to be a code monkey and would like to climb the corporate ladder. &lt;--- **I really want tips on this.** My dad did this as an engineer who got his MBA in his late 20's but I was wondering what are the most effective methods of obtaining the necessary credentials to reach the highest salary asap and what options are out there.

* I am very dedicated to becoming wealthy. I drive an hour and a half to two hours every day two and from school because I know the connections and name of the school will help me professional later in life. I am more worried about becoming wealthy than anything else and I have been told that is not what makes life worth it and all of that before but I would rather cross that road when I lose motivation.




*Financial info about me*

* I have a new car, known for reliability paid for by parents

* Insurance is paid for by parents

* Gas is paid for by parents

* College paidfor by parents

*My actual expenses really only include* 

* dates with my girlfriend ~$150 a month

* stuff for my PC setup which is my main hobby 
* my $10 a month gym membership which has been the best thing I have ever paid for (Skinny fat is not a life long thing I wanted to live with). 

I honestly can just live off cash gifts from relatives for holidays as I have my entire high school career. I did decide last summer to do a paid internship in software development. But recently I got my youth soccer reffing license and earn an average of $35 an hour on the weekends where I get as many games I can as possible. I have put all of my money earned from jobs in my savings account and just use cash gifts for my checking **but wondering if I should get a credit card to basically use instead of my debit card.**



**Advice on any or all of these would be amazing:**

* How can I leverage my financial advantage of not having any debt asap after graduating college? 

* What are the best ways to build long term wealth and when in my life should I be worried about other assets than just $$$? 

* Should I be just putting my money away for things like a down payment on a house later in life, retirement account or investment (I still have a lot more after keeping $1000 or so in my savings for emergencies).

* What is kosher to ask alumni from my school who have given me their business cards four years down the line for job opportunities?

* What job titles/positions should I be aiming for in the corporate setting for tech companies for $300,000+ salary?

**Any advice or answers to questions are so appreciated, I know this is a lot of info.**

*Edit, yes I was born with the silver spoon and am grateful for it, but am looking to also capitalize on it as much as possible"

Things are actually finally going a bit better lately, but I am having a lot of trouble feeling happy. I'm an unpaid intern at a career where I need a year experience before I can get paid. But it was hard to get this far so I should be happy, I guess.

A friend in the same situation got frustrated when I said ""I won't feel like I have a career until I have a permenant, paid job."" He tells me it is a sure thing and we already have our foot in the door. That we have already passed the hardest part. But I am a ""I'll believe it when I see it"" kinda guy.

I find it so hard to get excited. This is my 5th career attempt. The last time was 2010 when I was just about to get hired as an EMT, in the company that trains paramedics in my area, but then I woke up in the hospital. I was told that I had started having bad seizures in my sleep and am now an epileptic and that I would lose my license. I never did any drugs and I still don't understand why I have them, although they are mostly controlled with medication. I was lucky to get my license back 6 months later.

I used to be spiritual, but now i feel lost. When God hates you, he really knows how to show it. In my case, God's lightning bolts came in the form of seizures. I can't imagine what I did to piss him off so much.

I went back to school after 2010 and finally got my Bachelor's a year ago. I have yet to see if it was worth it.

I am having trouble staying motivated to do my training.  I keep thinking the rug will be yanked out from under me again and it will all be for nothing. I feel like the more excited I get now, the more disappointed I will be later when everything falls apart. How should I deal with this?"

8dby65,3,2018-04-19,My Boyfriend Had a Psychotic Episode,throwaway_boaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8dby65/my_boyfriend_had_a_psychotic_episode/,"Obligatory ""this is a throw away"", and I will refer to my boyfriend as Jim.

The last three weeks have been absolute hell on Earth.  About three weeks ago, Jim became aware of some family issues.  For the sake of privacy, I will not elaborate too much, but I will say that the issue was divorce and it had nothing to do with Jim.  During this time, he became very concerned about a younger family member and became absolutely enveloped in trying to fix his family.  At first I just thought he was very emotional and concerned for this younger family member.  Understandable.  Well, it soon turned into such pervasive thoughts that he could not concentrate at work and at home it was all he talked about.  I tried my best to keep him occupied with other things, never brought up the topic myself, and tried to help him distance himself from that side of the family.  I struggle a lot right now with not knowing if what I did was enough.  Anyway, the thoughts became more intense, after about 2 weeks he started to not make any sense, and he would talk about the same thing over and over again.  Jim began to lash out at me and other family members, all sorts of repressed memories and emotions started to surface, and he would cry a lot.  Jim talked a lot about me dying (I have some serious health conditions) and would cry about that specifically, often.  By week three I was exhausted and besides myself.  I've dealt with MANY people with mental health problems over the years in school, internships, and at work, and I don't know why I didn't see the signs.  Or maybe I did and I chose to ignore it because I knew what was going to happen.  His use of THC had increased exponentially over the past 3 weeks by the point. 

This Saturday everything came to a head.  With privacy in mind, I will try and describe the incident as best as I can.  I was taking a nap and just woke up.  All of the sudden I see a chair hurl across the living room and I jolt out of bed.  Jim is rambling on and on about how money doesn't matter and none of our material possessions mean anything.  He is afraid that someone has hurt me and keeps repeating that he is going to protect me.  I look over at the TV and it took a direct hit from the chair.  I turn and see Jim on his knees and look over at our friend who had no idea what was happening.  And I just break.  I call family right away to help, but Jim runs out of the house and I tell our friend to take him to his house.  I was afraid of what he might do if I tried to stop him.  I immediately tell Jim's family where he is going and when they get there it is an uphill battle.  He is rambling, delusional, scared, crying, I can't even imagine it.  His family finally gets him to agree to go to the ER, but turns out he wasn't taken right away. (a whole other issue)

I found that out because the next morning Jim is texting me, not making any sense, saying that he is smarter than me and I need to stop being anxious.  That he knows what kind of games I'm playing and I can't play them like he can.  He switches gears a lot saying that this is so and so texting me from your my phone and then to this is so and so texting me through your phone.  He has no idea what is going on.  For the sake of time, after jumping out of a car, running through the streets barefoot, and hopping over fences, he is finally taken to the emergency room.  He is sedated multiple times and waits for an inpatient bed for 24 hours.  He gets in a place, they are NOT ideal obviously, and he is so distraught.

I find out from his family that he had a previous break before we met.  Jim told me he had some problems with his family before, but I didn't know the official diagnosis was something serious.  He stopped meds and treatment before I met him.  We've had a wonderful relationship.  Highs and lows, but I love him so much and he takes care of me and we were so happy.

The past 4 days have been draining.  Seeing him like this is scary, terrifying, heartbreaking, makes me mad, confused.  Uncertain.  He is getting the help he needs and is on medication that has been helping.  Today the doctors officially ruled out schizophrenia and landed on bipolar with psychotic symptoms.  I'm sick.  I can't take care of myself and him.  I can't stop thinking about the future and how badly I want to be there for him but I just can't.  Yet the medication is helping more each day and I know that people live normal healthy lives bipolar.  I'm trying to be positive but he's still showing symptoms at visitation and I'm trying my best with what I know I should and shouldn't say.  I just don't know if I can be who he needs me to be.  And that makes me so sad I can barely stand it.

I've struggled with mental health issues myself, and was in the psych ward as a teenager.  I understand what it feels like to be in there, but I was in for depression.  I had more of my mind so to speak than he does right now and I just see him in pure anguish.  He begs me to bring him home.  I don't even know if he CAN come home or if we can make it through this.  I have to take care of my health and I might not be the best thing for him right now I don't know.  He thinks we put him there just because he threw a chair.  He thinks everyone is anxious and that we all have this hidden meaning and manipulation behind everything we say.  That he's better now and can come home on his medicine.

Tomorrow I'm calling the social worker again to hopefully set up a meeting with me, his family, and the social worker and doctor.  I hope the medicine continues to do it's job and we can get him to a place of understanding.  Thanks for listening to this VERY long one and my word vomit.

TL;DR - My boyfriend had a psychotic episode and I can't handle it."

I am a CS student so I was viewing the list though that lense but I saw a lot of non-profits, a few unpaid internships, and next to no tech companies. Is that indicative of the reputation of our CS program? I don't expect our students to be highly recruited by Google or Tesla, but I would expect more medium sized companies looking for our CS students. Would it help to express this disappointment to the organizing committee?"

8dcesy,35,2018-04-19,Knights fan coming in peace,yoda17,SanJoseSharks,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJoseSharks/comments/8dcesy/knights_fan_coming_in_peace/,"Hey y'all! So here's my story...

I first started watching hockey in the summer of 2016. I was doing an internship in the San Jose area, and my Airbnb host was a HUGE Sharks fan. He always had the game going in the living room, and I would often watch with him when I got back from work. As you all know, that was the season where the Sharks made a deep playoff run and almost went all the way.

I saw ""THIS IS SHARKS TERRITORY"" signs everywhere I went. As someone who visits the Bay Area on a regular basis (I have family there), I absolutely felt the hype. I felt the joy of victory as each series went by. I felt the crushing pain of the loss in Game 6. Though I was not a big hockey fan, the Sharks were a big part of my life that summer.

Now at this point, you may be wondering where the Knights come into this. Well, I grew up in Las Vegas. It was my home for the first 20 or so years of my life. We've never had a major sports team, let alone one that has captured the imagination like the Knights have this season. I'm the type of person that likes to find a personal connection in the teams that I support, and no connection is closer than my hometown. When we got the expansion franchise, I knew I had to support them.

I may be a Golden Knights fan, but the Sharks will always hold a special place in my heart. If the Sharks win, I will 100% support you guys throughout the playoffs, and in fact I will support the Sharks whenever you aren't playing us. No matter what happens in the coming weeks, I will still love y'all 💗

On a slightly different note, I know we have our share of obnoxious fans - if you see them, please ignore them and know that they don't represent all of us. We know we're new and are extremely fortunate to have such a great inaugural season, and trust me, we're not taking it for granted.

On that note, best of luck in the series, and may the best team win!"

8dcgja,6,2018-04-19,A message of encouragement for those starting over,throwainagoodway,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8dcgja/a_message_of_encouragement_for_those_starting_over/,"Hey hey. Obligatory disclosure that this is a throwaway account--I just prefer to keep things of a personal nature private, but I was hoping that sharing might help someone else who may be facing a hard time.

About a year ago, I discovered via a left open browser that my then-spouse of 1.5 years had been cheating with an indiscriminant amount of partners the entire time we'd been married. At the start of the marriage, due to his status, I was the sole income earner, in an apartment that I had secured on my own. Once he was legally able to work, however, he insisted that I cut out working less and less. He also insisted that we move to a larger, less affordable apartment, but assured me that he could afford it. Much like his faithfulness, these were also lies.

After deciding to end things, I was alone in an apartment that was far beyond budget, without any kind of work, and as I'd been out of traditional work for a long time I knew I didn't have a lot going for me to make a competitive wage. I got a part-time retail job, and hustled for months to try to secure a full-time to no avail. To survive, I had to give up my room and bring in a new flatmate--reduced to sleeping on the living room couch for four months. Among all of the hardship in the whole experience, it was sleeping on the couch that really broke me. I will say, however, that I was fortunate enough to be invited by a family friend to stay at her home for a few weeks, take some time off, and focus on regrouping and figuring out my next step. What a blessing that was.

And now, a year after that night of discovery that changed the course of my life forever, I am moving into a new place all my own. I have an internship and a volunteer role in the new profession that I'm working to move into, with two other internship offers I have to respond to this week, and have been offered a full fellowship to a workshop intensive this summer--all paid by the school. I still have me part-time, and I'm looking for another one to fill the evenings as well. It seems like everything is coming together at lightning speed, all within the past few weeks, but really it has been a -long- journey, with a lot of hard work, to get here.

And now, I want to share some tips and insight about my journey, and I hope that, wherever you may be on yours, this will be helpful for you:

**Be patient with yourself.** No matter why this is happening, understand that if you're going to rely on yourself, you have to have compassion for yourself. Don't beat yourself up for having a hard time. Be gentle, take time to breathe, and understand that it is OK if you need a minute or if you need an ice cream or to hear that song one more time. 

**Take this time to get to know who you are right now.** Chances are that this change has arrived because, well, things change. And guess what? Maybe that means that you've changed too, or moreover, that there's more to learn about yourself that you hadn't uncovered or explored before this moment. Listen closely to what makes your heart sing, or what makes it weep, and explore what that means for what you value and where you would like to project yourself to go. But also, don't feel pressured to be at a certain point of revelation at any time in this process--everyone's experience is unique, therefore, take it at your own pace.

**Sometimes you just have to go through the motions and focus on putting one foot in front of the other.** These are turbulent times, and I know that right now that might seem like the understatement of the century. There are going to be those days where you might wish that existence wasn't even a thing, or those other days when it seems like there's no way that this could ever get better. Shut down these thoughts when they arise, and instead focus on what actions, however big or small, that you must complete to get to tomorrow. Whether it is having a square meal, walking the dog, completing an assignment, etc. If you keep moving forward, day by day, eventually you'll look up and see that hey, you've made it out of the eye of the storm, and even if you aren't totally out of the woods, hell, it makes time go a lot faster when you're being productive with it.

**Walk.** For me, walking has become a newfound love. There have been studies that demonstrate how good it is for you thought functioning, and naturally it is good for you physically too. For me, I can say that when I was feeling impossibly tangled up inside, walking helped to get out those awful nervous chemicals, and piece things together a little better in my mind. When in doubt, walk it out. Your body will appreciate it in so many ways.

**If you lose your appetite when stressed, take half of a Dramamine.** My appetite bottoms out and I feel nauseated by food when stressed. This is unbearable when going through such prolonged circumstances. Dramamine helped me in the hardest moments to be able to keep nourishing my body and be able to eat.

My computer is about to die, so I'm going to end here. On a final note, I want to say that you are SO BRAVE for being where you are right now, and when you get further down the line you are going to thank yourself for taking this risk to improve your life for the better. I promise you, if you keep putting one foot in front of the other, no matter what those self-defeating thoughts might be saying right now, I promise you that you are going to make it to the other side. I'm just about there and I gotta say, it's already a helluva view.

8dd4u0,7,2018-04-19,Rereading my personal favorite Urban Fantasy series. I still love it.,RunnerPakhet,Fantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/8dd4u0/rereading_my_personal_favorite_urban_fantasy/,"I love Urban Fantasy. In theory. My introduction to Fantasy as a genre was Harry Potter and therefore a somewhat Urban Fantasy story ~~(even though arguably Harry Potter almost functions like Portal Fantasy in many regards, due to the magical world being so cleanly seperated for most of the time)~~. Anyways … 

I say in theory, because for the most part there are not many Urban Fantasy series, that manage to keep me invested, for different reasons. I have some pet peeves with the genre and sooner or later there will be something that annoys me.

Because of that I have started to reread the series, that brought me into the “adult” Urban Fantasy series sub-subgenre. The *Sookie Stackhouse* series by Charlaine Harris. And yes, yes, I know that the series is certainly not one of the subs favorites. But for some positivity I though I would just talk about the series and why I still love it so much. 

Now as I said, the series was the first of those long running Urban Fantasy with some mystery (you know the kind of books, I am talking about) series I ever picked up. Well, except Anne Rice, but considering her Vampire Chronicles are constructed very differently from those other books, I see them as something a bit different. 

Back then I was 15, I think, and doing an internship at a bookstore (because here in Germany doing at least one internship while you are still at school is kinda compulsory), just when book 4 of the series “Dead to the World” was released. I picked it up, when I was putting the new arrived books on the shelves and, being a vampire obsessed teen, was like: “Oh, vampire romance with some actual sex scenes! Neat!” and bought the book, not knowing that it was in fact volume 4, thanks to the German publisher changing between books 3 and 4 and book 4 being the first volume in the series, to receive a wide release.

Long story short: I was instantly hooked. When I realized that it was only book 4, I got the first three books, too (even though I was less hooked on them, due to my strong dislike for the love interest in the first three books). After that I just kinda stuck with the series until the end. And man, did I love the end.

Since I have started to blog a lot about Urban Fantasy recently, I decided, to give the series a reread. Mostly, because I wanted to be sure, whether I still consider it to be one of my favorites and how it holds up to my taste of today. And generally I was pleasantly surprised.

The main problem still stands: I definitely dislike the first two volumes, due to Bill. I just hate him as a character. Later reveals about him certainly do not help my enjoyment of his “romance” with Sookie. Book 3 is kinda fun, mostly due to Bubba and Eric playing larger roles in the story, with the two of them being favorites of mine.

What strikes me most as something that I like about the series, is Sookie neither being a damsel in distress, nor the hard boiled super-badass, that a lot of other female protagonists tend to be. She is not a fighter, she is not powerful, but she is witty and often manages to find her way out of the problems, she gets herself into. She also gets hurt (a lot) during the series, but neither whines about it, nor act all badass about it. And I just love the downward spiral, when it comes to her moral and psyche. All the shit that is happening to her takes its toll and it shows, which is something I tend to miss in many other books.

I also love many people in the supporting cast. I already talked about Eric and Bubba (about whom I might add, that it took me a long time to realize who Bubba was, considering that I was born in the late 80s and grew up in Germany), but there are also many others. Pam was one of my favorites pretty early on, as was Amelia, as soon as she was introduced. And I really liked Sam, who I still consider to be one of the better realized characters in the series (plus, the line “Because people do not tend to shoot at border collies” makes me crack up every time). Yeah, I know, Sam is an issue, where many people who like the series will disagree with me. 

I also enjoy the worldbuilding quite a bit. I still totally dig the “there is artificial blood now, so vampires do not have to kill and can be productive members of society” hook, as well as the revelation of all the other magic fractions over the course of the series, as well as the political development, that takes place in the background. I really found it appealing, as it was and still is something different then the more common “Muggles know nothing” or “Everybody is totally out” settings in Urban Fantasy.

Something that strikes me as rather hard to believe today, is, how diverse the cast is. It strikes me as odd, considering when the series started and where it was written. Mostly, I am afraid, due to how I am having a hard time finding diverse Urban Fantasy series, with actual neutral or positive representation of different minorities. [Later relationships](#s ""And may I just say, how completely believable I found the relationship between Pam and Amelia? I found quite funny being bisexual myself, to have them have very similar conversations I had with some of my girlfriends."")

And of course there is the other big thing.

I like me some paranormal romance. I really do. But I almost had forgotten how much I like it, due to the fact, that most paranormal romances I have read really, really turn me off. And that is mostly due to one thing: The “creepyness factor”. And with that I am not talking about dating someone, who turns into animals at least once a month or is literally dead. That is part of the deal. I am okay with that. What I am talking about is my pet peeve of creepy stalker behavior, that goes mostly unmentioned or even if mentioned is brushed aside. It honestly got me to drop so many series, when some behaviors like stalking or possessiveness towards the female character were either displayed as romantic or mentioned as a bit creepy, but never brought up or changed.

And this is one of the things that I really enjoy about the Sookie Stackhouse books. Sookie calls the dudes out for it. Sometimes not immediately (she is fine with [SO's](#s ""Eric's"") possessiveness in the beginning), but it will be called out at some point. The respective love interests have to change this behavior, because it is not okay for her. Or to put it more general: It just is not okay. Stalking is not okay. Being overly jealous of everyone is not okay. Trying to force your girlfriend into a certain lifestyle she does not want is not okay. In all those cases where the guys in question do not change, the relationship will end at some point.

Which probably brings me to the thing about the ending, that I was surprised to find, **a lot** of people apparently hated. [Spoilers for the last 3 books](#s ""I have talked about, that Eric is easily my favorite character in the series, but I still liked, that he and Sookie broke up in the end. It was, what I have been hoping for all along – yes, including the Sookie/Sam endgame. The reason being, that I was fairly certain, that Sookie and Eric would just not work longterm. Mostly due to Eric being as old and powerful as he is. They never were in the same playingfield, never could see eye to eye. And I liked how the books outright admitted that and have them break-up. As somebody never involved in the fandom, I was later shocked to find, how everybody hated the break-up apparently. I just … Do not get it. The books started to build up Sam as endgame in book 1 – at least the way I read the books. It seemed to me early on, that Sam and Sookie were right for each other, but needed to grow as persons, before they could realize that. Which was basically, what the books went for in the end. So … Yeah, it still bewilders me, why people were so pissed about it. I like Eric. I liked the Eric/Sookie relationship. But I also liked, that it ended."")

That is of course not to say, that there is nothing that bugs me in the books, but most things are very specific. The only general things I can think of, is this one pet peeve of mine, that I really like Urban Fantasy, where computers play a role and the Sookie Stackhouse novels are certainly not one of those. 

Also: While I absolutely *loved* the “erotic” scenes as a teen, I kinda find quite a few of them rather cringeworthy today. I still like though, that the books are very sex positive, without spending a quarter of each book on sex scenes.

Well, and yes, in some cases (most of all Alcide) the first descriptions of the male characters somewhat cringy, too. Though I might add, that I still find them way less cringy as some descriptions of the female body (coughs). 

What I am saying: I do not consider the books as perfect in any way. But yeah, they are still by far my favorite Urban Fantasy series so far and I find it rather sad, that I am apparently rather alone with that. "
8dd9vw,2,2018-04-19,What job can I do now with PCS? (Desperately need job) Also will I ever be able to work as a graphic designer again?,TEAM_Porange,Concussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concussion/comments/8dd9vw/what_job_can_i_do_now_with_pcs_desperately_need/,"Hey all, just found this sub. Nice to meet y'all.

Edit: ho boy, this got long. Sorry about that, but please still hear me out?

As the title says, I am in a real desperate need for a job that I can work, or at least work around PCS symptoms. Trying to avoid countering any progress in healing. If anyone has managed this, I could really use your advice.


Hoping yall may have some suggestions towards options, job ideas, or an employer's perspective on PCS, interviews, really anything you can think of on the matter? As well, let me know if you think I could manage to fit into a design position again, maybe something low key like an intern or junior designer, -or is it implausible? 

 

Its been 4 months since the highway MVA I was swept up into. I blacked out for about 7 seconds, and was hit hard enough I pulled some muscles. Had immediate 'spasm' of the upper back and neck pretty bad for months. Went right to the ER that night.
 I am going to a specialist concussion clinic now, and just starting cognitive/speech (SPL) and vision therapy (OT). Also have a CBT helping me weekly, since this has been a big life stressor, and my depression is through the roof uncontrollably. Seeking a chiropractor now too, since my back is just locked up.

I'm in my late twenties, so my healing has improved some things relatively quickly for PCS. Things liks sound, light sensitivity and finger numbness are much better now. Sound has recovered to almost normal; just can't do high pitches, sudden loud nearby noises or movie theater loudness, without getting ringing. Music while doing other activities is still off the table too. (But I can eat at resturaunts again!) Oh, and my fingers can feel texture again competely!

I have even recently pulled out of that foggy, lost myself, kinda tumbleweed throughout the house sickness. My mind is awake enough to go about the day, be aware continuously long enough, I am not getting stuck in a loop of lostness. (horrible description, but you might know what I mean)

Where I am 'stuck' is memory, cognitive, focus and emotional/mental problems.
I'm stir crazy at home now. I want to work, I'm stressed and depressed about it even. But still struggling to keep up with half of the everyday things I would normally have done before the accident. Some days are good, others are pathetic. I can't seem to get a balance or perpetual rhythm of productivity, -at least at home.

So as you know, there are issues of course that I fear will impact heavily on getting and working a job.
Those problems and how I have tried to reign them in are:

^(•Unable to rely on self memory, *adapted to using a task list app and lots of notes to survive.*)

^(•Unable to multitask without mixing things up, *must do thing one at a time.*)

^(•Dipping into strong bouts of depression and anxiety- moodswings because of the pcs,) ^(*medicating and routine exercise helps*.)

^(•Occasional pauses in speech due to the mind catching up, as well as messing up word pronounciation or phrases. *There is nothing I can do for this, and sometimes I don't realize I'm doing it. It doesn't happen as frequently as before, but I sound intoxicated when it does, which sucks. I am basically gonna practice interviewing and hope repetition will curb it.*)

^(•Unable to catch dyslexic mistakes like before, in type or writting, as well take twice as long to formulate passages well, *just keep using spell check, reformating and rereading many times over best I can.*)

^(•Time limitations for various activities, which when reached cause sudden full head magraines that meds cannot always dim -at worse, I sleep it off.)^(* I'm told by my neurologist that pushing through these migrianes is one of the worst things I can do, so I have been stopping activities  at first sign of them, as well taking meds.*)
&gt;^(Maxium continuous concentration limits are:)

&gt;^(1-2 hrs - conversations, even over the phone.)

&gt;^(2hrs - learning anything new, or mathmatics.)

&gt;^(2-3hrs - research, conceptualizing tasks.)

&gt;^(3.5hrs - screen time doing what I know, like art or video games.)

&gt;^(4.5 - droneous screen time, like TV or light reading.)

&gt;^(5hrs - chores, cleaning)

&gt;^(?? - driving)


&amp;nbsp;


Apparently the less brain stimulating or mentally exhausting, the longer I can do it for. How can I work around this?

It completely changes my skillsets...they are unachievable it feels like. I can't swing 12 hrs in front of a computer anymore. Let alone do the extra leg work as a freelancer.

Do I resolve to start over in a new career field, to work around PCS? Throwing my degree right out the window after graduating is distressing. And is it even fair to employers, to secretly manage these issues, and risk being a unemployable employee?



Thanks for any help you can give, and reading this monster."

We'd gotten through the 30 minute evaluation in about 5. He looked at me and said, ""So what is it you're actually hoping for from a psychologist? Are you just going to sit there and tell them you're fine for an hour?""


I suppose I was hoping for answers. Why have I been depressed for most of the past 4-5 years? Why am I suddenly so anxious now, when anxiety was not a problem in the past? Why do I suddenly hate being around people, even people I like? How can I reconnect with my emotions again? How can I live, rather than endure -- enjoy, rather than tolerate -- love, rather than not hate? 

I didn't know how to say any of this out loud. He gave me the mental health care plan anyway.

------------------------------------------------------------

II.

I'm 22. I first fell headlong into depression at 15, and I feel as though I've never really fully come out of the hole. Every semester, every year, was supposed to be different. And my first semester of university really did feel that way. I was living on campus, near new friends; I was joining clubs, getting into leadership roles, socialising. But inevitably I would retreat. I would hate myself. I would feel too ashamed to see anyone. Depression robbed me of my undergraduate years. I look back now and see all the friends I missed out on, all the events I never went to. All the parties, concerts, art exhibitions, hikes, meetups, hackathons, and games that I missed because I hid in my room while the world moved on without me. The shells of those friendships are still on Facebook. I see their lives and wonder why it seems so effortless for them.


I’ve just started my PhD at the same university, because I was too sad and tired at the end of my honours year to apply anywhere else, and I couldn’t find a job. And of course I should do all these things – write a paper. Write this program. Work on all these projects. And make friends and network, and invest in a hobby and volunteer and look for internships because you have to do all these things to be employable these days. I should learn C. I should update my website. I should do machine learning. Should should should. I don’t want to do any of these things. I’m so tired. 


That’s the thing about depression. It makes me dumb and slow and tired. Everything takes me twice as long, because I just don’t get it. I know I should, I *know* I can do these things. But I’m always grasping for words, unable to conceptualise this or that math thing. I have no attention span – what was I doing again? Oh, I was going to google this. How did I forget that in the span of opening a new tab? And I’m so tired. I don’t want to do any of it.  

------------------------------------------------------------

III.

I was quite excited about going to a therapist. I’d never been. Two years ago, I did ask for another mental health care plan, but actually looking for a therapist and figuring out the payment gap and figuring out how much I could afford seemed too much. I filled in my Kessler K10 quiz – 36/50, a distinction! – and hoped that maybe she’d be able to give me activities, things to do. Maybe I could treat this like a problem that I could solve. Or she would tell me that I clearly was deficient in some easy to replace chemical and give me a drug.


It boiled down to fifty minutes of the therapist telling me that I should just try to be happy.

------------------------------------------------------------

IV.

I don’t know, maybe it is that simple. Maybe it is just other people making themselves feel happy. Maybe I’m self-sabotaging and it’s all my fault. I’m too wrapped up in self-pity and vanity and ego and wallowing in misery is comfortable.


There is so much pressure from the shoulds. I should cook right and exercise right and sleep right. I should drink more water and should be happy. I should volunteer and help other people. I should save more money. I should chase more opportunities. I should love my boyfriend and be excited to see him. I don’t know if I love him. I don’t know if I can feel love. I should either be a better girlfriend or I should break up with him so he can find someone better. 


I think I dislike being around other people because they remind me of what a failure I am. They’re smarter than me, more hardworking, more fit. They come to work and solve problems while I stare blankly at code. They’re funny and they’re nicer than me, and they notice when other people get their hair cut. I don’t think I really care about people. Depression makes me self-centered. Or maybe I’m just blaming everything on depression, and I’m just self-centered. They apply to jobs and get interviews while being the national secretary for a club. I go home and stare at my computer some more. My attitude has had an effect on how people treat me, too. It’s hard to smile and laugh now, so I don’t do it much. When I try to fake joke or laugh or be light, I can’t help but use a different voice – almost sugary sweet. People think I’m weird and I am. At least by myself it’s peaceful and there’s no one I have to interact with or judge me. 


In my head, I know that I would normally like spending time with people. I would normally love my boyfriend -- he's amazing and I don't know why he's still with me. I would normally love this PhD – I am autonomous with minimal supervision, I get to do things I like while contributing to science and medical research, and I’m working for myself/my future but with the resources of a research group. Emotionally, I can’t get there. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to do things. But, I don’t want to be anywhere else either, and I don’t want to do nothing. I just don’t want. 


I can’t go the rest of my life this way. This isn’t living. Tolerating the least unpleasant choice and knowing that I used to have ambitions and plans and the drive and cognitive ability to achieve them. But I don’t know how to stop. "
8ddhsr,0,2018-04-19,Liposuction Average Cost Paying More or Less?,emmaj1,beauty,https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/8ddhsr/liposuction_average_cost_paying_more_or_less/,"Liposuction average cost consists of all payments made for the surgery and the non-surgery procedures included in the liposuction process. This is considered by all medical practitioners as a global fee and remains absolute in all liposuction sites located in no matter which city in the United States. Patients must note however that this global fee is the liposuction average cost paid for operations done in the surgeons office or other out-patient facilities. The patient must then expect that if he undergoes an extensive liposuction in the hospital, the cost to pay will be practically higher.

The non-surgical fee percentage of the liposuction average cost includes the services of the anesthesiologist which may also vary depending on the anesthetic used in the procedure. The non-surgical fee also includes the cost of the operating room, the services of the nursing staff and interns, the pre-operative laboratory tests and consultation with the surgeon, and the post-operative care services and maintaining materials with the costs for the patients compression bind, as well as added medication prescriptions like antibiotics, Tylenol, and other drugs necessary should complications from the surgery arise. The surgical fee portion of the liposuction average cost on the other hand includes the estimate of the services that will be employed in treating particular sections of the patients body during the liposuction. The usual total liposuction surgical cost ranges from $ 2000 USD to $ 3000 USD per patients body area to be suctioned out. If the patient is undergoing a multiple liposuction for several parts of his body, the complete amount will be the sum total of the unanimous rate for each body part. For example, if a prospective patient wants to have her buttocks, hips, and outer thighs liposuctioned all together, she would have to add up $ 1800 USD for her buttocks, $ 2400 USD for her hips, and $ 3000 USD for her outer thighs. The sum total would then be $ 7200 USD, and this is just the full amount of the surgical fee part of the liposuction average cost. The patient also needs to estimate the cost of all the non-surgical fees and then add it together with the$ 7200 USD surgical costs to compute for the entire liposuction average cost. Hence, if the total non-surgical cost to be paid is $ 1600 USD, the total liposuction average cost will be a stunning $ 8800 US dollars.

Hence, when inquiring about the costs of liposuction, patients must clarify with their health providers whether they are discussing about the surgical fee, the non-surgical fee, and/or the total liposuction average cost."

(1st car during Internship),JustAnotherJuan123,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/8ddixt/lease_or_buy_1st_car_during_internship/,"Hey guys, looking to do a lease takeover or buy an s4, e92 335i or 335is (2010-2013). Ive been obsessing over the 335is for about 6 months now and really want to get one for the duration of my internship (lasts about 1.5 years). 

I don't know if I should lease or buy, I would rather lease it just for the duration of my internship because I will be returning to school afterwards and dont want to pay for it without a source of income. 


Also, if I lease Im assuming I'll have some sort of warranty for the car which is really valuable for luxury cars (especially since Im not really DIY). 


Do you guys have any thoughts on buying vs. leasing? 

I would also appreciate some suggestions on other cars similar to the 335i/is or s4 that I should look into that is more reasonable for a 1st car. Budget is around 550$/month for the car.

Thanks!"
8de4cl,1,2018-04-19,"Me [22/M] moving from the North to the South for my job 6 weeks after I graduate, girlfriend [21/F] wants to come along with me but I'm afraid I'll be missing out",I_Built_The_Ark_Bro,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8de4cl/me_22m_moving_from_the_north_to_the_south_for_my/,"Hi guys,

So long story short I graduate with a degree in engineering in about 2 weeks. I'll be moving South as I have accepted a pretty good job. 

I have been an intern with this company for 2 summers, so I know the area somewhat well. I told my girlfriend (who I've been with for about 7 months) three months into our relationship that it would be great if she came along.

This girl is very supportive of me, she doesn't have any education outside of high school, but she works as a manager at a retail store and seems to have similar goals to mine. 

I have been very back and forth for the last month or so about her coming down there with me and my reasoning is because I feel like I haven't completely experienced life, and being ""on my own"", as I feel like I will be missing out on something if I tie myself to her so soon. 

I'm a very logical, money oriented and sometimes a  pessimistic person that sees things as the glass half empty when I should be seeing them as half full. I have never lived with someone before, so I am definitely frightened by doing so. My parents who I genuinely repsect and go to for advice are Christian's who are strong in their faith, I have ran my idea by them and while they still support just about any decision I make have told me that moving in together prior to marriage statistically doesn't do so well in terms of a long lasting relationship as far as their experiences went. 

I'm less concerned about my parents views of my decisions, but it's ultimately their respect and advice that I value so much.

I would like to know what Reddits take on this is, as I have ran this by my girlfriend and she is certainly not happy about it which I understand. I am backing out, and wasn't true to my word. 

**TL;DR**

Girlfriend wants to move 100s of miles away from home to be with me as I start my new job, I feel like I'll be missing out on something if I bring her there right away. Am I right or wrong to feel this way, and should I push my own feelings aside or consider them in this decision?

8de8b5,1,2018-04-19,I [20m] think I'm done with my life. Here's why,francesmyfriend,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8de8b5/i_20m_think_im_done_with_my_life_heres_why/,"First of all, I'm only here because I have no one else to talk to. Even though I have an incredible mom, a wonderful brother and some very good friends, I can't explain or I'm not willing to show what I'm truly feeling. I've tried, and it doesn't help.

I will keep this as short as possible. 3 years ago I met what would become my girlfriend for 1 year. During the time that it took for us to know each other, I realised I've never met a more beautiful person than her. Even now, three years later I still feel a the same sensation in my stomach when thinking about her that I felt the second time I met her.

I was with her a whole year, and I can easily say that it was my happiest time of my life. We never did anything extraordinary, nor can I pinpoint exact moments (except one) when I reached the pinnacle of my happiness. It was just the fact that we were together that fulfilled me. I was so so happy.

Then it all ended. It ended on good terms but I know the fault was mine. I know I could have done things to stop what was going to happen, but I didn't.

But here's the problem, during the last year (after ending the relationship) I've accomplished some things. I graduated from my country's top HS with straight A's. I've declined offers from the best business school and the top medical school in my country. I even passed on Cambridge. Instead, I started my first company which now has around 10 part-time employees. Thanks to my business I have now secured an internship at a wealth management firm. No one before me has gotten that internship without a university degree.

Yet none of this makes me happy. Surely, it makes me feel proud, but what I've currently achieved career wise does not give me the same sensation that I get when I'm with her. It's not even close.

We've been away from each other for 1 year. Last week I met her and we kissed. I cannot even begin to describe the feeling that I experienced when we kissed. Since then I've slept with her on two occasions, but it's not the same. The last time I saw her she said ""I don't feel the same about you as I used to. I'm not in love with you"".

And that's it. Writing it, and remembering it makes me tear up. My heart is aching and I have barely eaten in two days. It always feels like I'm going to vomit and I sleep til one in the afternoon.

I'm glad that I got to experience love. Even just for a small moment. But honestly, I think she drove me insane. I can't think of anything else but her. 

Now, hearing her name makes me cry. Seeing her makes my heart break. Being with her, realising that I once had it all, makes me want to die."

68|	WORK FROM HOME: Easy money that anyone can do! Finally live your dream lifestyle! Be your own boss! Make thousands in your first week! Retire early! Don’t be left out!
69|	Open minded and discrete healer wanted. Must interview.: Despite the suspicious wording, the job is treating people from discriminated-against ancestries or with embarrassing deformities that have been persecuted, passed over, or financially exploited by other healing organizations. The pay is low, but you make solid allegiances. Word of your kindness spreads among the hidden downtrodden and you may find welcome far away.
70|	Sales assistant wanted. Incredible pay!: It's a multi-level marketing job. The job poster gives you a sales talk about their wonderful liniments and gizmos. They do work, but they are overpriced. You have to make a bulk purchase of the items and then try to resell them for a profit. You are unlikely to find the buyers needed to turn a profit and are stuck with too much stock.
71|	Horsebreaker needed! Inquire at the Post Office! The job is preparing young horses to accept the saddle and harness so they can be ridden or pull carts. They must also be taught basic commands and gaits. The job is successful if the handler can get the horses to calmly accept riders and obey simple orders.
72|	Do you think you know your gems? A grand test awaits at Nappe and Klippe's Emporium. Only those who truly appreciate mines and minerals should apply! A local jeweler's outfit acquired a large stock of specialty mineral samples and gems from a flash sale of unclaimed shipments. They need them identified but want someone, preferentially a dwarf, who isn't going to undersell them. The first part of the job is a basic knowledge test and then they move onto the unusual samples. They pay in wholesale gems of the player's choice.
73|	Music tutor: My son Stevie wants to be a bard, but the kid has absolutely no talent. I want to enjoy my time at home without the shrieking of his horrible electric lute destroying the peace. I'll pay you 10g to give him some lessons, and if after a couple his ""Music"" becomes less painful, I'll give you a 100g bonus. Contact John Harris at 75 Leyton Ave.
74|	Help! My mother-in-law is coming to town for a visit and I need someone professional to inflict me with some awful disease or other affliction so I have an excuse to stay in bed and not interact or be around her. Please no afflictions that cause perminant damage or death. Mildly life-threatening ok. Meet me at 10pm behind that bar that smells like old goat. You know the one. 50g upon disease delivery.
75|	Help recovering property! This is your local bard Razzle, and if you've seen me lately you know that I haven't quite been myself. The truth is I lost my prize peacock feather hat in a wager at the Lusty Mermaid two days ago. The man who won it from me said I could pay him back for the value of the hat, but when I went to the inn he was staying at I found he skipped town without even paying his tab! (And I found out he cheated at that game of cards by the by) Please, I need a skilled ranger or another who is good at tracking to get back my hat! I'll pay you 4,000 gold to go with me to get it, and I'm willing increase the price to 5,000 if our quarry proves elusive.
76|	URGENT: It is my little pookums birthday and the entertainment cancelled! Anyone may apply as replacements at the magistrates estate.
77|	NEEDED: Someone competent in the ways of word to berate, yell, and speak ill of me. Willing to pay. Discretion is key. Meet me during the night 2 alleys up from the pub in order to discuss terms.
78|	LOST: 3 peg legs, a hook, 5 eye patches, and a talking parrot. If found please return to ""The Luckiest Crew"" down at the pier.

80|	MINIONS NEEDED - Local Lich Looking for Less than Lawful Lackeys. References not required, no paladins. Full training and benefits given.
81|	Fence need painted. Good pay. Contact Sythi at the Inn. Twist, the fence is 10 feet tall and almost a mile long.
82|	ISO: Skilled toymaker, it's my daughter's birthday and she wants a teddy. I can compensate for any materials you use. This was posted by an orc and her human husband, there's an address near the bottom with a smiley face. The 6-year old half-orc wants a GIANT teddy.
83|	IN NEED OF DURABLE IDIOT, WILL BE WORKING WITH IMPOSSIBLE GEOMETRIES. IDIOCY NOT NEEDED BUT DESIRED. BRING FRIENDS. snacks provided! (This was wrote incredibly hastily by a desperate wizard, and his wife. The words ""snacks provided"" are in much cleaner handwriting toward the bottom, obviously added as it was being posted.)
84|	My brother an me want candy!!! (This note is barely legible and is tacked at the very bottom of the board.)
85|	Hey, we're having a party and we need booze. Bring any and all you can carry. (Posted by some broskis at the wizard college. There're about 200 in need of whatever alcohol they can get their hands on.)
86|	Having trouble stocking all these books! Will pay for some big and strong people to help me! (This was posted by a small old woman who owns the local library.)
87|	A set of seemingly innocuous symbols is carved into the side of a barrel underneath the board, all in Thieves' Cant. The symbols are being used for a purpose they're very much not meant for, and the message is patchy and uncertain. ""Dangerous Area."" ""Owner not home."" ""Owner is Vigilant."" Meaning: One for the rogues! The local thieves' guild has found that their missions in the area have ended... poorly. Their new recruits are raving about some kind of spirit, and the veterans insist that something just isn't right.
88| Need demolition help: A demolition company is looking for outside help to clear out and then tear down a vacant house. The reward can be money or allowing the players to scavenge what they find inside the house. (What the company doesn't tell the adventurers is that no one will do the job because of the powerful stench coming from the house. Exploring the house reveals a locked(mechanically or magically) wooden door leading to the basement of the house. The basement contains 1d4 Dretchs accidentally summoned by the previous owner.)
89|	Mimic hunt! Mimics are running rampant throughout the town. Find and kill 2D6 mimics. 1-6 mimics gets 100gp, 7-11 gets 300gp, and 12 kills gets 500gp.

Just read a shitpost about how Apple reviews are sometimes fast and sometimes slow depending on the Apple employees process. They even talked about how the people reviewing are interns. 

Then... We have an idiot who said that Tencent released to Android first on purpose cause Android does not have Fortnite while iOS has Fortnite.

How dumb are y’all to believe this and think this?

The app/update reviewing process is a standard  Apple procedure. It can even take more a week if you sent the update during Halloween/Christmas.
The speed of the update depends on the amount of pending updates that require reviewing. We’ll definitely be getting the update very soon so let’s be patient instead of sharing bullshit. 

EDIT 1: Just got called an Android user by an idiot in the comments section. FYI, I have no android device and I play on my iPhone X. 

EDIT 2: Seems like you guys now have a problem with Apple’s reviewing process. [Here’s](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/) a link for some information on it. "

8dg0jh,2,2018-04-19,Season 3 Manga Adaptations,agentmario,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8dg0jh/season_3_manga_adaptations/,"I was theorizing when season 3 would end in terms of the manga, and did some numbers. Season 2 was 25 episodes and adapted 48 chapters (they even had time for the frog episode!). If we assume Season 3 will cover the Camp, Raid and Trial arcs that's a total of 45 chapters. However, 7 chapters later is when Deku vs Kacchan 2 is fully resolved and would place season 3 at 52 chapters, which is imho doable if there is no ""filler"" episode. Considering it would be weird to start season 4 with such an emotional start, I believe the season will end with the shot of Mirio as the president gives his speech. 

Applying this for the season 4, the chisaki/remedial arcs are a total of 47 chapters (if we assume season 3 ends at mirio). However, this would end right before the festival, which seems to be a resolution for Eri's arc: given that the festival arc is currently 11 chapters and shows no sign of stopping season 4 would have to have an insane pace to cover it all. Unless it ended with an intense climax of Aoyama X Midoriya...

What do you think? The best method I can see for a satisfying season 4 is adding filler and make the internship arc + Remedial last the whole season making for a light ending, with season 5 starting with Gentle and moving on from there."

First of, I would like to thank those who commented on my original post. It was reassuring to see that I am not being a terrible person for putting myself and my future first.

So... We had a talk earlier tonight. I came downstairs to the kitchen after they finished dinner. We had a small talk and then they asked if I had enough time to think about our previous conversation. So I told them that yes, I thought about it and had multiple conversations with multiple people, and I decided to take the internship and will be leaving them at the end of June. They acted like they didn't expect that. My Host Mom refused to speak to me and left the room and my Host Dad started saying how disappointed he is and that although he understands why I am doing this, I am also being inconsiderate and I should think about the impact it will have on the kids. He went on for like 10 min, but I didn't really respond to anything as I didn't want to argue. When he finished, I told him that I know this was not what they were expecting and I am really sorry for putting them in that position, however, I think 11 weeks should be enough time to find someone and I will help them look for a new girl if they want me to. After that he kinda just repeated himself and said he was disappointed and left the room.

So yeah.. I feel so much better after this conversation. However, I am preparing myself for the next coulpe of days/weeks to be awkward and uncomfortable, since I live with them. I am also packing some of my things (in case they let me go earlier) and I will send them to  my parents next week."

Does anyone have any advice for a freshman? Does it get any easier @sophomores/juniors, and have any freshmen landed anything for this summer yet?

8diqkg,2,2018-04-19,MUltiple choice test taking strategies/tips.,chemousey,teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/8diqkg/multiple_choice_test_taking_strategiestips/,"Hi teachers of Reddit.  

I am a medical lab technologist and am currently also assisting in teaching a group of students that are going through a 1 year internship in an attempt to get a degree and license in order to join the profession.  The license exam is 100 multiple choice questions and is computer adapted to adjust difficulty based on the performance of the person taking it as they progress.

So, I’m giving them a 45 minute to 1 hour presentation on good multiple choice test taking strategies!  I’ve read a few articles published by multiple universities and I believe I have a decent framework but I’d love to get more advice from the professionals; if anyone has any Golden advice or good references/reads they can link to I’d appreciate it.  

My current outline is (approx) 5 minute intro, how these strategies might help as well as outlining their exam format to them in case they haven’t researched it.  10-15 minutes of going through tips and tricks / strategies.  10-15 minutes for them to engage in my mock test that will be questions that almost none would know the answer to, but given these strategies they should be able to deduce many of the answers.  Followed by a 5-10 minute Q&amp;A period which I would guess will go long with students inquiring about their license exam format. 

Currently the bulk of my research suggests...

1. Read and answer each question in your head before reading the options

2. Read all options before selecting a final answer

3. Take notes as you progress through the test, answers can be given away by other questions

4. Eliminate nonsense answers and things you know to be wrong

5. Eliminate answers if they appear as an option twice for one question (if “erythrocytes” is option B and “RBCs” are choice C then neither can be right, as they are the same thing.)

6. In the event you do not know the answer the longest answers are often the correct ones.

7.  In the event you do not know the answer answers with definitive qualifiers are often wrong (definitely, always, all the time...)

8. In the event you do not know the answer Answers with possible qualifiers are often the correct response (sometimes, often, usually...)

That’s the bulk of what I’ve gotten so far.  Appreciate anyone to have taken the time to look this over and anyone with info that might help me better prepare this group for success. "

Looking to move out of home without taking a hit to my current lifestyle.,rastorpeter,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8divnv/got_my_first_salary_job_for_70kyear_looking_to/,"After working out of school as an intern and contractor for a little less than a year, I finally landed a full-time salaried position for $70K. I'm looking into moving out with some friends. If so, I want to set myself up for long-term financial sustainability without necesarilly taking a hit to my lifestyle.

For context, I just recently turned 23 and would definitely love to spend my early youth years (i.e. next two years) being able to experience life as much as possible. As I approach my mid-to-late 20s, my priorities will change, but I want to find the right balance of being able to have fun without being irresponsible.

Over the past 6 months as a full-time contractor, my gross income was anywhere between $1,800-$2,000/month. I would love to try to stay as close to that number as possible for my new ""discretionary funds"" budget.


**Primary Notes:**

* Estimated Monthly Gross Income: $4,200/month
* Rent: $1,000/month
* Estimated Bills: $200/month
* Student Loans: 22K at a weighted average interest rate of 4.22%
* Minimum student loan payments: $286/month


I have variations of budgetary plans set up (including an Excel calculator) to figure out how much money to be putting towards my loans, into savings, and into a long-term investment fund.

I would like your guys's feedback and recommendations on how I could best make the transition to moving out."

My slim waist, thick, muscular thighs, and perfectly toned stomach would catch anyone's eye.  But what made me a legend was the massive cock between my legs, difficult to conceal when soft, impossible to ignore hard.  And of course, and endless appetite to match my impressive endowments.

I came into my own in college, gaining a domineering attitude as I fucked my way through the girl's dorms and raided sororities, breaking the wills of every good girl I came across.  Whole teams fell to me and would regularly have me join them in the locker rooms after practice.  My favorite past time became working out in tight fitting spandex to show off my incredible physique and tease the gym rats with my impossible bulge.

After school, I wouldn't slow down, taking every cute secretary, coworker, client's wife or intern that crossed my path.  You can get away with that if every woman in HR is sending you dirty, begging texts.

I love showing off, so of course my snap chat, twitter, and instagram are full of provocative, teasing photos of me and my conquests.  My phone is constantly buzzing with texts and pics from girls I've fucked and those who have somehow gotten my number and want a taste.  Cam shows and live streaming have become a great second source of income, though if I'm being honest, I'd do it for free.

---------

So yes, this is over the top and ridiculous. That's the vibe I want and would love for you to embrace.  So where do you fit in? Are we back in college? Do you spy me in the gym? Are you the wife or daughter of one of my clients? Do you have some other idea? I love brainstorming scenes, so feel free to come with ideas or characters and we can build something.

Also, just because we're going crazy doesn't mean we need to skimp on details or rush through things.  I love teasing and slow build ups.  Good dialog is always a plus.

Other kinks I'm into but are not required: incest, BDSM, exhibition, public sex, lots of cum, overly endowed partners, penis and breast growth, penis pumps and cock rings, drugs

Not into: gore, piss, scat, lactation, feet, food"

8dk4ly,2,2018-04-19,Possible Adrenal Insufficiency,InfiniteDisplay,askdoctors,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdoctors/comments/8dk4ly/possible_adrenal_insufficiency/,"Hi everyone, I am currently a 22 year old male (throwaway account for reasons you will see later on) who has had no prior health complications before beginning university.  I am a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Physics (will play a role later on..).  I used to be a Division 3 Swimmer and had been in good physical health up until college.  At the beginning of college, I began experimenting with some drugs, mainly amphetamines and marijuana.  I used them quite often to help with my workload, as I was at one point doing a double major, in the honors college, competing in D3 Swimming, and pursuing research.  This habit eventually got worse to the point where I came to the self-realization that the use of adderall and other amphetamines became an addiction.  Fortunately, I was able to stop cold turkey and have abstained from using them since ~19/20 years old, but haven't been the same since then (this is approximately around the end of my sophomore year in college).  Over the summer, I had some depression and was quite stressed out while working at an internship and during that summer, had a small medical emergency.  The incident I will describe in the next paragraph. 

**Summer 2016 (~May-June)**
I was at work for my internship, when all of a sudden I became very faint, nauseas, light-headed and felt very weak.  At the same time, I began having painful, stabbing pains in my left lower back and left flank.  I immediately noticed that this was not normal, asked my boss if I could go home and he urged me to go to the ER since I was as pale as a ghost.  Went to the ER, got hooked up to an IV and the symptoms eventually went away with some time.  The ER doctors thought it was just a kidney stone and the symptoms don't come back.. Until later.  

(Fast forward almost exactly a year)

Summer 2017 (~May-June)
I had the same internship as the summer before, and was back to dating my high school sweet heart after being broken up for about 2 years (I was very excited to be back together with her).  Things were going pretty well in the relationship, I was hitting the gym quite consistently (lifting ~ 5-6 times a week) and was doing quite a bit of work at my internship.  I began getting back pain in the same area as the previous year, but slowly progressed over the next few months.  In addition, I began having GI troubles and appetite issues.  At about Mid-July, my relationship with my girlfriend was on the rocks, my symptoms began getting worse very fast and the quality of work at my internship was beginning to decline (this was brought to my attention by the employees there, who noticed it was unusual of me).  Eventually, me and the girlfriend parted ways and I was heart broken and my symptoms at that point got extremely bad.  I have mentioned ""symptoms"" vaguely throughout this paragraph, but will now give a detailed list of the associated symptoms: 

-Headache
-Severe Fatigue
-Weakness
-Severe, penetrating/stabbing back pain (also in my legs as well)
-Postural Hypotension
-Nausea
-Severe inability to deal with stress
-Severe Weight loss (lost about 25-30 pounds over the course of 1.5 months)
-Inability to eat
-Inability to concentrate

These symptoms were in full effect for about a month.  My original PCP couldn't figure out what was wrong, had an endoscopy (came back fine), performed multiple stool sample/blood sample test (nothing out of the ordinary, as of now), and so on.  They couldn't find anything specifically wrong, so they attributed it to anxiety and put me on Zoloft (which I was only on for about 2 months as I knew it wasn't totally anxiety related).  

After a semester at school, my parents find a different PCP who specializes in Fibromyalgia and a few other things (my parents were convinced it was Lyme, I have no idea why).  After a consultation visit and a huge order of blood work, he concludes that I have Refetoff Syndrome, a mycoplasma infection, and possible adrenal insufficiency.  The new PCP then prescribes me T3 (Liothyronine) and an antibiotic for the infection (along with a bunch of other useless supplements in my opinion, he seems like the type of guy who is a vitamin salesman).  

From my blood-work results, it shows that I have low adrenal levels, here are the results from the blood test performed ~Thanksgiving of 2017: 

**Cortisol (Serum)** = 11 ug/dL
****Cortisol (free)** = 0.47 ug/dL
Pregnenolone**  = 79 ng/dL
**DHEA - Sulfate** = 402.4 ug/dL
**ACTH, Plasma** = 19.3 pg/mL
**Aldosertone** = 6 ng/dL

I decide to give this guy the benefit of the doubt and follow his treatments for the next 2 months.  After the next appointment, he decides to test for the same things again and here are the results (test from ~ first week of March 2018)

**Cortisol (Serum)** = 7.7 ug/dL
**Cortisol (free)** = 0.40 ug/dL
**Pregnenolone** = 220 ng/dL
**DHEA - Sulfate** = 360 ug/dL
**ACTH, Plasma** = 11 pg/mL
**Aldosterone** = 5 ng/dL

At this point of seeing all of my adrenal levels decreased (except my pregnenolone level, since that was one of the supplements he had me on after the thanksgiving blood-work, 100 mg pregnenlone per night) I was beginning to get worried.  He said I was fine and the levels looked normal.  

As school is approaching finals, I recently started becoming very stressed and all of the symptoms that I had listed above are now coming back in slowly, but worse each day.  I asked him if I could get additional blood work done to see how my adrenals are during this time of great stress, and the answer he gave me was along the lines of ""We don't want to supplement you with cortisol right now as your stressors might change when you leave school, so in the meantime just suck it up"".  Obviously I am paraphrasing, but that is the nature of what they had told me.  I asked specifically for an ACTH Stimulation test to see that if my symptoms are directly caused by adrenal problems or if they are not.  

**MY MAIN QUESTION(S):** 
What are your opinions on this matter?  
Should I seek out an actual endocrinologist with the current adrenal levels I have? 
Or am I just being extremely anxious about all of this and I am actually fine? 

I can assure you however that my symptoms are real, and I am beginning to lose weight again (~5 pounds in 2 weeks).  I have been able to go to the gym this semester and eat way better, but it's all going back to shit at this point.  Thanks for taking the time to read this :).

8dklg5,1,2018-04-19,High school graduate job decision,tabp2k,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/8dklg5/high_school_graduate_job_decision/,"So, I'm at a fork in the road right now. Some background about myself: I'm a senior in high school who's graduating next month, and in the fall I'll be starting classes at my local community college for my AA degree. I then plan on transferring to an in-state university to get my bachelor's in civil. I'm certified in AutoCAD and the Microsoft Office suite. I'm also in my school's engineering program, which is recognized as a ""technical school program"" by most local engineering firms and the city and county engineering departments. 

I want to work during the summer, and possibly during community college, however I'm not sure which job I should apply for. One of them is a storm water engineering technician position for the city's department, while the other one is an internship with the county's engineering department, but it's just during the summer. I have already interned with the city's traffic engineering department last summer. I'm wondering if I should go for the storm water one even though I know little about storm water engineering. The job is an entry level, no experience required position. I'm mainly afraid that if I do get the job, I won't be able to complete the tasks that I'm given. 

Another option is to do the county's internship, and then go apply for the city's storm water position, as I'd have more experience and training.  

What should I do?"

8dm26q,2,2018-04-20,M4M - the Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8dm26q/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"I hope you can tell from my sparkling prose that I'm an adult. I'm also only looking for adult partners for roleplay - its like let's pretend only stickier

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

8dn8aa,2,2018-04-20,[F4A] Exploration of My Desires,TheNubileNymph,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8dn8aa/f4a_exploration_of_my_desires/,"I’d been called a workaholic throughout my life. Since highschool I’d been working out, constantly running, doing yoga, riding a bike, or playing tennis.  When I wasn’t working out, I was studying. I graduated tied for the top spot in my class, and although I didn’t go out and party as often as other girls, my life had been made difficult – or at least, annoying – by jealous girls who had crushes or boyfriends more interested in me than them.

I hadn’t cared. I’d gone to college, leaving my small town behind, and I’d excelled there too. I found it difficult to multitask: when I did something, I put my full effort into it, and since my full effort was considerable, that meant I was able to get a lot done. I studied, I worked out, I learned how fashion worked so I knew how to dress and avoid nerdy or rural stereotypes, while still being comfortable.  I learned to look good without being scandalous.

With my short, slender frame, narrow waist, flared hips, and round, smooth, thick ass – along with cute perky b-cups (some days closer to a-cups) and my short, dark chocolate hair – sometimes in a bob-cut, sometimes a top knot – I also managed to pull off a mixture of cute and sexy that worked to my advantage. I was pretty, with perpetually tanned skin – it was a fair shade of olive, the result of my part-Hispanic, part-German heritage.  I have huge amber-brown eyes, like some Disney princess, which I often hid behind glasses. I didn’t shy away from using my attractive, petite frame to encourage someone, tacitly, to take out the trash for me.  Perhaps it even helped me get into the schools and internships I had wanted, but I figured I should’ve gotten in anyways based on my grades and skills.

Everything I did, I did using every skill I had.  That included pleasuring myself.  I was settled on my knees, supporting my upper body with my left forearm, while I twisted my upper body and reached back behind me with my right.  In my delicate right hand, I held the plug.  I used my fingers to shift and press the metal point of the plug against my tight little asshole, deep between the thick cheeks of my ass.  I’d already poured a dash of lube against my asshole, and put another dab on the toy before I’d settled onto my knees and arm in front of the tall floor length mirror I had against my bedroom wall.  The metal plug, expensive and luxurious in both appearance and feel, was warm from the heat of my mouth, as I pulled it between my lips and teased my tongue against it.  It had filled my mouth, and I’d only withdrawn it once it was the right heat.  Then the lube, and now the teasing touch. 

I kept a steady pressure against my asshole, felt myself spreading as the plug flared from a narrow tip to its widest point.  It wasn’t difficult at the start – but the plug flared rapidly, and soon I felt my mouth spread wide as I marveled at how *huge* the plug felt against me.  I knew how big it was, had taken it in my mouth, had rubbed it in my hands.  But my ass had never been spread so wide.  I wished I was recording it, watching it slowly spread me as I kept that steady pressure, interspersed with sudden pulses of more force.  My glasses, the lenses themselves only slightly corrective but the frames a classic matte black style, were fogging as my breath grew hot and fast, and I bucked my head to try and nudge them back up my nose.  

I sat back, pushing my hips back as I lowered my ass towards my heels, towards the mirror, towards the *plug*.  Felt myself spreading wider and then–

–there was an audible pop as the plug tapered back to a narrow stem, my asshole immediately gripping it tightly.  Pushing the last centimeter of the stem, and the whole of the plug inside me, until the circular flange of white metal nestled tightly against my asshole.  Fuck.  I felt so full.  I’d been curious about anal for a long time, and I’d slid my fingers, or little safe objects I had on hand when I’d craved it in the past.  But it wasn’t until now, as a graduate student, 25 years old, that I’d bought myself a plug.  I wished I’d figured out a way to do it sooner – I’d let amazon order histories and worries of discovery from roommates or relatives scare me off too long.  

I groaned with pleasure as I felt the plug shifting inside me as I stood, pulling my skin-tight jeggings back up my fit legs.  I was foregoing panties for this date – not something I’d ever actually done before, but another kink I was curious about, one I read of and fantasized about.  It wasn’t like I’d never met my date before – we’d had classes together, and were somewhere between friends and acquaintances.  The jeggings were every bit as tight as yoga pants, but were made of dark quality denim and other more elastic materials in the lining – invisible but ensuring they hugged every curve.  I chose a bralette, lacy and white, without a wire or much in the way of support, to settle over my high perky breasts, then slipped on the blouse I’d hung in the doorway before I’d started my little pleasure session.  

Five minutes later, after I gave myself a once over in the makeup mirror – I practiced the minimal make up look, the look that some men think actually includes *no makeup*, but still has some liner and foundation.  But it was light and breathable and quick to touch up.  I tied my hair up in a topknot, securing it with a navy ribbon, so dark it almost appeared black, matching the color of my jeggings.  

I grabbed my clutch, blushing as I felt the plug shift inside me once I started to move more naturally.  It was too late to rethink my decision – a glance at the little watch on my wrist was confirmation of that.  My heart raced as I left.

------------

My kinks are: uniforms / clothing – I like spending time undressing and revealing each other’s bodies, or having sex with yoga pants at my knees, or a skirt flipped up, etc; booty stuff – I like spanking, but I don’t like bruising or anything like that, and I don’t like scat – mostly playful spanking to turn my cheeks pink and make them sting a little, and if you’re good at it maybe a little harder, as well as just groping, kissing, gently biting; teasing (not verbally, but like stripteases, flashing, masturbating while the other person watches); sex outside of a bedroom (I don’t like being caught but I do like sort of mild exhibition or voyeur I guess – tough one to explain, and I don’t like dirty settings like alleyways); lingerie; D/s (I’m a switch and I don’t like passive partners – we should both be advancing the story); anal (probably could’ve put this with booty stuff – I like semi-realistic anal, with the exception in that I’m not going to write an enema and I’m just always going to be perfectly clean – I mean that working your finger in should take like two posts from both of us, as your knuckles gets stuck and you have to wiggle and pulse and spread me or give me instructions or get lube etc. No just sliding in.)
I have other kinks but since I was explaining the details that’s already pretty long.

 Limits: non-con, heavy pain, scat, gore, watersports. Also, please **don't** tell me your cock is *x* amount of inches long and *x* wide. **Just use adjectives. It's sexier.**

Partners of all genders equally welcome."
8dn8o8,10,2018-04-20,Decision and fresh Withdrawals!,BklynLaw2021,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/8dn8o8/decision_and_fresh_withdrawals/,"I'm 95% certain I've made my final decision (the only holdout being Fordham..), and I've decided to commit to Brooklyn Law School!  It was an extremely tough decision between BLS, Seton Hall, and somewhat St. John's purely because of scholarship considerations, so for those of you who are also stuck between these two, here were my deciding factors:

**1. Location and Campus in General:** I would live in and have my future career be based in New York City, and Brooklyn and St. John's have a significant advantage over Seton Hall. 

**SETON HALL:** SHU is a beautiful building inside and out, very modern and had a very clean feeling atmosphere.  It's prime location in the up-and-coming developed business/downtown area of Newark and it's vicinity to Newark Penn (a 35 min bus ride home from there) and my brother who works just a few blocks away were very big selling points for me. 

**BROOKLYN:** Brooklyn, while the academics are great, is not the most beautiful building on the inside.  It has an antiquated, almost run down vibe to it, except for the classrooms I saw which were equivalent to SHU's and the moot court room which was as nice if not better than SHU's.  The location though is excellent.  Situated right between the Brooklyn Borough Hall and quite a few court houses, the potential internships practically at your doorstep makes it's placement desirable to say the least.  On top of that, there's access to almost every subway line within a few minutes walk and it's right in Brooklyn Heights, one of the most desirable and beautiful places in the borough.  Being only one stop from Lower Manhattan is also a huge plus.  For me personally, Brooklyn also has it's advantages as much of my family lives there, it's about an hour-hour and half trip from my hometown, and only an hour long subway trip from my favorite team, the New York Mets.  

**ST. JOHNS:** SJU was actually my favorite of the campuses.  It's really a nice campus with beautiful buildings, just overall aesthetically pleasing.  When you're there, it's tough to believe that you are within the NYC city limits.  The beauty is important, as you have to be willing to see the school daily for three years, but it had it's drawbacks.  The law school is on the undergraduate campus, and I saw a few undergraduates just casually hanging out in there when I visited.  I know some areas are law student only, however I didn't like knowing that I was going to be surrounded by undergrads when I could avoid that at BLS or SHU.  Lastly, it's geographic location makes it pretty inaccessible.  It's a 15-20 min walk or a couple min bus ride to the only subway line even close to it (F), and it's very far out into Queens so it takes approximately 45 mins to an hour to get into Manhattan where I'd ultimately like to do internships, etc.  

**2. Employment and Career Outlook:** Employment rates really tripped me up for a while.  From my (extensive) research, I've found a few thing that helped guide my decision.  Seton Hall has very high rates of employment, but their numbers are very packed with clerkships for federal and state judges in NJ, which might lead to higher paying jobs but I have significant student loans just from undergrad.  Brooklyn on the other hand, has the fourth highest amount of placement in NYC BigLaw, and overall good employment in the NYC area due to a very large and loyal alumni network. St. John's had overall good employment numbers, but I've read that their alumni network and reputation isn't as strong as BLS. 

**3. Scholarship Considerations and Stipulations:** The three schools I was stuck between each offered me substantial and similar scholarships at first, and the difference in debt I would have to take on was within 8k over the course of the three years.  The initial range was close enough that I wasn't weighing the cost difference heavily.  The stipulations are what made me eventually entirely write off St. John's.  SJU mandates you remain in the top 60% of your class, and disclosures showed me that many many students lose their scholarship after their first year (53.72% in 2015-2016).  BLS only required you remain in the top 80%.  They are somewhat notorious for section stacking, but their disclosures suggested that losing a scholarship isn't very common (19.2% in 2016-2017).  Lastly, SHU required you maintain at least a 2.8 gpa, or top 80% of the class (I'm almost positive about the 80%).  Most students kept their scholarships here as well, only 20.37% had them lowered or taken from 2016-2017.  SHU and SJU offered me a very close amount of money, but Brooklyn had offered less so I negotiated with the admissions office and they gave me a 30% bump from their original offer literally two days after I had pretty much decided on SHU and informed my family and friends (sigh).  This changed everything pretty much everything.  I went from having to take on about 40k over the three years at SHU to less than half of that.  The housing cost is going to be higher in Brooklyn of course, but when comparing rents in Newark to rents in BK/living in the school housing, it appears it won't be insanely more expensive.  

**Conclusion:** I was leaning more towards Seton Hall despite the advantages I saw in Brooklyn due to its advantage in rankings, having friends who go there and are extremely happy, and the fact that I much preferred the physical structure of the school. However, after making the internal decision without placing my deposit, I started to second guess myself at least a little bit for not choosing BLS and starting looking more closely at various numbers and factors.  Then Brooklyn hit me back up with a huge scholarship advantage, and the rest is history!

I feel like I wrote a lot more than what people normally do, but I felt like I had to because I haven't really seen many posts comparing these schools, and based on the amount of offers they give I'm assuming this can help out others on this sub.  Even if you're not considering all  or any of them, maybe it'll help you in your decision process by seeing my method for deciding on a school.  I don't know, here's to hoping?

One more thing before I wrap this up...  BLS committed students, how are you going about you roommate hunt?  Roomsurf was abysmal, craigslist was the same, and the class of 2021 facebook group only has like 10 members.  I couldn't find a link for a roommate matching resource on BLSconnect either.  Also, I looked at the housing application and don't even see an option for writing in a preferred roommate with only 9 basic kind of questions.  Can anybody help a future classmate out?

Edit: Another deciding factor was the housing options. Brooklyn has a 22 story law school housing building that is below market rate, whereas SHU doesn't offer any university owned housing. That would mean I'd have to pay market rate in an expensive area of Newark if I'd want to be as close as Brooklyn's housing is to the school itself.  "

8dnhu0,2,2018-04-20,ESAL calculations,UmbrellaSyrup,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/8dnhu0/esal_calculations/,"Hi guys,

I'm basically an intern at a consulting firm that primarily works with coastal/water resources projects (my personal interest), but one of my bosses does a lot of work on highway design as well. We've been tasked with calculating ESALs and completing the geometric design of a roadway we're working on with a partner, and I've been assigned the ESAL calculation. I've done this before in class, but we were always give a lot of the information we needed to complete the calculation. I have some traffic counts I can use to gather my AADTs and my directional/design lane factors, and I'll probably go ahead and use each of the Load equivalency factors associated with terminal serviceabilities of 2.0, 2.5, &amp; 3.0 and let my boss select the value we need after talking to our pavement design guys. I also have a pretty good idea about the growth factor, but...

My main concern is what values to use for my axle loads when choosing my Load equivalency factor? Also, in the AASHTO tables used to calculate design ESALS is the number of axles on each vehicle type already multiplied by the load equivalency factor in column D?

Thanks for any help you can offer."
8dnxlz,3,2018-04-20,Needing a visa for a summer internship in the UK as a US citizen... and I have no idea where to begin,pigstakeflight,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/8dnxlz/needing_a_visa_for_a_summer_internship_in_the_uk/,"I'm a 21 year old college student going into my senior year. Before I begin my thesis I want to go abroad! I am currently seeking an apparel design/fashion internship in London, and my department head will be helping me connect with some of her contacts as she is from London herself. 

So the issue is that I do not yet have an internship. I am in the midst of finals, and I'm working on my portfolio at the same time so I haven't even been able to apply yet. My aim is to complete my portfolio this weekend so that I can begin applications... yada yada.. that's the scoop..

So from what I understand, to get a working visa I need my internship to endorse it? Or to get a visa at all I need it to be endorsed? My other thought is to apply for a student visa because I'm interested in taking classes at CSM (Central Saint Martin's).. but I can't guarantee at this moment that is something that I will actually be able to do during my time there.

I want to stay for three months.. In fact.. I already have the plane ticket for the first of June. I will be going to Scotland to stay in Glasgow with my boyfriend (we're LDR and alternate visiting each other every other month)... So the plan is essentially to sort of hang out and enjoy summer for the first few weeks of June, then I would probably start my internship mid-June or right at the start of July in London. 

Again, I don't have an internship planned yet so I can't definitively say when it will end but it's likely that I would be working from mid June to mid August, ideally. 

The internship will be paid.. or needs to be paid.. or if it isn't paid I need to make money some other way.. so I need a visa that will allow for that.

Another factor is that my family is going to Italy while I'm in the UK.. and my boyfriend and I are planning on making short trips to Europe.. like to Paris and Amsterdam for only a few days at a time.. will that be allowed on my Visa? I know that when he was here in the US on exchange we wanted to visit Canada but it meant that he would have to jump through a bunch of hoops to do so, so we didn't.

I don't know how any of this works! Is it easier for a US citizen to get a UK visa? Can I go before my internship starts or can the Visa only be for the time that I'm working?

Do I even need a Visa? My roommate, who is from Kazakhstan and just recently got her Visa for an internship in Paris for the summer insisted that because I'm a US citizen, that I don't need a Visa to spend three months in the UK. Is that even true? Could I get an internship, unpaid, and work freelance (which I already do - graphic design and illustration work online). 

I don't even know how to begin researching this... and I don't have much time! I'm anxious to get this process started! "

I know that I should be thrilled for her and happy she got the offer, but I'm just not right now. We currently attend the same college and spend a good portion of our time together when classes are in session. Our hometowns are roughly an hour away and when we aren't in school we will spend a couple days at one of our houses. With summer approaching, I am starting to have anxiety about how much we will be able to see each other. She will be working Monday-Friday and then spend weekends at her lake house with her family. My girlfriend's family all struggle with depression and are very co dependent on each other. Her family really likes me and is extremely welcoming towards me, but it is a force to try and get her to leave her family for more than a day. I guess my real concern is that we aren't going to get to see each other much this summer which makes me think it isn't worth staying together. I love my girlfriend, but spending weeks apart from each other doesn't do us well. She has every intention of staying together and doesn't see it being an issue. Any advice is appreciated. "
8dq2dh,1,2018-04-20,Retirement Saving vs Construction Loan,SteelofSparta,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8dq2dh/retirement_saving_vs_construction_loan/,"I'm planning on building a home on some land my wife and I bought last year, and I'm wondering about the best way to structure our budget for the future mortgage payment.

I'm 24 and my wife is 23. We've been maxing out our roth IRAs the last few years and now that we both have full time jobs are currently maxing out roth 401k's.

We were lucky to both have good scholarships and internships while in school and escaped college student debt free. Instead the debt we have is about $75k to a family member when we bought our land, and $25k remaining on a car loan when my last car pooped the bed and we decided to bite the bullet then and upgrade my sedan to a 4wd truck so we could access every part of our mud farm.

Whenever we do move forward and obtain a construction loan, would it be a wise choice to reduce our roughly 30&amp;#37; 401k contributions to free up some cash for paying off construction? Would it be better to hold off on construction entirely and wait until we've paid off our current debts?"

If anyone reads this, thanks, I guess. Any help is appreciated but I don't expect it so whatever. My thoughts are all very scattered.

I haven't filed my taxes in the last four years. The longer I put off fixing this the worse it's going to get.

I failed the last subject of my masters degree for no real reason (or at least for a reason I can adequately explain to myself or others.) I can't tell anyone about this. Everyone in my life thinks I've completed my degree. I can't even tell my parents. If i did would they be angry or understanding? I honestly don't know and I'm now living a lie. I told myself this would be better, that I can fix this, but can I? I've only told my ex, she feels like the only person I can talk to about this stuff. Even then, I still can't tell her everything. I'm scared what she'll think of me. I can but I can't. I feel like I can't confront this with a therapist. I can't go to a GP and explain this. I know they'll probably take this seriously and refer me to someone who might help but the fear of having to confront my problems terrifies the fuck out of me.

I technically passed my internship but I failed; both the organisation and myself. I have no excuses why. I can't explain it. I feel tremendous guilt. I feel useless. It feels like my brain is broken. I think the stress triggered an immense downward spiral in my life that I can't pull out of. I wake up every day with no motivation to makes things better. I'm tired. constantly tired. I just want to sleep; so I do. But I also don't. I'm staying up progressively later. It's 4:43AM. I'll sleep all day tomorrow and not do anything.

I don't want to die but I wouldn't mind not existing. I'm self-destructive. The thought of doing something positive for myself, making an effort, applying for jobs, confronting my problems and getting on with my life make me want to bash my head into a wall; to hurt myself. I've done this. It's become an excuse to not to try. Why force myself to do difficult things if it'll hurt me? I know this is bad. I know I have to force myself to change, but I feel like I can't.

Is it too hard to ask for help because I don't want really want it? Maybe. I don't know. But probably not. Maybe writing this down will help.

I felt a mild anxiety attack coming on tonight. I've been experiencing physical symptoms of stress: self diagnosed pulsatile tinnitus and a lifelong dysfunction of the belch reflex. I can't burp. Shoutout to /r/noburp. Is that part of whats led me here? Maybe. I'm also struggling to confront that. I feel like I can't go to the doctor because it'll cause me to have to confront everything I've already/will have described here. Or going to a doctor for something else and not bringing this all up will just make me feel even guiltier.

I'm running out of money after quitting my job in December. I've been living off of accrued leave but it's not going to last much longer. Is this how homelessness begins? Will I be the crazy person yelling at people in public and making them feel unsafe? I can't say it won't be and that scares me. Maybe quitting was a mistake. It felt right at the time, like it would force me to find something else to replace something that was making me miserable. The tipping point was when I didn't get promoted despite being clearly more experienced and capable than others who were. I'm confident this was the case, but what if it wasn't? If I can't even get ahead in a job I'd been in for 10 years how the hell can I expect myself to be of value anywhere else? I feel useless; like i'd be of no value to a new employer and that's stopped me from even applying for ANY jobs. A grad job is out of the questions. My grades suck, I can't function. There's no way I'm beating out people who have things together. Why bother?

I want to tell people all this but I feel like I can't. It's too difficult to confront. Should I just refer people here to explain my thought process because i feel incapable of verbalising it? I know the answer is no. But maybe. I also feel guilty putting that on others. I know they'd want to help but it just feels wrong. Especially when I know my friends themselves are struggling with things themselves. I read a study about how placing your problems onto others who are themselves vulnerable just compound things for them, and I'm not comfortable with that. I'm happy to help others though. I do, I try to make myself emotionally available. Should I stop? Is that making me worse? Am I anecdotal evidence backing up that study? Maybe. It feels like it. After others tell me they're not fine and ask how I am I'm always ""just fine"" but I'm not. It doesn't feel fair to tell them all this. It's too much of a clusterfuck. I'm too fucked up right now. My brain feels broken. It didn't use to be like this. It's been 3 years of this. I wish I could go back."

I'm tomGER and I moderate some subreddits in my free time, here is a rundown of what I do for each subreddit:

**/r/subredditoftheday**

Subredditoftheday is probably the subreddit where I spent the most time in the background, I mainly help our interns but I'm still writing some articles (The biggest bunch coming out from the 1st till the 7th of May.2018 :D) It's really unique and I can't compare it to any other subreddit I moderate :)

**/r/game**

/r/game is the smallest sub I moderate and one of the subs I moderate for the shortest time. But in that time it grew on my. I absolutely love the community, and we have such a nice moderation team. I'm super active on that sub and it was the reason Zadoc allowed me to /r/subredditoftheday. Of all subs I moderate, this is my most favorite by far, and that just for its amazing community and idea.

**/r/Bossfight**

I can't really say that much about that sub since I'm pretty new to it but I like the idea of it and how they manage to stop reposts. I was invited by a fellow mod of /r/SubredditOfTheDay and previous /r/game mod.

**/r/ZeldaBotW**

/r/ZeldaBotW was in fact the first subreddit I joined because I wanted to. I'm basically ""owner"" of that sub as I'm currently the only mod that cares for it and its community / does any moderation work at all

####Subreddits I'm not moderating anymore

**/r/torrentlinks**

**I finally left this place. This was by far the worst subreddit I have moderated.**

~~/r/torrentlinks is a sub that kinda stands in contradiction with myself. While I moderate it **I DON'T ENDORSE PIRACY IN ANY WAY**. I do very little on that sub and am not happy about the changes we made 2 months ago. With that being said, I still think that this sub had some glory when I started moderating it as it started out as a place to talk about torrentlinks (and not share them). This sadly isn't true anymore, but we'll see /shrug~~

~~EDIT: After 2 months reddit decided that this was unacceptable and warned us - We're now back at our old glory and pride and I'm happy to say that I love that change :D~~


**/r/radeon**

**There was no need to have that many mods, I get the owners intentions but the subreddit is way too small for his ideas**

~~I'm currently just a ""filler"" mod that is waiting for the big boom of that sub. That being said, I love AMD and the sub itself. The owner is really active and friendly, and I'm grateful to moderate it, even if it's small in size compared to the others :)~~"

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

For me:

Either make the new interns interesting, or cut them out (same goes for Owen, DeLuca’s sister)

Give the characters some strong storylines like they did with Kepner and her faith (one of my favourite recent arcs)

Let the Grey’s sisters (and Amelia) actually look like a family, I’m personally not a fan of Jo getting so close to Meredith, she’s not my favourite 

Get some decent love interests (unlike Riggs) 

Give Bailey and Webber something to do
If new characters come, give them a reason to be there

Nothing accepted at this time because they only can offer per diem but the SW dept seemed very interested and wanted me to keep in touch as they feel they will have FT positions by the end of the summer.

My dilemma now lies in what do I do for the fall? Obviously nothing is written in stone yet. BUT I do work in a teaching institution and we are expected to bring on at least a couple of interns. I also already offered a spot to someone for Sept.

The new place doesn't take on interns although that has the potential to change if I'm there I'm sure lol. 

I do believe though my company has a rule that you can't work with interns until you've been in your new role for a year.

I'm not saying anything just yet but I can't help but worry that I could end up screwing some people over if I interview as usual.  

I'm thinking of telling my boss I want to take a break from students for the fall and hope that things come through soon so the fall student can find a new placement..... "
8drg0m,0,2018-04-20,"""The Intern"" (2015) is White Supremacy set in Brooklyn, NY - My original review on the night it was released...",Rebeltastic,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8drg0m/the_intern_2015_is_white_supremacy_set_in/,"On Thursday, September 24, at 9:50 p.m. in Brooklyn, New York I decided to go see the very cute, very campy movie called “The Intern” starring two actors that I love, Anne Hathaway and Robert DeNiro. I saw many previews for in over the past few weeks, and every time that I saw a preview I would think how adorable and funny it looked, and I was right. The movie was indeed comical, and endearing, with a lot of heart-felt moments. I enjoyed the movie throughout, until I began to look at the larger picture of the city being presented in “The Intern”, and began to notice how well the director did at portraying the refined, contemporary city that is Brooklyn, New York.

In the movie “The Intern” we see a very modern day version of Brooklyn, which is now very white washed and gentrified. All of the color and culture that was carved into the city and made up the city (and literally plastered on sidewalks and buildings) are quickly being erased and replaced with Skyscrapers and Hotels. Fire escapes are almost non existent and fire hydrants are even being removed. All of the black and Hispanic neighborhoods are now becoming monotonous white neighborhoods, with white “yuppies” moving in causing all costs, including rents, to skyrocket and push the minorities out.

Brooklyn (the borough in NYC that once belonged to the “Brooklyn” Dodgers before being moved to Los Angeles because Brooklyn was seen as the dumpster of NYC) went from a very homely borough to the “new Manhattan”. Brooklyn is now the borough where tourists come to stay or site see, and the borough where young, white out of towners move to start their “new” lives. This is the Brooklyn that we see in “The Intern”, where there were probably two or three people of color seen throughout the films entire 2 hour run time. We never see Anne Hathaway have a conversation with a person of color (minus the 5 second scene where she is speaking to minorities that work in the factory to her business), see Robert De Niro look at a person of color (how could he when there were none to look at?) or even see a black or Hispanic person walking down the street during the outdoor scenes or inside the coffee shop where Robert DeNiro’s character picks up coffee for his young boss (there are also no people of color working directly for Anne Hathaways character in her business. Nope. All young white people minus the older white interns that are hired as an experiment, to Hathaways dismay, as she only wants young people in her business). The entire movie was youthful white people living in “white” Brooklyn and living very luxurious, exorbitant lives with no fears or worries of having to deal with any real issues or having to “deal with” minorities (this is probably why they were all so calm and preppy all the time, no black man to scare them by doing nothing). In other words, the movie “The Intern” is as racist as Brooklyn has become over these past few years (a white woman recently called a black co-worker of mine a nigger after he accidentally bumped into her).

Many will argue that the city of Brooklyn itself can not be racist, but I beg to differ. When the government of NYC decides to “gentrify” all of NYC to “beautify” and “fix” all of the neighborhoods all the while raising rents and prices to an all time high, to me (along with many others), that is racism and classicism. They are not pathologizing black neighborhoods, but completely erasing them. Gentrification is something that is celebrated and promoted by the media as a good thing when in reality it is the process of uprooting communities. Gentrification is white supremacy (with their intention to segregate in an inconspicuous manner) with a nice, thick coat of sugar over it to make it look like something sweet and beautiful and pleasurable (when in reality gentrification should be seen as a human-rights violation). Many white people do not feel safe living in mostly Hispanic and/or black communities, and the mostly white government makes sure that they can live where they please without having the burden of many minorities living in their neighborhood (as well as Politicians manipulating zoning laws to allow major developments with very few low income housing available).

Gentrification in NYC (and every area being taken over by the white man that then pushes out the black man) is blatant racism, and this movie,  ""The Intern"", depicts the outcome of a post “gentrified” Brooklyn quite well (where everyone is young, white, living in over-priced apartments, working with only white people with few minorities working for them in labor jobs, while sitting back and enjoying lattes at the new coffee shop or bakery that was just put in the place of an old low-income apartment building or house). This is the NYC that we are shown in the movie and this is the NYC that is really being built up as I type this, sadly.

Maybe I read too into the scenery of the movie “The Intern” as I watched it, but as someone that was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY (it is my hometown and I am a third generation Brooklynite) what I was watching hit close to home for me as I am witnessing minorities being run out of their homes (many people that once lived near me are now living on the streets a few blocks away) and jobs (I know young Hispanic and black people with their Masters degree being laid off jobs only to come to find they were replaced by a white person from out of town) all to move in white people and raise the prices to assure that the blacks and Hispanics no longer are in the area. Something has got to change before it is too late.

I was planning on doing a double degree in Econ and CS but can't decide which school is the best to do it at. 


Although I've heard that U of T has a more robust economics program (especially interested in Financial Econ) and computer science program, I've also heard that it's really difficult to get into those programs. On the other hand, McGill doesn't have any entry requirements for declaring a double in Econ and CS but their programs may not be as good as U of T's. Is there a stark difference between the two that makes it worthwhile to try my hand at U of T, or are these degrees from either school comparable down the road. 



I hope to be able to do some internships during my undergrad degree and was wondering which school would make it relatively easier for me to do so with these degrees. Obviously, you have to network like crazy nowadays, but does the brand/reputation of either school make it easier to get spotted by or to impress recruiters both in Canada and in the States.

8dsp5y,5,2018-04-20,[F4A] The Third Date,TheNubileNymph,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8dsp5y/f4a_the_third_date/,"I’d been called a workaholic throughout my life. Since highschool I’d been working out, constantly running, doing yoga, riding a bike, or playing tennis.  When I wasn’t working out, I was studying. I graduated tied for the top spot in my class, and although I didn’t go out and party as often as other girls, my life had been made difficult – or at least, annoying – by jealous girls who had crushes or boyfriends more interested in me than them.

I hadn’t cared. I’d gone to college, leaving my small town behind, and I’d excelled there too. I found it difficult to multitask: when I did something, I put my full effort into it, and since my full effort was considerable, that meant I was able to get a lot done. I studied, I worked out, I learned how fashion worked so I knew how to dress and avoid nerdy or rural stereotypes, while still being comfortable.  I learned to look good without being scandalous.

With my short, slender frame, narrow waist, flared hips, and round, smooth, thick ass – along with cute perky b-cups (some days closer to a-cups) and my short, dark chocolate hair – sometimes in a bob-cut, sometimes a top knot – I also managed to pull off a mixture of cute and sexy that worked to my advantage. I was pretty, with perpetually tanned skin – it was a fair shade of olive, the result of my part-Hispanic, part-German heritage.  I have huge amber-brown eyes, like some Disney princess, which I often hid behind glasses. I didn’t shy away from using my attractive, petite frame to encourage someone, tacitly, to take out the trash for me.  Perhaps it even helped me get into the schools and internships I had wanted, but I figured I should’ve gotten in anyways based on my grades and skills.

Everything I did, I did using every skill I had.  That included pleasuring myself.  I was settled on my knees, supporting my upper body with my left forearm, while I twisted my upper body and reached back behind me with my right.  In my delicate right hand, I held the plug.  I used my fingers to shift and press the metal point of the plug against my tight little asshole, deep between the thick cheeks of my ass.  I’d already poured a dash of lube against my asshole, and put another dab on the toy before I’d settled onto my knees and arm in front of the tall floor length mirror I had against my bedroom wall.  The metal plug, expensive and luxurious in both appearance and feel, was warm from the heat of my mouth, as I pulled it between my lips and teased my tongue against it.  It had filled my mouth, and I’d only withdrawn it once it was the right heat.  Then the lube, and now the teasing touch. 

I kept a steady pressure against my asshole, felt myself spreading as the plug flared from a narrow tip to its widest point.  It wasn’t difficult at the start – but the plug flared rapidly, and soon I felt my mouth spread wide as I marveled at how *huge* the plug felt against me.  I knew how big it was, had taken it in my mouth, had rubbed it in my hands.  But my ass had never been spread so wide.  I wished I was recording it, watching it slowly spread me as I kept that steady pressure, interspersed with sudden pulses of more force.  My glasses, the lenses themselves only slightly corrective but the frames a classic matte black style, were fogging as my breath grew hot and fast, and I bucked my head to try and nudge them back up my nose.  

I sat back, pushing my hips back as I lowered my ass towards my heels, towards the mirror, towards the *plug*.  Felt myself spreading wider and then–

–there was an audible pop as the plug tapered back to a narrow stem, my asshole immediately gripping it tightly.  Pushing the last centimeter of the stem, and the whole of the plug inside me, until the circular flange of white metal nestled tightly against my asshole.  Fuck.  I felt so full.  I’d been curious about anal for a long time, and I’d slid my fingers, or little safe objects I had on hand when I’d craved it in the past.  But it wasn’t until now, as a graduate student, 25 years old, that I’d bought myself a plug.  I wished I’d figured out a way to do it sooner – I’d let amazon order histories and worries of discovery from roommates or relatives scare me off too long.  

I groaned with pleasure as I felt the plug shifting inside me as I stood, pulling my skin-tight jeggings back up my fit legs.  I was foregoing panties for this date – not something I’d ever actually done before, but another kink I was curious about, one I read of and fantasized about.  It wasn’t like I’d never met my date before – hell, this was our *third* date, even if the furthest we’d gone on dates one and two was an incredibly good deep kiss.  The jeggings were every bit as tight as yoga pants, but were made of dark quality denim and other more elastic materials in the lining – invisible but ensuring they hugged every curve.  I chose a bralette, lacy and white, without a wire or much in the way of support, to settle over my high perky breasts, then slipped on the blouse I’d hung in the doorway before I’d started my little pleasure session.  

Five minutes later, after I gave myself a once over in the makeup mirror – I practiced the minimal make up look, the look that some men think actually includes *no makeup*, but still has some liner and foundation.  But it was light and breathable and quick to touch up.  I tied my hair up in a topknot, securing it with a navy ribbon, so dark it almost appeared black, matching the color of my jeggings.  

I grabbed my clutch, blushing as I felt the plug shift inside me once I started to move more naturally.  It was too late to rethink my decision – a glance at the little watch on my wrist was confirmation of that.  My heart raced as I left.

------------

My kinks are: uniforms / clothing – I like spending time undressing and revealing each other’s bodies, or having sex with yoga pants at my knees, or a skirt flipped up, etc; booty stuff – I like spanking, but I don’t like bruising or anything like that, and I don’t like scat – mostly playful spanking to turn my cheeks pink and make them sting a little, and if you’re good at it maybe a little harder, as well as just groping, kissing, gently biting; teasing (not verbally, but like stripteases, flashing, masturbating while the other person watches); sex outside of a bedroom (I don’t like being caught but I do like sort of mild exhibition or voyeur I guess – tough one to explain, and I don’t like dirty settings like alleyways); lingerie; D/s (I’m a switch and I don’t like passive partners – we should both be advancing the story); anal (probably could’ve put this with booty stuff – I like semi-realistic anal, with the exception in that I’m not going to write an enema and I’m just always going to be perfectly clean – I mean that working your finger in should take like two posts from both of us, as your knuckles gets stuck and you have to wiggle and pulse and spread me or give me instructions or get lube etc. No just sliding in.)
I have other kinks but since I was explaining the details that’s already pretty long.

 Limits: non-con, heavy pain, scat, gore, watersports. Also, please **don't** tell me your cock is *x* amount of inches long and *x* wide. **Just use adjectives. It's sexier.**

Partners of all genders equally welcome."

8duq2e,19,2018-04-21,Aoyama/Shinsou theory post,akamarulover,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8duq2e/aoyamashinsou_theory_post/,"So…I just had a thought.

A rather popular headcanon is for Shinsou to join class A. But for this to happen, one student would have to leave. So then who would it be? Thats what I want to talk about now, because there is one character in particular who stands out to me…

As we know, Shinsou told us that students can come under review and be transferred to lower class levels if they are underperforming. Well, in the race during the sports festival, Aoyama was the very last participant to qualify in the cutoff. 

In the Provisional License Exam, once again, he was the very last to qualify.

Not only that, but he almost did not qualify at all. Specifically, because he was planning on sacrificing his chance so his classmates could move on (without him)

The provisional license exam also showed us that he seems to have very little confidence in his actual ability. Also that he sees himself as having to become equal to the rest of his class. He seems to believe himself to be less than the other students :( 

Now then, we know that Aoyama is very much dependent on his support belt. And the panel stating that heroes who become overdependent on their gear in some cases may lose their equipment and become unable to perform their heroic duty, was placed in the same chapter that Aoyama opened up about this very weakness. I think that strongly hints at something bad happening involving his gear. Not only that, but Aoyama has suddenly been a focus in recent chapters. And by the pattern Horikoshi has set up (Todoroki &gt; tournament arc, Kirishima &gt; intern arc, Mirio &gt; Overhaul arc etc…) a sudden backstory means a BIG development for a character.

After talking with deku, we saw a shot of Aoyama's face which looked very troubled and definitely meant there is more to him than what he revealed. So his little character plot with Deku was just the tip of the iceberg. And why else would Deku be taken off the dance team and placed in the support team (with Aoyama!!), unless it were for Big Plot related reasons.

Finally, while its just a popular headcanon based on the apparent popularity of Shinsou, I think there IS some ground to it now, just maybe. In an interview, Horikoshi had said something involving Shinsou specifically in the plot will be happening sometime in early 2018 in the manga. 

Since Shinsou has done nothing notable yet, (and if Horikoshi wasn’t messing with us lmao), we can assume he merely underestimated the length of some arcs and that this “interesting development” has yet to happen. But I can guess now that it will be happening soon. 

Aoyama, however, HAS had a rather large focus in the manga recently. While he has been developed and given some backstory, he has not had his major Origin chapter yet. So there will be more Aoyama to come. In addition, the recent theme introduced in the Gentle fight was about bittersweet dreams and failed potential. Crushed dreams of one person (Gentle and LoveLover), in order to realize the dreams and goals of another person (Izuku’s and the other students culture festival)

So what if this theme continues? What if the fall of Gentle and LoveLover is just foreshadowing what is to come? Perhaps Aoyama’s future isn’t so much about about him realizing his potential, but rather him losing his ability to become a hero. Maybe Shinsou’s and Aoyama’s developments will both happen together, in Aoyama giving up his place in order for another person to succeed. "

It was easily the most excited I had been in ages but then she cancelled last minute and when I tried to reorganize said she was busy those times. Felt so stupid thinking she could possibly like me back and just went back home and took another 'sick day'. I feel completely empty since and just want to lock my self away. I don't talk to any of my friends or family about any of this and feel so lonely. "

##Serious part here
Creepy Asterisks is a subreddit that shows people, usually neck beards, role playing with ""uncomfortable and unsolicited asterisk actions."" The unfortunate receivers of these actions act in very comedic ways and overall make this a comedy subs. From here i'd like to leave it to the mods to explain the subreddit as they did a great job.

&gt;#1.Around when did this sub start to pick up a following? 

&gt;&gt;**deliteplays**  Well, there's a little bit of a backstory here. There was an incarnation of the sub (also called r/creepyasterisks) before the current one. Just when the sub was really catching on, the owner of the original sub very suddenly, dramatically, and mysteriously nuked his account and abandoned the sub. This resulted in quite an outcry. There were many rumors and stories about what had happened swirling around and being discussed in subs with similar content such as r/creepypms. Then, an alert and opportunistic fan of the original sub was able to gain ownership of the abandoned sub, and resurrected it. This would be our present Glorious Leader, u/Delite. Fortunately, the fans of the previous incarnation were still around, and were extremely happy to see the sub in operation again. So, here we are just a couple months later, and the sub is running well and gaining subscribers. We're really happy with the growth and progress.

&gt;#2.What are some defining posts? 

&gt;&gt;**deliteplays**  https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyasterisks/comments/7sk65z/slaps_you_with_dck/ This would definitely be one, although it didn't get as much attention at the time.

&gt;#3.Is it hard to manage this sub?

&gt;&gt;**deliteplays** At first it was kind of a clusterfuck. We had alot of mods all with different ideas of what the sub should be. It got rocky for a bit, to be sure. Once we established the rules and what kind of content we wanted in the sub, it got significantly easier to manage. We're still designing and redesigning, trying new things, etc. We rely on feedback from the community to help guide our development and decisions. We have great users who are very involved and conscious of the rules. They do a lot of self-moderating. They definitely let us know when something isn't agreeing with the rules and spirit of the sub.

&gt;#4.Have you ever had any big complaints about the server from people who use dashing asterisks?

&gt;&gt;**deliteplays** I'm assuming you mean -doing this- instead of doing *this*? Ironically, this situation was just being discussed by us when we were alerted of your questions. We were discussing making a clarification in the rules that submissions don't need to literally have asterisks in the post to be acceptable in the sub. Some people use dashes instead, some use other punctuation, some don't use any punctuation at all - but the creepyasterisk-y RP is obvious and heavily implied. These are all acceptable in the sub, at the descretion of the mods, of course.

&gt;#5.*Awoo*

&gt;&gt;**deliteplays** *gives you a wry smile, grabs you and brings your face close to mine OwO bulge grows signifying confidence*



If you have any other questions feel free to ask the moderators of the sub and I'd highly recommend joining their community!

I was wondering if anyone had any experience in getting possible credit hours for an internship? I had originally heard in Foundations of Engineering that it was possible, but with anything in that class, I took it with a grain of salt. I'm an IT major, and getting some electives taken care of, would be awesome.

Any ideas or suggestions?

Thanks in Advance."
8dwlyh,3,2018-04-21,"I want to spread my wings, but my parents don't want them open yet.",volfan68,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/8dwlyh/i_want_to_spread_my_wings_but_my_parents_dont/,"Just for context, I am currently at a university 400 miles away from my family's house. 

Last year, I wanted to do door to door sales (sophomore year of college) to get some money and also give me a chance to hone my selling skills. My parents did not allow me to do this because they did not think I was going to sell enough to survive. Fast forward to this year: I found a spot at better company for door to door. Additionally, my best friend from high school is currently on his second year after the first, in which he was the top rookie in the company. I wanted to try it out, so I flew to a preseason selling trip with him and did fairly well. I did that to see if I like the profession and I am cut out for it. After this trip, I was dead set on doing it this summer, specially considering that I did not get an internship for my major. I brought up the fact that I will do it this summer to my parents and they shot it down completely. There were many reasons why they did that: #1 was the fact that they would not be able to see me during the summer (and not winter break either since I have a Co- op right after in a different state). #2 Is that they don't think I would be able to make ends meet. 
They suggested that I stay back home and find a job there, but I really don't want to do that due to such a great opportunity waiting for me in selling. 
When I called them last night and emphasized the fact that it's commission- based, they began to scold and berate me, without any intent on hearing my thoughts and feelings. In the midst of them treating me like a child, I said ""Mom, Dad, I love you, but I am going to sell this summer, please respect my decision."" I immediately hung up the phone.
Fast forward to this morning: my sister calls me and tells me that my parents were a mess after our call and starts crying, begging me to not do it. 
This has been paining me, because I wanted to do door to door selling for a long time, but my parents have never even considered allowing me to do that. I will also miss my family, but this is the only time I can take this chance, as my next coming years are booked with work. 
All of my young adult life, my parents have treated me like a child when it comes to matters like this. I am tired of being broke and want to make enough money to help my parents pay for my college education, and I see this as an opportunity to do so. On top of everything, I want to be independent.

What are your thoughts on this situation?"

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you (for a celeb over 30) though still of legal age

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

8dy90v,2,2018-04-21,"Me [23F] with my Mom [52F], confronted her over a drinking/driving/smoking situation and need perspective.",needhelpmomstuff,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8dy90v/me_23f_with_my_mom_52f_confronted_her_over_a/,"TL;DR: My mom drove after drinking 1.5 bottles of wine, with an expired license, on 4/20 to grab a pack of smokes after I told her not to. She says she was fine and I'm being rude and judgemental. 

(Sorry, this is going to be a long post)

My Mom and I have always been at odds because we are similar. We're both passionate and care deeply about our beliefs - we just don't share the same core beliefs. This can get us into trouble and make fights escalate really quickly. I live at home because I have a series of internships lined up with school and I can't afford to rent a place to keep my things and live in other places. My parents have been great about this. 

Last night I had went out with a friend and she drove me, I was excited because that meant I could drink, and we were talking in my driveway when my mom messaged me asking me to pick up cigarettes for her. I told her I couldn't and she sent like 6 or 7 more messages trying to be lighthearted and convince me to go get her smokes. I told her I was already home and that I had had something to drink so I couldn't. She jokingly tried to guilt me but I started ignoring her.

I should mention now that I have had this problem with my mom before. Over the last year she's probably done this 6 or 7 times. My mom and dad share a car and I have my own, so I have also been asked to take her to get cigarettes when I pick her up from work or after I take her to grab groceries. I confronted her about it a few months ago and said that I don't condone her smoking and I can't be a vehicle for her to get cigarettes. She agreed and until last night did not ask me. 

Now, back to last night. I went inside and talked to my mom and she kept insisting. She needed me to go because her license expired and she hasn't renewed it yet. I told her no, and said that she should just go to bed because she had been drinking (she frequently comments that she really only wants a smoke when she's been drinking). (This makes it sound super bad, but my mom and dad are upper middle class, 9-5  jobs, vacation in Europe and Mexico every year, etc. )

This is where the problem is. I checked and she had finished one bottle of wine and had drank half of another bottle of wine, and she decided that even if I wasn't going to drive her she was going to go and get smokes. I told her that she shouldn't and I'd be disappointed with her if she did, but she went and drove to the store. 

When she got home we had a bit of a confrontation because I was arguing that she had drank over a bottle of wine, had an expired license, and drank and drove. I told her that she could have hurt someone, it was 4/20 and there were cops everywhere (the friend that drove me texted that she had seen someone get pulled over by the cops 30 seconds from my house). I was mad. 

She said that I was judging her for no good reason, that she had drank the 1.5 bottles of wine over 6 hours, that she wasn't ""drunk driving"" because she wasn't ""swerving, violent, aggressive "" and she was ""looking where she was going"". She then also said that I was coming after her and that she would be this ""mean"" the next time the basement was a mess. I told her that what she did was illegal, and a messy basement doesn't put lives at danger. Neither of us went to bed happy. 

My question is that I need help with perspective. I feel awful for calling her out, but there were things that I just couldn't ignore. I feel bad that I had something to drink because that means that I couldn't drive to the store for her. Is 1.5 bottles of wine over 6 hours okay to drive on? I researched and it meant that she probably had 7 or 8 servings of alcohol which has always been classified as binge drinking when I was taught about this stuff in school. How do I make this okay? 

Sorry this is way longer than I thought it would be. Any feedback is welcome. "

I am currently a sophomore in college pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I haven’t been able to acquire a co-op or internship for the summer and I’ve been wanting to monetize my programming experience while learning.
I have a decent amount of experience in Java, with exposure to C++, Web development languages(HTML, CSS, PHP, JS). While I predominantly want to be a back-end developer, I wouldn’t mind an attempt at front-end design. 
If anyone knows anything that could help me, it would be very appreciated!"

My slim waist, thick, muscular thighs, and perfectly toned stomach would catch anyone's eye.  But what made me a legend was the massive cock between my legs, difficult to conceal when soft, impossible to ignore hard.  And of course, and endless appetite to match my impressive endowments.

I came into my own in college, gaining a domineering attitude as I fucked my way through the girl's dorms and raided sororities, breaking the wills of every good girl I came across.  Whole teams fell to me and would regularly have me join them in the locker rooms after practice.  My favorite past time became working out in tight fitting spandex to show off my incredible physique and tease the gym rats with my impossible bulge.

After school, I wouldn't slow down, taking every cute secretary, coworker, client's wife or intern that crossed my path.  You can get away with that if every woman in HR is sending you dirty, begging texts.

I love showing off, so of course my snap chat, twitter, and instagram are full of provocative, teasing photos of me and my conquests.  My phone is constantly buzzing with texts and pics from girls I've fucked and those who have somehow gotten my number and want a taste.  Cam shows and live streaming have become a great second source of income, though if I'm being honest, I'd do it for free.

---------

So yes, this is over the top and ridiculous. That's the vibe I want and would love for you to embrace.  So where do you fit in? Are we back in college? Do you spy me in the gym? Are you the wife or daughter of one of my clients? Do you have some other idea? I love brainstorming scenes, so feel free to come with ideas or characters and we can build something.

Also, just because we're going crazy doesn't mean we need to skimp on details or rush through things.  I love teasing and slow build ups.  Good dialog is always a plus.

Other kinks I'm into but are not required: incest, BDSM, exhibition, public sex, lots of cum, overly endowed partners, penis and breast growth, penis pumps and cock rings, drugs

Not into: gore, piss, scat, lactation, feet, food"

Like mostly people my age, eventually I had a large falling out with my parents last week. However instead of the silent treatment and exchanging of passive aggressive texts, now I find myself asking for a stranger's help for the first time in my life. If you don't want to read the entire pitiful story, feel free to skip the next two paragraphs.

I grew up in a very conservative (read: strict and sometimes abusive) household with my father. I spent my entire life being a good student and a good daughter to the best of my ability, and trust me when I said I had a lot of reasons to rebel. However my father has, and continues to, impose a lot of restrictions upon me which has been incredibly stifling and almost unbearable at times. I went to a college near home in NY on a near full scholarship near him as he wanted me too, and had to let go of my dream school along the way. But seeing as I was a broke 18 year old who just graduated high school, I knew I had to take his offer. Up until this semester I even worked my butt off to afford my own living expenses so I wouldn't have to ask him for anything besides living in his home and being on his phone plan. It was hard, but I really took pride in my independence and not having to ask my father for anything. This semester I decided not to work to focus on studying for my LSAT, which my father agreed to help me do. However, with a renewal of my financial dependence on them things went to high hell between us. 

I lived at his home near my campus, while he travels through his various other residences and vacation spots throughout the world. He rents this home to other college students and lets me stay free and manage it for him. He found out I was seeing someone secretly last week, and you can imagine what happens next. He demanded I break up with my boyfriend, unenroll from college and move to the home country so that I could be monitored 24/7 by his family. Goldfish would have more rights than I would - you can imagine my response to that. The dating taboo is a cultural thing for them and they feel as if I betrayed their trust by doing so. My entire family has has disowned me. I had to refuse, as finishing college is the only route to financial freedom I have, I told him I refused. This led my father stating that I am no longer welcome in his home and that I must leave immediately, removing me from his phone plan and basically cutting all contact with me. Luckily, my college allowed me to move into the dorms temporarily and I had enough funds to pay for my phone plan this month. 

Due to these circumstances, money is extremely tight for me and I have to come up with money (around $300) for housing for my dorms soon. I have job interviews lined up for next month, and already have a good internship over the summer, and will also most likely have free housing over the summer due to a program at my school. Its just getting through this next month and finals that's my hurdle right now. If anyone reading this could help me, or even read through this long sad rant, I would be so, so thankful and will pay you back or pay it forward. Also I would welcome any other assistance with food/necessities and have an amazon wishlist I am updating tonight if you rather do it that way, as I read that many do on this subreddit.

Thank you again to all the wonderful people in this community, and I am willing to show you any documentation you need to prove my circumstances and need.

Edit: Thank you to all those who have helped me so far. I didn’t really expect anything to come from making a post on Reddit, but the response from strangers who are kinder to me than my family is being to me right now is really touching and humbling. I really don’t know how I can thank those who bought from my wishlist or who even just read my post and sent me an encouraging message. Really thank you, I will pay it forward when I am stable and on my feet "
8e099r,3,2018-04-21,Orbits and crashing in Star Trek,eneone19,startrek,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/8e099r/orbits_and_crashing_in_star_trek/,"Let me start by saying that I understand that the people who worked on the show probably did not know how orbital mechanics work so this is not a complaint. I also understand that most of the time ships crash for dramatic effect. I'm just trying to realistically understand how starships could hold the orbits shown in the series. 

I watched all of Star Trek originally when I was doing my undergrad in Physics and loved it. After that, I decided to get more seriously into space stuff (Master in Space Studies, internship at NASA, and of course Kerbal Space Program :D the BEST orbital mechanics teacher short of STK or GMAT) so now I understand a lot better how orbital mechanics works. Re-watching DS9 S1E12 reminded me that no matter what fault happens in Star Trek, the ships seem to always crash on some planet.

Since they never specify what orbit they're in, I was wondering if maybe because the engines of even the shuttles are very powerful, most spacecraft use their engines to maintain an orbit that is not passive, i.e. the spacecraft is not just orbiting using inertia.

For example, in a lot of shots of the Enterprise in TNG and TOS, the inclination of the orbit is 0 but the plane does not cross the planet's equator, it's raised. This suggests that the engines have to be kept active to maintain this orbit.

Or in the episode I was watching (DS9 S1E12) the shuttle is shot down by a satellite and falls. This again should mean that their orbital speed is slower than what it should be at their altitude, so once again they should be using their engines to keep it that way.

What do you guys think?"

I have a very hard time keeping up to speed and consistently find myself second guessing prescriptions and falling behind on promised times for scripts. I worked as an intern before and am very familiar with the computer system but have a lot of anxiety at work, I'm assuming due to fear of making a mistake. When I do final checks on prescriptions I worry about a wrong patient getting the wrong script and it causes me to check the name over and over sometimes. I have noticed this problem a while back and have been trying to force myself to only look once and move on, but have not been successful. Is there anyone who has had a similar hard time, and if so what worked for you to improve on your speeds? I feel like I'm in a downward spiral as I work at different stores around the district and I feel I already have a bad reputation as a slow pharmacist, in addition to the already negative attitude that usually comes with me not being a stores regular pharmacist and this feeling that I'm already unwanted makes me more anxious and tends to make me second guess more.

It’s an uncommon profession and you likely stumbled into it by accident. I’m the girl that must interview you for the position.

Specifically, I play the personal assistant of the multi-billionaire (who I have mentally tagged as “Howard the Duck”) who seeks to employ you. It’s more a college internship position that I got, because my dad is a friend of the big boss. In a world of tall, utterly statuesque ice-blond beauties with size zero frames and perfectly coiffed hair, I stand out like a sore thumb. I’m more pat-me-on-the-head-short and curvy; a pocket Venus with ripe breasts, hips, and more “junk in the trunk” than I want. I’m still working off my “Freshman Ten.”

My face is girl-next-door good looks with dark hair and almond eyes. Unlike the fair skinned beauties that my boss favors, I’m an ambiguous mix of Italian and Filipino genes. 

I’ve a list of terms and wide-ranging kinks that I barely understand and which my boss wants you familiar. Some I get, “group sex,” MFF and MMF and bondage and the list continues. It’s my job to ensure that you’re the right man to train my boss’s fiance and expose her to most of the kinks on the check list I was given. 

I’m going to conceal the fact that I consider you, my boss, and everyone associated with this organization rather disgusting. The women who are brought in and trained and enter into fifty page personal assistant/adult entertainer contracts are borderline slaves in my opinion, even if they are paid very well. 

Once you are hired, you’ll be training the boss’s future wife as well as other women, but we’ll interact routinely as we meet walking about the estate—you perhaps leading a size zero blonde on a leash—or over lunch and we’ll get to know each other. 

What I won’t confess is the fact that I’ve begun masturbating at night to images of you training these women. I’ve fantasized about being trained by you. I’ve fantasized about being one of the boss’s projects even if it means I’ll be “sold/employed” overseas for an extended period of time. 

It’s a fantasy, but an incredibly vivid fantasy, because I spy on your daily, watching you train these women, fuck them. Watching you direct other men to use and fuck them. It’s getting hard to pretend I despise you when I want me to be the woman you’re touching. 

Unfortunately, my boss has become aware that his old college friend’s sweet young daughter is rather obsessed with one of his more promising trainers. 

[We can discuss and rewrite sections of this setup. No to bestiality, necrophilia, vore, gore, water sports, scat, underage material. But yes to hot, sweaty sex, group sex, one-on-one sex, handcuffs, spankings, name calling, slave-training, piercings, and a long, long list of additional kinks. I'll write the roles for any additional woman. We won't address every scene involving those other woman, but when it makes sense, I'll help write those scenes.]

8e1mzx,3,2018-04-22,I feel like I'm useless,Taomc999,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8e1mzx/i_feel_like_im_useless/,"Hello guys, 


I'm posting because in the first after 5 years, I just had a suicidal thought and I have no one to talk and to get it out of my chest.


5 years ago, I had a really bad fight with my parents and my sister, and seriously, it was the worst day in my life. On that night, I tried to hang myself, but just before I lost my concious, my father saved me. During that time, I had a really amazing girlfriend and she gave me a lot of support to get out from my depression and suicidal thoughts. She moved to my house, and we lived together for about 6 months or so. During this time, I got a scholarship from a studying abroad program to live for 1 year on US. I had a serious talk with my girlfriend and she said I should go to US, because it was the right choice for our future and she will wait for me. One month before my travel, her father died and she lost herself. I tried to gave her the same support that I had, I missed 2 entire weeks from my college classes just to be on her side the entire day and do anything that she could needed. I said that I was going to give up my scholarship and I wouldn't travel because she needed me, but she was against the idea and said it will be alright. 


During my first month on the studying abroad program, she changed the way that she normally talked to me, and I knew that she was going to breakup with me. It was a terrible day, my roommates tried to cheer me up, and they pick a random movie to watch with me, and it was the last movie that I watched with her. That day I lost my world, my love, and I think I lost my life too. I tried to kill myself again on my room, but the knife that I took wasn't sharp enough to do it. I think my roommates notice it and they literally removed every sharp thing that we have on the dorm from my sight. 


So after this suicidal try, I had a really good time with my roommates and a couple of friends that I made during my studying abroad program, but I was sure that whenever I get back to my country, my world would be destroyed and all my sadness would return. 


When I get back, I had no friends, my relationship with my family wasn't the same since the fight, everything that I had was my ex-girlfriend, and now, I had only memories from moments that we had on my house. I tried to get over it and it worked for a while. I got back to my college classes, started to look for a internship and then, it started all again. 


I couldn't get a internship, I was going really well on my classes, but every interview that I had, they said I was a good student and probably a good worker, but I didn't have the profile that the company was looking for. And I started to feel that I'm useless, that everything I worked hard my entire life felt apart because I don't have the ""profile"".


During this new low time on my life, I met a new girlfriend, but I don't know if I was depressed enough or if I tried to don't see it before, she was a big liar and she didn't loved me, she tried to destroy the very few friends that I have (I have like 10 friends in total right now, but I feel that they don't care about me). She also tried to destroy the relationship that I have with my family.  But the day that I notice this was on my graduation day.


One month ago, I had my graduation day, I invited my girlfriend and said it was a really important day, and I want her with me on that moment. She said she was coming, but a hour before I met her, she said she was sick and was in the hospital and couldn't come to my graduation day. That day I felt so alone, I felt that nobody else in the world cared about me, I felt that the only person that cared about my was my girlfriend that broke up with 5 years go. So I tried to understand that maybe she was really sick and it wasn't her fault, and I asked if I could see the results from her medical exams, and she got really mad with me and stopped talking with me for about 3-4 days in a row. 


After this, she always have a excuse about meeting me, saying she had a lot of jobs to do, saying that she needs to study, and I knew something was off. Then, last week, I said I couldn't take it anymore, and I was breaking up. She got really mad, said I was a monster, and I would die alone, that my ex-girlfriend did the right thing and she only lost her time with me, that I deserved nothing on my life. And that destroyed me. I was alone, destroyed, depressed and now I had someone that I really cared saying tough stuff to me. But I was trying to keep going, keep trying to be happy. I am taking some data engineering classes so I can try to find a good job, and I'm getting really tired from studying. So last Saturday, I arrived at home tired (I'm living with my parents now) and my mom showed me the Facebook from my ex (the one from the graduation day) and she had a post about being in a new relationship with guy since one day before my graduation. And that was the last hit that destroyed me. I feel like I will never meet someone that loves me like my first girlfriend did, I feel like I have no friends, like will never get a job, I feel that my family doesn't understand me and put a really heavy weight on my back. I feel like I'm carrying the world right now.


And today, I started having suicidal thoughts again. I want to disappear, I want to die, I feel that everybody try to blame me about everything bad that happens, so I think I will do everyone a favor if I just disappear. And I have no idea what to do right now. I feel like I'm hopeless and will never have a happy life.


Sorry about any grammar mistake, and about the text lenght, I wanted to get it out of my chest because I'm feeling that I'm about to lose this battle, this war, and I don't expect anyone to read everything and answer me. 

I love you all guys, and I'm so sorry about being this monster and this trash that I am..."

I have psoriasis on 90% of my body including scalp, and the only ones not affected are the back of my knees and my fingers. I stopped sweating most likely due to Methotrexate, and I'm really scared of going back to taking steroids. I've done photo therapy but stopped because it was too expensive and my schedule just won't allow it. I have one last semester before I graduate and I feel like I might not make it anymore because of this condition.

One time I had an argument with my parents because I needed to go to school for my thesis presentation on the day of my photo therapy schedule and they angrily asked me if I prioritize my health or school. At this point though, I couldn't care less. I might not proceed with my summer internship because being outside in the heat increases my risk of heat stroke, and I've ended up hyperventilating in the school's clinic more than once.

I've seriously considered suicide over the years, and I can't talk to my friends about it because I don't want to burden them with my shit anymore. I'm tired of going back to dermatologists who are just going to prescribe the same stuff again and again. I want to stop being a costly burden to my parents too.

Older people kept telling me to just relax BUT I DON'T FUCKING KNOW HOW TO!! When I ask them how they just repeat the same thing!! How can I relax when I'm in constant pain and the shedding of dead skin falling on my food and water and the three hour every day commute to the hospital and university and the judging looks of people who refuse to sit next to me in public vehicles stacking up?? I wish I could just disappear and never come back."
8e3677,50,2018-04-22,"Today is the birthday of Catholic priest José Arizmendiarrieta (1915-1976), the founder of the Mondragon co-operative movement. He valued labor over capital, a right to life humanism of work, and set in motion what is probably the most successful experiment yet in Catholic distributism.",lilyonce,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/8e3677/today_is_the_birthday_of_catholic_priest_josé/,"Today is the birthday of Roman Catholic priest José María Arizmendiarrieta Madariaga, Father Arizmendi as he was known. He is widely credited with the founding of the Mondragon co-operative movement in the Spanish Basque Country in the 1940s.

From *The origins of Mondragon: Catholic co-operativism and social movement in a Basque valley (1941–59)* as it appeared in the Journal of Social History Vol. 33 2008:

In 1972, British economist Robert Oakeshott discovered in a Parisian library an extensive report by the Centre de Recherches Cooperatives of the E´cole Pratique des Hautes E´tudes on a littleknown group of co-operatives located in the Basque city of Mondragon, Spain. Intrigued by the report, he traveled to this entrepreneurial centre, and the results of his visit were published in *The Observer* in January 1973. He defined Mondragon as an ‘oasis of democracy’ within General Franco’s dictatorship; the result of a singular ‘alliance between the Catholic church and technology’, inspired by a priest and a group of young businessmen ‘engaged in an exciting attempt to reconcile modern industry with social justice and democracy’.

Arizmendiarrieta’s entrepreneurial leadership was not ethnic but social, exercised not as a capitalist businessman but as a social movement entrepreneur. All social movements construct collective action frames in order to create a contentious identity, and social Catholicism can be seen as an exercise in the implementation of papal encyclicals, church propaganda and sermons, taken as discursively elaborated realities. These gave rise to entrepreneurial initiatives such as Mondragon, possibly the most unusual in twentieth century Europe.

Arizmendiarrieta was born in 1915 on a farm in the Spanish-Basque town of Markina. He studied in the Seminary of the Diocese of Vitoria, which was then the most prominent educational centre of the Spanish Catholic church. He was educated by a brilliant generation of intellectual priests committed to the social question and what Catholics called the ‘redemption of the worker’s world’. Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical *Rerum Novarum* (1891) had provided the practical content for the church to articulate an integral social initiative in response to the clashes arising from the new economic thought of the age.

*The Social Code*, written by Cardinal Mercier at the University of Malinas (1920), and the papal encyclical *Quadragessimo Anno* (1931) by Pius XI completed the triad of reference texts for European social Catholicism in the inter-war period. 

Arizmendi was influenced by two priests with modern perspectives on sociology and anthropology, the most advanced Catholic social doctrine, and virtuous notions of life and work.

Years later, Arizmendiarrieta remembered how his instructors introduced him to the journal *Esprit* and the innovative social ideas of French Catholic philosophers, especially Jacques Maritain and Emmanuel Mounier. Their proposals had come alive in various Catholic social initiatives by francophone states and their entrepreneurial elites. Among their strategies to reduce social conflict during those years of economic crisis, one that had already proven its worth was co-operativism, which had been successfully applied in Belgium.

Arizmendiarrieta also absorbed two key objectives from the numerous works of Joaquin Azpiazu. This Basque Jesuit had unfailingly publicized social Catholicism, and was one of the most widely read ideologues among seminary students. Azpiazu would go on to inspire the social legislation of the Franco regime, stating that if the church wanted to (i) recover the trust of the masses and (ii) stop the advance of communism, it needed to re-evaluate its view of private property by recognizing its social nature and subjecting it to the common good and higher rights, such as the right to life.

Arizmendiarrieta arrived back in the Basque Country after the Spanish Civil War and began to promote apostleship for the working world. After their classes at the School of Apprentices or work in the factories and shops, hundreds of young people would come to hear him speak on sociological and theological topics at the Catholic Action centres of Mondragon or at the School of Apprentices. Little by little he formed a core group of those who consistently participated in the social activities he promoted. They gradually took on leadership and management tasks, according to their age and ability. Arizmendiarrieta began to teach them classic values from Catholic social doctrine, which they applied in their local milieu: enthusiasm for work, austerity in the social sphere, dedication and sacrifice for community ideals, faith in social initiatives, selfexamination and personal integrity in collective tasks. These were the ethical bases for the future co-operativist culture in Mondragon.

Professional training became the main pillar of Arizmendiarrieta’s social work in Mondragon. The working class could not be redeemed without a modern technical education. On 10 August 1943, under the banner of ‘socializing knowledge to democratize power’, Arizmendiarrieta launched the Professional School of Mondragon with the financial support of local companies. Youth from the lowest ranks could now invest their only asset, their own personal effort, in order to improve their skills. While they studied, they also did internships in local companies, applying their knowledge and learning responsibility. Each student also received a thorough moral and social education based on a modern reading of social Catholicism.

His students graduated and went on to become managers in local industry but that would not satisfy his vision for the region.

In his commencement address for the Professional School’s graduating class of 1948, Arizmendiarrieta announced that the time had come to unite the efforts of all these social actors into one institutionalized co-operative initiative. ‘It is not enough for the bosses to do good works; the workers need to participate in them also. It is not enough for the workers to dream great reforms, the bosses need to concur. It is not enough for the authorities to make great efforts and sacrifices, the people need to associate themselves with these authorities.’ Some sort of corporative entity was needed to facilitate co-operation between two classes for a common good, and to provide a Catholic social alternative to Marxist class conflict.

Arizmendiarrieta felt the need to get past the philosophy of charitable donations by businesses, replacing it with a true system of social justice that would involve the workers in the management of the company and its capital. After a clash with the largest employer in the region, the first Mondragon co-operative would be founded.

Arizmendiarrieta’s ideal company would go beyond a mercantile and economic society dedicated to satisfying the private interests of its investors. It would spearhead a complex social movement based on **principles of self-management, subordination of capital to labour and Christian communitarian ethics**.

There had to be **co-operation at every level: between social classes, institutions, generations, public and private sectors, believers and non-believers, priests and laity, Basque and Spanish nationalists, left- and right-wing parties, liberals and Marxists, employers and employees, men and women**. This required a religious sensitivity that could soften hard-line ideological or patriotic positions, unite ideals and encourage the sacrifice of individual longings for the good of the community of workers and the community at large.

On 20 October 1955 the three former Union Cerrajera factory heads and two others from Arizmendiarrieta’s group purchased a Vitoria company that manufactured gasoline burners, thus creating Ulgor, the first co-operative of its kind (currently known as Fagor Electrodomesticos). In 1958, Ulgor began to manufacture, under Italian patents, household appliances that used a revolutionary energy source: butane gas. Their appliances and electronic products were in line with the needs of Spanish consumers during the modernization era of the 1960s, giving the company spectacular success. Arizmendiarrieta spent four years developing the statutes of Ulgor, and the result was not at all orthodox vis-a`-vis the criteria established in the 1942 Law on Co-operation, which had a strong Fascist tendency that Arizmendiarrieta rejected. None the less, the Ulgor statutes were approved in April 1959, launching a socio-entrepreneurial movement that in 1967 would be labelled ‘the Mondragon co-operative experience’. **All its workers participated as partners in the company, with an equal share of capital, thus becoming its owners**.

Other co-operatives began to appear and soon after, the Caja Laboral credit union.

Today Mondragon has 74,335 workers. 257 companies. Organized in four areas of activity: Finance, Industry, Retail and Knowledge. It faces many new challenges in the globalized economy but if it pulls through them without sacrificing its principles, it will continue to serve as an example of Christian economics in practice."

He valued labor over capital, a right to life humanism of work, and set in motion what is probably the most successful experiment yet in Catholic distributism.",lilyonce,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/8e3868/today_is_the_birthday_of_catholic_priest_josé/,"Today is the birthday of Roman Catholic priest José María Arizmendiarrieta Madariaga, Father Arizmendi as he was known. He is widely credited with the founding of the Mondragon co-operative movement in the Spanish Basque Country in the 1940s.

From *The origins of Mondragon: Catholic co-operativism and social movement in a Basque valley (1941–59)* as it appeared in the Journal of Social History Vol. 33 2008:

In 1972, British economist Robert Oakeshott discovered in a Parisian library an extensive report by the Centre de Recherches Cooperatives of the E´cole Pratique des Hautes E´tudes on a littleknown group of co-operatives located in the Basque city of Mondragon, Spain. Intrigued by the report, he traveled to this entrepreneurial centre, and the results of his visit were published in *The Observer* in January 1973. He defined Mondragon as an ‘oasis of democracy’ within General Franco’s dictatorship; the result of a singular ‘alliance between the Catholic church and technology’, inspired by a priest and a group of young businessmen ‘engaged in an exciting attempt to reconcile modern industry with social justice and democracy’.

Arizmendiarrieta’s entrepreneurial leadership was not ethnic but social, exercised not as a capitalist businessman but as a social movement entrepreneur. All social movements construct collective action frames in order to create a contentious identity, and social Catholicism can be seen as an exercise in the implementation of papal encyclicals, church propaganda and sermons, taken as discursively elaborated realities. These gave rise to entrepreneurial initiatives such as Mondragon, possibly the most unusual in twentieth century Europe.

Arizmendiarrieta was born in 1915 on a farm in the Spanish-Basque town of Markina. He studied in the Seminary of the Diocese of Vitoria, which was then the most prominent educational centre of the Spanish Catholic church. He was educated by a brilliant generation of intellectual priests committed to the social question and what Catholics called the ‘redemption of the worker’s world’. Pope Leo XIII’s encyclical *Rerum Novarum* (1891) had provided the practical content for the church to articulate an integral social initiative in response to the clashes arising from the new economic thought of the age.

*The Social Code*, written by Cardinal Mercier at the University of Malinas (1920), and the papal encyclical *Quadragessimo Anno* (1931) by Pius XI completed the triad of reference texts for European social Catholicism in the inter-war period.

Arizmendiarrieta was influenced by two priests with modern perspectives in sociology and anthropology, the most advanced Catholic social doctrine, and virtuous notions of life and work.

Years later, Arizmendiarrieta remembered how his instructors introduced him to the journal *Esprit* and the innovative social ideas of French Catholic philosophers, especially Jacques Maritain and Emmanuel Mounier. Their proposals had come alive in various Catholic social initiatives by francophone states and their entrepreneurial elites. Among their strategies to reduce social conflict during those years of economic crisis, one that had already proven its worth was co-operativism, which had been successfully applied in Belgium.

Arizmendiarrieta also absorbed two key objectives from the numerous works of Joaquin Azpiazu. This Basque Jesuit had unfailingly publicized social Catholicism, and was one of the most widely read ideologues among seminary students. Azpiazu would go on to inspire the social legislation of the Franco regime, stating that if the church wanted to (i) recover the trust of the masses and (ii) stop the advance of communism, it needed to re-evaluate its view of private property by recognizing its social nature and subjecting it to the common good and higher rights, such as the right to life.

Arizmendiarrieta arrived back in the Basque Country after the Spanish Civil War and began to promote apostleship for the working world. After their classes at the School of Apprentices or work in the factories and shops, hundreds of young people would come to hear him speak on sociological and theological topics at the Catholic Action centres of Mondragon or at the School of Apprentices. Little by little he formed a core group of those who consistently participated in the social activities he promoted. They gradually took on leadership and management tasks, according to their age and ability. Arizmendiarrieta began to teach them classic values from Catholic social doctrine, which they applied in their local milieu: enthusiasm for work, austerity in the social sphere, dedication and sacrifice for community ideals, faith in social initiatives, selfexamination and personal integrity in collective tasks. These were the ethical bases for the future co-operativist culture in Mondragon.

Professional training became the main pillar of Arizmendiarrieta’s social work in Mondragon. The working class could not be redeemed without a modern technical education. On 10 August 1943, under the banner of ‘socializing knowledge to democratize power’, Arizmendiarrieta launched the Professional School of Mondragon with the financial support of local companies.

However I have one glaring hole. I hardly have any non-clinical volunteering. I'm a WA resident and would really like to get into either of the two state schools. But they both seem to be be focused on applicants that have had extensive volunteering with underserved populations. I'm very interested in working with rural/underserved populations, but i don't think my volunteering reflects that wish. Am i setting myself up for failure this cycle with a lack of non-clinical volunteering? Below are my stats/experiences for reference.

Year in School: Graduated in 2017 State of residence: Washington (went to UofW) Major: Neurobiology

Schools to which you're applying: University of Washington, Washington State, University of Vermont, University of Colorado, Oregon Health Sciences, Vanderbilt, Dartmouth, University of Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, University of Michigan, Mayo clinic AZ, Rochester, Rosalind Franklin, Einstein, Emory, University of Arizona, Tufts, Drexel. I'm open to DOs as well but haven't done much research on them yet (definitely will apply to more but haven't finished school list)

Cumulative gpa: 3.71 Science gpa: 3.55 MCAT Score: 517 (129/127/131/130)

Research: about 500 hours in a pharmacology lab studying GPCRs. Mid level author on a paper and low level author on another. Also did research in a neurobiology lab and presented a poster

Volunteering (clinical): about 250 hours on various units at Swedish hospital through a healthcare internship program. Worked on med/surg, neurology, neuro ICU, and primary care. Also volunteered at an underserved population primary care clinic for about 50 hours

Shadowing: 12 hours w/ a neurosurgeon, about 20 with a neurologist in an autism clinic and a traumatic brain injury clinic. 10 hours w/ a primary care physician

Non-clinical volunteering: I'm lacking in this department...about 25 hours helping to run a food drive in my home town. Helped coordinate an auto show/auction that raised money for Seattle Children's (about 15 hours). About 30 hours at an animal shelter

Extracurricular: Skiing, backpacking, and hiking as often as I can, was part of a few clubs for outdoor activities at UW. Rock climbing club. Love to travel. Love the music scene in Seattle and going to shows. Intramural basketball, neuroscience club. Never held leadership spots in these clubs

Employment History: Had to pay my way through college w/ minimal loans so i worked a lot. Associate manager at a pizza restaurant during the first half of freshman year. About 30 hours a week during freshman and sophomore year working in the UW kitchens and cafes. Junior and senior year i worked about 2 hours a week bussing, serving, and shift managing at a breakfast cafe. It was in the top 1% for busiest restaurants in the country and i learned a ton about task management, customer service, and just pushing through a long, tough day. I now work at a non-profit eye and tissue bank coordinating recoveries and advocating for donation with donor families. I get to work w/ nurses, doctors, medical examiners, and decedent/recipient families on a daily basis and I love it. It has been great experience in dealing with death/sickness/empathy with families, as well as interacting w/ people all across the medical field. The company also is committed to ending corneal blindness around the world in the next 20 years and each employee gets to work on projects to work towards this goal. I plan on keeping this job until I (hopefully) matriculate in fall 2019

Family in medicine?: No, I'm the first to go to college in my family

Specialty of interest?: Primary care, neurology, EM, possibly ortho

Interest in rural health?: Yes, very interested

I know my leadership and non-clinical volunteering are pretty weak. I worked a ton through school and it definitely affected how much time i had to get things done outside of school. But I think I've gained a lot of great experience in the working world learning how to interact w/ and manage people in stressful and highly emotional situations, which could really pay off in interviews and the people skills side of medicine. Let me know what you guys think. I would appreciate some very honest feedback

Thank you everybody!"

I'm especially a fan of the two biggest AUs (that I know of so far...tbh)

**The P5 Flower Child AU by P5FlowerChild**

*  Tatsuya and Jun from Persona 2 are a couple and are Ren's adoptive parents

*  Ren lives with them, rather than Sojiro

*  The game wasn't released at the time, so Ren is a Phantom Thief in the real world rather than the Metaverse.  To the point where he makes his Joker outfit after Jun teaches him how to sew.  The Phantom Thief aesthetic is inspired by all the Phantom Thief manga that Jun used to read him.

*  Tatsuya is the main detective assigned to take down the Phantom Thieves, creating an interesting dynamic between him and Ren where Ren has to keep his identity a secret.  Also there's a cool moment where they're forced to reluctantly team-up with each other against an enemy and Tatsuya is forced to bring Apollo back to fight.

*  Jun pieces together that Ren is Joker after certain things fall into place.  Ren's picture as ""The Phantom"" is shown on the news and Jun recognizes his son, with further evidence coming when he hears on the report that a calling card was left in the form of an orange lily (meant to symbolize revenge in flower language, the reason Ren steals a certain item) and Jun taught Ren all about flower language.  One night he finds Ren sneaking into his room as Joker, and reveals he knew the entire time(partly because he left his Phantom Thief jacket in the laundry).  Ren reveals to his parents that he and his friends are the Phantom Thieves.  Tatsuya is resistant at first, but comes around (but not before Ren gives them both PTSD because of his codename).

*  Lisa might be Ann's mom and Maya is Yuuki's mom

*  Eikichi is part owner of LeBlanc with Sojiro

* ...Ren may or may not be in a relationship with Yusuke going by the Valentine's Day comic (Like Fathers like son?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Adult Confidant AU by ScruffyTurtles (note: not a huge amount of info is out on this, so I'm going to be speculating on a few aspects)**

*  Sojiro, Iwai, Toranosuke, Sae, Tae, Kawakami, Ohya, and Chihaya ages are switched with the main cast and they become the Phantom Thieves with Sojiro as the leader

* Toranosuke is the student council President at Shujin, Tae is a first year college student who interns at a local hospital, Kawakami is a Student Rep and T.A. (and works at the maid cafe for a part time job),  Iwai is a delinquent (possibly serving Ryuji's role as Sojiro's first companion), Ohya is the president of the newspaper club, Chihaya goes to Kosei High(Hifumi's and Yusuke's school) and is part of the astrology club, and...no word on Sae yet.

*  From the looks of things, all the villains are de-aged as well since Kamoshida is referred to as the star of the school volleyball team rather than the coach.

* The roles of a couple of the main cast are confirmed.  Futaba is Sojiro's caretaker much like Sojiro was for Ren and Makoto is the police commissioner (and takes on Sae's role in the story since Sae is off being a Phantom Thief).  Wakaba is confirmed to have existed but her status is exactly the same as in canon(more on that in the speculations)


* Sojiro's Phantom Thieves identity is 'Boss', and he has a Phantom Thief costume that's a mix between Ren's Joker suit and a hunter from Bloodborne.  Iwai's seems to have a lizard mask(leading me to believe his codename will be Gecko), and Tae has a plague doctor's.

*Speculation Time!*

*  Wakaba might be Futaba's daughter instead of her Mom going by the piece of art where Sojiro said they don't talk about Wakaba because it makes Futaba sad.  Would explain why Futaba is a shut-in and stays up all night [Spoiler](/s ""Considering I imagine any parent witnessing their child's ""suicide"" would be a bit traumatized.  Just imagine that, Futaba chasing after Wakaba after she accidentally embarrasses her in front of Sojiro or something and while she's running off in a huff she suddenly stops short and starts shaking. Her eyes go blank and she starts leaking a black liquid from her eyes and mouth.  The last thing Futaba sees of her daughter is her collapsing in the middle of traffic where she's hit by a car and dies."")

*  Ren's role is difficult to place.  I've thought of everything I could for him. Him being Wakaba's dad and Futaba's ex-husband where they divorced after she pushed him away after what happened to Wakaba. Maybe Sojiro's social link with her being about helping her let go of the past and helping them get back together.  Maybe Ren acts as Sojiro's mentor in Thievery instead of Morgana. I haven't heard a single mention of Morgana by ScruffyTurtles so far, so maybe that's the case.  Maybe Ren [Spoiler](/s ""turns out to be real Igor's shadow construct instead of Morgana"").  Or...he could potentially not be involved at all :-(  The only reason why he was involved in the main game in the first place was the situation with Shido.  Maybe he could fill a role similar to Marie from Persona 4: Golden where [Spoiler](/s ""He's a split off piece of Yaldabaoth"") 

* [Spoiler] (/s ""Shido's and Akechi's roles could be reversed, with Shido taking on role of traitor and sociopath.  What reason does he have to kill Wakaba?  Anything from petty reasons such as turning him down for a date (AKA Full Mitsuo Syndrome) to doing it by accident and getting a taste for blood"")

*  Mishima I could easily see filling a Baofu from Persona 2 kind of role.  Hifumi could fill the same role as before, except she could be more of a washout from pro shogi.  Shinya I could see taking on Iwai's former role as gunsmith for the team, possibly still teaching Sojiro gun moves.

*  No clue what Ann, Ryuji, Yusuke or Haru would do though.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now that the explanations out of the way, I just want to talk about some random Persona 5 AUs I came up with in my head.

**Human Morgana AU**

Okay this is less of an AU and more an alternate story path that I came up with randomly on a discussion post on an image of Morgana [seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/8c2ui9/human_morgana_by_ad_astra/).  Basically I thought up a random dialogue about an alternate way the initial confrontation Haru and Morgana had with Sugimura after leaving Mementos.

Morgana:  Haru, no.  This....This is all my fault.  Why do I have to be so weak?  Like this I can't protect anyone.  If only I was human. I could...No it doesn't matter, I'm not as strong as they are anyway. I'm sorry guys. I guess I really am useless after all.

*Voice From Inside Head* :  Are you going to give up?

Morgana:  What?

*Voice From Inside Head* :  Are you going to continue to allow your friend to be hurt?  Will you fail the task I gave you?

Morgana:  The...the task? I...I...no. NO! I won't let him hurt Haru! I don't care if I'm human or not, I won't allow anyone to hurt my friends.

Sugimura:  Come on, we're getting married anyway.  Let's just have some fun before the honeymoon

Haru:  No, let me go!

*They both hear hissing in the background*

Haru:  M-mona?!

Sugimura:  Great, what does that flea bitten thing want....now?

*They stare at the now human Morgana*

Morgana(a bit shaken):  D-don't. You. TOUCH HER!

*Morgana charges forth and punches him to the ground*

Sugimura:  Grr...first the cat and now this impudent little runt.  How dare you get involved in my affairs?!

*He then starts attacking Morgana, while Haru screams and begs him to stop while holding him back.  Sugimura smacks her down and Morgana goes for the counterattack in rage*

*The rest of the team shows up, and Ryuji saves Morgana*

Sugimura:  This isn't over Okumura, when I tell your father about this you can count on it.

*Sugimura leaves as Morgana collapses to the ground*

Ryuji:  Who was that guy?  And where's Morgana?

Haru(standing over Morgana in tears):  Mona? W-wake up, please

Ryuji:  Wait that's Morgana?!

Ann:  But he's...

Makoto: No way

Morgana(in pain): Are...are you okay?

Haru(sniffling ):  Of course, you saved me.  I'm so sorry this happened.

Morgana(smiling):  Don't be, I'm just glad you're alright.  *Looks at the team*  I'm sorry I was such a jerk guys, especially to you Sk...I mean especially to you Ryuji. Thanks for having my back.

Ryuji:  Oh, N-no problem man

Morgana(Cheshire grin):  Even though I bet I could've taken him myself *Coughs blood*  O-Okay...maybe not.

Yusuke:  Come on, we need to get you medical attention

*Team leaves and takes him to Tae's clinic*


So yeah not too much changes other than Morgana is human in the real world from now on I guess.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Persona 5: Onyx (Random story that I might not even do)**

This stuff I came up with randomly while working on a story about Shiho.  Basically it goes sort of like this

* Shiho and Ann switch places in the story, with Ann giving in to Kamoshida to ensure Shiho's safety but commits suicide after something happens.  Shiho finds out about the abuse when she accidentally goes into the Metaverse, which destroys her emotionally.  Ren brings her back from the brink, and Shiho awakens her Persona rather than being consumed by her Shadow.  I think her Persona was Fillibus but I think for the full story I was planning to have it be Boudicca instead.

&gt;""SHUT UP!"" Shiho yelled, ""You hurt me, you've bullied the volleyball team into fearing your abuse, and worst of all you forced yourself on my best friend and hurt her in a way that can never be fixed. I will make you suffer! I! WILL! MAKE! YOU! PAY!""

&gt;**It's about time you finally fought back**

&gt;Shiho felt a slight pain in her head, causing her to gasp

&gt;**This man has made you and others suffer for far too long**

&gt;Shiho began struggling against her bonds, writhing in apparent agony

&gt;**It's time we forge a contract to avenge your comrades in arms**

&gt;**I Am Thou**

&gt;**Thou Art I**

&gt;**Be free from your cage**

&gt;**Spread your wings**

&gt;**AND RAIN DOWN HELLFIRE FROM THE SKIES ABOVE**

- Quoted Text from the original one-shot


* There's a few other things too, like Yuuki joining the team with Dr. Jekyll as his Persona and Hifumi joining with Fillibus (like I said, Shiho's would probably be changed to Boudicca which would probably fit her better.  Warrior woman taking revenge after being tortured and being forced to watch her daughters be raped...yeah i could definitely see that for this version of Shiho).  I'm not 100% sure whether they'd be additions or replacements, or hell if whether or not Ann is benched for good.

As for the rest of my ideas...well that will require a hell of a lot of explanation

*  For starters the story involves time being reset to Ren's first day.  Why?  Well...the return to prominence of two important figures, one good and one bad. Either Ren's memories are hazy to prevent him from changing history too much (such as going after Futaba's palace first), or any attempts to change it results in drastic consequences.  

*  The changes in the timeline allow for former characters to return.  People called Akechi the second coming of the Detective Prince, so let's see how well he'd do if Naoto is brought in on the Phantom Thieves investigation.  Same to how much Sae would butt heads with the Suou brothers. (And Original Tatsuya might make a return)

*  And more story twists and turns.  The traitor is changed, the motives are changed, characters that were relatively useless( *cough* SIU Director *cough*) are given time for expansion and do more besides just look evil, what happens in the end changes, certain story elements change thanks to Ren's advanced knowledge(possibly), someone besides Ren might still have their memories intact(but who knows).



So....actual discussion time...think up cool ideas for AUs I guess, I dunno."
8e4fkt,1,2018-04-22,Have I developed depression?,throwawayjay1980,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8e4fkt/have_i_developed_depression/,"So, a guess a little background: Male, turned 21 a week ago, and a junior at a large university. While I've definitely had my fair share of ""sad"" stints before (had next to no friends during the early years of high school), I don't think I've ever felt quite like this until now.

It started during the very beginning of the year; I've faced a lot of rejection in my life, but things really started to look up. I actually started talking to a girl I had a crush on (girls rarely ever communicate with me, and I've never even been on a date or anything before) and I had a final round interview for one of the best tech internships I could get in my area of the country. I came into the new year ready to make the best of things with a good attitude; until my interview, I would literally study up to 15 hrs a day, putting my heart and soul into getting this position. Having thought I did decent in the interview, I still came into the semester (by far my hardest yet, with 18 credits) with a positive attitude...until everything hit me in the face at once. The girl I liked rejected me and has seemingly gone out of her way not to speak to me since, while the company I interviewed for rejected me as well.

I think this was the killing blow to my self-esteem; for once it looked like everything was finally working out, as if all my hard work was finally paying off, but now I felt like nothing more than a worthless loser:

For once it looked as if a girl could actually like me -- nope, I'm still an ugly, pathetic creep.

For once it looked as if a really reputable company could see a future in me and welcome me -- nope, I'm still an incompetent, awkward good-for-nothing kid.

These thoughts have been circling in my head for months now, and they always bring me to the realization that once I graduate next year, I'm doomed to live the life I've always feared. I'll be all alone working at some job I hate; I won't have a SO since there isn't a girl on this planet that would willingly talk to me, and I won't be working a dream job since, as I learned, no amount of hard work will pay off for me. Ever since the end of January, I've been getting caught up in my own head with this stuff a lot; often, it keeps me up at night. I've been trying to hide it from everyone I know, making it seem like I'm happy, but in reality I just feel almost-dead inside due to worthlessness, and it's been getting harder to mask as the months have passed.

However, there are two peculiar things about my situation that make me question whether this is actually depression:

I don't actually feel like this everyday. Sometimes, I can wake up and just immediately know that it'll be an alright day. Others, I wake up and immediately feel the weight on my shoulders, if that makes sense. However, it can also be triggered; for instance, yesterday I went to an event and everything seemed to be going pretty good...until I saw that girl that rejected me unexpectedly arrive, and then immediately all those thoughts came flooding back and ruined the day for me.

I've often heard that people with depression have a problem ""functioning;"" they don't even have the will to get out of bed or do anything productive (this is my naive understanding, which may be completely wrong). That's actually not the case for me; in fact, I think making myself more busy with my schoolwork has helped me this past semester, even though I do occasionally lose focus when those thoughts come crawling back to me. In fact, I have a good chance at getting a 4.0 this semester despite everything, and that's including having what is generally thought of as the hardest course in my major. This is probably the biggest reason why I think I may not have developed depression, but I am glad I have at least something that could improve my self-esteem.

I understand that the rules of this sub say ""don't diagnose others,"" but I would really appreciate it if people could let me know if they think that I have developed some form depression. These last four months have been hell for me, and I figured I finally needed to type all this out somewhere to get some clarification on my situation. Thank you for reading this"

- I'm going into my senior year of mechanical engineering. 
- For side cash / hobbies I'm also a photographer/Adobe CC creator, DJ, and bedroom producer (Ableton). 
- I travel quite a bit (currently in China for a semester internship, when I get back to the United States, I'll head out again after two weeks for 14 days backpacking Europe). 

Essentially, I have found myself at a crossroads and can't decide where I truly want to invest my money or what the best option would be. 

I've been leaning towards an XPS 15 (9560) to do it all for me but I can't convince myself to pull the trigger.

28.  MA degree holder, International Relations.  (BA from the U of St Andrews, UK; MA from the U of Queensland, Australia; dropped out of PhD in NZ).  Marginally employed freelancer.  Haven't been stably employed or housed since I dropped out in Feb 2016. 

I'm a Millennial who hasn't made it - whose chances fade with every passing month and year (age: 28, b. 1989).


I came back to the US in 2016 from a PhD in NZ (long story) after realizing that the project wasn't going to work out. The transition from academia to the professional sector isn't easy. My field (international relations) is based in the NYC-DC axis and is heavily gate-kept by a substantially closed network. While my undergrad uni (St Andrews) does have some people in this area, ""just network bro"" is difficult when you have no immediate value to the other party and any undergrad chums have moved on with their lives. 



Nonetheless, I queried via social media and in-person.  ""How did you get where you are?""  A downcast glance and a confession that luck played a part because of a family friend, a lunch out one day, or an old internship was the common one. I never heard, ""I sent out 400 applications and gosh darn it, one of them paid off!"" 



The rest of us?  Muddling on with short term contracts and/or freelancing. 



I am at a loss of what to do. I've burned a lot of cash in 2 years of living expenses, moving, costs of travel for job interviews, informational interviews.  My landlords have been subpar, but it's either that or be homeless (I've experienced this). I have filed circa 350 job applications. I've given up anything resembling a normal life - why bother dating/making friends if I have to move?  I ""work"" 7 days each week - pitching to clients, learning new skills (digital marketing/seo/sem + html/wordpress), doing freelance writing, maintaining a blog/instagram/facebook page for my freelancing business (redacted - pm me), and doing on-the-side writing on medium.com to build maintain a following. 



I am moving to SE Asia for the summer to cut down on living expenses and to be able to afford health insurance before doing a stint in China to learn Chinese (this would be the capstone on my foreign affairs education as an ex-Asia guy). 



I don't know what my future holds.  If I were to stay in the US, I foresee going irretrievably bankrupt at 30-31 and then a desperate existence on the margins with the other circa $10/hr workers with no insurance. 

In the meantime, the personal costs have been catastrophic. I've removed myself from the dating pool and basically explained on dates that ""I'm unsuitable in the following ways due to long-term unemployment.""  For lack of a better description, I feel profound and acute shame in social situations with friends, acquaintances, and family.  The collapse of ""expectations"" from ""oh, you'll find something in your field"" to some iteration of ""just settle"" from your inner circles is soul destroying when the unemployment process alone is confidence-breaking. [FYI, those apparently easy-to-get min wage gigs aren't eager to hire the overqualified for a variety of reasons, but that's another thread. Further, those gigs can be a long term career move as corporate HR sees you as damaged goods.]

I've been trying to figure out how to break out of this rut. Aside from relentlessly trying to ""be better,"" I functionally need some sort of professional role.  Asia is a cheap reset and helps with the resume.  Also the $350/mo rent in Bali ($500 incl office space in Thailand, $400 in China) really helps versus $900/mo rent + $200 in bills + $100 in car insurance in the US. And I get to have high quality medical insurance in Asia versus nothing in the US.   Otherwise, these past two years have seen me falling down the socioeconomic ladder fast enough to feel myself hitting the rungs."

CSUF has a pretty reputable business program with really good connections to LA/OC. But if I want to graduate in 4 years I’ll have to take around 5 classes per semester.
UCR also has a really good business program, but I’m not sure if I’m ready for the fast paced quarter system, even though I’ll be taking 3-4 classes per quarter. 
Personally UCR seems like more work since I will probably have to commute for internships. However I could get a better paying job with the “UC” title.

8e5vzy,10,2018-04-22,"Two teens trapped in an old, operational, and yet utterly empty office building, in San Antonio",LostParticular,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/8e5vzy/two_teens_trapped_in_an_old_operational_and_yet/,"A forewarning - I am new to Reddit, but I wanted desperately to share this somewhere.

This happened yesterday, April 21, 2018, in San Antonio, Texas.

My best friend Adrian has just gone through a breakup, so he and I thought it would be beneficial to have a day out. I am eighteen and he is seventeen, and we have been friends for about a year. We are both hispanic, we both have black hair, we are both over six feet tall, and we both have the same last name, so we come off as brothers. He blew off work, and we took a Lyft to the AMC theater at the Rivercenter Imax in downtown San Antonio, around 1:15 pm. We were trying to see Black Panther (he had never seen it) but we were turned away, because we got there about ten minutes late, and there was only one non-handicapped seat left available. So we started walking the mall. We were talking a bunch of nonsense, like two dumbass friends would. Girls, jokes, making fun of people we knew, people we saw, he talked about his ambitions, I talked mine, and it was actually really, really fun. It was the best day either of us had had in a long time. We eventually left the mall and walked around the Riverwalk for a while, even past the Alamo. It was overcast, but still San Antonio, so it was drizzling but around 85 degrees out, humid, and we were both sweaty, but having a great time nonetheless.

I have to provide a little background. When I was sixteen, in the summer of 2016, I took a summer internship with the City of San Antonio's Economic Development Department, which was mostly clerical work, and I would sit in on meetings. It was largely procedural, but it was nine-to-five, in downtown, and it was great experience. I worked with another girl named Terri, who was also a sixteen-year -old intern, and so every meeting we went to, every invoice we walked to finance, every time we had lunch or had to do busywork around the office, was like an adventure, and we became really good friends. The office was located on the nineteenth floor of the Frost Bank building, and we shared an office, from which we could see the Tower of the Americas and the Grand Hyatt hotel (two important buildings for the city). One meeting was at an office building in downtown San Antonio, called the Milam Building, which was super old (it was the first air conditioned office building in the country!). The building was ornate, creaky, and about twentyish stories tall. The inside is all dark wood paneling, a lot of gilded-colored framework, and a lot (a whole lot) of weird panels. The bottom floor had a wall of elevators, tile, long hallways, some offices for various firms, and a very old, short stairwell that took a very short trip to relatively plain basement space, in which there was a big meeting room. One of those summer days, Terri and I had to sit in on a Goodwill SA meeting with the Goodwill SA jobs (CEO?) manager, David Clarke. It was super fascinating (for a government junkie like me), but the impact of that meeting was the feel that the old Milam building had left on me. The seemingly random panels (or trapdoors?). The mirrors, everywhere. The old air of the place, the creepy, haunted vibe of an ancient building. In the basement, there was a long hallway of darkness, about twelve feet wide, twelve feet tall, and fifty or so feet deep, that was not lit, but also not covered, and seemed to go nowhere, with concrete floors, walls, and ceilings, exposed pipe, and the only thing that covered this long, seemingly pointless hallway (located in the basement) was a large iron, floor-to-ceiling prison-style door. Intense, and it immediately struck unease in Terri and I. We left that day with an impression of an old building that was as frightening as it was fascinating. But all this, at the time, seemed like fun imaginary fright. Nothing real to back it up.

Back to yesterday, Saturday. Adrian and I were still sweaty around the Alamo, and it was only getting hotter and more humid. We wanted to wrap it up, so I proposed we take the bus home. I knew a route with which I was familiar, but this began about two miles away, a long walk through downtown in this weather. It was okay with him; with his breakup, with the weather, with the great conversation, it was cathartic for him and fun for me. I knew my way through the city, mostly.

A few wrong turns and about an hour later, we had only gone about a mile (again, I hadn't waled the city since I had worked downtown, and that was two years ago. Cut me some slack). We were even hotter, sweatier, more tired, and now with the added bonus that we had to pee and were getting a little hungry. An adventure!

On Houston street, we had made it to the Frost bank building, where I was sure we could use the restroom, but alas, it was closed. Then my gaze went a block down and saw an old, familiar sight. The Milam building was there, with its elegance and old facade, and it looked so inviting. It was an office building, so I figured it would be open. We walked towards it. He trusted that I knew where I was going, and I mostly did (plus I knew where the bathrooms were).

We were in front of it. I noticed on the door, towards the bottom, it read, ""no public restrooms."" I figured we would be okay anyways. The glass doors opened, and we were inside! It was really quiet, but then it always was. Part of me wanted to revisit the thrill of being in a spooky building, because I love that stuff. Maybe I wanted to scare Adrian, a devout Catholic who was easily overwhelmed. Whatever, we were dicking around. I showed him the weird panels, and the old staircase, and the weird, scary, empty hallway, which, after two years, was still weird, still scary, and still, utterly, empty. It was euphoria for me, because I was out with my best friend, laughing at his discomfort, but also disquieting because we weren't being quiet - all the lights were on in the building, every single light. All the air conditioning was on. All the lights, lots of noise from us, but still, and all alone, and yet we felt anything but alone. No management at all, no anyone, not a soul! It was just as spooky as I remembered (and hoped). Anyways, I took Adrian around all the greatest hits, the hallway, the panels, the lobby, the bathrooms, which had a bloodstain? That was a bonus.

Ah, well, it seemed that was it. We had peed, laughed, felt a little spooked. Time to leave? Something called me to the elevators, in which I had never been. He opposed this, but I made him come with me anyways. The elevators had the same dark-wood, and were very small on the inside, and felt extremely old. He was panicking, and I was laughing. Still fun, still innocent. I tried the button for floor twenty, because I am an ass. It flickered to life, but then died. The elevator didn't respond. Floor nineteen. Flicker, death. Eighteen, the same. Seventeen stayed alive, and up we went. We looked at each other, he said, ""Eddie, fuck you, I don't want to be here."" I laughed, because he was always a flight like that. The trip was normal, but the elevator swayed heavily as it came to a stop, freaking us both out. The elevator had the creepiest voice when it said, ""FLOOR, *seventeen*.""

It was nothing I hadn't seen before, regular old obscure firms operating out of a random floor in just another office building. But it was stranger than that, and we both picked up on it. It was ice cold, and every single business had their lights on, coming through their non-transparent windows (law office windows, all dark-wood everywhere). And we did not, at all, feel alone. It was eerie, even for me, someone who gets a high on stuff like this. We got back in the elevator, and Adrian pleaded to get out, but then I pushed the button for floor ten, just to perpetuate the adventure. It was fun!

Up until this point I had told myself that is was the norm for all the lights to be on on the weekend for security reasons, however, I did not see a single camera. And it all checked out. The firms were all closed, the doors shut, but the lights on. Nothing unusual.

Floor ten was different. One of the firms' doors was open. Just a crack, but it was enough to see that inside, well, there was nothing. Just pure, white light, flooding out of the office space. That freaked him and I out, and so we rushed to the stairwell. I was playing it off, laughing at him, still, (I know) as we headed down the stairwell, which was poorly lit, and reminded me of that of a hospital. On every floor of the stairwell, there was a restroom, and they were all locked, every single one. The old windows in the stairwell were high off the ground. Adrian was faster than me, and maintained a distance of about a flight lower than me as we descended. I was laughing, but he was growing more and more frightened. I didn't understand why. In the stairs we traveled from floor ten down to floor six. He paused on floor six, and said, ""Eddie, look."" He said this with wide eyes and a terrified expression. I made it down, and saw what he was seeing.

The light coming in from floor six was not pure white. It was tinted red. I pushed open the door to that floor, and the light still hung red in the hallway, the firms on that floor were blackened, and it had the destitute feeling on abandonment paired with the sheer terror of not being alone. This floor was even icier than the previous ones. He sprinted to the elevators and I followed quickly. Neither of us were laughing anymore. The elevator descended slowly to the first floor, which was where we started, and it was just the way we had come in. Empty, but not icy, and not scary. I let out a laugh of relief, but he was ready to get out, so I walked as he ran down the hallway through which we had entered in the first place.

He tried the door, so we could exit. It did not budge. Not at all. I was in a brief state of humor and disbelief. I tried it myself, and it didn't budge. We looked at each other, and out stomachs and hearts dropped. Then I noticed a, ""push to exit"" button, and I felt once again relieved. I pushed. No exit. The walls felt like they were closing in.

Our last hope was another hallway, another door, and another exit. Or so we thought. He was full-on running at this point. He ran all the way over to the other hallway door, which had two sets of doors, one that was unlocked and opened when he pushed, fostering a tiny glimmer of hope that we could leave the damned building. But it was the second doors, the ones that actually led outside, that were locked. It was a nightmare situation. Not to mention that my phone's battery life was at six percent, and his was at eight. Just then a couple waked by, so we instinctively pounded on the windows, trying to get their attention. They were s close, but they kept going! My heart was in my throat as reality began to sink in, and suddenly we weren't playing anymore, we were actually, totally trapped inside this building. We ran, trying both doors twice again. Adrian was almost breaking down. ""Call someone! Call Amanda!"" Amanda is my fiancee.

My phone was at five percent, and had no signal at all. I asked him if I should call the police, to which he replied, ""Fuck no!"" It seemed like hope was diminishing and things were getting more and more intense as we felt trapped and helpless and terrified. It was still dark outside. The day afternoon would soon be evening. We were exhausted, and trapped inside a horrible, awful place with something. Something was in there with us.

We tried the door one last time, the door through which we first entered, and with a swoosh, we almost fell onto the sidewalk. The humidity caught us and immediately replaced the cold that had held out bodies. But it didn't matter, because we were free.

We just took a moment. We basically ran straight away from the Milam building. It was so terrifying.

The Milam building.

On the bus home, he told me the reason he was so scared in the stairwell is because he could hear footsteps and whispers that were not ours.

We want to go back and document some of this, this time, with full batteries and maybe a couple more people.

But I, a staunch skeptic, can not explain any of this. If anyone has any ideas, related experiences, questions, or answers, please let me know.

Thank you so much for your time."

I am still waiting to here if my supervisor was able to secure me park housing or not, which would be in El Portal. So I've been looking at renting a room in Mariposa. 

I am moving up to that area from Los Angeles and don't have a car and am wondering if people live there without a car.

I know there is the Yosemite Area Rapid Transit and I am hoping I can get by with just that. Do other people do that? Or nah? There obviously is not a whole lot of housing options in Mariposa and I also have glanced a bit at Merced, I know that is much further away but do some people do that commute? 

I've looked into allllll the ways a person can rent a car for 3 months and they are all so expensive I've been looking at just buying a really cheap car for the summer, but then there is car insurance. So I really don't want to have to go through that hassle just for 3 months, unless I have to because living in that area car free is not possible.

I got a good job out of my internship, found a roommate and moved out of my parents house because it’s been 20+ years of emotional abuse and shitty parenting. My mom basically raised me herself and so she always had ultimate control of all of my decisions. Even when I was 18 and older and still living in her house everything I did had to be ran through her. She had her hands in all of my choices, all of my relationships, and anything that I did that was not exactly what she would have done would be met with resistance if not threats to kick me out or with hold money from me. 

Once I moved out I had hoped that my relationship to my mom would get better. When I first moved out she insisted on texting me 24/7 and knowing everything that I was doing. She would call me and scream at me for moving out telling me to “go live my life and leave her the f*ck alone because that’s what I had always wanted.” When infact this was not true and honestly all I have ever wanted was to love my mom. I moved out of my parents house mostly because I cannot stand my dad, who is abusive  and manipulative, I honestly do want to have a good relationship with my mom. 

Now, I have a new boyfriend who I really love and can see myself spending the rest of my life with, but she seems to be threatened by him and finds anything she can wrong with him so that she can convince me to “slow down and let this man play out”. It doesn’t help that she has been diagnosed with PTSD due to all of the abuse that she went through, mostly from men, throughout her life. 

I try to be loving and kind and compassionate to my mom and I honestly do whatever I can to try and help her through her emotional healing, but she cannot seem to let me go. I get off the phone with her more often than not crying because she’s yelled at me for making my own choices or deciding to look into something she might not agree with. It has gotten to the point that even though I want to, I don’t tend to enjoy time with her anymore, and she can tell and that makes her even more upset. Talking to her drains me, and I always feel as though I am getting a lecture over something that I chose myself that she feels she would change. I know that some of this is normal, but it seems like this is just too much. I try to distance myself from the relationship, but I cannot seem to come to terms with having a bad relationship with her and I always end up crawling back to fix it. How do I let this go? How do I become ok with being me if it means losing her?

8e8gh0,12,2018-04-22,I didn't know what i was missing,jazzsassin,lovestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/lovestories/comments/8e8gh0/i_didnt_know_what_i_was_missing/,"I got married when i was 20 to a man that by all accounts wasn't _bad_, but he wasn't good for me. Long story short, I was married to a loser. He didn't necessarily do anything _wrong_, he just didn't do _anything at all_. Now, I am not a ""typical woman"" if there even is such a thing. I love myself. Sure, there are things I want to improve, but I don't have a problem with my age, or intelligence, or what my body looks like, or my personality- those things that seem to stereotypically plague women just don't bother me for whatever reason. I have a career where I make more than enough money on my own to live comfortably. I know how to use power tools, fix my own car, and google the shit out of anything else that needs to be done.  I say what I mean, and expect others to do the same, none of this passive-aggressive nonsense. But I'm stubborn as a mule, and marriages are supposed to last, so even though I was the primary breadwinner, and did most of the things around the house, and raised my kids mostly on my own, I still spent 13 years in that worthless marriage. At the end of the day, my husband felt like I didn't need him, because I am very capable. But he was wrong. I needed support. I needed a partner, a friend. Even someone who would see how hard I was working to just keep my head above water. I couldn't manage EVERYTHING on my own; and I still can't.  



For some perspective at how emotionally isolated I was, I struggled with infertility for three years; I had to take tons of medications &amp; shots that made me sick, tired, have hot flashes, body aches, and migraines for those years; not to mention the emotional drain of every month without fail seeing a single pink line on that damn stick. The emotion of going through a bulk pack of pregnancy tests, or taking photos of your cousin's child's first birthday (for the child they conceived after you started trying), is just... a lot to bear; I was very open with my struggles, because i think it helped other people too. Somehow, my husband wasn't even aware this was a thing that i was needing support in. he had no idea. and it's not because i didn't tell him or directly ask him. he just was that thick and lost. he was a five year old trapped as an adult- lacking the ability to give support in that way. 



And once I had kids, he was actually more of a burden than a help. I spent most of my time walking on eggshells, trying to balance being exhausted from a high-demand job, making dinner, and praying the kids (who are all-around good kids) didn't do anything to ""poke the bear"" while my husband played games on his phone and mostly ignored them. I spent more time trying to keep them from upsetting him than anything else.



When i finally asked him to please leave, everything improved immediately. I could breathe again. I was free of so much dead weight. I was so, so happy to just not-have-him around. It was so much better, I never looked back, and I was ok on my own. Sure, I crawled in to bed every night, feeling ready to collapse at the end of the day. Kids are demanding, after all. But I was free. And I was happy. 



But it wears on you. I have an unfair amount of help in my life. I have a six figure salary and live well within my means. I have family that watches my children when i need. I have amazing neighbors and a church family that pitches in often whenever I need a hand, and still, i had many, many, days where I was so tired from thinking all day, coming home to my screaming 4 year old, and my 10 year old yammering about a tv show, and the dog yapping at the door and the cat under my feet crying, and it's so much. everything _needs_ me, all the time. Notice, I didn't say _want_. They _needed_ me. Feeling needed is great, but most days I was a mostly empty cup that was trying to wring out every last drop to pour into my little family, and there simply wasn't enough to go around.



Did I ever think of dating? lol, no. Who has time for that? I sure didn't. I was busy enough, and i clearly was ok on my own. Besides, who would want to date a woman who had little kids, and was by all accounts completely independent and very successful? I was sure as hell not ever looking to date for ""fun""- ain't nobody got time fo dat! Not to mention, I'm not going to go out of my way to meet anyone, my standards were WAY high after my ex, and again, that's just time i don't have for something i didn't see any particular need for. 



So that's when God said ""Hold my beer"" and cracked his knuckles.



He was an intern that summer; an absolutely brilliant one. Good looking, hard working, personable, did crazy things like fix his own car, and budget. But there was an over 10 year age gap, and there surely wasn't a chance in hell this guy would want to chill out with (much older) me and my kids in our simple suburban lives. Summer flew by, and before I knew it, he was gone back to school. But he happened to be back for the weekend, and much to our mutual surprise, he kissed me... and we've been a thing ever since.



Oh. My. God. If I knew this was what healthy relationships were... Ya'll. I can't even with this guy. He uses his words to tell me what he's thinking and feeling, even if he is pretty sure i'm not gonna like it. You GUYS. I don't have to guess what he's thinking! He just tells me! What a gift... he budgets, he watches his money. This man is 22 years old and has a credit score over 800! I can talk to him for an entire day about deep stuff, like existential things, or science, movies, tv shows, or books with actual plot lines and not just explosions. He asks me about my day, every day, and when i tell him, he actually remembers and cares. I don't have a single fuck to give about getting flowers or jewelry or any of that other crap, I just want a companion, ya know? So for valentine's day, he flooded my inboxes on every possible channel he has to contact me with everything he could think of to make me smile-- memes, sweet love notes, pictures of cats, whatever. The first time i went to his apartment (he's got several roommates), i was DEAD TIRED from the day, and pretty much passed out on his bed. I woke up like 2-3 hours later and was talking with one of his roommates and found out that he had gone around to all the doors close by and wd-40'd them while i slept to make sure the squeaking didn't wake me up.



He cleans up. He cooks, he wants to try new things and do new things. He is appreciative! OMG you guys! He actually says things like ""wow, this dinner is amazing, thank you so much for cooking!"" or ""wow, you are really good at x, that is so cool!"" get this you guys- this is crazy. There was this one day I had gone pretty far out of my way to do him a favor, (very happily), but he was weirdly short when i got there to deliver the items to him. very uncharacteristic. After i left i was thinking I should probably call and tell him i didn't appreciate that very much, but was everything ok?-- when the phone rang. he was calling to apologize for being so short with me, he realized after i left he was being rude and he was very, very appreciative. this man OWNED his mistake and APOLOGIZED immediately! WHAT. IS. THIS?! Shut the front door!



And he calls me on my bullshit. God, I love that. If I'm being ridiculous, I want to know it-- and he tells me! He does not let me get away with it. And damned if he's not the same way-- I don't even know how to handle a mature adult... it's so wonderfullll



he leaned in to the kids thing. last week he came over for dinner. my four year old was in a special mood. usually she's the spunkiest kid around, but she was being a grade-a turd that night. i was already about to breakdown when he got there with some of the dinner food. he took one look at me, gave me a quick hug, and said he'd take my daughter out in the back yard for a minute if that was ok... OK?! hell yes, please take it! and he took the dog too. are you kidding me, i can cook dinner without things yapping at me?! i about cried. he came in after a few minutes and asked me if i was ok, and what he could do to help. i was still pretty frazzled, and just muttered ""yeah i'm frazzled, i don't really even know..."" he just gave me a long hug, and said he was there for me, and it'd be ok. gave me a peck on the forehead and took off to play with the kids again outside. Then he brought them in and got them to help set the table. he did everything, i have never in my entire adult life gotten to sit down for dinner while everyone else gets the table set and food ready and drinks and etc. After dinner, he made a point of telling the kids he couldn't play till he helped me clean up. and by helped, he meant do everything for me. I literally didn't know what to do with myself you guys. I didn't have anything to do... it was... so... nice.  I tell my man all the time how appreciative i am of him, and he feels uncomfortable about it because he doesn't think he's doing anything special. Guys, he thinks this is normal and everyone is like that. What?! False. These men are few and far between from what i've seen.



The craziest thing to me here is he _wants_ me. he. wants. me. What in the ever living hell is wrong with this man?? He is in his senior year of college, he could do anything he wants, the world is his oyster. Oh sure, he could have tumblr'd his way through a gazillion hot college girls his own age; that weren't long-distance, that didn't have kids, but no. He picked me. Me, with my baggage, and my kids, and my stretch marks, and my sarcasm for days. Me, that is hard headed and opinionated, and can barely hold it together every day. I don't know what I did to get this guy, but I'm sure as hell gonna do everything i can to make him as happy as he makes me every day. My heart didn't even know i needed him..."

I don't have a job, I'm failing at university, I'm overweight, and have horrible health habits. Apparently, I am likable, though because a lot of people choose to hang around me. I have sociable checked off, but that's not enough. I want to be responsible.






I just wish I could make better choices.





This is what I should've done 2 years ago. I should have gone to my first choice university, instead of the less expensive 2nd choice. I should've insisted on taking a gap year to sort out my problems. I should have worked out my mental health problems. But I didn't do that. I was younger, 18, and was completely inexperienced with life outside the protection of my parents.




I spent my first semester locked away, trying to teach myself Python, which resulted in me failing 3 of my 4 classes.



My GPA was below a 1. As I have come to learn, I had Multiple Personality Disorder and what I was doing was a poor coping Technique. M.P.D. is a form of P.T.S.D. that is non-biological, and once I realized I had it, it was not too much of a struggle to rid myself of it, but for 6 years it had caused me a lot of problems. My next 2 semesters, I did fairly well, but it doesn't do much to recover from such a disaster first semester. 




Right now, I should be doing school work, but for some reason, I find the thought of it dreadful. I know what I have to do:





Study Statistics






Finish a project




Do 2 labs for Biology




Finish a lab for Calculus 2






Start another project




Watch 12 hours of lecture videos




Apply for internships because I have been procrastinating




A lot of these things I should have done already, but I find it so dreadful. I don't understand how to approach them. I'm scared to ask for help because I don't want anybody to know how much I'm struggling. All of my friends say its so easy or they're at least able to cope. 






I wish I was more capable and responsible.

8e98qb,2,2018-04-23,I don’t know how to cope with some of the stuff my mom does,throwaway277336737,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8e98qb/i_dont_know_how_to_cope_with_some_of_the_stuff_my/,"I’m a 23F right now. I live at home because I’m doing an internship in my hometown before I start medical school.

My mom has combined borderline/narcissistic personality disorder that has run rampant for the last two decades. I’ve learned to cope with a lot of the ramifications from horrible physical and emotional abuse as a child, but living at home as an adult having experienced sexual trauma from a past partner now makes me view some of her other actions in a different light. She forces me to sleep in her bed with her and cuddles me while moaning and making weird noises and then forces me to hug her and when she does she more often than not runs her hands over my butt. Whether this is because she literally cannot conceptualize me as an adult or something more perverse in nature is beyond me. If I try to stand my ground she screams and cries and threatens to kill her self until I give in

I feel shitty talking to my friends about this specifically because the ones who have experienced anything creepy from a parent were victims of child sexual abuse and I don’t even know how to begin to tell someone who hasn’t experienced intimate violation like this from a parent.

Anyway I am posting this right now because I thought she was moving back to be with her family in her native country and I thought I could really get a fresh start before medical school. This morning I found out from my sister that she’s moving back “because she misses us” and I’ve been panicking all day. The medical school I’m going to is only an hour and a half away and I’m truly dreading what sort of bullshit she’ll pull at my white coat ceremony because she can’t handle all attention and adulation not being on her. Not to mention the shitstorm that’ll keep going while I’m trying to study...

Unfortunately cutting her off means cutting my whole immediate family off and if we all cut her off she’ll probably end up homeless or dead. I just don’t even know what to do anymore "

Body: Life hasn't been perfect from the start. I won't go all the way back but I'll start where the depression got really bad and skim up until more recent stuff.

Junior year I switch schools from my normal school to a career technical school. Because of this switch I lost all my old friends. Started to get bad grades (C was bad for me at the time). Then lost my (then) girlfriend of nearly 2 years. 

Barely manage through all my classes with heavy depression setting in. The depression just kind of comes and goes as it pleases and when *GF* left it took her place. 

Graduate highschool with the schooling for several computer networking certificates, as well as a paid college internship at a fortune 500 company. Start dating my best friend of 4 years senior year. 

Turn 18 and mom starts charging for all kinds of shit like phone bill, car insurance, health insurance etc..

Months later, start college with fasfa money while working as much as I can at the internship. College sucks. I don't know what I want to do with my life. Stop going to class. Fail every class I took. Start streaming on twitch. Decide not to go back next semester and try to figure out what I want to do.

Lose job because I'm not going to school.

No school. No job. No idea what I want to do with my life. Can't pay my mom all her bills. Continue to stream on twitch. Enjoy the hell out of it. Does relatively well.

Few months later. Still no job, still no plan, still streaming. Streaming is not going as well but I still do it because I enjoy it. Get a pet lizard, start thinking about getting a job and going back to school.

No idea where to apply for a job. No idea what I want to go to school for. Even if I go back to school I'll probably end up paying all the classes back because failing 5 classes pisses off fasfa. 

Today, realize lizard has something wrong with his tail. Only have 90 dollars on my account. Can't take him to vet. Tell the pet store and they're willing to take care of him but I littlerally have to return him to them, let them treat him, then buy him back. Whatever he needs it. Cry over lizard.
 
Thinking about school gives me crazy bad anxiety. Lost my lizard the only thing that's been getting me up for the last 10 days, depression hits really hard.

Can't get a therapist or medicine because I'm not on insurance after I turned 18 and can't pay my l for it. 

Still have my best friend/turned girl friend. Only thing I still have thats worth living for. No idea what to do with my life or how to fix anything or even try to get on some sort of path again. 

Im sorry this post is all over the place but I feel like need to just explain some of the stuff that's upsetting me and cause things to feel worse. I just feel like there's no point. So what, I find a job, pay for college, get a better job. For what? To have kids and hope they do better than I did? What's the point in that. It's so fucking meaningless.

Conclusion:

It's all so fucked. Even this post barely has any meaning. "

8e9ome,7,2018-04-23,"Insane career path, soon to be college graduate, relationships, stressed and anxiety in future",pensoku,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8e9ome/insane_career_path_soon_to_be_college_graduate/,"I just need to rant a bit as the stress and anxiety has been building up. I've been asking myself a lot recently what the hell am I doing with my life. 


I've lived a fairly privileged life, well good in some aspects and others not so much. Growing up my family environment wasn't so healthy with non stop fighting for years. My mom had a bad relationship with her family and her pent up anger as well as some incompatibilities with my dad resulted in an extremely toxic environment. I didn't have very good social awareness as a kid and sure as hell couldn't learn it from my parents. To top it off I was an extra late bloomer looking maybe 3-4 years younger than my age throughout high school. 


All these factors in combination resulted in pretty severe mental bullying for 6-7 years. The bullying just compounded with the toxic home environment and those were the worst years of my life. It destroyed me as a person and I was contemplating suicide. Fortunately I was blessed to meet great people throughout college and had my experience been poor I'd probably be dead right now. But I worked my ass off to break through insecurities, socialize, and grow as a person. I still have problems stemming from the past but its miles better than I was 6-7 years ago.


Just a side note, my parents aren't all that bad. They genuinely do care for me and try their best. It was just unfortunate that my mom had that relation with her family and problems just built upon each other despite having a good intention.


Coming out of high school I had a strong interest in metallurgy and knife making. I worked for a knife dealer during high school which peaked my interest. Unfortunately the tools necessary to pursue that interest were monetarily completely inaccessible to me and there were no apprenticeships or like I could reasonable pursue.



So college it was and I picked the closest related major to metallurgy, material science and engineering. I excelled academically and held internships each summer, but my through my work experience and coming into the last 2 years of my college career I came into a realization that my pursuit was nothing that I hoped it to be. 



But I ain't just being fussy. At the end of the day you need to eat, pay bills, and deal with the realities of life. It was my mentality that I didn't need to like my job, but if the pay was okay, and I could get by its fine. But working in a lab and doing research isn't just some simply 9-5. Its hard fucking work with not a lot of pay. I have a lot of respect for my peers and fellow researchers. You need to be the driving force or the innovator creating the work and the one to complete it. I didn't have the drive and I was working in an environment where I had to pretend to be passionate and generate new ideas. Mentally it was extremely taxing and after a few years I realized this was not sustainable for me long term.



All the while this is going on I had a passion for bonsai on the back burner. Initially I got into bonsai because mentally, it felt so good. Growing and developing the trees helped me through so much mental stress and my growth as a person. I had been getting increasingly involved with the bonsai community and was trying to see how viable it was to pursue professionally in a financially sustainable way. After realizing that I could either 1) continue on my current career path and probably destroy myself from stress or 2) start fresh and try to find a job with growth potential. 1 was no go and I was slightly apprehensive about 2 since it felt like I wasted 4 years in college. So I said fuck it. If I could find an opportunity to pursue bonsai professionally I'd go for it. If not I'd suck it up and figure something out.



Well out of nowhere my friend, a bonsai professional in the US, told me the nursery he apprenticed at in Japan was looking for apprentices and he could vouch me. I was already trying and failing for a few months to get an apprenticeship on my own. Over 3 months I studied out of my mind, previously speaking almost no Japanese, made it out to Japan by myself, (first time alone in a foreign country) winged it out of my ass, and was accepted as a full time apprentice by the owner there.


I'm back in the states to finish my last quarter in college but I'll move to Japan in August. Fucking nuts. That last think I expected was I'd be moving to and living in a foreign country. An apprenticeship typically lasts between 3-5 years (5 officially) and it is fucking hard work. Doing bonsai professionally after is even harder. Well first you need to get really good artistically, horticulturally, and technically to be able to style and develop trees. Assuming I become fairly skilled and get recognized in the international bonsai community you then travel a shit ton (like 300 days of the year) to private clients, shops, and workshops to work on bonsai. Maybe after a few years of that madness you have enough money to settle down and start your own nursery or workshop so you can travel less. I feel like a masochist for consciously subjected myself to such a difficult career path. There are so many other pursuits that entail much less work for much more pay. I just have such a strong passion for the art that I was compelled to go for the opportunity. 

I have no fucking idea what's gonna happen in the future. I do know I have a lot of challenges set before me and I need to hustle to make it work. I just feel a little lost....like what am I living for? Self-fulfillment? Get married and raise a family? Or maybe is it more simple? Don't die and don't get hungry? My life has been a lot of lows, some mid points, and a few highs. I look at my parents, friends, relatives were their choices the right ones? I guess everybody lives a bit different and how their aspirations in life get realized vary. I'm fucking afraid of failing, being alone, or having a mundane shit life. 

I am constantly trying to improve myself and grow as person. From being in isolation for such a long time building good social skills were always very hard for me. By the time I had stability and time for a relationship I had no skills nor the compatibility with most people to get a girlfriend. I already knew this from other professionals sharing their experience with me, but apprenticing in Japan, following by frequent domestic and international travel means it'll be very hard to hold a relationship for a long time. I kind of accepted this cause hell...I've been alone for the past 20+ years. What's 5,6,7,8 or 10 more.

There's this girl a like a lot and get along with reasonably well in my major at college. But I've just been too awkward or too damn busy to talk more. Sometimes different schedules or no circumstances to easily talk. I was thinking the past month...fuck, it's my last quarter in college. If I don't put in the effort there's no possibility for any kind of relationship in the future. She's an assistant ice skating coach so I made up some bs (well not all bs, I did have an interest) about being interested in skating and asked out to skate. Not sure if you could call it a date because it wasn't implied, but maybe something close. I went skating for the first time, fell on ass many times, but had fun and was able to have a good conversation. I like her, I don't know if she feels the same way, but we get along alright. For now I just want to keep a good relation with her and hopefully keep contact over the years. Realistically I am not trying to pursue a relationship right now because I'm leaving the country in 3 months and long distance brings up all kinds of pressure and troubles. But after that day I realized that I did not want to live my life alone. Someday I hope to have a spouse and family of my own. Am I naive? Do I want to much? Fulfilling career, happy family, decent life? I feel my future is so cloudy juggling so many different things and I have no idea how it'll all play out. I'm not going by the book and everything is unconventional or new waters for me.

Life ain't so bad but I'm treading deep waters. I'm afraid of sinking before I make it to the other end.

Well fuckkk that was long. Feels good to write it all out though. Please comment as you'd like

I am a french student currently doing my 4th year at the INSA of Toulouse, France in computer science.
I am looking for a 8 to 10 weeks Internship this summer in the fields of software programming, networks or computer security.

I have consequent experiences in java thanks to several projects with local startups. These projects also involved networks design (peer-to-peer chat application, smart home design) and security. With a team of students and teachers, we developed a pedagogical tool for companies and students to learn computer security efficiently, and we have been invited in two major computer security conferences, and produce two articles.
On a side note, i created a online company last year where I sell autonomous terrariums on the website I designed.

Very fast learner and team oriented, my goal is to adapt the fastest way possible to a new project and to be the most useful possible. Thanks to my school and personal projects, I have knowledge in a large array of technologies, from hardware programming to front-end development.
Thanks to the company I created, I have experiences in marketing, financials and strategy, which are useful to see the big picture while working for a company and help them the best I can.

Passionate about London and entrepreneurship, working for a startup in this city would mean the world to me. Thriving under complex situations, I love working with a team for an ambitious project.

1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kent u het bericht 'Hulp nieuwe stijl: sámen tegen muren oplopen'? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.   
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vindt u het een goede ontwikkeling dat inmiddels ruim acht van de tien gemeenten een wijkteam hebben? Zo ja, waarom? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
2.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Gemeenten hebben op basis van de Wmo 2015 en de Jeugdwet de vrijheid om de toegang tot jeugdhulp en maatschappelijke ondersteuning op eigen manier vorm te geven.  De meeste gemeenten kiezen voor een multi-disciplinair wijkteam of voor de inzet van generalistische professionals in sociale wijkteams voor kwetsbare burgers of huishoudens met meervoudige problematiek. Op deze manier is het beter mogelijk integrale ondersteuning en maatwerk te bieden.  Ik vind dat een goede ontwikkeling. Belangrijk is wel dat het wijkteam ook over de juiste expertise en competenties beschikt om deze burgers/huishoudens goed te kunnen ondersteunen en zo nodig door te verwijzen.     
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Denkt u dat wijkteams binnen de gemeenten voldoende bekendheid genieten? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, waarom wel?  
&amp;nbsp;    
3.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Het oprichten van wijkteams is meestal door de gemeente zelf geïnitieerd. Dat betekent overigens niet dat alle medewerkers van de gemeente altijd goed op de hoogte zijn van de wijkteams of de individuele casuïstiek die de wijkteams  behandelen.  De samenstelling van de wijkteams kan per gemeente verschillen. In sommige gemeenten zijn bijvoorbeeld ook medewerkers van een dienst Werk en Inkomen betrokken bij de wijkteams of medewerkers van de wijkverpleging. In die gemeenten waar dit niet het geval is, kan het voorkomen dat een medewerker van een dienst niet goed op de hoogte is van de &amp;#40;individuele casuïsitiek in&amp;#41; de wijkteams.   
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat vindt u ervan dat wijkteams zeer verschillend zijn van samenstelling en dus ook wat betreft de bevoegdheden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
4.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Aangezien er verschillen zijn tussen gemeenten qua omvang en problematiek vind ik het begrijpelijk dat wijkteams verschillend kunnen zijn in samenstelling en bevoegdheden. Grote gemeenten kennen veelal specifieke jeugdteams of aparte teams voor multiprobleem-gezinnen. Kleinere gemeenten hebben vaker bredere   
&amp;nbsp;    
wijkteams die op een groot aantal leefgebieden ondersteuning bieden. Belangrijk is dat de wijkteams voor het doel waarvoor zij zijn ingesteld over de juiste disciplines en bevoegdheden beschikken.    
&amp;nbsp;    
De tussenevaluatie van de Jeugdwet die begin dit jaar uitkwam, leert ons dat lokale teams in vrijwel alle gemeenten een cruciale rol hebben gekregen bij het realiseren van de doelen van de Jeugdwet. Ook blijkt dat de diversiteit van deze teams heel groot is. Dat is lastig voor partijen buiten het lokale team, zoals de specialistische jeugdhulp, huisartsen en jeugdbescherming. Zij weten dan moeilijk wat wel en niet van de teams mag worden verwacht . De evaluatie leert ook dat kwetsbare kinderen en gezinnen grote moeite hebben de weg naar de juiste hulp te vinden. Ook bestaan zorgen over de expertise van professionals in de lokale teams, met name bij complexe problemen. Ik ga met de gemeenten en andere relevante partijen in gesprek over de wijze waarop de toegang tot de jeugdhulp voor kinderen en gezinnen beter kan. Zodat binnen elke regio helderheid is of komt over wat je van een lokaal &amp;#40;jeugd&amp;#41; team kan verwachten. Daarbij gaan we ook zorgen voor voldoende specifiek en adequaat &amp;#40;bij- en nascholings&amp;#41; aanbod voor de professionals werkzaam binnen een lokaal team.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat vindt u ervan dat het belang van het wijkteam en van een gemeentelijke dienst vervolgens kunnen botsen?  
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Wijkteams zijn veelal door gemeenten ingesteld om ondersteuning te bieden aan kwetsbare burgers en inzicht te krijgen in de brede ondersteuningsvraag van deze groep. In die zin is de werkwijze van wijkteams anders dan de wijze waarop een gemeentelijke dienst kan zijn ingericht.  Elke gemeente kent zijn eigen organisatievorm.  Indien sprake is van een aparte gemeentelijke dienst Werk en Inkomen dan kan het zijn dat alleen naar dat onderdeel van de ondersteuningsvraag wordt gekeken in plaats van de samenhang in de behoefte aan ondersteuning. Een en ander kan tot spanningen leiden tussen het wijkteam en een gemeentelijke dienst, waardoor soms problemen onvoldoende effectief kunnen worden opgelost. Het zijn juist dit type belemmeringen die de gemeenten die betrokken zijn bij de Citydeal inclusieve stad &amp;#40;nu Citydeal eenvoudig maatwerk&amp;#41; willen oplossen. De praktijk wijst uit dat gemeenten meestal passende oplossingen weten te vinden voor ontstane situaties. Soms is bestuurlijke instemming nodig om te kunnen afwijken van bestaande werkwijzen.     
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;    
Wat vindt u van de conclusie van dit bericht, namelijk dat veel wijkteams dichter bij de burger zijn komen te staan &amp;#40;zoals beoogd werd&amp;#41;, maar dat zij met de burger samen tegen dezelfde bureaucratische muren aanlopen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
6.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik deel de opvatting dat wijkteams, door het outreachend werken en het multidisciplinaire karakter dichter bij kwetsbare burgers staan. Wijkteams zijn vooral bedoeld voor kwetsbare burgers waar sprake is van meervoudige problematiek. De gemeenten die in het artikel worden genoemd en betrokken zijn bij de Citydeal inclusieve stad herkennen de bureaucratische muren en willen de ondersteuning flexibeler en meer op maat maken, zodat het beter aansluit op de leefwereld van betrokken mensen. Dat betekent echter niet altijd dat de gehele gemeentelijke organisatie op deze wijze moet gaan werken of dat de organisatie moet worden aangepast.  Ik ben van mening dat burgers met een enkelvoudige ondersteuningsvraag ook goed op een andere wijze kunnen worden geholpen dan via een wijkteam, bijvoorbeeld via een goed toegankelijk gemeentelijk loket.   
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Denkt u dat wijkteams die een integraal budget tot hun beschikking hebben effectiever kunnen werken, zowel voor de burgers als voor de gemeenten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7.   
&amp;nbsp;    
In diverse gemeenten, waaronder de gemeenten die betrokken zijn bij de Citydeal inclusieve stad, wordt geëxperimenteerd met wijkgebonden of flexibele budgetten.  Hierdoor krijgen de professionals meer mogelijkheden zelf maatwerk te bieden bij ondersteuning. Dit kan het beroep op zwaardere vormen van zorg voorkomen.  Belangrijk is dat professionals binnen de gemeente de ruimte krijgen maatwerk te bieden, maar ook meer bewust worden van de kosten  indien zij doorverwijzen naar specialistische zorg.  Belangrijk blijft dat professionals tijdig en goed inschatten of de vraagstukken zelf op gelost kunnen worden of dat doorverwijzing noodzakelijk is. Wijkteams kunnen dankzij de inzet van flexibele middelen op korte termijn effectiever zijn voor de burger. Op langere termijn is het nodig dat  bij de aanpak van huishoudens met complexe problemen, waarbij veelal sprake is van schulden, gemeenten samen met andere partners effectief gaan samenwerken om maatwerk te bieden.  De gemeenten die betrokken zijn bij de Citydeal inclusieve stad hebben de ambitie landelijke uitvoeringsorganisaties als het CJIB, het CAK en de Belastingdienst daarbij te betrekken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vindt u dat wijkteams een ruim mandaat moeten hebben zodat zij regel-overstijgend kunnen werken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
8.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het is aan gemeenten om daar eigen keuzes in te maken. De budgetten die gemeenten ontvangen voor het sociaal domein zijn breed inzetbaar en het is aan gemeenten op welke wijze zij deze budgetten intern verdelen. Ik ben wel van opvatting dat meer ruimte moet komen maatwerk te bieden ook in situaties waarbij er regeloverstijgend gewerkt moet worden. Uitgangspunt in de dienstverlening moet de vraag zijn op welke wijze de burgers het best kunnen  worden ondersteund gegeven de eigen persoonlijke en financiële omstandigheden.

I don't really mind if you even want to play futa just be predominantly feminine. I am open to any other creative changes you may want to pitch to me.

The overall theme I am looking for is Dom/Sub with an emphasis of general control resulting in praise and maybe perks within the office. I prefer my new interns or employees to be somewhat innocent, but not ""oh, I've never done that before"" responses if that helps. It could revolve around a coercion or even forced moment or it can be a slower, control based power move or even bimbofication if thats what you are looking for.

I will play the CEO with the big office down the hallway on top floor. Mid 30's, shapely and toned, brunette, perky breasts and always in extravagant lingerie underneath my business attire.

My idea would be that you become my pet, my sex toy. I control you actions, make you service people or myself at will. It can get dark and rough if the mood goes that direction. I love breast play, nipple play, light pain, whips, spanking, toys (large and small), control, oral, anal, group play, public tasks, etc

Please message me with your desired character age, description, and kinks/limits with any additional twists you want to add, please. Hope to hear from someone soon!"

A headhunter contacted me because one company was looking for a person who can create Wordpress Plugins, which I cannot but if they would give me 1 - 2 month, I would be good, because I allredy know PHP and JavaScript pretty well.

Than they don't even wanted to invite me for an interview, because I have no degree lol. 

2 month later I called them and pretended to be their dream guy, they actually are looking for a developer allredy over 6 months, yes, 6 months. They cannot find a right candidate!

Why employers are so stupid? I am sure they've got even a better candidate than me but they would likely to wait until the right (perfect) candidate is here, instead let's say, hire one as intern and give him like 2 month to learn stuff and then hire as a fulltime employee, if he learnt enought for a job???"

I have been NC with my mom for about four years give or take, or close to that. I'm doing much better than I was when I lived with her. I graduated from college, have an internship and am basically trying to make something of myself. I've recently started therapy, which helps so much, and I have weekly appointments with my therapist to process feelings and actually acknowledge that having feelings is okay and totally valid.

I'm starting to realize a lot of the thoughts and feelings I had about my mom being a bad person and a terrible parent are actually valid and I'm not just a ""bad daughter"" who's ""ungrateful and lazy.""  

I feel like I've been making a lot of progress lately but today is my birthday and it's a day I always end up feeling crummy on, even though I know I have people around me who care, and I'm in a better place. I went to bed feeling bummed and woke up feeling bummed. I just basically dread today and I wasn't exactly sure why. 

I think I realize now. Every year since I have been nc she finds every single one of my online profiles (I have a few ones for professional reasons) and she messages me weird crap. She'll message me on twitter pretending to be a bot and thinks I won't notice. She was so incessant with facebook I actually had to delete it entirely when she started messaging friends and coworkers. She'll send me random emails under her address or friends addresses, and today she found my professional online portfolio and messaged me on that. For every email I block it's like 4 more pop up, and it's so frustrating. I never answer, never engage, but it's like she's too stupid or arrogant to realize that I have no desire to be around her or interact. 

I left because she nearly killed me, and more recently I was made aware that she'd lied about something in regards to some financial aid I recieve and was getting money from me every month under my nose rather than me receiving money that I needed. Why on earth would I even speak to her. 

When the bday emails first started years ago she literally would tell me in graphic detail about how much she hated me and regretted having me, and now she's literally sent me a message like ""I wish I could send you a bday gift but I don't know how...i love you my angel!!"" 

It literally makes me feel sick, it's all just a complete lie, and it's beyond frustrating. 

Thank you to anyone who bothers to read this and sorry for the vent, I just needed to get this out somehow.

I've never worked with a range, and I want to know what you guys think I should ask for? I really don't mean to brag but I have no one else I can ask this to and was hoping you all would be able to help.

My background:

1st class degree in engineering
1 year out of university in a systems analyst grad role
current salary: 26,500 and 10% annual bonus
1 year of engineering internship experience with project management experience

new role
Engineering positon within a major company, with a salary range between £32,500 and £36,500. 

The role can be done in London and Manchester which leads me to believe the lower end of the range is for Manchester whilst the higher end of the range is for London? I don't want to ask for too much as I only have 2 years of experience since university (1 grad, 1 internship). I was think £34k but is that too much?

8ecu6q,2,2018-04-23,"Bowyers, ""artifice"" and point costs.",Rosmarii,EldritchLarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/EldritchLarp/comments/8ecu6q/bowyers_artifice_and_point_costs/,"So taking a look at the current player guide...

Being able to build arrows (straight wooden shafts) requires 30 pts for artificer 1, another 25 for artificer 2 and then 10pts for bowyer 1. For a total cost of 65pts. Characters start with 35, and get 10 pt per game. So starting character can start making bows... after playing the game for 9 months.

So, I'm supposed to believe that a woodsman can't make their own bow or arrows? This just doesn't seem realistic. Bows can and have been made for thousands of years with stone tools. In fact, here's a video of someone doing exactly that with no prior training. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDUn38JXVU.

I understand that the intent is to make characters who can craft valuable commodities in their own right who are worth protecting and politicing over. I also understand that the 3 levels of general crafting skills basically represent ""Apprentice"", ""Journeyman"" and ""Master"" levels of skill. I also understand that crafters will require both a ""tool kit"" and ""materials"" to build any tagged item.

So to translate that into the world or Arnesse: to make arrows a character will have had to devote their life to becoming a crafter (spent all of their character creation points on artificer 1)-- spent years in internship to an older bowyer, and have a specialized kit of tools that they had to make for themselves from materials that they traded for (with what is unclear since this character is a freeman with no capital to speak of and no ability to craft anything without their tool kits, but I suppose this character has gotten through 3 events... so maybe they begged a noble). To make arrows. Which are apparently consumable, non-durable goods that break once you fire them?

Where as in our world a person can go out, cut a hazel shoot with a stone, dry it for a week and then using nothing but that rock, a small fire and a chewed bit of sinew and feathers and make an effective, lethal killing tool in an afternoon. (https://youtu.be/NY68rNx3wMM)

I very much understand and laud the push to make crafting characters valuable -- however I feel that by redesigning the costs of crafting skills to be exponential or otherwise dramatically increasing instead of heavily front-loaded will encourage players to both feel empowered to invest in those skills and still serves to make highly skilled crafters worth protecting and fighting over. Since no schematics have yet to be released, you could even make it such that the apprentice levels of a crafting skill are only able to make or do things like repair damaged equipment and replace common consumables, and leave the actual ""crafting"" to those with the Journeyman or Master level skills -- thus still allowing you to limit the availability of those items in play.

The fact that even if I wanted to make a character who was solely a bowyer, I would be unable to even make a bow (THE ONE THING I'M BUILT TO DO) until almost a year into play really discourages me from choosing that option when I could instead choose to play a swordsman who can start play with armor, toughness, a called attack of your choice and weapon skills (Armor proficency 4pts. Melee weapons 4pts, Tough 2 10pts. Master of arms 2 - 10 pts. Sunder 1 4pts. - 32 pts.) Or an roguish information broker who can start with the ability to gather information on others and the world, open locks and other devices including manacles, dodge attacks and still knows how to use a club or a sword if it comes to it (Information broker 2 10pts. Disable Device 2 10pts. Dodge 1 4pt. Melee weapons 1 4pt. Armor proficiency 4pt. - 32 pts.)

Given those choices, which would you choose? Start playing the character you want from jump or wait a year in the hope that your character isn't killed or blamed by a noble for some political reason so that you can make a bow or item for someone else?

The school I chose to go to is a long while away from my friends and family. The only real friend I had my first year was my roommate, and I struggled hard mentally. I'd secretly checked in to therapy sessions to struggle with a depression I told no one about. This semester I got into a flat with him again and several of his friends. I didn't know any of them and was very nervous going into this, but the flat is 20x better than dorms. Anyways, about two weeks into last semester I came out of my room on a Saturday and caught them playing DnD. I'm not good around people, but I loved every moment of watching them. I sat in for four hours, just watching.

The next week, I was offered a spot by the DM, and rolled up an eladrin circle of dreams druid, as the party was lacking real support aside from a paladin. The DM kindly took time to help explain to me character creation and form a backstory that meshes well with the narrative. Since then, I look forward to game day most of all every week. Even in just a short period of a couple weeks, I feel this game allowed me to relate to my new friends more.(and not to mention explore a character and have the fun associated with that!) It's a darker setting, but it makes me happy just thinking about it. In two weeks we all have to go our seperate ways for internships and the like, but we're going to keep in touch and maybe figure out how to use Roll20 to keep these game nights going. Thanks, DnD."

There are almost too many reasons to list as to why I think Social Justice Warriors are full of shit and the whole phenomenon of SJW crybabies influencing the media and popular discourse with their brand of political correctness is complete bullshit, and I'm sure much of this isn't news to any of you, but I’m going to try and be as concise as possible and summarize everything wrong with the crybullies:

It’s a cult. It functions exactly like a cult. You know what other group does the same exact sorts of things? Jehovah’s Witnesses. I was a Jehovah’s Witness for much of my childhood. My upbringing cultivated an extreme abhorrence for religious and magical thinking. I was raised in a cult, but I’m an atheist now. I have a vehement dislike for cults of any kind. The idea that people will be rewarded with a utopia if only they follow a specific dogma prescribed by the cult’s leaders is manipulative and cruel. SJWs are encouraged to cut off and shun people who fail to uphold the tenets of SJWism. Most SJWs who discover that their friends are not also SJWs will freak out on those friends, feed them the dogma, and try to “convert” them, and if those friends refuse, they’ll cut off contact with them. This is literally how cults work.

It’s intrinsically divisive and creates double-standards out of nothing. At the heart of SJWism lies the frothing shit-crock known as identity politics. This is the idea that the identity of a speaker is more important than anything they have to say. It’s hilariously reductionist. Basically, if you’re a member of an oppressed class of people, and you say exactly the same thing as someone who isn’t part of an oppressed class of people on the topic of oppression, what you have to say is automatically more valid, because you have firsthand experience. Objectivity is denigrated, and emotional, subjective responses to claims are encouraged. Under SJW dogma, there is no universal truth, only personal truths. This is both illiberal and contrary to Renaissance values. It takes perfectly good individuals and reduces them to collectives based on their physical and mental attributes. If two people say the sky is blue, it shouldn’t matter what color their skin is, or if they have a dick or a twat, or who they like to fuck. Identity politics is complete nonsense.

Learning about SJW dogma only qualifies you to teach others about SJW dogma. The range of disciplines involved in SJWism have no practical real-world applications. None. If you get a degree in communications, you’re going to go into journalism and preach SJWism. If you become a professor, you’re going to brainwash kids with this bullshit. Nothing about SocJus teaches you how to build a bridge, or man a ship, or run a factory, or engineer electronics, or anything of any actual use. These degrees are fucking easy. People pick them because they’re easier than STEM and make dipshit brainlets feel good about themselves. If you’re such an unremarkable, low-IQ twat that you come out of college with a BA in Communications, you could’ve saved a whole lot of money by going to trade school, and then you’d be making a decent amount of bread as a plumber or electrician instead of flipping burgers while sucking dick to try and get an internship at some online tabloid like the useless fucking sack of shit you are. They’re offended when I say shit like this? Well, I’m offended. I’m offended that I have to breathe the same air as these people. I’m offended that their lungs are molesting innocent oxygen molecules with carbon exchange as we speak.

The whole concept of avoiding PTSD triggers is nonsense. PTSD triggers are not supposed to be avoided. You're supposed to expose yourself to them in a controlled environment to desensitize yourself to them. What it basically amounts to is that they commandeered the language of psychiatry to try and police speech. 

They’ve ruined comedy. You can’t joke about anything anymore, because not only do these silly twats lack a sense of humor, they consider even slightly racy humor to be something worth prosecuting people over. Thanks to political correctness, a man who tried teaching a pug how to Heil Hitler was fined hundreds of pounds sterling for obscenity. They actually charge people with crimes for filming harmless pranks in the comfort of their own home. SJWs think that this entirely Orwellian state of affairs is somehow desirable.

They’ve ruined fiction. You can’t write about anything without offending someone. Wanna write a rape scene in your book? Maybe a lynching? That’s insensitive! Your cult-assigned Sensitivity Reader will give you zero stars. See, this is how you know SJWs are full of shit. They’ll say “We live in a rape culture” or “Rape is everywhere!” and cite all these statistics saying one in four women will be a victim of rape sometime in their life, but then turn around and say that you can’t write about it in a fictional context without being really circumspect and evasive about it. Well, if rape is as common as breathing, why can’t we write about it in all its terrible, twisted details? I mean, the whole point of authoring a work of fiction is to comment on reality in some way or another, right? Because, they say. Someone who was raped may pick it up and feel terrible about themselves, and that’s terrible. Someone who likes rape scenes may jerk their gerkin to it, and that’s also terrible. Best not to include it at all, they mutter. Well, you know what? Fuck you! In fact, from now on, any stories I write will have three times as much rape in them, just to spite you motherfuckers! I hope somebody’s triggered. I hope somebody picks up something I wrote and cries great big crocodile tears. You think I give a shit? You think I’m supposed to give one single shit? Fuck you. I want to make you hurt. On purpose. That means I’m doing my job as an author. What, you think you’re supposed to pick up some horror novel, and it isn’t supposed to hurt? That you’re supposed to walk away with warm, fuzzy feelings no matter what literature graces your hands? You wanna reduce all fiction to a bunch of fucking feel-good Hallmark Cards? You want everything to be covered in pillows and cotton candy to shield you from reality? Fuck you. I’m going to find some way to crawl in your head and give you nightmares, and afterward, I’ll sleep like a fucking baby.

They’re ruining eye candy. How come when I boot up Mass Effect: Andromeda, the dude-Ryder looks hot, but if I want to make a female character, she has to have a big, round, creased, pockmarked, tanned face like a fucking baked potato, with a nose that looks like a small potato on a big potato? Because. SJWs, son. Potato. Jesus, you should see the fucking wankstains who developed that game. They all look like potatoes, too. I’m guessing they used themselves for reference.

They’re ruining journalism. How many publications these days invite you to support the same bullshit neoliberal authoritarian-statist status quo? How many publications are even the slightest bit sympathetic to a libertarian or individualist point of view? Or, for that matter, how many are just plain unbiased? NYT, WSJ, Reuters and AP are fine, but god. Outside of that, all you hear are these bullshit fucking opinion pieces. It’s always the same crap. Excoriating decent people or works of fiction for not following SJW dogma. Holding up unremarkable bullshit by minority authors as the second coming of Christ just because it adheres to their traditions. Whining about the latest episode of South Park, or something insensitive that Ricky Gervais said, or a video game character who had a nip slip out of her top, or whatever the fuck it is that's grinding their gears today. It’d be one thing if this sort of shit were a range of niche opinions, but this shit is everywhere. It’s overrepresented in journalism. Too many of these cunts have a platform that unquestioningly accepts them for what they are instead of holding them to a higher standard, which brings me to my next point.

They like to silence dissent. If you want to speak your mind, if you want to tell them why their dogma is unscientific, new-agey nonsense, not only will they not engage you in rational debate, they will insult you, tar-and-feather you, try to get you fired from your job, and try to get you blacklisted from public speaking roles. For all their whining about fascism, they more closely resemble fascists than any other demographic. The people who call themselves fascists are just right-libertarian gilded-age corporatists trying to be outrageous and put their opponents off-balance by projecting an intimidating aura.

They’re just plain fugly. Short hair dyed neon blue, fish mouth, love handles, braces. God, they’re like some kind of Coney Island freak show. I would pay good money to see SJWs wrestle over deep-fried Twinkies.

In conclusion, fuck them. But not literally, because that would be gross as hell and your dick or tongue would come back covered in SJW smeg.

Oh, and there's one other thing. You know what pisses me off the most about it? It's unkind. Brainwashing all these unremarkable dipshits into thinking that they can be a part of something bigger than themselves, if only they start by feeling guilty about literally everything in their lives. That's not something that someone who believes in justice does."

We both didn't really have any notably close friends and became best friends. I am quiet and she loves to talk, things use to be so easy. She went to community college for nursing while working part time and I went straight to a university the following year for engineering. School is stressful, I tend to complain and be more hateful when I'm stressed so over the years with my workload I've had times where I've been mean to her verbally. She made some friends last year in school and I was happy for her. I decided to do an internship for a year. We decided to move in together with one of her friends(F). F is messy and dislikes me for not entertaining her. My gf starts hanging out with the F's friend group more (dancing, drinking, girl talks, etc). F shit talks me to her friends. I am no longer stressed, I only complain about chores occasionally (80/20 split is unfair), and am not mean. Her friends talk her into breaking up with me(Feb. 2018). She claims all the little things over the years have added up. She's been awful to me for the past month. She stays out until 1 in the morning all week, ghosts me, talks on her phone with her friends (some are boys) for 2+ hours on the nights she is home, and won't give me the time of day. I'm moving out in 2 weeks and we're going to do no contact for at least a month. She's house sitting for 2 weeks so it's basically already no contact besides her popping in to grab things. I don't feel like anything I've done has been bad enough to warrant leaving and I really feel like she was convinced she's in a bad situation by her friends. So here I am, alone with no friends while she becomes a party girl. She'll be so busy being entertained that she won't miss boring old me. Be me."

Everyone has always told me, ""Study hard and you'll make it"" But that is not the case, Ive come to realize its all about who you know. You are either born with it or not.

I dont know where I am going to live in 3 weeks when the semester is over. I need something, and somewhere, and someone. Ive been trying as hard as I can, but after getting denied 20+ from online applications, and 2 unsuccessful interviews, I am ready to throw in the towel. I understand that i am still very young, but I need something to go right for me at this point because it seems like nothing is.
Ive tried it all. And Ive tried everywhere. I have taken all the advice that has been given to me, and all the feedback I have received, but nothing is working. Ive even tried other places that arent close. Ill move across the country for the summer I dont care, I just need something, anything.

For prospective astronaut selections (around 2030s-2040s), retrospectively &amp; theoretically speaking what would be considered a ""highly qualified"" candidate for the astronaut corps to Mars? I want to focus on Engineering &amp; flight hours in this situation and ask if this would a favorable candidate to NASA's astronaut selection board:

- Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with distinction &amp; honors, Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering, &amp; a PhD in Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry *or* Electrical and Computer Engineering.
- Numerous internships, extra-curriculars &amp; research opportunities
- Commissioned US Air Force pilot *or* US Navy aviator ; distinguished graduate from Test Pilot School &amp; accumulating 1,500+ test pilot in command hours of complex military jets. 
- Incredibly fit and passes all physical examinations.

Would one with these sample qualifications be a favorable candidate for NASA's astronaut selection around 2030-2040 for the manned Mars mission? Would they be considered as an ideal pilot &amp; can they also be considered for a mission specialist, commander, or payload specialist? or would someone with similar qualifications just be thrown in the pool to be selected with other similar pilot qualified astronaut hopefuls? and other applicants with extensive research experience over military hours would be considered primarily for mission specialist positions?

Edit: I heard in this sub-reddit that the needs of astronauts is declining &amp; was wondering if this would be true considering NASA and/or other space agencies tend to have the goal to send humans to Mars by 2050.

I graduate from college in December with a degree in Criminology (I wish I'd seen this reddit about 4 years ago so I could have chose something different). But I plan to pursue a career as an officer after graduation. I have a few questions and any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

1. Whats the best way to prepare for academy? Physical fitness is already on the list. I hit the gym 5 days a week and have cleaned up my diet. 

2. How likely is it to be hired straight out of school by a sheriff's department? I don't really know the difference between city and county's hiring process/requirements, but I was fortunate enough to have an internship with my local sheriff's office doing ride alongs and I loved it. After completing the internship I was sold on where I wanted to work.

3. My school offers internships as classes through the Crim program. Does it matter if I intern with a jail or not? I heard from a lot of officers I road with that they began working in a jail and worked their way up.

I appreciate any and all advice. As always, thank you for your service and I look forward to being a brother in blue soon!"
8egc26,11,2018-04-23,UCR or UCSD???,okpeach,ucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucr/comments/8egc26/ucr_or_ucsd/,"I can't decide between UCR and UCSD. 

I’ve been accepted as an Economics major at both UC's, but I plan on changing my major since Econ doesn't interest me anymore. I want to switch my major to something in STEM, but I’m not sure what yet. I don’t know what I want to pursue, and I’m not sure if I want to go to graduate school :/

Here’s the situation: 
UCSD has the better reputation, which might mean more opportunities for research and internships. It has a wonderful location (close to the beach and San Diego), and they have a six college system that seems interesting (I got into Warren college, which is far from most classes, but close to the Price Center and library). SD has nice gear, a beautiful library, and I have a close friend going to SD (ERC College). However, it's been said that SD is socially dead, and I'm worried about the competitiveness of the school (When I visited on Triton Day, people seemed stressed/tired; It didn't feel like there was much of a community). For dining, I've heard Warren food sucks, and I know that it's a dining dollar system, not buffet-style, and that turns me off. Additionally, I feel like UCSD's Warren College has harder GE's and that switching majors would be harder at SD than at UCR. I don't know if I'll be happy w so much competition/stress.

At UCR, I received the Chancellor's scholarship, but the cost of attendance for both schools is roughly the same. I was also accepted into the Honors program, which means that I will be dorming at Pentland Hills if I decide to go thru with the program. Anyhow, UCR has a modern-looking and centralized campus, so I won't need to walk as much, and I heard it's good for pre-meds (IDK if I am going into pre-med though). I feel like I would do better in my classes at R than at SD and stand out more. There seems to be more spirit as well. However, the reputation is not as good and I dislike the location (hot+not much to do). The gear is also not as nice. Plus, I know a lot of people from my HS going to UCR, and I kinda want to avoid them LOL. I also know more people transfer out of UCR so I think that's saying something.

Anyway, from my home, UCSD is a two hour drive, and UCR is one hour away. I will be dorming at both schools. 

Some stuff about me:
I'm extremely introverted and only have a few close friends, but I want to meet new people and make friends in college. I don't party or rave, but I'm open to it LOL. I'm also really focused on school, but I'm lazy, so I procrastinate until the last minute for studying and hw. I feel like I can fit in at either SD and R. 

Sorry for the long post and thank you if you read all of it. I'm so conflicted about where to go. Please advise bc May 1 is coming up soon :((

My slim waist, thick, muscular thighs, and perfectly toned stomach would catch anyone's eye.  But what made me a legend was the massive cock between my legs, difficult to conceal when soft, impossible to ignore hard.  And of course, and endless appetite to match my impressive endowments.

I came into my own in college, gaining a domineering attitude as I fucked my way through the girl's dorms and raided sororities, breaking the wills of every good girl I came across.  Whole teams fell to me and would regularly have me join them in the locker rooms after practice.  My favorite past time became working out in tight fitting spandex to show off my incredible physique and tease the gym rats with my impossible bulge.

After school, I wouldn't slow down, taking every cute secretary, coworker, client's wife or intern that crossed my path.  You can get away with that if every woman in HR is sending you dirty, begging texts.

I love showing off, so of course my snap chat, twitter, and instagram are full of provocative, teasing photos of me and my conquests.  My phone is constantly buzzing with texts and pics from girls I've fucked and those who have somehow gotten my number and want a taste.  Cam shows and live streaming have become a great second source of income, though if I'm being honest, I'd do it for free.

---------

So yes, this is over the top and ridiculous. That's the vibe I want and would love for you to embrace.  So where do you fit in? Are we back in college? Do you spy me in the gym? Are you the wife or daughter of one of my clients? Do you have some other idea? I love brainstorming scenes, so feel free to come with ideas or characters and we can build something.

Also, just because we're going crazy doesn't mean we need to skimp on details or rush through things.  I love teasing and slow build ups.  Good dialog is always a plus.

Other kinks I'm into but are not required: incest, BDSM, exhibition, public sex, lots of cum, overly endowed partners, penis and breast growth, penis pumps and cock rings, drugs

Not into: gore, piss, scat, lactation, feet, food"
8egiyk,0,2018-04-23,24 years old and starting all over... at a cross road and don't know what to do.,AbjectMathematician,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8egiyk/24_years_old_and_starting_all_over_at_a_cross/,"I am EXTREMELY career oriented. Ever since I was a kid, I always fantasized about being the guy that comes into work every day wearing a suit, to go to his corner office on the 50th floor. A few of my likes and hobbies are also obscenely expensive, so high income is necessary to fund them.

Because I have put such an emphasis on career development, I have moved up quickly through the ranks. I graduated when I was 21, and had three summer internships during college \(and did 20\+ hours of undergrad research during the years.\) I started off my career as a design engineer \(\~6 months\) before being promoted to a regional sales manager \(1 year\), and after that switched companies to become a national business development manager \(1.5 years\). Right now I'm in talks \(with my current company\) about a promotion to director of North American sales. I've been putting in 80 hour weeks on the regular to constantly improve my skillset, so it's nice to see this being recognized. 

Right now I make about $120K \(which is low for business development, but I'll get into that in a minute.\) The director level position is about $140K\-$150K. My new manager would be the VP of sales, which is about $180K. His manager is the president/CEO of the company. I don't know how much that position pays.  But realistically, I'm looking to cap out at, at most, $200K. 

This is one of the largest companies in my field, so it's not just an issue of ""switch companies."" It's an issue of the industry. I work in an industry that is almost exclusively an expense and only rarely makes money.  It's an industry purely driven by regulation. If the governments of the world decided my industry wasn't important, it would literally die tomorrow. Since there's no money in the industry, there's low salaries even up to the highest rung. 

The issue is I am extremely technical, and this is just about the only industry I know. Sure, I could go get a business development position in another industry, but that would be a couple steps back in my career, and I'd be looking at another 10 years until I'm ready for a director level position. I'm kind of lost on how to handle it, I feel like my wage is about to start stagnating. 

One thought I had was to get an MBA and work as a technical consultant for financial projects in this industry. But that seems like an ""all your eggs in one basket"" sort of deal. 

Any advice? It sucks most of the professionals I talk to are sales guys or business development guys that are happy to take their $100K\-$140K job and just live their life, so they don't really have any experience in moving up the corporate ladder. And I don't really want to talk to my boss about shit like this. "

Must have skipped writing ""long"". 

I posted this first in r/depression but it didn't get much notice and I still would like to see what other people would have to say. 

Female from Canada, 28 years old. Late bloomer at life. 

So I had an internship at a really good international company. When I got the placement, people in my class were sooo jealous being all like ""omggg I wanted this place!"" I had never heard of it because I'm not from this city , I'm only here for school.

So I did my placement (office administration) , and I was soooo nervous, anxious, I cried the night before I started.. Like I just did not want to do this. I had to get up at 545 am everyday (not at all used to that) and not get home till 6 pm because it was pretty much a 1-1.5 hour bus commute. I hated it. The 2 weeks (yeah I know, only 2 weeks!!) I was there, my apartment was such a disgusting mess. Dishes were everywhere, take out garbage scattered on my desk, no clean socks or underwear left, I hardly showered (and I'm a neat freak) .. I was just so tired and exhausted after work that I would eat subway or make a Grilled cheese or frozen pizza for dinner, lay on the couch and watch Netflix from 630-830 until I went to bed at 9 pm and not fall asleep till around 12. Every night. I had NO motivation to clean, tidy up, cook, I ignored my 2 best friends for those 2 weeks because I couldn't muster up the willingness to call them. I know I sound absolutely pathetic... It was only 2 weeks.

But I fucking went every single day. Was never late. I got my ass out of bed at 545 and did it. I put on my BEST face and attitude and seemed like a real fucking go getter. I was energetic and happy and fun and positive on the outside but would go to the bathroom and rest my head on the side and breathe and tear up a little.

ANYWAYS, now that my placement is done, I am relieved, however I know there will come a time where I can't avoid not having a iob any longer. I live on my own, pay rent and all my bills on my own from a stash of cash I have from selling my mom's house when she died (was not a great deal of money, I've been frugal with it but it's been keeping me alive).

I got an email saying I have an interview with this place for a position on Friday. I accepted of course because I would be a fool not to and I'd be so ashamed of myself... But I'm terrified. I'm scared. This job was hard. It's for a huge company with a lot of theory based knowledge to it... And it'd be taking away my freedom to sit on the couch and hate my life. I know that sounds absolutely ridiculous... It's hard to explain. It's like I'm content with being miserable.

Either way, I need help with convincing me this is for the best. Who knows I might not even get it, but I'm sure because I already had a placement there then i have a great chance at getting it.

I'm terrified. I feel I'm too depressed. I know I won't have any energy to do anything on my weekends or after work. I lose all social life and any hobbies and interests I have now. I know this is ""welcome to adulthood"", but I honestly am just weak. The people who can do this every single day for the rest of their lives and still have a life outside of it are like superheros to me. I don't know how I'll be able to do this if I get hired. I honestly just wanted to start a twitch stream and work full time on getting something going there (I'm literally a clown. Happy and fun on the outside but depressed and miserable on the inside) but now if I get hired, there's no way I'll have motivation to try that. 

Also, one last thing.. I feel like I'm generally pretty stupid. I'm a slow learner, and it takes a lot of time and repeated words to get me to understand what it is I'm doing and why I'm doing it, and for a company like this... I feel like I'm just too stupid for it. I'm not intellectually all there I feel and I'm going to come off embarrassing and airheaded.

My past jobs have literally just been serving or working in a cafe. To be honest though I haven't had a job in quite a while. When my mom died I took a lot of time off because I could barely get out of bed, this lasted a while. I have a lot underlining issues with that whole thing that I am seeing a therapist for. But then I went back to school a year later and here we are. 


If anyone has had to deal with this in their life some advice and words of encouragement would be really appreciated.

To my surprise, I awoke laying on a gray field of grass that looked like it stretched on forever. I couldn’t tell you if it was day or night as I couldn’t see the sun or the moon. The entire sky was as grey and as lifeless as the grass I was laying on.

“I see you have awoken,” a cool voice said behind me. I sat up with a start. I whipped my head around. “Who are you? Where am I?” I demanded. The young man in the grey suit sighed. “My name is not important, although I would probably be referred to as ‘Death’s intern’ in your world. I’ll ask you to save the rest of your questions to the end, as I’m sure you can imagine, I have a lot of work to do.” He pulled a file out of his briefcase and began reading his script. “Welcome insert na…er…John Richardson to The Afterlife. Think of the area around you as a waiting room. Since you have lived a decent life it seems, you have quite a few options. I see you were baptized as Catholic, but it seems like you haven’t been to church in 20 years. No matter, it just means that Traditional Heaven is out of the picture. Don’t worry, it’s pretty overrated anyways. However, I can offer you our Tropical Island Package. It is one of our best options and my personal favorite. Of course, you always have the rebirth option, if you are particularly attached to Earth.” I scoffed. “Are you kidding me? I’ve spent 20 years of my life working as a social worker. I’ve seen the worst that life has to offer people. I’m glad to get away from that hellhole,” I retorted. The intern shrugged. “Fair enough,” he replied. He snapped his fingers.

Instantly, my scenery changed. Tiki huts popped up all over a white sand beach. Everywhere, people were relaxing and drinking an orange liquid out of a slim, clear glass as they lay in great white lounging chairs. Others were napping with an empty glass beside them. The pale blue ocean in front of me was as smooth as glass. In short, it was perfection. “Here is your spot and here is your beverage,” the intern said briskly as he gestured to the seat next to him while handing me what looked like a glass of orange juice. I wasn’t thirsty, but I took a tiny sip out of politeness. Immediately, my head went foggy. “Whaatttss iinnn thissss,” I slurred. “It’s fine,” he assured me. “Just drink it.” I dropped it in the sand and yelled, “I wiiilll nnnott.” None of the other people on the beach reacted to my outburst. “I’mmm gonnnna taaakkke a naaapp,” I mumbled. I passed out on my lounging beach chair.

When I awoke, the intern was there. “What the hell was that?” I demanded. The intern sighed. “That was the memory cleansing drink. If you are not satisfied with this afterlife, we can try the mountain lodge instead. Their memory cleanse is hot cocoa flavored, if that makes a difference,” he suggested. “It’s not about the beach!” I snapped. “Don’t you get it? As long as you are going to wipe my memories I want no part of it. I also don’t want to just be sedated forever. I know there was some sort of sleeping medication in there. I’ve never felt so tired in my life and that’s saying something.”

“Sir, with all due respect, the beverage is a necessary part of the experience. You can’t relax with all your memories and feelings! You should know that better than anyone. I’ve read your file. I know what you have been through. Human beings think too much. It is why they make themselves miserable,” he explained

“It doesn’t matter. My memories and my feelings are important. They make me who I am. We can’t just sit around and do nothing because we are too sedated to have clear thoughts. Sure we might be happier, but is that really living?” I cried passionately.

“We? Who is we? I’m just trying to get college credit through this program and you are not making it very easy, by the way. Why can’t you just drink the freaking drink? No one else had a problem with it, just you pal,” the intern retorted.

“I guess you will just have to send me back then because I’m not going to sit on my ass all day. What kind of life is that?” I said stubbornly.

The intern shook his head in disbelief. “You really do care don’t you?” he asked.

“Yeah I do,” I replied.

“So rebirth then?” He asked.

“Yes, rebirth,” I stated. Earth is a tough place, but at least I could have a real life there.

The last image I saw of the afterlife was the intern shaking his head at my foolishness. He chuckled as I shrunk and began to change into a newborn baby.

He didn’t understand that there is more to life than just existing."
8egyda,1,2018-04-23,How the heck does one pay for college?,feckinheck,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8egyda/how_the_heck_does_one_pay_for_college/,"Hello,

Here's the situation:
I've completed my gen eds at my local college in my freshman year for relatively cheap; I was able to pay for nearly all of my expenses from this year and only took out a small federal loan.

I've been accepted but have not accepted enrollment at a great college where I qualify for in-state tuition. This college undoubtedly has excellent programs for what I want to do (English bachelor, TEFL minor) and many opportunities for internships at publishing companies that'll hopefully become careers. The only problem is that this university costs about $14,000 for tuition alone each year. I'd also have to pay for housing (about $6,000 a year) and a meal plan (around $2,000 a year) plus I think I could probably keep my spending on books under $200.  So, $22,200. Per year. For probably 3 years-- $66,600.

My parents are not in a financial position to extensively help me, but because of circumstances, the FAFSA *thinks* they'd be very helpful and because of this my initial FAFSA estimate for next year is only about $4000 in unsub, sub, and work-study. Obviously not enough.

I work a retail job, making a couple thousand more dollars a year that'll help, but still not enough. 

And I'm applying for scholarships, but I can't necessarily rely on those.

I know that I could take a gap year and make as much money as I can... but I don't know if I want to spend another year at home. It feels like giving up, like failing. And anyway, how much of a dent in my future debt could my crappy retail job really make?

The thing is, I need to accept enrollment at this university in the next month. I'm 18 and I'm the first kid in my family to go to college and neither of my parents went to a 4 year college, either. 

My questions to people who have gone through this: if I take out bank loans to help pay for this stuff, is it possible to pay off so much money in a lifetime? With all that student loan debt, are you still able to travel, to live somewhat comfortably? Are there other options for paying for college that I'm missing? 

To be honest, I'm really afraid to take on so much debt. Anything you can tell me will be appreciated :)

8eha9l,7,2018-04-23,Delayed Results (more than 8 weeks now),mytermsaresimple,universityofauckland,https://www.reddit.com/r/universityofauckland/comments/8eha9l/delayed_results_more_than_8_weeks_now/,"Is it common for departments to delay the final grades for more than 8 weeks? 

The Master of Information Technology program has an internship component and it has been more than 8 weeks the results of this component have been delayed. Just want to know if this is common that the results of such practical course components take such a long time? 

The department has said it will take about 3 months since the day of the final submission of the internship  report but would 'try' to release soon. Its disappointing having to wait this long without the final grade. Any others have similar experiences with such long delays?"
8ehl30,1,2018-04-23,Me [21M] and my girlfriend [22F] of 4 months are having trouble figuring out our relationship while long-distance.,Horyshi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ehl30/me_21m_and_my_girlfriend_22f_of_4_months_are/,"We started dating right before starting internships 7 hours away from each other (yes, I know, bad idea). We've only been able to see each other once a month at best. This summer we'll be a little closer and able to see each other more often, but we won't be together long-term until the fall when school starts again (we go to the same university).

This is the first major relationship for both of us, although she has dated some before me. We get along really well and are super compatible. However, recently she said that our relationship has been missing a romantic component to it.

For me, it already feels romantic. When we're together, we'll go out on dates and walk around town, cook and watch movies together, make out, etc. When we're apart we'll talk for hours and are very emotionally close.

However, to her, those are just ""best friend"" things (minus the making out, lol). She has many close friends who she feels she can share most anything with, so many of the things I feel like are more special, since I only do them with her, she feels are more ""friendly"". So when we actually do meet up physically, she feels less like my girlfriend and more like my friend, and so is more hesitant to be emotionally/physically intimate. She talked about ""not feeling like she is my girlfriend"".

I'm not sure what she means by this, and neither is she, really. I can sort of sense the lack of romanticism she's talking about, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong or how to be more romantic (again, first relationship). I don't really have a great guide for relationships in my life, either (parents are married but very... practical/boring about it). I'll see her next in a couple of weeks and we'd really like to hash this out since it'll set the tone for the next few months of our relationship (or if it should even continue while we're long-distance). Any advice?

TL;DR: How to cultivate a more romantic relationship when long-distance (or at all, really)?"
8ei156,3,2018-04-24,Laid-off and looking for your advice,De_5_5,Munich,https://www.reddit.com/r/Munich/comments/8ei156/laidoff_and_looking_for_your_advice/,"Rather, I need your advise here in presenting myself to recruiters.



I graduated in 2016 from a Polish university and since then had 3 roles within 2 years of time span. 

- First one was at a major bank which I left at my own accord since I wanted to move to Germany and the role offered not much growth over time.

- Second one was an internship at an early-stage venture that I was very hopeful to convert to a full-time except that the founder - the one who I was on excellent terms with - passed away, there was downsizing, and my role was no longer applicable. No full-time role and had to look for something new.

- I really enjoy my current role (Jr. Operations Manager) but...as if a stroke of bad luck and before I could gain more experience/skills to make myself indispensable, once again there has been an internal reorganization and my manager suggested I should leave by mid-summer since they need someone more senior for this position. 

OK, that was the bad part.
The kinda-good part is that all of the aforementioned companies are well-known and my references from all my managers/previous companies have been very good. Additionally, I actually did make some noticeable contribution etc. during my time at each role.


Nonetheless, I simply do not know how to approach recruiters now and present all this without coming off as someone who is job-hopping all the time. I really, really want to be more stable at a job, learn German (A2 right now after 1 year in Germany)

What should I do and how do I present all of this in the best possible and succinct way? I am very stressed because of this and seek your suggestion.

8ei6ve,1,2018-04-24,Immigration Options,YM92-YOYO,ImmigrationCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/8ei6ve/immigration_options/,"Hello,

I hope you guys are doing well. I need to know my options for immigration to Canada. I'm currently in Alberta on a study permit that is valid for 7 months. I came on exchange. I know that the provincial program here has my occupation on the list of Engineering  Occupations Category as part of the Strategic Recruitment Stream. But I have some pros and cons:

Pros:

1- Bachelors in Mining Engineering. 
2-Masters degree in Economics.
3-Both from recognized English taught programs in Asia and Europe.
4-IELTS 8/9 (expires end of July).
5- Canada Exchange (one semester only) at a recognized university. 
6- Age below 28.
7- Single, never married. 

Cons:

1- Experience is below 1 year. Almost 9 months of paid internships. Total two years of non paid work. 

*UPDATE* I've checked with my previous company, if my experience can be documented properly, I would have almost two years of paid work. 

2- No Canadian work experience. 
3- No relatives in Canada. 

May I know what kind of options do I have? 

Thanks for your help in advance.

8eio7l,3,2018-04-24,M4M - The Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8eio7l/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"I hope you can tell from my sparkling prose that I'm an adult. I'm also only looking for adult partners for roleplay - its like let's pretend only stickier

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

8eirrx,13,2018-04-24,Is this a San Francisco issue or a big city issue?,danny841,sanfrancisco,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/8eirrx/is_this_a_san_francisco_issue_or_a_big_city_issue/,"So I've been applying to jobs in San Francisco for about three months now and I've had four phone screens and one on site interview. I tried to apply to developer roles with my bootcamp experience and figured out how pointless that was. So now I'm applying to customer service and tech support jobs (which I have some experience in). 

I've actually had more call backs from developer roles than customer service jobs. I got in the habit of looking at people in similar roles at the companies I'm applying to. Without fail they're people with years of experience in similar roles or even things like Project Manager or Implementation Engineer in their resume. They've all gone to amazing college or worked on internships. 

These customer support roles make less than $50k a year in the highest CoL area in the country. They were undoubtedly making more in their previous jobs. I can almost guarantee it.

Is this just a San Francisco thing or is it any big city? What causes these people to accept the roles they do? Especially people with project management or team lead experience? 

I'm getting pretty desperate to find a job that pays more than the $18 an hour I made in Los Angeles. And I never thought I'd say that. "

8ejb7p,0,2018-04-24,I feel like I've put my life on hold for debt,litesONlitesOFF,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8ejb7p/i_feel_like_ive_put_my_life_on_hold_for_debt/,"I'm a 24 year old recent college graduate. While I was in school I felt like my life was full, Ioved school (for the first time ever), was involved in clubs and had a great internship. I met lots of wonderful people and had an amazing group of friends. I felt really good about my career in the entertainment industry and was already working a few gigs. I was getting over living with depression and just really felt great about my life over all. 

After graduation, I've been left feeling empty. I have $60k in loans and I'm racking up credit card debt because I don't get paid often enough to pay my bills. That internship has gotten me some work as a freelancer, but it's not often enough to get ahead or save anything. I've stayed in this job because I really love it, I can decide if I need a few days of or a week off but I've had way too much time off so far, only working 10-15 days a month. It's a lot of fun, when the work is there I can make about $45/hour on a show.  Although its been slow so I've made roughly $11/hour comparable to a 40 hour a week job this year. I'm still waiting for about half of my checks from 2018 to come in too. So to save on costs my boyfriend and I have 2 roommates (so 4 of us in 1 house). He has the same job, so we never go out, spend money, or enjoy our lives because having hobbies or friends or just leaving the house costs money. It causes a great deal of stress on our relationship because all we have to do is bicker at each other about bills, or who was the last to do the dishes (and so on). I've also lost most of my friends because they've moved away after college or just work too often to get together. So I'm starting to become super emotionally unstable and rely on my boyfriend for happiness. I start to hate myself when I realize I'm doing this because in the 3 and a half years we've been together it's been truly amazing and we've had a really healthy relationship. This is mostly me reverting to my old self when I was with very unstable guys in pretty awful relationships. With all of this I've come to feel like my house is a jail and I just lay around the house all day waiting to be out of debt and trying not to get on my boyfriends nerves (he's a saint honestly). 

On top of all this I've been having to take care of my sick grandmother who is on her own road to recovery dealing with the passing of her (emotionally abusive) husband of 26 years. I only go about twice a week but it's always very stressful and is almost 2 hours away. Unfortunately the only answer to this would be convincing her to move in with one of her children (who have both offered!) But are in the north and she's just too stuck to Florida. 

I just really thought after graduation I would be able to save up for a year or two (while building my career) for a down payment on a house, get married, have some children and get my life started. It doesn't help either that I've got my mother and grandmothers constantly talking about me having a wedding or children before they die. The way things are going it is not realistic for the next 5 years, or maybe 12 years when my loans are paid off! I just feel like it's all on hold for now, but I don't know how long that is and it's really crushing my spirit, because I never wanted to start my life in debt And poverty.

 And while I type all of these complaints I have about my life I feel extremely guilty about not feeling happy, because when I really analyze it I have a great life and I'm appreciative of all the amazing people I have in my life. I just can't seem to find my happiness through all of this anxiety and depression.

 I know this is pretty rant-y and I'm not really sure what kind of advice I'm looking for, but it just kind of helps to get it all out there, and this is the most supportive sub I know. Thanks for reading. "
8ejxky,2,2018-04-24,"April 24th, 2018 - /r/3Dprinting: A hub for all things 3D printing!",SROTDroid,SROTD_Archives,https://www.reddit.com/r/SROTD_Archives/comments/8ejxky/april_24th_2018_r3dprinting_a_hub_for_all_things/,"Submitted by SROTDroid

####/r/3Dprinting

**180,308 prints going for 8 years!**

3D printing used to seem like it was a far away technology that only existed in sci-fi, but nowadays you can get a good 3D printer for &lt;$300! /r/3Dprinting is a hub for the community that expanded around this technology. For those who are interested in 3D printing, looking at stuff in this subreddit can help get you into the hobby.

What can you use 3D printing for? There is more uses for it than you might think. You can use it for small things like trinkets and toys, but surprisingly you can use it for functional uses as well. I've personally have made many prints (many I've designed myself) that do practical things like replacing broken parts and headphone stands. I also know of many people using it to make functional prototypes instead of paying to get injection molds, which costs waymore. 

How does 3D printing work? The most common type of 3D printer (called an FDM or FFF printer) is by laying down molten plastic, and letting it harden into the object. This process takes time, but is much cheaper than other processes such as injection molded parts.

A popular place to get free files to print is a site called [""Thingiverse""](https://www.thingiverse.com/). A couple popular prints are [a calibration boat called ""Benchy""](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622), and a [measuring cube](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2676324). My favorite thing to print is to print out models (like [tanks](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:769137)), and paint them with acrylic paint.

One major question is ""what printer should I get"", and this is entirely personal. Always do your own research into every printer, and don't just blindly pick one. 3D printing has been an evolving market, so always make sure you look at recent recommendations. Another thing to be aware of is that many printers are sold as kits, where you have to assemble it by hand. Most of the time kits require setting up electronics, and might have open power supplies, which can be dangerous. For getting your first printer, I'd recommend not getting a kit because of that.

/r/3Dprinting is a great place for things like finding cool prints, helping new people get in the hobby, asking questions, and getting help making your printer work at top capability. It's the best for getting good discussion on subjects, and almost every problem you might have, someone will have been there, and will help you through the problem. The other thing that the subreddit does is inspire for what to make next. Some of the coolest posts to me are like [this amazingly fine tuned printer](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/7sl16b/satisfying_gif_of_my_cr10_bridging_a_150mm_gap/), or this [oddly satisfying fit](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/5tasn0/i_made_some_super_satisfying_twist_containers/).

**Commonly Used terms**

CAD: Computer Aided Design, The way how you make or edit models on the computer

.STL: The most common type of file used in 3d printers

G-Code: The type of file that the 3D printers use to print objects

Slicer: The program that lets you turn a .STL/OBJ files into G-Code. This is where you determine factors such as layer size and supports.

Infill: The amount of plastic in the insides of the model. the more infill you have, the stronger the print is, but the more plastic you use.

FDM/FFF: A common type of 3D printer. This printer works by it melting plastic in a moving heated block, and laying that plastic down on the model. This is generally what most hobbyists use. The terms FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) and FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) often get interchanged.

Resin Printer: it uses a tub of resin and a laser to form the model. Generally they are more expensive and require more processing than a FDM printer, but they can make more detailed prints. The two common types of resin printers are called SLA and DLP.

Filament: The plastic used in most printers to make objects.

Here is an interview from the mods of /r/3Dprinting 
&gt;##How did you get into 3D printing?
&gt;&gt;**/u/xahk** About three years ago now, I got a 3D printer with the goal of making custom Nerf guns and printing out some of my video game character ideas. Shortly after getting my first machine, a Printrbot Simple Metal, I realized two things. One, that I was terrible at judging foam ballistic properties, and two, that I really had very little interest in making textures, UV maps, skeletons or animations for anything I made. It was around then that I started learning CAD, and working on more practical devices. Throughout all of that, and the three semi-functional to moderately usable printer frameworks that came after, I found this community to be absolutely indispensable for advice, and after the departure of a moderator last year, I decided to apply to help out with maintaining it.
*****
&gt;&gt;**/u/veive** My wife told me I needed a hobby, and I clicked /r/random and found /r/3dprinting, so I bought the cheapest kit I could find and built a printer, this was back when printrbot made wooden kits. It was a load of fun to get working, and I had a blast.

&gt;&gt;About a year later /u/traverseda asked me if I would help moderate and here we are.

&gt;##What is your favorite printer currently?

&gt;&gt;**/u/xahk** Currently I've been using a Monoprice Ultimate (sold elsewhere as a Wanhao Duplicator 6) for everything. Despite the praise often lavished on Monoprice's other offerings, the Ultimate is really an underrated little gem of a machine, and uses some parts of a quality not seen on machines twice, or three times its going price. There's also my own personal devices, but as my current one has yet to be fully finalized, I'd rather wait until I've finished some more testing to go into more detail on it.
*****
&gt;&gt;**/u/veive** The Monoprice Select Mini. I can't say that it's run flawlessly, but it has run well enough for me to print replacement parts for anything that broke, and for $200 it's tough to beat.

&gt;##What is your favorite thing to print?

&gt;&gt;**/u/xahk** Mostly functional components, with occasional favors to others, funny ideas I find online, or gifts for others. It's always amazing seeing something that existed solely on a screen built line by line, layer by layer by a finely tuned machine, and I doubt I'll ever get tired of the feeling of pulling something I've created off the bed, snapping it into place, and using something I'd just thought would be useful the day before.
*****
&gt;&gt;**/u/veive** Stuff for my kids. They love stuff like a [toy car](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:21214) or a [fidget spinner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2309267)
There are also a staggering number of small plastic bits and bobs that are needed. Stuff like a [cupboard lock](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2365101), or a [doorknob cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2842381), I've even printed a [drawer knob](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:76436)

&gt;&gt;A lot of the plastic things that we use every day cost around 50 to 100 times as much at the store as it would cost to print them.

&gt;##What's moderating the sub like? 

&gt;&gt;**/u/xahk** It's, well, interesting, to say the least. After the sub was added to /r/popular when that feature was introduced, its userbase has exploded, which has been great, in some ways, but means the community has become much less tightly-knit, and led to more than a few growing pains. Really, the biggest problem comes when users that are used to discussions about fairly subjective topics (entertainment, games, etc) apply a similar logic to the discourse on /r/3DPrinting. This can lead to problems, as a number of things relating to the danger of certain components, correct handling of materials, and the like, really only have one correct answer, as they're rooted in the simple reality of the technology.

&gt;&gt;However, that aside, this community has come together to do some amazing things, and I'm proud to be able to try and help it flourish. The collaboration, support, and knowledge of this community is hard to understate. From newcomers that just bought their first machine, to CEO and technicians that have been a part of the field for over a decade, this sub has served as the launchpad for a wide variety of ideas, gotten countless previously thought to be un-salvageable machines back online, and serves as a sort of water cooler for a large part of our community.
*****
&gt;&gt;**/u/veive** Kinda overwhelming sometimes. We have added like 2 or 3 mods since we were at 20,000 users, we are pretty careful about who gets to be a mod, since you need to have a good understanding of 3D printing.

&gt;&gt;We've had to ban a few people who thought that giving advice that could start a fire or poison someone was funny, so it's important for the moderators to know when someone is giving bad or dangerous advice.

&gt;&gt;However, people should remember that redditors are just random strangers on the internet. Take advice that you get from reddit with a grain of salt!

&gt;##What are some of your favourite posts on the sub?

&gt;&gt;**/u/xahk** I don't have the links anymore, but I don't so much have a set of favourite posts as I do a favourite type: scrap bots. Sometimes called ScrapRaps (for Scrap Rapid prototypers), or RepStRaps (Replicating bootStrapped Rapid prototypers), these are machines built out of parts found lying around, either to prove it was doable, or as a means to build the parts for a larger, more powerful machine. Seeing someone create something capable of manufacturing precise components out of nothing but old disk drives, dot matrix printers, moving on fishing line, lifted by threaded rods from a hardware store, and powered by some spare parts hooked to a breadboard is absolutely fascinating to me, and never fails to capture the imagination of both myself and many of the other users here. Not too long ago, a user built a printer that was run entirely on screw drives left over from the inside of a few CD drives, with a 3D pen hooked to the top of one, and a piece of cardboard underneath it. They were able to make surprisingly intricate models using just that, and they by no means were the first to make a machine using such motors, though the cardboard was a great touch.
*****
&gt;&gt;**/u/veive** When someone asks for help or posts a cool new print that no one has done before.

&gt;##Anything else you want to add?

&gt;&gt;**/u/xahk** Yes, you can 3D print a 3D printer. While I get the idea behind the joke, people have actually been replicating printers using other printers for about eleven years now, so it's less a joke and more the way a sizeable percentage of our user base got the machine they're currently using, or is part of the project they're currently working on. If printing printers sounds interesting to you, there are loads of resources online, and if you run into trouble, /r/3Dprinting is a great place to look for help, haha.
*****
&gt;&gt;**/u/veive** We do our best to make this sub a place that is friendly for people who are new to 3D printing.

It's already affected my prospects at one job and ruined most of my professional relationships. Not sure there were any complaints against me after all, don't think people will believe I didn't have a breakdown.**

A few months ago at a conference I was unexpectedly fired one evening half-way through, while sitting in the lobby of the venue. They informed me that since meeting with clients at this event, they had received complaints about my behavior and professionalism during my time at the company, and that they were left with no choice but to fire me to save their relationship with their clients. I was shocked, I had never received any negative feedback from these clients or got the impression that they were unhappy with my work. When I said this, my bosses said that they were surprised too but the clients were threatening to cancel their contracts if I wasn't fired, and since those contracts were worth a lot of money, I had to go.

I was not given an opportunity to hear this directly from the clients, had not been involved in any of these meetings where they discussed me, was not offered a second chance to improve or get training. I was told to leave immediately and not to discuss it with anyone as they wanted to formally announce the changeover in staff when my role had been redistributed among the other staff. They said they would handle my meetings for the rest of the conference. I was in shock, embarrassed, and so I just left without speaking to anyone. They told me we could speak about it in the office after the conference the following week, and I could collect my things from my desk too.

That evening I got a message on LinkedIn from one of the clients who had supposedly complained about me, saying they were sorry to hear what happened, but understood that the industry wasn't for everyone, and wished me the best for my future. I didn't know what to say, to me it seemed like she was just rubbing it in that her complaint had gotten me fired, and again being so embarrassed about everything, I never replied.

The next week back in the office my bosses got really petty when discussing my final payment, vacation days owed etc.. They said they already told all our clients that I had finished working with the company, so it wasn't appropriate for me to stay for my one months notice and be in communication with those clients still as my role had already been redistributed. They said if I did want to stay for my one months notice, I could do 'odd-jobs' around the office such as clearing out the storage room. I didn't think I could stand the embarrassment of being fired and then staying in office a further 4 weeks not even doing my actual job, so I declined. They also wanted me to sign a form to say I finished working with them officially earlier than when they fired me, for 'accounting purposes'. I thankfully had the sense to firmly refuse as this would have affected my social insurance and other payments. So I left that day, with the promise of being paid 3 weeks of owed vacation days and for the few days I had worked that month and no paid notice period as stated in my contract.

As I left one of my bosses took me aside and apologised, said that he hoped I understood how they needed to protect the interests of the business for the sake of the other employees. He reassured me that they didn't tell anyone - outside of those clients who complained who of course knew - I was fired as he knew that would look bad, that they had told the clients simply that had finished up with the company. I didn't really know what that meant but it sounded better than being fired so I left it at that.

6 weeks later I still had not gotten paid, despite writing every week they gave me excuses and lies that the transaction was 'being processed' or the bank 'made a mistake' etc.. Eventually one of the bosses admitted to me that they were having financial problems and simply didn't have the money to pay me. They eventually did the following week. I was still looking for work, and had secured a few job interviews. I work in an industry where most people know each other, and so this was with an employer who was acquainted with my previous company and bosses. At the interview he asked me questions such as 'Do you feel you're ready to take on this kind of role again?' and 'What kind of supports would you expect to have or need in your role?'. I presumed he was referring to how perhaps being fired had knocked my confidence, even though my boss had told me they didn't tell people I was fired, it's inevitable that some people would find out. It did not go well and I didn't get the job. At every interview I was met with glowing praise for my previous employers, I was getting so tired of hearing about how amazing my bosses were when they had treated me so badly.

I no longer heard from any of the people I had worked with, clients or colleagues. I had developed great relationships with some, but since that week at the conference I had not spoken to any of them. Then last week I bumped into the young intern who had worked at the office when I did. We chatted a bit about what we were doing now, and she said that she too had found the office environment really stressful and was close to having a breakdown herself some days.

That's when I found out that my bosses had told all our clients, and my colleagues, that I had quit due to being unable to handle the stress of the job and that attending the conference just pushed me over the edge. They had told people that they were 'very supportive' of my decision and that their employees health came first. No wonder all these interviewers thought they were amazing.

Now I'm not sure how to move forward, it seems that they told everyone that I quit due to stress, and that's clearly what the guy at my last interview was referring to. Maybe that's also what the client on LinkedIn was referring to in her message. I wonder if I was fired due to financial reasons but they didn't want to admit that to anyone - they did admit they couldn't afford to send me my final pay after I quit. Was I really fired because of complaints against me or did they just say that so that I would be embarrassed and stay quiet? Telling people I quit due to stress is not any better than telling them I was fired, why the lie?

So everyone thinks I'm not cut out for this industry, and who would want to hire a girl who left her last employer out in the cold by quitting with no notice? I'm really concerned that if I were to bring this up with anyone, they wouldn't believe me, and that the more I argue the crazier I would look. But I don't want people believing a damaging lie about me. I've worked in this industry since college, it's been 6 years and I've built a solid career base that's now potentially destroyed. I'm totally lost, what can I do?"
8ekep8,5,2018-04-24,"Dreading another day of being teased and bullied at school, Tyrone was trudging along the sidewalk,",AssistPowers,Jokes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/8ekep8/dreading_another_day_of_being_teased_and_bullied/,"dragging his hand along the neighbor's fences when he felt something wet. He looked at his hand to find white paint on his fingers and got a brilliant idea. Tyrone rubbed his hands up and down the fence and slathered his face and body with white paint.

People immediately treated Tyrone better. As he arrived at school, the janitor was dressed in a tuxedo and opened the door for him. During class, the teacher was impressed with how smart and well-behaved he was. Even when he got the wrong answer, he didn't get in trouble - he just got another chance! At lunch, he got to actually eat, rather than wear, his food and he even sat at the ""cool kids"" table. At recess, he was picked first for tennis doubles and a new friend set him up with an internship at his dad's wall street brokerage. Tyrone was only 10! It was unequivocally the best day of school ever. 

As he skipped home, Tyrone sang and snapped his fingers in rhythm: ""IIIIIIIII's white! IIIIIIIII's White! Heavens to Betsy, mamma IIIIIIIII's white"". Cars stopped to let him cross the street, and not just so they could honk when he was right in front of them. Sophisticated folks tipped their fancy hats and said ""howdy"". Nobody yelled insults from passing cars or spit in his face. And the old man at the soda shop offered him a free ice cream sunday! By the time Tyrone got home, he was delirious with joy and boldly singing ""I's white! I's White! All you motherfuckers suck it. I's white"".

Tyrone's sister was outside the house and the first to see him. ""oooh boy, you done it now. Don't you know you's black and black's beautiful? If you don't wash yourself up quick, you're in for an ass-whoopin. I gotta see this!""

Tyrone's jubilation was a little tempered from this, but his sister was a bitch and he wasn't about to let it ruin his day. He walked into the house singing a little softer ""I's white. I's white. Life is sweet as peaches now cuz I's white"". 

His mamma caught a glimpse of him through the kitchen door. ""Boy, what you gone done paint yo'sef up white for? You's black and black is beautiful. You better wash y'sef up before your papa comes home and whoops some sense into you.""

Tyrone's sister snickered as Tyrone hung his head a little lower and headed into the living room still singing softly: ""I's white! I's White. nothin you can do 'bout it, I's white"".  

Then his brother saw him. ""Boy you look a damn fool all covered up in white paint. You's black and black is beautiful. You in for a beatin' if you don't wash up before Papa sees!""

Tyrone was feeling pretty bad at this point and kinda mumble-singing ""I's white. I's White. you fuckers gon' get it now cuz I's White"" as he headed toward the stairs. Just then, his father walked in the front door.

""Tyrone!! What you gone done paint yourself up white for?! huh?!! You's black and black is beautiful. You have till I get my belt off to wash up and then you still in for a beatin!""

Tyrone ran to the top of the stairs, tears streaming down his face, and turned around to see his mamma, arms akimbo and stone-faced; his papa, pulling his belt from his pants; his brother, arms crossed and head down, but with a disapproving sidelong glance; and his sister, doing everything she can to keep from laughing. Fury welling up inside of him, Tyrone screamed down at them ""I ain't been white but six hours and I already hate you n****s."

Antwoorden op Kamervragen van het Kamerlid Hijink &amp;#40;SP&amp;#41; over  het bericht dat zorgverzekeraars voor miljoenen euro's beleggen in farmaceutische bedrijven.  
&amp;nbsp;    
&amp;#40;2018Z06388&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het bericht ""Wie beleggen in de farmaceutische industrie en waarom? Dit zijn de reacties van zorgverzekeraars en fondsen"", over zorgverzekeraars die miljoenen euro’s beleggen in farmaceutische bedrijven? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u het ermee eens dat door het verplicht aanhouden van hoge buffers, zorgverzekeraars worden gedwongen om een deel van hun vermogen te beleggen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zorgverzekeraars dienen eigen vermogen aan te houden om onverwacht hoge betalingen van zorgkosten op te kunnen vangen. De premie wordt aan het begin van de verzekerde periode betaald, daarna volgen de zorgkostenuitgaven pas, waardoor er ruimte is om te beleggen. Zorgverzekeraars worden niet gedwongen om te beleggen met deze ruimte, maar kunnen dat wel doen. Het rendement dat daarop gemaakt &amp;#40;kan&amp;#41; worden, kan premiedrukkend kan werken. Het beleggingsbeleid van zorgverzekeraars is aan henzelf. DNB houdt toezicht op het kapitaalbeleid van zorgverzekeraars. Spreiding van het belegd vermogen is onderdeel van het een gezond beleggingsbeleid.   
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het feit dat zorgverzekeraars in 2016 15 miljard euro hebben belegd, aantoont dat de buffers die zij moeten aanhouden veel te hoog zijn?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee, deze mening deel ik niet. De normen voor de buffers van zorgverzekeraars zijn er niet voor niets. Deze eisen zijn van belang voor de financiële stabiliteit van de zorgverzekeraars, voorkomen premieschommelingen en is in het belang van de verzekerden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Is u bekend hoeveel rendement van de beleggingen van zorgverzekeraars de afgelopen vijf jaar is ingezet voor premieverlaging? Zo nee, bent u bereid dit te onderzoeken?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoeveel rendement van de beleggingen precies is ingezet door de zorgverzekeraars is moeilijk te zeggen. Het rendement van de beleggingen is namelijk onderdeel van het totale resultaat van de zorgverzekeraars. Van het totale resultaat en de reserves is de afgelopen 5 jaar ruim 6 miljard door zorgverzekeraars ingezet voor premieverlaging.   
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening van VGZ dat aandelen in de farmaceutische industrie op geen enkele manier passen bij de doelstelling van de zorgverzekeraar, te weten de zorg betaalbaar houden en voor iedereen bereikbaar?  
&amp;nbsp;    
VGZ heeft er recent voor gekozen niet meer te beleggen in Gilead Sciences en Biogen. Zij sluiten niet de volledige farmaceutische industrie uit. Het beleggingsbeleid van zorgverzekeraars is aan henzelf. Zorgverzekeraars binden zich aan de code voor duurzaam beleggen van het verbond van Verzekeraars. Er wordt belegd in maatschappelijk verantwoorde &amp;#40;ESG&amp;#41; fondsen. Dit zijn fondsen waarbij er sprake is van een duurzaam beleggingsbeleid. Voor deze beleggingen geldt een uitsluitingbeleid voor bedrijven die betrokken zijn bij bijvoorbeeld de tabaksindustrie, wapenhandel en schendingen van mensenrechten. De farmaceutische industrie wordt niet op voorhand uitgesloten. Zij vervullen immers een belangrijke functie in de ontwikkeling van nieuwe geneesmiddelen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Veel verzekeraars hebben richting VWS aangegeven ook op enige wijze, zij het zelf, of via een vermogensbeheerder, invloed uit te oefenen op het maatschappelijk verantwoorde beleid van de organisaties waarin zij beleggen, de zogeheten  “engagement programma’s”. Eén van die programma’s focust ook op het bevorderen van verantwoorde prijsstelling in de farmaceutische industrie. Hierbij geldt dat de omvang van de investeringen relatief beperkt zijn. De zorgverzekeraars geven aan dat wanneer er sprake is van overtredingen van de onderliggende principes van de ESG fondsen hierover de dialoog aangegaan. Als dit geen resultaat oplevert vindt uitsluiting plaats van de betreffende bedrijven. Dat gebeurt ook regelmatig. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn het niet langer beleggen in Biogen en Gilead Sciences door VGZ en Valeant Pharmaceuticals en Novartis door Menzis. In dat geval kan er ook geen invloed meer uitgeoefend worden, bijvoorbeeld via de “engagement programma’s”.   
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Heeft de premiebetaler invloed op de beleggingsportefeuille van zorgverzekeraars?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Verzekerden kunnen op diverse wijzen invloed uitoefenen op het beleid van hun zorgverzekeraar, onder meer via de leden- en verzekerdenraden. Indien daaraan intern behoefte zou zijn, zou de zorgverzekeraar de &amp;#40;voorgenomen&amp;#41; beleggingsportefeuille kunnen voorleggen aan de leden- of verzekerdenraad om haar mening hierover te horen. De Raad van Bestuur neemt uiteraard de beleidsbeslissing hierover en is hiervoor ook verantwoordelijk.   
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
&amp;nbsp;    
Acht u het wenselijk dat zorgverzekeraars door hun investeringen in de ‘lucratieve’ farmaceutische industrie een bijdrage leveren aan de hoge medicijnprijzen, terwijl hun taak is om de zorgkosten in toom te houden? Kunt u dit toelichten? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
12  
&amp;nbsp;    
Acht u het waarschijnlijk dat, zoals Menzis stelt, zorgverzekeraars die in farmaceutische bedrijven investeren, invloed kunnen uitoefenen op de prijzen van deze medicijnen? Als deze analyse van Menzis zou kloppen, waarom zijn de prijzen van sommige geneesmiddelen - zelfs met de aandeelhoudersmacht van Menzis - nog altijd extreem hoog? Is het ook niet zo dat een daling van de prijs van geneesmiddelen negatief kan uitpakken voor het beleggingsresultaat van Menzis?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik vrees niet voor een pervers effect. Zorgverzekeraars beleggen een klein deel van het belegd vermogen, namelijk maximaal 1%, in farmaceutische bedrijven die bovendien vaak mondiaal opereren. De Nederlandse zorgverzekeraars beleggen minder dan 0,1% van hun belegd vermogen in de genoemde farmaceuten: Biogen, Gilead Sciences en Vertex.  Voor de meeste zorgverzekeraars geldt daarbij dat dit gebeurt door middel van beleggingen in fondsen, die een duurzaam karakter hebben en een uitsluitingbeleid voor bedrijven die betrokken zijn bij de tabaksindustrie, wapenhandel, schendingen van mensenrechten, inzet van kinderarbeid, fraude of corruptie en milieuvervuiling.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Er vindt, zo laten verzekeraars mij weten, voordurend screening plaats op deze principes, zodat bedrijven die de regels overtreden hierop kunnen worden aangesproken en als dat geen effect heeft, worden verwijderd uit de portefeuilles. Bovendien geven zorgverzekeraars aan het gesprek aan te gaan met bedrijven die zich niet houden aan de principes, of de principes die zorgverzekeraars belangrijk vinden. Als dit geen resultaat oplevert vindt uitsluiting plaats van de betreffende bedrijven. Dat gebeurt ook regelmatig. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn het niet langer beleggen in Biogen en Gilead Sciences door VGZ en Valeant Pharmaceuticals en Novartis door Menzis.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Er kan, wanneer er niet meer belegd wordt in de betreffende bedrijven, echter geen invloed meer uitgeoefend worden via de “engagement programma’s”  Dat verzekeraars hun aandeel in de farmaceutische industrie aanwenden om de discussie over de hoogte van de prijzen aan te jagen, vind ik positief. Ze hebben daar ook zelf belang bij.    
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Op welke wijze passen de investeringen van zorgverzekeraars in de farmaceutische industrie binnen uw agenda om iets te doen aan de hoge medicijnprijzen? Hebben zorgverzekeraars überhaupt een rol bij de ontwikkeling van nieuwe medicijnen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het beleggingsbeleid van zorgverzekeraars is aan henzelf. Naast de invloed die zij proberen uit te oefenen via de beleggingen, hebben verzekeraars naar mijn mening zeker een rol in het stimuleren van de ontwikkeling van nieuwe medicijnen die belangrijk zijn voor patiënten. Door het beschikbaar stellen van kapitaal dragen ze hieraan bij.   
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat wordt de inzet van uw gesprek met zorgverzekeraars over hoe zij hun rol benutten als aandeelhouder om te pleiten voor maatschappelijk verantwoorde prijzen? Bent u bereid om zorgverzekeraars te dwingen de omstreden beleggingen in de farmaceutische industrie te stoppen? 2&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
VWS heeft de zorgverzekeraars gevraagd of zij beleggen in de farmaceutische industrie en wat daarbij hun overwegingen zijn. De meeste zorgverzekeraars geven aan te beleggen in de farmaceutische industrie, omdat het een belangrijke industrie is, met name voor de nieuwe, innovatieve zorg. Bovendien maken veel farmaceutische bedrijven deel uit van de maatschappelijk verantwoorde &amp;#40;ESG&amp;#41; fondsen. Ik zal de zorgverzekeraars niet dwingen te stoppen met beleggingen in de farmaceutische industrie. Uiteraard vind ik het wel belangrijk dat zorgverzekeraars scherp zijn op hun eigen beleggingsbeleid en zoals een aantal zorgverzekeraars ook doen, het gesprek aangaan met omstreden farmaceuten wanneer zij dat noodzakelijk vinden.    
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wanneer kan de Kamer een terugkoppeling verwachten van uw gesprek met de zorgverzekeraars?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In deze beantwoording treft u de terugkoppeling van de reactie van zorgverzekeraars op mijn vragen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u het met de heer Marc Pomp eens dat door het afhaken van een deel van de beleggers, de kosten van kapitaal voor farmaceutische industrie omhooggaan en zullen resulteren in hogere prijzen? Zou het niet eerder zo zijn dat het weglopen van beleggers als statement kan worden opgevat dat megawinsten op geneesmiddelen maatschappelijk ongewenst zijn? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
De financieringsmix is voor ieder bedrijf van belang, zo dient er een goede balans te zijn tussen eigen en vreemd vermogen. Dat geld ook voor de farmaceutische industrie. Door te investeren in deze industrie kunnen de zorgverzekeraars ook invloed oefenen. De invloed die de Nederlandse zorgverzekeraars hebben, zowel door de “engagement programma’s” als door het uitsluiten van deze bedrijven in de beleggingsportefeuille moeten we echter niet overschatten, gegeven de omvang van de relatieve omvang van de investering.

8ekjwy,1,2018-04-24,the family business,rainerstride,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8ekjwy/the_family_business/,"been working at my mom's shop for the past 5 years since it opened. the money is nice and all, but i do not want to spend the rest of my life working there. i have bigger plans for myself.

at first i thought it would be a simple transition. i finish college, do my internships, get my certs, then move on.

unfortunately its not going to be this simple. my mom got into a heated argument one night with her co-owner and the co-owner ended up leaving the business. its been 6 months since then. as the sole owner, she's been carrying this pressure herself since then. 

this former co-owner has been working with her for over 10 years, even before she opened her own business, so the loss was felt, but she still carried on. later on it turned out this person wasn't really living up to the expectations a co-owner should conduct themselves in.

slowly the pressure has been creeping on me. while it is true that i know what everyday life is like in the business, i just don't want to do it. it feels like she wants me to take it over one day. 

im not really a remarkable person. i never enjoyed face-to-face interaction with customers to begin with after seeing all the retail horror stories, and i can't go out of my way to see the good qualities in other people, only their bad ones. i would much rather just stay in the backline and work from the shadows. yes, this is a retail business, and yes im fully aware of the consequences of my personality. 

i dont know why i allowed it to show on my face, but the years of working in a job i dislike so much must have finally taken its toll on me. yesterday i think my mom noticed the way i conducted myself yesterday and just said ""you dont have to work anymore if you don't want to. i can do it myself.""

what have i done? am i selfish for doing this? i realized that i gave up a job due to my unwillingness to adapt to my environment..

what if i did end up taking over the business? i don't even know.. what happens if something horrible happens to my mom? how am i going to deal with that?

edit 6/3: for anyone whose still following this - the situation has improved. confronting her about it first was really awkward for me because like i mentioned earlier, i realized that my unwillingness to adapt to new situations may have caused unnecessary damage with my relationship to my mom.

we were able to come to an understanding. thanks guys."

I don't really mind if you even want to play futa just be predominantly feminine. I am open to any other creative changes you may want to pitch to me.

The overall theme I am looking for is Dom/Sub with an emphasis of general control resulting in praise and maybe perks within the office. I prefer my new interns or employees to be somewhat innocent, but not ""oh, I've never done that before"" responses if that helps. It could revolve around a coercion or even forced moment or it can be a slower, control based power move or even bimbofication if thats what you are looking for.

I will play the CEO with the big office down the hallway on top floor. Mid 30's, shapely and toned, brunette, perky breasts and always in extravagant lingerie underneath my business attire.

My idea would be that you become my pet, my sex toy. I control you actions, make you service people or myself at will. It can get dark and rough if the mood goes that direction. I love breast play, nipple play, light pain, whips, spanking, toys (large and small), control, oral, anal, group play, public tasks, etc

Please message me with your desired character age, description, and kinks/limits with any additional twists you want to add, please. Hope to hear from someone soon!"

I'm an undergrad and managed to land an internship in downtown Boston for the summer (right in the financial district). I've been looking at some housing options and basically have come to the point where I have to choose between trying to live in Somerville, JP, or Allston.

At this point, here's my understanding for each neighborhood (which could be super wrong since I'm not from the area):

Somerville: Seems to be the furthest away, most annoying commute, and a the most ""suburb-y"" feel to it. However, it's cheap and seems the safest and the housing seems the biggest.

JP: Seems to be about the same distance from downtown as Somerville, but with an easier commute thanks to the orange line (which I have heard is the best). I've heard that JP has a good vibe for young professionals and is a great place to live on it's own, but I'm still concerned that it seems a bit far away (and I've also heard it's the most dangerous but I've really never been to the area so I can't really comment too much on that first-hand).

Allston: This seems like the best commute option since it's right on the green line, plus seems the closest to everything in general. Biggest concern with this place is that I've heard the entire thing is kind of just a student-housing town for BU. I am an undergrad, but I'm really not interested in the ""stereotypical"" college living situation of bad housing and loud students and house parties.

Sorry for the wall of text! Just trying to narrow down where I want to live for the summer.

Tl;dr: I am an undergrad (young 20's) living in Boston for the summer with an internship downtown, looking for opinions on which neighborhood would be the best (Somerville, JP, Allston)."

8emxy0,77,2018-04-24,Why I stopped faking extraversion,Skandov,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/8emxy0/why_i_stopped_faking_extraversion/,"First of all, I'm an INTJ, I thrive in my own space and I feel extremely sharp when I can be in that space with no distractions, whether I create those distractions myself or they are created by external factors. Now, You might think that those are very obvious for an INTJ, but let me tell you something that I don't think many introverts realise \- Faking extraversion and outgoing is not good for you or the people you associate yourself with, no matter if it's family, friends or work.

Let me explain why this is, with a story:

First day at a new job \- I wake up at 6am in the morning, which is already extremely hard for me, because my body works better between 10am and 2am \(yes, from 10am to 2am at night\), this change is enough to throw you off in terms of mentality and energy, when you're about to have your first day at a new job and on top of that, you want it to go well and you want yourself to be energized so you can perform your tasks well, which just adds a shit ton of expectations and pressure on you.

Anyways, the first day I got to work, I went there early so I could get a tour and meet my new co workers, before we had to start the day. Some of my co workers I knew and 3 I hadn't meet before \- So we get the information needed to start doing our tasks and obviously me being introverted, immidiately starts picking up on everything, from how my co workers are, what tasks I'm being handed and how I should handle them and probaly most obvious of all: Making sure I can execute my tasks with my team and still manage to have good communication with them. This thought process in it self is where most introverts go wrong, and here's why:

By committing to trying to ""fit in"" was a great mistake of mine, I would be very talktive, laugh and anxious about doing things wrong and most of the time I actually ended up doing things wrong because I was too concerned about adapting to my enviroment. My co workers would start laughing at me or make fun of me if I did something unusual or seemed worried about things / not thinking clearly.

I would ask myself ""Why do I get humiliated by my co workers, like they're having some kind of a intern banter going on and I'm the victim?..."". On our way to lunch, I realised ""I am making myself look like a fool, because I am in fact NOT myself..."". After that realization, I choose immediately to throw my mask away and start being who I am at home and use my smarts to solve my tasks, analyse everything I do, my enviroment, my co workers, myself and find my confidence in how I think, act and speak, ESPECIALLY how I speak, because I was trying to be a little bubbly or fishy for conversation before, and like I said above, if you look worried, you will become a victim for humiliation, because you're what we today call an ""easy target"" and when you're outgoing in a fake way, it comes of as very forced and people can pick up on that very easily, especially if they're also somewhat introverted. Some people are not as stupid as they look, but most are. :\)

So if you're an introvert, it doesn't matter if your personality type is INTJ, INTP,INFJ what ever \- Do yourself a favour and take off your mask. Start using that smart brain of yours, you ruin your chances of getting respect, a clear mind and self confidence, and most important of all: A good time while socializing \- You're basically putting yourself on overdrive. Start believing in yourself and your abilities and use your great intuition/thinking and you'll have a lot more energy throughout the day and also start getting the respect you reserve, because *you're your own person* and people pick up on that straight away too. Since I took of my mask, my co workers started treating me respectfully different, because I started thinking clearly in anything I did, because I was not wasting my energy on trying to be somebody that I'm not and I would also fire back and any person trying to manipulate me or make me a target.

Stop limiting yourself, embrace your introversion and use it as a tool, but don't go out and be a douchebag to your co workers and costumers because that's not authenticity. Give your costumers a little more line in terms of putting on a mask, because you have to stay professional and not look like a person who is not interested in any human interaction at all, which by the way is just another one of those stupid introvert stereotypes.

If you can relate to all this, try it and let me know how to works out for you. Self awareness and willpower gets you far."

(Michigan State, UMass, or Penn State)",CollegeCompThrowaway,msu,https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/8en2b0/which_college_amongst_these_should_i_choose_for/,"Hey, Guys, I am an international going to major in CS (Fall'18), So I have shortened my list to Michigan State, UMass, and Penn State. I am sure that the CS program is top notch for all, but I was wondering if you all current students can give me an insight on which college should I choose amongst them/ why is Michigan state better than the other two. Actually, Penn State is going to cost me around 10k/year more than the other two. Is it really worth it to pay that much more each year? What's the difference in college life and other stuff including internships and work opportunities? Michigan State is ranked overall better than UMass, does that matter in any way?

My work hours are a bit crazy so I would only be home to sleep essentially. My budget is $1.4k, but I'm hoping to find something around $1.2k - looking at Manhattan (LES or East Village preferred) and Brooklyn (near Barclays Center preferred). I will consider anything in my price range though!!!

As for myself - I'm 22(F), I don't have allergies, I consider myself pretty clean, and I don't mind if you're messy. LGBTQA ally and 420 friendly, but not really a smoker. I like to go out on the weekends, and I have a boyfriend that may visit once or twice a month. I also really enjoy cooking so having a kitchen would be a plus but not super important. Honestly, I'm just trying to find somewhere super chill that I can come home to."
8endjt,164,2018-04-24,The Anchorman,WorldlyMirror,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8endjt/the_anchorman/,"This happened several summers ago. I was a fairly naïve college sophomore majoring in Journalism at Syracuse University, and had snagged a summer internship at the News Bureau at the local NBC affiliate back home. I’m not going to mention the city, or use the real names of the on-air personalities. Hope you enjoy!

It was my first day, a sunny warm mid-May day, and I was totally psyched. I didn’t care I wasn’t getting paid. I arrived early, and was waiting for the personnel manager. The evening “News Team” generally arrived at 11:00AM and stayed until 8:00PM. The personnel manager got my paperwork setup, advised me of the “rules and regulations”, handed me an employee manual, and told me to read and sign the manual. Usual shit; no smoking, alcohol, harassment policies, blah blah blah. It did stress the zero tolerance for sexual harassment, and the equal rights of the LGBT community to my relief. I signed the manual and returned it to the manager. She asked me if I had any questions, and I made a quick reference to the LGBT rights. At first it didn’t seem to connect, but then she smiled and said I had nothing to worry about. 

I met the evening “news team” at the 11:00 morning meeting. I couldn’t believe how many people were involved in the production. The “team” consisted of “Maria” the weather-person, “Scott” the sports personality, “Andrea” co-anchor, and “Chip” the lead anchor. Maria, was the sex appeal; big tits, small waist, pleasant face. I’m sure plenty of fat Dad’s in “audience world” were thinking of Maria’s tits and body when they were hammering the old lady. Scott was the typical macho ex-jock sports fanatic. Andrea was probably pushing 45, and looked completely different on person than on air. Whoever did her makeup was fucking good. Chip was the star. He had been at the station about 2 years, and catapulted them from 3rd place to 1st place in the ratings. He was funny, charming, easy going, and handsome as fuck. I’m sure the “old lady” getting hammered while her hubby thought about Maria, was having the same thoughts about Chip. The meeting was interesting. They discussed the proposed story lineup, allocated the time for each story to the second, even discussed what “ad lib” banter they would have between stories. I’d always thought that was just casual conversation, but it was all planned and scripted out.

I spent most the afternoon shadowing the producer. I met the camera people, makeup, gaffers, best boy, associates, writers, and then the “talent”. Maria was a “ditz” who just giggled at everything I said or asked. Scott seemed to be distant after I told him I didn’t really follow sports. It was as if he had nothing else in his life to talk about. Andrea was interesting. The pleasant smile and lilting laugh from on-air, were not present. She seems to be a bitter nasty person with a scowling face. Was happy when that ended. Chip was just the opposite. He appeared as friendly and funny as on-air. He insisted I call him “Chip”; “Mr. Collester” was his Dad. 

The schedule was 3:45 taping of teasers for insert during afternoon programming, 4:00 wardrobe, 4:30 full rehearsal, 5:00 makeup, 5:20 final rehearsal, 6:00 live. After the teaser shots, “Nancy” the producer told me to go with Chip and help him with wardrobe. 

Chip’s office was impressive. Huge mahogany desk, 3 large flat-screens mounted on the wall; the noon news from out station, and the 2 competitors was looping on the screens. A deep plush sofa with coordinating chairs, a large coffee table, and pewter lamps finished off the space. I must have been gawking, because he laughed and apologized. “Wasn’t my doing. Previous anchor had an ego problem”, he said with a light slap on my back. He closed and locked his door, and pulled off his crisp Polo shirt. My knees slightly buckled at the sight of his well-toned, bronze smooth torso. He started to unbuckle his khakis, when he nodded to the closet on the opposite wall. “Grab today’s outfit for me if you don’t mind.”

There was a single Navy Blue suit, crisp button down blue wide check shirt, and a bright red and blue broad striped tie. I gathered them up and turned to Chip. His back was to me as he stared in the mirror running an electric shaver over his face. His ass was resplendent, The tight stretch white fabric perfectly outlined his two cheeks. His muscled back tapered from wide broad shoulders to a small narrow waist. His eyes caught mine, and I’m sure he saw me staring at his perfect ass, but he flashed that million dollar smile, and thanked me while telling me to lay them on the sofa. 

It took all my willpower to look away and out the window when he turned and walked to the sofa. I really wanted to see his equipment in the tight pouch of boxer briefs; God knew I had enough for a zesty jerkoff session later that night. He kept up the non-stop banter as he dressed; telling me about how his clothes are picked by an associate producer with the sponsored men’s store, how they can’t use stripes or checks below a certain size, or they pixilated on screen. When I finally turned, he was finishing with his tie. He looked terrific. 

As we walked to rehearsal, he asked me if I had any dinner plans, then asked me if I wanted to join him around the corner. I was stunned, and could just nod. He winked, tapped my back and leaned in. “I’ll catch you up on all the “office drama”, he then turned and walked away.

Telecast went fine, and after the wrap meeting, I went back with Chip to his office and he changed back into his khaki’s. The steak house was opulent, and I was relieved when I saw they had fish. I don’t eat meat. Chip ordered a beer, and started telling me about the office. Maria was fucking both Scott, and the station manager. Andrea was also fucking the station manager in a feeble attempt to hold on to her job. Nancy (the producer) was a wonderful person, who got hosed last year by her now ex-husband. He leaned in. “Scott’s not the macho jock he seems to be. Per Maria, he likes to be tied up and humiliated, and has a penchant for wearing black lace panties. To each his own, I guess.” 

After dinner, he ordered coffee. He turned to me in the booth, and said casually, “So Laura (personnel manager) tells me you are gay”. I know I turned crimson. I was out and all, but never really felt comfortable discussing my sexuality with others. “Shouldn’t be a problem, just don’t let John (station manager). Hypocritical fuck has no problem fucking every woman in the office while sitting in church with his wife and kids and bashing the sins of homosexuality”. He then told me the associate producer and gaffer were gay, and a couple. 

He asked me if I had a boyfriend, and I shyly told him, no and never really had one. I got the light pat on the back, and an assurance I was a good-looking guy and the right guy would come into my life.  He signed the bill to the station; “in my contract” he noted with that patented wink. We walked back to the station, and I gawked at his Porsche 911 Targa in his reserved spot. He gave me another shoulder slap, and said I was welcome to drive it anytime I wanted. 

Just as I said my goodbyes, and turned to walk to my car, he asked me to wait. “Jayson, I want to tell you something in confidence. I’m gay. Only Nancy (the producer) and my agent know. It’s not that I’m hiding, just reality. We’re in the “Bible Belt”; not New York, Seattle or San Francisco.  I just wanted to let you know. I remember how hard high school and college were for me.” I was floored, just nodded and returned to my car.

My fantasy that night was awesome. Chip was in his boxer briefs, I was sitting on the sofa. He turned to me, and said he usually “relieved” himself of stress before the news, and squeezed his cock. I moved forward on the couch, and without a word, began to kiss and lick his hot abs, as I peeled his underwear down to mid-thigh.  I blew a huge load all over my chest.

The rest of the week was uneventful; other than the daily eye candy at 4:00. I’d checked out his bulge, and it was rather impressive. Depending on the underwear, I could make out the ridge of his fat cock head. Information I used in my nightly jerks. On Friday, he caught going out the door, and asked me to dinner again. 

I learned he dated women for the many charity dinners he had to attend. Never more than few times, but would break it off as soon as it became sexual. “Gotta fuck them at least once, for appearance sake.” His real fun happened once a month when he’d visit his gay friends from college in New York. There, no one recognized him, and he could get the sex he didn’t get back home. I kind of felt sorry for him. 

When the waiter left with the check, I felt his hand squeeze my lower thigh. “Want to come back to my place?” he said quietly. My dick immediately swelled. I looked around, and we were alone. I pulled his hand over my hard throbbing cock. “What do you think?” I asked as he broke into a broad smile. “Want coffee and let that go back to sleep, or want to leave now?” I really didn’t give a fuck if people saw I was hard, and just stood and walked quickly to the parking lot. 

As I drove behind his Porsche, I kept pinching myself to make sure this wasn’t a dream. His place was a tri-level condo in tastefully done contemporary décor. He offered me a beer, which I eagerly accepted. He drank about half his beer, then leaned over and gently put his forefinger under my chin and turned my head toward him. He told me how hot I looked as he moved his lips towards mine. His other hand wrapped around my waist, and he pulled me into him as our lips touched. 

He began to slowly unbutton my shirt as our tongues danced.  I shivered when his hand caressed my chest, his thumb lightly encircling my sensitive nipples. I unbuttoned his shirt, and explored his manly chest, tracing his abs and pecs, and toying with his wide hard nipples. His hand moved to my thigh, and he slowly stroked the inside; stopping tortuously close to my throbbing cock. He pulled back just as he finally touched me, and lightly rubbed my shaft through my pants. “Let’s go upstairs” he said in that deep sexy TV voice. I followed him up the stairs as he unbuttoned his sleeves, and removed his shirt. God I wanted to hold that back, run my hands over it and down to his tight ass, push his ass, and beg him to fuck me harder. 

I saw his ass first. Two beautiful white full globes with just a trace of light hairs. A man ass, not a small teen ass. The he turned and exposed himself to me. He had a pretty cock. Not huge, but perfectly proportioned with a slight upturn, a nice fat cock head with a prominent flaring ridge. His nuts were large, shaven, and tight. I dropped to me knees and took him right there at the side of the bed. 

God, his cock tasted great, and smelled great. He gently ran his hand through my hair as I gobbled his cock with gusto. He told me how good it felt, and how talented I was. I grabbed those two perfect cheeks and squeezed them, and pulled his cock into my mouth. How began to slowly face-fuck me feeding me that cock, as his balls nuzzled my chin.  The faint saltiness of pre-cum crossed my tongue, and I greedily swallowed it. 

He slipped his hands under my pits and drew me into his chest. “Gotta stop; you’re getting me close”. He laid me on his bed, and nuzzled my neck, and licked and kissed down my chest to my aching cock. He worked my cock and nuts like a pro, then pushed my legs back and nibbles and licked my taint. I shivered from not only the sensation, but the anticipation of his tongue working my hole. 

I felt my cheeks spread, and his tongue slid down my crack. The sensation of it gliding around my ring, and then into my hole was at hot as the thought he was preparing me for his cock. I moaned and writhed in pleasure. His hand fumbled with the nightstand drawer, and still buried into my crack, he pulled the tube of lube out.

His mouth was quickly replaced by a lubed finger probing for my prostate. His fingers pressed and probed my prostate And I was moaning incoherently, and pressing down into the mattress to try and get more pressure. He seemed to not be in any hurry. I realized how much better it felt with a long teasing foreplay. Every other time, it seemed to be a rush to get to fucking. Chip was different. 

I stroked his steel-hard fleshy cock as he assaulted my ass. Finally, I pleaded with him to fuck me. He pulled a condom from the night stand, and told me to suit him up. After he lubed up, he flipped me over, and pressed my shoulders into the mattress. I was disappointed. In my fantasies he’d always fucked me on my back, so I could see him, and maul his back and ass while he fucked me. I reached back and pulled my cheeks apart for him, and I felt his wet cock head press against my willing hole. His hands went to my waist, and he told me to back into it. I’d never down that before, I’d always been penetrated by the top. 

I liked pressing into his hard cock, and feeling it expand my ring. It popped in with ease after the long finger fuck, and I kept backing into it, until I felt his nuts press into my cheeks.  

I just stayed there for a good 30 seconds, drinking up everything that was happening to me. His cock felt like it had been custom made for my ass. His hand moved down to my throbbing dick, and gave it a slight squeeze. “Ready, Jayson?” his deep melodic voice whispered into my ear. I’d never been more ready to be fucked in my life. I pulled away from him, then plunged it back in quickly. His hands returned to my waist, and he controlled my tempo by pulling and pushing my waist. His thighs were slapping into my ass, as he picked up the pace. He stopped buried deep in me, and pulled me up, my back pressed into his smooth chiseled chest. He turned my head and kissed me gruffly, while pulling on my sensitive hard nipples. “Good?” 

“Unfuckingbelievable” was all I could say. “Finish me on my back?” I pleaded. He withdrew, and I felt that empty vacant feeling of a stretched and ready hole being vacated, I could feel it gape and tighten as he flipped my onto my back, and hoisted my ankles over. He slid back in easily into my well loosened ass. His steel blue eyes locked into mine, and I melted. He was the hottest guy I’d ever been fucked by, and by a mile. His chest began to glisten with a sheen of sweat as he continued his onslaught.  I’d never been fucked that long, and that hard in my life. Usually 5 to 10 minutes, but he’s been pounding me a good 20 minutes straight, with no sign of it ending soon. My ass was almost numb from the fucking.

I pulled his warm wet chest down against mine, and wrapped my legs around his waist and locked my ankles. “ I wanna see your face as you cum inside me, Chip. Let it go.” He kissed me roughly, and began to pound harder than ever. His slick hard abs were rubbing against my pre-cummed cock, and I knew I was close. I told he was making me cum in a loud gasp, and I felt the wave of pleasure spread through my whole body. I spasmed and rocked into him as cum flew between us. He had stopped fucking me and was staring at me as I convulsed. When thepleasure ebbed, I sunk back into the mattress overwhelmed by my orgasm. He raise up, pushed my knees into my chest, pounded me for about 10 seconds then froze deep inside me. 

I could feel his cock twitch with each volley filing his reservoir. His square jaw was thrust forward, and he growled as a flush spread across his upper chest and cheeks. He collapsed back onto me in a heavy breath. He gave my ass a few short thrusts, as if to milk the last drops from his balls into the condom. 

He rolled off me, and gingerly removed his condom. He then pulled me onto his chest, and cuddled. He asked if I could stay the night, as he traced his finger through the cum on my chest. I could feel my hole gaping at his absence. “That’s the best fuck I’ve ever had”, I said in amazement. He chuckled, and said he hoped that meant he was welcome back. I didn’t say it, but he was going to own my ass all summer. He tapped my stomach, and said “Let’s clean up in the shower together. 

As he soaped my chest from behind, I felt my cock begin to stir. By the time his soapy hand was there, I was fully hard. “Ahh, the joys of youth” he melodically whispered in my ear, as he slid his slippery hand across it and teased my hard nipples.  I leaned back into his chest, and felt his cock press into my crack. As much as I wanted it, I didn’t think my ass could take another beating. Given his stamina the first time, I imagined I’d be hamburger back there if he fucked me a second time.  He kissed my neck, and asked me if I wanted to finish back in bed.

He started sucking me again with abandon. I tried to get him in my mouth, and he pulled off and smiled. “I’m done for the night. Just lay back and enjoy.” Fuck it felt great. He’d suck and lick until I got close, then pull off, kiss and lick my inner thighs and nuts, then go back in. After a good half hour, I begged him to finish me off. I’m good sized, 6” or so, but he had no problem taking all of it. I told him I was cumming, and he didn’t hesitate, just kept on sucking me until I shot into his warm mouth. 

As I laid in his arms, I told him I was going to give him “stress relief” the next Monday as he dressed. He said he was looking forward to that. Monday, I kept my word, and had my first bellyful of delicious Chip juice. As I sat through rehearsal, I looked at Maria, and imagined her tying up macho Scott his erection evident in his black lace panties. Then I glanced at the asshole GM, and imagined him fucking Maria bent over his desk, and Andrea spreading her legs for him as well. The best thought though, was taking Chip’s load and watching his face as he came. It made me hard to just think about his cum in my stomach.

And so it went all summer long. Chip would fuck me 2 or 3 times a week, and I’d suck him off almost every afternoon. Maria got knocked up by one of them, and had an abortion. Andrea did not get her contract renewed, despite giving her pussy and mouth to the asshole. She was gone by August. I was invited back for an internship the next year, with the promise from Nancy I’d be in lead contention for a job once I graduated. I was thrilled. One more summer with Chip.

I’d stopped by the studio on my way out of town, and Chip said he had something for me. Heard the office door lock click behind me, and my cock went instantly hard. He fucked me good bent over his leather sofa arm, and I spewed twice on the couch. After he came, he pulled my back tight into his chest, and kissed me tenderly. He told me to have a great year, and not get taken by some hot college guy. I squeezed his softening cock with my ass, and told him not to worry. He reached over and handed me a new I-phone. Bought this for you, but only if you promise to call me. 

I drove away to return to Syracuse, and saw the new billboard by the entrance ramp. Chip, Maria, Scott, and the new co-anchor smiling broadly. I wondered if 
Scott was wearing panties or not. I stared into Chip’s smiling face, and felt my freshly fucked ass twitch. I couldn’t wait for next summer.

Sadly, Chip’s contract expired, and he got snapped up immediately in an A market, a thousand miles away. My second summer wasn’t nearly as good.

I encouraged her to go through with this, but now her parents are guilting her into returning it. 

She has savings and paid for it from that. She is in the final months of her doctorate of pharmacy degree. Her parents paid for her school and she saved very well from high school jobs and internships. She has no dept and more than 15k savings. She will be starting to work as an on call pharmacist in a couple months.

Her laptop that lasted her whole education died. She says she doesnt want a laptop but a desktop and wants a nice big screen and intends to learn and practice photo processing after school. Anyway, an iMac seems to me like a good match for her use case and financial situation.

Is this financially irresponsible? 

Her parents think that dropping an extra 1k on a computer to support a fledgling hobby is stupid. I think she has earned it and she clearly chooses her luxuries wisely, otherwise she wouldnt have savings."

I am a 20 year old, college student and in late January, I began to notice blood in my stool. I didn't think it was normal but I waited it out a bit to see if it would stop, which it didn't. Around mid March I started noticing that there was blood even on my toilet paper, so I decided to make an appointment with a GI since my mom has Crohn's Disease. 

I had a colonoscopy this past Friday and my doctor said I had mild colitis, though I am still waiting on biopsy results. He also mentioned that it was ""healing on its own"", though I am not sure what that means. As of now, my only symptoms are blood in my stools (my stools are normal in appearance, no diarrhea) and occasional cramping. I have seen my mom flare up and do not think I am going through that. My blood results also came back normal, no anemia or anything of that sort. My weight has also been average. 

I have an internship in NYC this summer and was wondering how long it might take for a diagnosis. There's a chance this might not even be an IBD but I am expecting the worst. I am very new to this so I don't know what to expect or how long this process might take, I also blame my doctor's office for being a bit slow with all of this. 

Thanks,

I wonder why Shondaland hasn't been able to keep her characters until the finale?

Ensemble casts such as Sex and the City, Friends and One Tree Hill had their main characters pretty much from S1-series finale. Gossip Girl too. I mean, most shows I've watched has started and ended with a core cast. I know Grey's has the medical aspect, but specially in the start, it seemed like the 5 interns were the core of the show and it would start and end with then. Ok, backstage drama. Then we got MAJAC and I thought ok, the show will end with them. And now April and Christina are leaving.

I dunno, for me it really affects the quality of the show.

I love when the core characters stay from start to end - I mean, in SATC and Friends we know that Rachel and Carrie were the mains but the writers still made sure to highlight the importance of the leading line-up. Nobody left.

It seems super rare for characters to leave like they do in Grey's Anatomy - for a drama that focuses A LOT on character development/friendships/romances."

Ready for battle. The army is large, but narrow, lining up behind the newly built battlebots.

The emancipated/captured orc slave is now working as Gary’s barmaid. Myron isnt drinking, spending the evening sharpening and polishing his armour. He now looks sharp.

Burnie is sewing (lame). He’s trying to disguise himself as something to do with the opposition army. But it’s taking fucking ages.

Burnie wants to wait til the army is at the water gate, fly over them, hiding behind some smoke. There’s a holy mountain. We blow up the gates, the army gets in. Then we just sort of run-about-a-bit. Then just win.

Burnie’s made an amazing disguise of the not-emporer we killed. He’s not wearing it yet tho.

Riphard checks on the heavily pregnant Delilah. She’s pacing. She questions him on his battle plans. He says Burnie or Myron’s got it covered. Riphard realises the plan involved Delilah flying over the battle. He’s not happy about this, but what can he do? Will his child grow up motherless?

The goblins sing goblin stuff.

Everyone gets a good sleep.

--------------------

Gary sets sail for the holy mountain before first flight, flying under cover of darkness.

Burnie feels the feng shui is off and starts with redecorating the ship immediately before battle. Myron likes this and joins in, painting the ship with his vanquished foes.

Masuda mountain. Creative name. 

Myron says we should bail at the slightest hint of danger. He doesn’t feel this country or it’s people are worth our lives. Exme tells Myron he won’t die today. Myron is doubtful. Burnie consults his dictionary.

Exme checks on the escape cows. They’re comfortable down in the hold. They’ve got grass. It’s all good. The plan is to rappel ourselves and the cows down from the ship when the time comes. The cows are called Fatima, Gustav, and Betty.

Burnie suggests we build some bombs, only several minutes before battle… Everyone is incredulous at him not mentioning this previously if he was thinking it.

Kolo hands Burnie a lit candle. Burnie is holding mass explosive materials. Everyone else backs away.

Myron goes into his pocket. Impressive. He comes out with a bunch of beef jerky. He places this back in his pocket. This was important.

From Gary the group can see the army columns approaching Masuda. There’s a bunch of commoners with rifles outside. The gunfire starts raining down. Kolo notices that the mountain begins to shake, triggering avalanches. The two armies are approaching each other fast. Gary approaches the northern side of the battle. There’s some archers and pikemen and shit inside the city.

Myron activates the smokescreen. Constantly. He says he’ll stop smoking once we’re in boomboom range.

Burnie wants to boss everyone around. No one is interested. There’s a discussion on who’s manning what. Kolo wants to ride a bomb down.

Kolo sees everything. Burnie denies having any children. A raven sadly caws in the distance. 

Burnie ties a rope to a bomb. Gary heads towards the walls of Masuda, they are getting close. People are looking up at this ship of death, looking shaken, some run away in terror. The ship is fucking terrifying. A thick black cloud of smoke, with just a bow protruding from the front covered in what looks like the rotten carcasses of gruesome monsters. Proper metal shit.

Burnie blindly dangles some cargo out the back of the ship.

Volleys of arrows strike the airship, chipping away at Gary’s seemingly impenetrable armour. This ship is invulnerable. It is well-built.

Myron eases off the pollution. Kolo fires the cannon, laughing maniacally. Gary emerges menacingly from the black. Riphard and Kolo miss wildly with the ballistas. Exme feels like a natural cannoner, nailing a towerful of archers at the gate, toppling it to the ground cinematically. At the same time, a huge explosion rocks the ship. Miraculously the gate has been blown to smithereens, assisted by the collapse of the tower.

The battlebots engage the lines of musketmen, who begin to retreat into Masuda. At the command of Myron, and with the aid of Riphards back-ballista piloting, Delilah swings the ship down low and Myron deploys a layer of smoke over the archers on the wall.

Kolo wants to fire himself with the ballista. In the confusion he fires the ballista… empty. Exme gets overconfident with the cannon. Riphard nails 3 men with his ballista. “Don’t get penisy”.

The musketmen fire up at the ship, chipping some more life off of Gary.

A third round of firing goes awry. This shit is harder than it looks. Gary gets ever weaker.

Delilah soars away from the battle into the sky. Myron reactivates the pollution. The mountain is shaking vigorously now, but only Burnie has noticed. Worrying. There’s some meta-volcano-zilla discussion.

Gary arcs over the Masudan walls, penetrating the outer edge of the city. There’s panic on the streets of Masuda. But relative to the battle field outside things are fairly peaceful and quiet.

Myron starts shouting “Fuck it uuuuup!” over and over. Burnie is reluctant for some reason. Myron wants fucking chaos. Kolo has tied Burnie to a ballista arrow. He notices in time and cuts himself free.

The group remembers they are actually on here to heist a macguffin from a place. Kolo spots the anticipated location of the mystical doodah. And a giant fucking mountain lizard. As in… the lizard is the mountains. All of them.
The group groups in the cargo hold, ready to drop down into the city. Belly of the beast. Not the lizard… yet.

Everyone jumps out … except Riphard. Riphard tries to convince Delilah to just ditch everyone and fly away. Delilah almost convinces herself… but instead kicks Riphard out herself. A single word echoes on the wind, “Divooooooorce”.

Riphard does a 3-point landing. It looks sweet with the golden cloak. Kolo lands on his head. The ground shakes and walls begin to crumble. Kolo starts rambling about ballistas and buildings and giant animals. The group ignores him.

Exme guides the way to the gizmo with magic of some sort. Burnie ties up the balloon cows by “some rubble”. Disguised as rocks…. No way this could go wrong.

The group approaches a huge glass wall, holding back a large pool of water. Riphard shoots the glass. A crack appears. And grows…. And stabilises. Looks like it’s been well designed.

Riphard asks the group who thinks he should shoot again. Only Kolo is keen. Dejected he kicks a stone at the wall and walks away. An ominous trickle of water goes unnoticed.

The group finds a few Masudan men accompanied by 2… church peeps? WHATATWIST. They draw weapons. 

The church peeps recognise us. Kolo mocks them through repetition with a stupid voice. Or just his regular voice. Difficult to tell. He then surprise shoots one of the fuckers.

Myron runs up into the middle of the group of enemies. Genius tactical awareness. He hits with a shot. Burnie gets twatted hard by the church dudes. Myron gets bumrushed by the fancy looking Masudan. Exme shoots at the onrushing Masudanman, hitting him hard.

Riphard keeps his distance, striking the already hurt church man. He tells Riphard he will pay for being a traitor. This reminds Riphard of his financial business.

Burnie takes covers and attacks the fancy Masudan on Myron, killing him. Nice.

The musketmen retreat and fire at Kolo, Burnie, and Myron. They miss all of them. Muskets are shit. “Useless locals” grunts the now-racist church dude.

Stanri bounds up the battlefield and looks ready to pounce.

Kolo threatens to eat them, also looking ready to pounce.

Myron wonders whether he’s seen these church “wardens” before. He hasn’t. Nor has anyone. Turns out they are unpaid church interns in fancy clothes.

Myron rushes a warden, and Kolo fires, sticking him with an arrow. Myron stabs him with his gun. “You still got some learnin’ to do, son.” he says as his fires his shotgun while still impaling him. 

He says “You’ll pay for this.” Not a great comeback, feels derivative.

Exme shoots a warden nearly to death. Riphard just misses with a shot because of Exme’s hit.

Burnie slashes really aggressively at a warden. Super menacing, but all bark unfortunately.

Exme gets hit with a musket. Actually hurts quite bad it turns out. Stanri mauls a musketman. 

Kolo casually murders a man with his bow. #accuracy

Myron misses a bunch of times at close range. Win some lose some. The warden attempts to “rapier” Myron. But fails. Exme shoots his head off.

One of the musketmen explodes from Riphard’s weapon mastery.

Burnie punches one of the remaining musketmen. To death. One punch.

The last musketmen is pinned down by Stanri, ready for interrogation/torture/”rapier”.

“They told us you were evil traitors here to take out belongings.” The group agrees this sounds accurate.

Riphard doesn’t know anything about religion. Myron has heard of this Pastor Kieran, who is involved according to this nobody. He’s a kobald and a bellend. Myron menaces the fuck out of the dude, pressing him for more info on church involvement. “There’s the other one they call…. Fallon.” The group press about the hammer of the gods we’re after. He gives us specific directions and says it’s mostly empty and mostly a mausoleum. He begs for his life. Myron stabs him in the face.

The group loot the corpses. Not aware of any giant lizard based necessity to get on with it. Myron further investigates the wardens and finds a hidden letter. “Cannillon demands their heads.” That’s it. No one knows who that is. 

Myron peeks through the windows into the main hall. Empty. A barracks at the far end. Stanri sniffs the air, but smells nothing.

The group heads into the building and left into a dining room area. It’s actually more of a meeting room. A set of papers on the desk indicate the golden halls are suffering from poor visitor numbers due to the civil war. A set of stairs in the room lead to a circular chamber below.

Kolo seems suicidal nowadays. Myron gives him a pep talk. Burnie sees something he shouldn’t. Myron asks Exme to look after Kolo. Exme stares blankly into space.

Kolo pokes the door with a stick. Myron still seems concerned. There’s no trap. Burnie mutters to himself about multibows. The group head through the non-trapped door.

Burnie opens the door. Everyone’s spidey senses tingle real bad at the sight of an “empty” corridor. Burnie makes it halfway down the corridor before nothing happens. Two sets of doors at the end, one open, one closed. Burnie peeps through the open door. 3 more wardens await beyond.

Everyone bundles round the corner attacking in surprise. Kolo pops off a shot with his new weapon, hastily-bundled-together-muskets, before anyone knows what’s going on. He hits them for serious damage, but severely hurts himself in the process.

Myron runs in and attacks the one who took the brunt of Kolo’s explosion, killing him quickly, while choking on acrid smoke from Kolo’s musketbomb.

Riphard misses with a shot, but quickly reloads and hits a warden with a thunderous shot, throwing him into the wall and he crumples in a head to the floor.

Exme shoots at the last warden standing, but misses. Stanri mauls the warden on the floor to pieces. Burnie does some Burnie stuff. Kolo hits the last warden with an arrow.

The warden takes a pot shot at Stanri in panic, but glances off his armour plating.

Myron puts the warden out of his misery and immediately barges through the door.

Burnie barricades a new door as the group head to the top of some more steps down. A huge shake rocks the building. Exme and Riphard are thrown to the floor. The group descend the stairs to find 4 more wardens and a shepherd flavour pastor. He’s got a super creepy voice. A back and forth ensues, but it doesn’t get us anywhere and some killin’s afoot. 

The wardens fire down on Burnie and Myron. They seem fine.

Kolo hits the shepherd with an arrow, that he’s tied to a string. He begins to reel himself in, “I’m coming for you!”. He gets halfway. Probably would’ve been quicker to run.

Riphard blasts the shepherd with a thunderous discharge, blowing him over and dragging Kolo with him to the floor.

Exme throws a forcefield onto Kolo and gets all blurry.

Burnie doesn’t really do anything of note. Maybe noteworthy in his ineffectiveness.

Stanri mauls the nearest warden.

The shepherd heals the mauled warden. Excpet he doesn’t cos he’s totes out of range, MIKE. Instead he touches himself, which is probably the more sensible move anyway. He also does some sanctuary shit.

Myron runs about a bit and yells. He has a little mid battle chit chat with the shepherd. “Helen will come for you.” Everyone wonders who Helen is.

The wardens fail in their rapiering. But the two with pistols hit Myron with some damage. He seems fine.

Kolo the wise is wise enough to shoot at the sanctuaried shepherd, whilst still being rappelled towards him. He hits him good. Riphard similarly gives him a whack with his blessed bullets.

Exme misses. Burnie runs away and gets rapiered for his cowardice. He slashes a different warden near Stanri for some reason. Stanri short circuits. 

The shepherd tries to hold Kolo with his mind tricks. Kolo the wise is having none of it.

However, Myron the unwise is fooled by the shepherds tricks and does nothing.

All the wardens miss, except Myron, who takes more poultry(SIC) damage.

Riphard’s fucking on it today, and hits the Shepherd with more blessed bullets, seeing through his puppy dog eyes.

Exme misses again. Not her day unfortunately. Burnie also sucks.

Stanri kills a motherfucker. Burnie is now riding Stanri and seems to try to take credit for the kill.

The shepherd slinks away from Myron and rains down with pistols on Kolo. Kolo dances over the bullets. He then further sanctuaries himself.

Myron is so fucking unwise. And then he isn’t. He tackles the shepherd to the floor, holding him “human shield style” demanding the warden put their guns down immediately. One of the wardens makes a break for it up the stairs. The other two wardens shoot the shepherd… to fucking shreds. But Myron rolls over just in time, realising they’ve called his bluff. Myron takes the bullets in the back. 

Kolo amazingly misses with an arrow. Riphard still got it though, and thunders a warden into the wall. Exme also misses. Riphard’s on his own today.

Burnie jumps off Stanri and slashes the shit out of the knocked down warden, but he clings to life. 

Stanri runs up behind Burnie and swipes the dude to death as Burnie flips up back onto him. Nice.

The mostly dead shepherd, whos life was just saved by Myron further mocks us, and he attempts to stab Myron. Ungrateful shit.

Myron forcefeeds the dude beef jerky, and tries to pin him down with his bayonet, but fails. The weak attempt doesn’t intimidate the clearly insane church cultist.

The last remaining warden looks desperate and shoots the onrushing Stanri.

Kolo shoots the warden. He’s still standing though.

Riphard, out of boredom and cockiness at this point, runs up to the warden and attempts to whip him. Sadly not.

Exme misses again. Burnie slashes the dude and he’s still going, the absolute unit. Stanri finally kills him.

Only the shepherd remains and Myron attempts a proper interrogation. The dude says “Fallon will have fun with you.” The entire building shakes. Myron cuts the shepherds tendons and leaves him.

The group approach the pedestal holding the hammer of the gods… a gun. It’s more Riphards thing than Myron’s. But everyone seems to want Myron to have it anyway. Riphard takes it.

The group argue over the freshness of meat.

As the group works their way out from the hall a collective sense of dread descends on the group.

**Blair Sawmill**

Cutting across fields and cycling on footbridges, Andromeda Frost was doing everything in her power to be at the Blair Sawmill for 5pm. Although she had been given the option of the day off from her internship with the Nance campaign (a position she had taken up during the spring) in order to represent her father in his legal case against the Sheriff’s department, Andromeda had refused, and firmly told Pete Nance and Joan Blair to hold her to her original shift start at 5pm. With the trial running significantly overtime, Andromeda was regretting the decision, but she didn’t intend to let it stop her keeping her word. As made headway up the sawmill road, Andromeda saw the fruit stall of Michael Philips a short distance ahead, and realised that she had an intense craving for an orange (A guilty pleasure, as oranges were not a folkish fruit), which were now actually in season. She glanced down at her watch, and, noticing that she would probably make it to the sawmill by five even if she did stop off with the friendly produce merchant, decided to swing her bike in by the roadside and buy that citrus. Andromeda cycled up to Philips, and called over to him from her bike. 

**ANDROMEDA:** Hark, I frain you, Sir Greenseller, what is the geldworth of those midricapples? 

**PHILIPS:** Well now, lil missy, I think that depends on what you’d be willing to trade for them.

Andromeda was taken slightly aback by this, as she had momentarily forgotten that, as a result of the plague epidemic, the country had reverted to something of a neo-barter economy which basically meant that purchasing anything was a huge production and you were generally better off making like Big Ed and going totally self-sufficient. Drom spent a few seconds trying to figure out what exactly Philips might be angling for, because many more nefarious merchants in the nation had taken advantage of the collapsed economy to curry sexual favours out of desperate customers, and would be more than willing to take advantage of her tight young entirely illegal (if you were over a certain age) body if they could. Fortunately, Old Mister Philips was a kindly fruit merchant, and was not predisposed to such action. This still did not take away from the fact that she had not come prepared for such a transaction, and as such, all she had on her at the moment aside from some debate notes was her Whiplash 5000, a light-up yoyo that, in layman’s terms, basically dabbed on all of her classmates’ inferior yoyos. Needless to say, Drom was not too keen to part ways with the kooky spinning toy. 

**ANDROMEDA:** I make mean that I have not much on me but this plaything which I hold dear. 

Drom then produced the yoyo from her pocket and showed it to the humble greengrocer, who appeared to be rather impressed with the thing. 

**PHILIPS:** Now, I don’t rightly think I can deprive you of such a cool lil trinket as that, but I would ask one thing of you before any sorta transaction is made: may I give ‘er a good spin, just for old time’s sake? 

**ANDROMEDA:** Sickerly. Have at it. 

Andromeda handed the yoyo over to Philips, who proceeded to do a series of cool tricks with it, one of which involved him going between both legs and using his back as a surface to roll it. Despite having not touched a yoyo in decades, the produce vendor seemed to immediately remember even the most complex moves. Perhaps yoyoing, like riding a bike or knowing the names of all the Toa in Bionicle’s deep lore, is something that once you learn it, your noggin puts it into permanent storage. Perhaps. Whatever it was, Philips, for a moment, returned to a simpler time when the biggest concern was which flavour of ice cream to get or whether to watch Spongebob Squarepants or whatever Cartoon Network’s equivalent of that show was. But that moment soon passed, as Philips, being a man of his word, handed the toy back to Andromeda and then grabbed a freshly-peeled orange from his pile, handing it over to her. If it’s never happened to you, then you probably can’t imagine the shock of being given an intact, albeit entirely skinless orange from a greengrocer. Andromeda looked at the orange as if it might secretly be a tribal assassination device, twisting it around in an effort to find where the skin had gone too. 

**ANDROMEDA:** Where is the skin, Sir Greenseller? 

**PHILIPS:** That ole’ thing? I peel ‘em before they go out to the stall. Sure, no one eats the skin anyway, and in these troubled times, it proves a very effective home countermeasure to disease. 

**ANDROMEDA:** But...I liked to strip it. I thought it to be fun, Lord Philips. 

Andromeda was aghast at Philips’ business practices, but she could not fault the logic of them, and so put the peeled orange into her pocket, anyway. 

**ANDROMEDA:** Whence do your midricapples hail, Sir? 

**PHILIPS:** Oh, I keep ‘em in a big pit back at the house. I live out near the old town, miss. 

**ANDROMEDA:** I make mean that I shall ride for your smallholding on the morrow, my Lord, and I will agive twofoldly the spins for a berry skinned and hided. 

Without waiting for a response from the humble merchant, Andromeda kicked off her bike and resumed heading towards the sawmill, somewhat fearful of the deskinned orange leaking all over her sweet coat’s unrealistically huge pockets. She soon turned up the country lane that lead to the Blair house, breezing passed the burned down ruins of the sawmill (which had been destroyed in a still unsolved case of arson some months ago), Andromeda eventually came to a stop outside the residence, which had once been one of the most resplendent houses in the town, but had faded and declined with the death of Anthony Blair (No relation to the former Prime Minister and Labour party leader Tony Blair), Joan’s husband, which had only served to magnify the impact of the logging industry’s post-Brexit downturn. Tying her bike up by one of the outside benches, Andromeda let herself in, and found Candidate Nance and his campaign manager talking shop in the kitchen, over a cup of non-poisoned coffee.

**PETE:** ...Jeez, Joan, are you sure this line you have here about removing all religious symbols from the public sphere will go down well with the people of Darkplace? 

**JOAN:** It not about peopre agleeing with what we say, what matters is the truth! We readers of curturar levolution, Comlade Nance! We are vangualds of levolution, and the peopre wirr forrow what we do. 

**PETE:** I get where you’re coming from, Joan, but if you look at the demographics of this town, it’s 97% Catholi-

**JOAN:** They just blainwashed by opioids of the masses! 

**PETE:** Alright, if you say so… 

**ANDROMEDA:** With greet heed, Lady Blair, I make mean my withholding to Lord Nance’s thoughts here. To onset the deeply-held worshiply beliefs of the burgh, even if rightly, would be to greatly hurt our shot at sig. 

Joan and Pete, with a small amount of surprise, turned to find Andromeda standing in the doorway. Such was their commitment to figuring out the right kind of socialist cause that they hadn’t noticed her coming in, despite the fact that their front door creaked more than the wooden trap-door entrance to the cave of Smallboy Jacobs - a 78-year old man in schoolboy garb who lived within the region of the Forest of Dean known as the “Outer Woods” (So named because, one, it was the area of the forest closest to civilisation, and two, it was much more normal than the goings-on further into the woodland) and who believed himself to be a sort of perennially young, Peter Pan-esque figure - and that had been specifically designed to creak, in order to alert Smallboy to the presence of intruders.

**JOAN:** You quiet, you no here to make big policy decision! 

**ANDROMEDA:** My deepest sorrywords, Lady Blair, I was onefoldly putting forth my selfly rede. I sickerly meant no harm by it. 

**PETE:** I suppose Joan here was a little bit tough on you, kid, but don’t take it personally, she just wants to see this debate go smoothly. Speaking of, I reckon I should probably lay off the coffee beforehand so I don’t get all jittery up there! 

Pete set down his cup of coffee, which was as black as his skin, which is to say that it was a middling brown, before reconsidering and downing the rest of it. 

**ANDROMEDA:** I frain you kindly, what is the plot going into this upcoming wordwrestle with the most hateful fiend Mogg? 

**JOAN:** We stop at nothing sholt of complete victoly! We use tlick questions in older to expose fraws in Lees-Mogg’s alguments in flont of arr Darkprace! 

**PETE:** Err, specifically though, I’d like to focus on my ideas on how to improve the community instead of just going after Mogg’s plans. Now, I might not be much of a seasoned politician myself, but I’ve found in life that people respond better to positive messages instead of negative ones. Instead of being anti-Mogg, I think we should present ourselves as pro-Darkplace. That’s just my two cents, though, ladies. 

**JOAN:** But we should not folget that we are anti-bourgeoisie! 

**PETE:** Well, of course, that’s a given, isn’t it? 

As he said this, Pete’s glance turned towards the antique clock in the corner of the room, which read a quarter past 5. 

**PETE:** Aw heck, I guess time really does fly when you’re having fun - it’s almost half-past! I guess we should probably start heading down to the town square here pretty soon if we want to make it to this thing on time. 

**ANDROMEDA:** I forthspell it that I have readied a set of speaking ords that you may find brookful in this clash of beliefs, if you would care to go over them on the way to the burghfield. 

**PETE:** Gee. 

**JOAN:** Hong-kong ching-chong ping fu!

**PETE:** Golly.

And it was.

**Wilmington House**

Remember this place? Unfortunately, we do too. Wilmington House, the impossibly large hotel/manor/office of the former (and last) British Prime Minister and current Conservative candidate in the Grant byelection Jacob Rees-Mogg had not changed all that much within the last six months. The arrest of Philip Davies on charges of childlusting in the middle of the manor’s dining room hadn’t done much for business, true, but Wilmington would rebound, and if not, its owner was rich enough for that not to matter. Perhaps the only major change to the house since we were last there was Rees-Mogg, who now disavowed alcohol as satanism, had converted the bar into a small church, where he could often be found gazing up at the crucifix, and begging for salvation from whatever the major issue of the day was. The major change to the house*hold*, which hung over the place like how the Holocaust makes Auschwitz a slightly troubling holiday destination, was that we were now a man down. Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius Rees-Mogg, or just “Alfie” to his zero friends, had contacted the plague in the early days of the infestation, and, having gone undiagnosed for some time, been put out of his misery with a highly illegal cocktail of Swiss drugs. As Alfred’s importance to the events of the Elizabeth Davies case was virtually nil, his passing might not come as a great shock, indeed, perhaps greater still was the shock at being reminded of his existence, but we assure you that it was felt by the entire Mogg clan, with the exception of Jacob and Tommy’s sister, Annunziata, because she had also died from the plague. At present, a few of the surviving Moggers (There were still many of them, a family overlarge if ever such a thing existed) were gathered in the living room of Wilmington House, for some high-octane action. Mary, who you’ll remember from such hit singles as: I Got Rejected (By Dale) and (C)Linger, was attempting to watch one of her programmes on the television, which as you have no doubt guessed, was an entry-level “kino” which she could watch and feel intelligent about, namely Casablanca, which she used to imagine herself reuniting with Dale in some faraway town in a prospective World War 3 situation. While this was going on, the great retard of the Mogg clan, Sixtus, was jumping around the room wearing an aardvark mask, and attempting to push into various servants and other unimportant people with. As Sixtus jumped around, his brother Thomas (Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan Rees-Mogg, not to be confused with their uncle, Thomas Fletcher Rees-Mogg) was attempting to get him to put these shenanigans on the backburner. 

**THOMAS:** Look here, Sixtus! Stop trying to burrow into people right this instant!

Sixtus, who was pressing his fake snout into the eye of an eastern european cleaner by the name of Olga, didn’t seem to pay his brother any heed.

**THOMAS:** I demand you cease these activities! 

**OLGA:** Help! 

**SIXTUS:** SIXTUS BUROWE FOR ANTIES! 

As this was happening, Mary laughed at something in the movie that probably wasn’t intended to be taken as a joke (We imagine: Play it again, Sam) causing the lumbering mongoloid’s attention to be diverted from Olga, who took the opportunity to escape. 

**THOMAS:** Sixtus, don’t you - 

Sixtus didn’t seem terribly inclined to listen to his brother, and jumped across the room, landing on the couch and causing the other end to briefly lift off the ground. Mary yelped in surprise, and tried to scramble away from her brother, but Sixtus used his superior retard strength to grab her and pull her into towards him, before attempting to ram the aardvark nose into her ear.

**MARY:** Sixtus, stop it!

**SIXTUS:** Heehehe!  

**MARY:** No, Sixtus, no! 

**SIXTUS:** SIXTUS NO STOP TILL HE GETS ALL DA LITTLE ANTIES! 

**THOMAS:** Stop this, Sixtus! Our dearest sister has plainly told you “no,” and no means no, I say! 

As Sixtus continued to root around inside his sister, and defy her protestations, Jacob Rees-Mogg came walking into the room, deep in conversation with his brother, Tommy, again, not to be confused with Thomas, who was holding a calzone. 

**MOGG:** ...Make no mistake, brother Thomas, I shall take that tin-pot Stalinist to task on the blood-stained history of his ideology! I shall take him task, I say! Did you know that Hitler was the original leftist, oh brother mine? I should think that most people are unaware of just *how* leftist that fascist’s inclinations were, but, indeed, they were. 

**TOMMY:** Would you like any of my calzone, Jake? It’s absolutely delicious.

**MOGG:** I would not! How can you eat such a thing, Thomas? It’s unnatural! It appears to be the union of two pizza pies! Adam and Eve, Thomas, but Adam and, and, and, Mr. Domino. In fact, I - 

It was at this point that Mogg noticed that Mary was pinned onto the seat, with Sixtus on top of her, violating her personal space and much else besides with his devilish aardvark snout. 

**MOGG:** What is the meaning of this, children?!?! 

**SIXTUS:** SIXTUS NEED TO EAT DA ANTIES, YUMMY YUMMY ANTIES!

**MARY:** Father, I didn’t consent to this! 

**THOMAS:** Father, you should know that I voiced my utmost objections to this but most regrettably, they fell upon deaf ears! 

**SIXTUS:** EARS?? SIXTUS WANT EARS, SIXTUS WANT ALL DA EARS! 

**MOGG:** By God, Sixtus, I demand you retract your proboscis from your sister at once! This is unseemly and I shall not abide it in this household, I say!

Sixtus appeared to consider the demand in his minute brain. 

**SIXTUS:** Anties!

**MOGG:** SIXTUS, THERE SHALL BE NO ARTHUR FOR YOU EVER AGAIN IF YOU DON’T DO AS I BID RIGHT THIS SECOND! WE LIVE UNDER GOD IN THIS HOUSE!

Although Sixtus didn’t understand much, he did understand the implications of a household-wide Arthur ban, and reluctantly removed his faux-snout from his sister’s orifice. Mary, fearing another run-in with the aardvark’s snout once the authoritative presence of their father was gone, fled the room, heading in the direction of her own. After Mary had gone, Mogg senior prepared to stamp his leadership status on his son (stamping leadership status was a phrase the Darkplace youth now used to indicate that someone had “owned” someone else, don’t ask us why), only for Tommy (That, again, is not Thomas) to interject.

**TOMMY:** Brother Jake, I hate to be a bother, but it’s heading on for a quarter past five. 

**MOGG:** Oh, good heavens, so you’re right. I suppose we’d better get going down to this debate then, eh? This will be a good day for the campaign brother, I can feel it! 

Mogg turned around to his son, Thomas (not to be confused with Tommy).

**MOGG:** Now, son, don’t let your brother hunt for any more ants, do you understand? 

**THOMAS:** Yes, father!

**MOGG:** Good lad. 

Mogg and Mogg turned and left the room, leaving Mogg and Mogg behind. As soon as they were gone, Sixtus pulled his aardvark mask back on, and made a frankly very retarded and eugenics-promoting farting noise. 

**SIXTUS:** Sixtush huntie antos! 

Sixtus charged towards the door, waving his arms around like a spastic.

**THOMAS:** Enough!

Thomas attempted to capture his brother, leaping through the air in an effort to tackle him. Unfortunately, Sixtus was quicker than his retarded nature and fat shite status might suggest, and so Thomas missed him, and landed face-first on the hardwood floor. With his brother looking on, Sixtus started to windmill his arms, and ran down the hallway towards his sister’s bedroom door, giggling and drooling all the while.

**Marc Bolan Memorial Retail Park**

The out-of-town retail park a few miles from Darkplace featured numerous amenities, such as a Tesco, a PC World electronics store, a B&amp;Q home improvement and general do-it-yourself store, and a Burger King and McDonalds that were side by side, offering unparalleled choice in bad food, but the last six months had seen it gain something new: A seagull-perch which also doubled as a statue of the legendary glam rocker and T.Rex frontman Marc Bolan - a childhood hero of the Anglish leader Morrissey - whose music was famous for never quite being as amped as you might’ve imagined. The statue continually broadcast Bolan’s music throughout the carpark, and as Strike Eagle pulled up in his blue 1986 Renault Espace (Somewhat humiliatingly, his dankmobile, a Pontiac GTO, had broken down, and he was now forced to use his mother’s car, which couldn’t go above 60 miles an hour without the back seat shaking), it was playing Bolan’s seminal soporific, Cosmic Dancer. As Cosmic Dancer is amazingly drab, we’ve instead chosen to broadcast [Children of the Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu3-ZGbqUyk). You’d do the same. Lanterman parked his car in, coincidentally, the same space that Sheriff Wilson and Masala had spied Christopher Walken in some months prior, but, he was...long, gone, by this...stage. In the passenger's seat was Joey Ashebrooke, while in the back you had Smokey, and Bueno Excellente (who had taken his name from the raping DC-comics character of the same name, “in order to counter the breeder”), a somewhat heavy-set hispanic student who, like Smokey, had been friends with Joey and Strike Eagle for the entire time, but also not relevant before now.

**JOEY:** Bros, can we talk about what the hell was going on back there?

**BUENO:** Yeah holmes, I’s confused, nawmean? 

**LANTERMAN:** Yeah, man, that makes uh.. 1, 2, 3, 4.. 5 of us. For a second there I thought they were doing that shit with the biscuits that they usually do, but Donna was with them, so that kinda blows that theory out of the water. Unless… you don’t think they used *her* instead of a biscuit, do you?

**SMOKEY:** I’m pretty sure they have a word for that, but I can’t really be fucked to think of it right now. 

**JOEY:** You’re thinking of a bukkake, man. 

**LANTERMAN:** Yeah, bro, a bukkake!! You don’t think they were using her as a bukkake, do you?

**BUENO:** If anything, those pendejos probably had her holding the camera while they jacked each other off and sheet, ese! 


**JOEY:** Whatever it was, it couldn’t have been worse than what the fucking breeder’s been up to at McDonald’s, bros. 

**SMOKEY:** I have this theory that James Hightower’s actually gay, bros. I mean, it makes sense, doesn’t it? 

**LANTERMAN:** Yeah, he’s a real faggot, Smokey!

**JOEY:** Hold up, bro. Smokey was talking about Hightower being *gay*, not him being, like, y’know, a faggot. There’s a difference, man.

**LANTERMAN:** Yeah, obviously, bro, but that doesn’t mean James can’t be both. 

**BUENO:** He’s definitely both, I gotta say. 

**SMOKEY:** Yeah, but the issue is that you agreed with me saying he was gay by going “yeah, he’s a faggot”, bro. 

**LANTERMAN:** Man, what’s the difference? This is so damn confusing. Why do you even care, man? 

Smokey leaned forward and put a hand on Strike Eagle’s shoulder, thus violating his NAP.

**SMOKEY:** Well mate, it’s because...I’m gay. 

The other three members of the car began to laugh, although this was one of those jokes you wouldn’t find funny unless you were friends with someone. Smokey was a notorious pu$$yhound, similar in stature to Lewis Carroll, and like Carroll, many jealous goons had tried to smear Smokey for various crimes over the years to stop his banging-spree.

**LANTERMAN:** Like fuck are you gay, Noah. 

**JOEY:** Let’s get back on track, bros! The Breeder’s been cumming in our burgers for years, remember! 

**LANTERMAN:** Right, bro! We’ve gotta deal with this somehow! Do any of you have like, y’know, a plan, or are we just gonna wing it?

**SMOKEY:** Every time we try to plan anything, it immediately goes to shit ‘cause we’re retarded, so I’m saying just go on gut instinct, man.

**BUENO:** My gut insteenct is telling me we need to put a stop to dees bullsheet, compadres! 

**JOEY:** We literally just said that, man. 

**BUENO:** Okay, holmes. No hate.

**LANTERMAN:** Enough goddamn talking, bros. If we’re gonna do this, we gotta do it.

The other three members of the East Side Jets that were present in the car agreed with Strike Eagle, and everyone bailed out on the count of three, but instead of heading into the McDonalds, they walked around to the front of Strike Eagle’s minivan and stopped. 

**JOEY:** Are we gonna do this, then? 

**SMOKEY:** I guess so.

**LANTERMAN:** Let’s not go insane in here, bros. This is just, just, y’know, it’s just a thing.

**SMOKEY:** This is just us scouting the breeder’s lair out, guys, and if we don’t like what we see, then we’ll deal with it later. 

**LANTERMAN:** Yeah, this is just that.

**BUENO:** So you’re telling me I brought my piece for nothing, Strike Eagle?

**LANTERMAN:** I mean, keep it on you. After all, you never know, it may come in handy if one of those burger-flipping fucks catches wind that we’re onto their operation. 

**JOEY:** Hold up, you brought a piece, man? 

Bueno pulled an M9 out of his coat pocket, holding it up for the others to see.

**JOEY:** What the hell, man?! Where did you even get that? You know what, bro, it don’t matter, just like, put it away! 

To answer Joey’s question, Bueno Excelente had actually acquired the handgun through the Anglish rikehood’s “Every Anglishman a Crigger” initiative, a big part of which involved loosening the restrictions on purchasing firearms. Despite purchasing it under these pretenses, the hispanoid hadn’t actually killed a single grey acweornas with it and instead just kept it on him for situations like the one he envisioned happening in this McDonalds. 

**SMOKEY:** Calm down, Joseph. Shouting’s just gonna attract attention, man.

Bueno put his gun away without offering any further explanation, while Joey briefly held his tongue, but something started to nag at him before long.

**JOEY:** Wait, did you just call me Joseph, bro? 

**SMOKEY:** Yep.

**JOEY:** Why, man? Just...why?

**SMOKEY:** Well, it worked, so that’s why. 

**JOEY:** Goddammit, man…

**LANTERMAN:** Let’s just charge in, bros! C’mon! 

The four unsung heroes of Darkplace went running towards the McDonalds, completely violating any idea of inconspicuity on their way. They soon reached the front door, and pushed past some obese fuck wae their big mac covered in breeder sauce, entering the McDonalds, which had the exact same layout as every other McDonalds you’ve ever been in.

**JOEY:** What the hell do we do now, bros?

**LANTERMAN:** Shit, I didn’t really think this far ahead. Uh, maybe we could grab some sauce packets to test later for the Breeder’s spunk? 

**JOEY:** Good thinking, bro! Alright, gang, what we’re gonna do is this: so there’s two counters with sauces and shit, so we’re gonna split up, and half of us will go to each. 

**BUENO:** Ey, bossman, one problem with that, there’s five of us which doesn’t divide evenly, unless you want to spleet one of us in half, which is OK with me. 

**JOEY:** Sorry, I wasn’t aware they counted differently in French or whatever the fuck you speak, bro! There’s fucking four of us here, so I don’t know what you’re even talking about!Anyway, uh, as I was saying, we’re splitting up, so I want you two to take the one on the left and grab all the sauces you can fit in your pockets, while Smokey and I… wait, shit, guys, where the fuck is Smokey?! 

That was a good question, as Smokey had, in a sense, gone up in smoke, i.e he was no longer there. Not wishing to dwell on their gangmate’s departure, the Arrows and Bueno rushed over to the condiment stand in McDonalds, pushing past a family of Chinese people (Perhaps Joan’s folks had come to visit) and starting to rapidly stuff their pockets full of all the available sauces, which basically amounts to just ketchup. 

**LANTERMAN:** Keep packing sauce, bros! Ketchup, ketchup, ketchup, ketchup…

Many people within the store began to stare at the three sauce bandits, who were by now dropping handfuls of tomato sauce packets into their pockets at a somewhat ludicrous rate. The employees of McDonalds might have been inclined to stop them, but they were currently busy with something else. As Joey started piling salt in (In case it was just crystallized breeder sauce) the doors to the backstage area opened up, and two McDonalds minions appeared, escorting Smokey out of the premises. Before they had him out the front door, Smokey shouted a word or two of encouragement to the fellow members of his detective agency.

**SMOKEY:** Keep on fighting the good fight, brothers!

As this was happening, Strike Eagle suddenly felt a great wetness in his pockets: He’d spunked. Er, no, we mean that the sauce packets had leaked, something which caused him a great deal of anguish, considering what was supposed to be in them.

**LANTERMAN:** BROS, THE BREEDER’S SPUNK HAS SPILLED IN MY POCKETS! OH HELL! THAT SHIT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WASH OUT, MAN!

Lanterman proceeded to try and tear off his jacket and run out of the store, briefly getting it caught up on his left arm and spilling sauce onto the floor. He eventually got it off and fled the scene, leaving Ashebrooke and Bueno Exellente the last two men standing.

**JOEY:** I guess it’s just you and me now, bro. 

No response. 

**JOEY:** Bro?

Joey turned around to find Bueno enjoying a healthy Big Mac meal, which he’d apparently pilfered from behind the counter during the chaos. 

**JOEY:** Goddammit, man.

**Darkplace Town Square**

The town square had been redecorated for the first debate between Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con) and Pete Nance (FB), the two leading candidates for the seat in the lawmoot that had been vacated by Philip Davies before he was revealed to be a murdering daughter-rapist. The town square had been allowed to return to its original colour by Father Damien on a purely conditional basis - the removal of the white-out, he said, was entirely contingent on plague rates over the next few days and weeks. If they spiked in Darkplace or the rest of England, he would be forced to resume fire sacrifices, and fire sacrifice required a stark white field for bloodletting. Many hundreds of townsfolk had turned out for the debate, which was being held on a makeshift stage in the middle of the square, as well as representatives from all of the major national media institutions, and some smaller regional ones, such as the Kentish Khronicler, one K away from misfortune. Although the debate was, essentially, Mogg v. Nance, and the vast majority of the town regarded and referred to it as such, there were a number of candidates from smaller parties sharing the stage with them. On the left-hand side of the stage was Pete and his podium, and on the right, Mogg and his. Between the two of them were the other candidates, from left to right: Evil Eduardo the Sinister One, a candidate standing for the “Party of Anglish Doom”, whose main promise was to plot world destruction from inside Westminster, “Captain” Vincent “Bad Butt” Cutler of the Anglish Pirate Party, which, despite sharing a name with similar organisations across Europe, stood for none of the same principles as those parties and instead advocated for actual piracy, Alison of the Party of Anglish Technocrats, a fully sentient AI that took the form of an attractive female and was programmed to have the personality of a “manic pixie dream girl” in order to appeal to the key demographic of young, sexless males, and the musician Phil Oakey, former frontman of The Human League, who had some years ago gone insane, moved to a shack in the Forest of Dean, and become convinced of the need for a party to “advocate for the rights of werewolves, vampires, ghouls, ghasts, and other extrahuman entities”, which he now led. The party didn’t have an official name, but it was popularly known as The Inhuman League. He, however, rejected this name as he felt that it implied inferiority, a notion Oakey, of course, vehemently opposed. By broad agreement, the moderator of the debate was a highly opinionated question wheel, which was originally to be spun by Shelly Jackson, but as she was in deep shock, it was now being spun by Mildred Robbins, the 84-year old treasurer of St. John’s church and wider parish. 

Now, as the last few Darkplacers trickled into the square and found their seats, Mildred slowly made her way over to the microphone stand, put on her spectacles, and began to read off a slip of paper in her hand. 

**MILDRED:** Good evening, fellow Darkplacers. I’d like to welcome you all to tonight’s.. mootish word-wrestle… now say, I didn’t know there was going to be any physical fighting involved in this, but I suppose that just shows much I know. Anyway, I know most of you were probably expecting to see a slightly younger face up here tonight, but I’m afraid Ms. Jackson has had something of an unforeseen emergency crop up, so they’ve chosen me to stand in for her as the moderator of this here word-wrestle. This event will be done in a standard U&amp;A format.. oh, I’m sorry, that’s actually “Q&amp;A,” silly ole me. Anyway, this format will involve the moderator, again, that’s me, spinning this here wheel and, whichever… gosh, I really need to get the prescription upped on these, I’m sorry about that. Whichever.. Frain it lands on will be the one asked. In order to determine who answers first, each candidate will draw a straw and the person who draws the longest straw gets the honour of answering first, followed by the second longest, third longest, and so on. Now, this is interesting because when I was growing up, that’s how we’d decide who got to have the first go at the rations, except, of course, we used actual straw instead of these plastic things you lot have nowadays but it was the same principle, really. Oh shucks, here I go again, rambling on. Each candidate has five minutes to make their point, after which point the rest of the candidates will be able to comment on or rebuke their points. 

Mildred stepped towards the wheel, and over the course of five seconds, outstretched her hand towards it.

**MILDRED:** I’m going to spin the wheel now. 

She did.

**MILDRED:** It’s spinning.

T’was. 

**MILDRED:** I think it’s slowing down.

It seemed to be.

**MILDRED:** Okay, it’s stopped.

It had. 

**MILDRED:** I’m going to read what it says now.

She did, but not without great strain on her old eyes. 

**MILDRED:** Alright, gentlemen, the first question for tonight’s word-wrestle is: “how are you doing today?” "

8epnc1,1,2018-04-24,"The Right to a Lawyer, the Right to a Fair Trial, Presumption of Innocence - What We Don’t Talk About When We Talk About #MeToo - By JoAnn Wypijewski (The Nation) 22 Feb 2018",FinnagainsAwake,WomenLiberation,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenLiberation/comments/8epnc1/the_right_to_a_lawyer_the_right_to_a_fair_trial/,"Amid the chorus of stories that define the #MeToo phenomenon, there remain other, unattended stories. These others do not displace the chorus. They do not say, “You are wrong, shut up.” They do not exist in the world of “Keep quiet” or “Be good.” They do not deny the reality of men’s age-old power over women, or conformity as a silencing force. They say power is cunning, power is a hydra; it has more heads than any story or group of stories can describe. They say history does, too. They invite us to inspect the hydra.

What follows is my invitation.

We both were young, 20s, but I was older. We worked for the same outfit, but I was paid. We kissed while walking home from a party, and then at the back of a bus, and then in his stairwell. He had made the first move, but only I could say, in the midst of our distraction, “Of course this means I can’t hire you.” He was an intern, I a department chief. The declaration astonished him—whether because he sensed I underestimated him, I cannot say. Ultimately, he so surpassed the qualifying test’s requirements that not hiring him would have been absurd. Years later, a catty friend would say ambition alone drove the boy’s kisses: “After all, he was gorgeous, and you…” I was his boss and lover, he my assistant and lover, each of us on the seesaw of power and weakness that those dual roles implied until, over time, the temperature changed.

That is a true story, true to me, and the telling, I suppose, encourages you to believe it. But what do you know? Say I were a man and the intern a woman. Say I called her a girl and someone said her desire for a job figured in the encounter. Say you knew nothing of her side of the story, as you know nothing of his—as, actually, you know only the barest details of mine. Say, finally, that she knew the value of her kind of beauty in seduction and social competition—how could she not?—but also its curse. Does that imaginative exercise open what for me is a sweet, if complicated, memory to sinister interpretation? Is the intern now a victim? Am I a predator? And yet the information is unchanged, as revealing and partial as it was at first telling.

The story, like any told from a single point of view, raises an unnerving question about certainty: How can we determine the truth from what we cannot know? In his Histories, Herodotus tells readers that x is what he heard but could not confirm, that y is what his informants say they believe, that z is something he highly doubts but is, in any event, a cultural consensus. Readers might not have verifiable fact, but they are invited to interpret what those views might say about the people who hold them (or the writer who chose to record them). At the detective’s desk, a story of crime is pieced together from multiple sources, but even then, a charging document is not the truth; it is subject to challenge. In literature, truth is an investigation, not an end point, so the story is an instrument for revealing the complexity of being alive, and wisdom, rather than certainty, is the hope.

In politics, truth tends to be whatever those holding the bullhorn say it is. In January, television viewers of the Golden Globes spectacle would have seen this graphic commercial:

    
He said. She said.

    
He said. She said.

    
He said. She said.

    
He said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said.

Today, the ad flickers from New York subway platforms. As cultural messaging, it resolves the problem of uncertainty by saying, first, that truth lies in the teller and, second, that social truth—the reality of sexual violence—may obliterate the particulars of any individual case by the sheer number of tellers saying, “Me too.”

Given the timing of its debut, the “She said” cascade could be read narrowly to represent Harvey Weinstein’s accusers and the Times’ role in his fall. It is now accepted fact that Weinstein is a violent criminal. He may be, but in actual fact we don’t know. Saying that should not be controversial; review enough cases brought on the basis of multiplying accusations in periods of high emotion, and you resist trial-by-media. That it is controversial indicates just how much people are willing to trade for certainty—also, how sheltered some are from the idea that they could ever find themselves on the wrong side of a police investigation. Weinstein basked in the bully role, and his descent would be more satisfying if it did not rely simultaneously on conviction by say-so and generalized agreement that he disempowered every man and woman who wasn’t on his security detail, from assistants to actors to journalists.	

Strip the veneer of liberation, and an enthusiasm for punishment is palpable.

Affirmations of powerlessness are more telling than sordid details. Not because the latter might be untrue, but because the former reduce a many-layered story of sexism and human weakness to a bleached tale of monstrosity and cowering. If some of the most privileged people on the planet were paralyzed by fear, this story implies, what defense do the rest of us have against the Bad Man?

As Natalie Portman explained, we are helpless:  It’s only some men who do the harassing, but it’s all women who fear the violence and aggression. It has an effect like terror…everyone is afraid to walk down the street alone at night.*

Desperate situations demand desperate measures. After the terror of 9/11: war, torture, mass surveillance, the gulag. After the terror of Weinstein, to what ends must we go to feel safe?

That is not a glib question, nor is the “terror” reference insignificant. It points to a broader politics of fear structuring our time. Rage, revenge, the frisson of freedom as the list of accused men grew—these emotions reigned as #MeToo burst into the air-conditioning system of the culture. Notwithstanding thoughtful essays, commentaries, and critiques, fury has led. And, as after 9/11, why wouldn’t it? Who is not moved by suffering, or does not want to be resolute in opposing violence?

There is a rub, though. Strip the veneer of liberation, and an enthusiasm for punishment is palpable. Look beyond declarations of revolution, and there is an under-analyzed conception of patriarchy. Take seriously the argument that any social conflict will have winners and losers, and there remain cavernous, unplumbed realities of loss. Look squarely at the presumption of guilt in light of experience, at the bundling of diverse behaviors under the rubric of sexual abuse, at emboldened efforts to drop statutes of limitation, and the zeitgeist feels like sex panic.

Exponents of #MeToo bridle at the term. After Daphne Merkin worried in the Times over waves of accusation, and Mimi Kramer called her “a beard for covert anti-feminism” probably put up to it by a man (“That’s Dean Baquet [Times executive editor] trying to muddy the waters, no?”), other voices rose to preempt talk of sex panic, which they promptly mischaracterized. So, a definition: A sex panic, or moral panic, is a social eruption fanned by the media and characterized by alarm over innocence (stereotypically, white women and children) imperiled. The predator is a lurking, shape-shifting social presence, a menace against which the populace must be mobilized—and has been since at least the “white slavery” panic of the 1880s–1910s, but almost continuously since the mid-20th century.

That politics of fear has not been trivial. Examples range from the fever over (homo)”sexual psychopaths” (1950s) to serial rages since the late 1960s against: sex education; gay “sex rings,” teachers, and threats to family; “stranger danger”; Crime!; Porn!; satanic ritual abuse in day care; sexual abuse dug up from “memory”; AIDS predators; “superpredators”; Internet predators; Sex Offenders as a separate category of human being; “pedophile priests”; campus date rape.

Whether formulated for political organizing (the right’s “Save Our Children”), or inflated/concocted from real claims (the priest scandal), or entirely concocted (the day-care frenzy), or fueled by exaggerated statistics and unstable definitions (the college “hunting ground”), these panics have shared features. Sex figures as a preternatural danger, emotion swamps reason, monsters abound, and protection demands any sacrifice.	

Garbed as justice, accusations become moral lessons of Good’s triumph over Evil.

Sex panic reverses the order that governs law, where, formally at least, innocence is presumed. In panic, the stories are all true, and the accused are guilty by default. Law having been declared a flawed tool for achieving justice—as, indeed, it is—“naming and shaming” takes its place. Garbed as justice, accusations become moral lessons of Good’s triumph over Evil; they thus become increasingly difficult to question. Their proliferation becomes proof of legitimacy. Victims are encouraged to “Speak your truth.” Everyone else is commanded, “Believe.”

Typically, panic generates another story, written in the language of law, resuscitated as a sturdy instrument of justice, reinforcing repressive power but protecting the rest of us from monsters… until the next panic.

In Sex Panic and the Punitive State, anthropologist Roger Lancaster examines these mass convulsions alongside the expansion of state violence. That hydra’s head is unpleasant to behold, more so when cries of the oppressed have been used to feed it. Liberals and feminists stirred many of these panics and have deployed an inflammatory language that they would mock were it coming from the right. Here, Oprah’s emergence as presidential dream prospect was overdetermined. There “is a dark evil pervading our country,” she railed in 2008 over Internet strangers lurking to destroy children. “What you are going to see will shock you to the core.” Earlier she had launched Oprah’s Child Predator Watch List. During the satanic panic, her show entertained hair-raising lies about day care, and in 1991 she pushed the “Oprah Bill” while, based on such lies, scores of blameless souls languished in prison or clung to the wreckage of their lives. President Clinton signed the bill, which established a national database of convicted child abusers for checking up on day-care providers.

The language, the lists, the insouciance about false accusations… As a nation we have been shocked to the core, only to be shocked repeatedly, and to feel as fearful and powerless as ever.

The repetition should disturb us. As citizens of the biggest prison state, the leading exporter of violence, we should consider how even arguments against violence may be colonized by it. When Wendy Kaminer, Zephyr Teachout, Masha Gessen, and others warned about the indifference to due process, women from Socialist Worker to The Washington Post scoffed. Ana Marie Cox in the Post: “The courts aren’t where our national conversation is taking place so let’s not dither about the dangers of proclaiming guilt or innocence.”

That ignores the way culture and social attitudes bleed into the law, shape policy, define guilt and innocence, and determine punishment beyond the borders of any particular discussion. It ignores the crippling of due process and the ratcheting up of criminalization in all contexts across decades of serial panic. Clinton’s grotesque 1994 crime bill did not occur in a vacuum; folding the Violence Against Women Act into it was calculated co-optation. Michelle Alexander is right; no claim to conscience can ignore the realities of carceral politics. Sex panic ignores them all the time.

Some 70 million people, nearly one-third of US adults, have a criminal record, by FBI statistics. Since the 1980s, the rate has spiked. Some 50 percent of black men and 40 percent of white men are arrested by age 23. Women and girls are hardly immune. As the Brennan Center for Justice puts it, “If all arrested Americans were a nation, they would be the world’s 18th largest…. Holding hands, [they] could circle the earth three times.”

The War on Drugs accounted for much of this. The War on Sex (as noted in an excellent recent anthology by that name) now drives the fastest-growing imprisoned population. That war has standardized irredeemable existence. Some 860,000 people who have completed their sentence are Registered Sex Offenders, social exiles for whom daily life is absorbed by punishment and shame. Many were put on the list as juveniles.

Progressives used to distrust “zero tolerance,” a term that just got a face-lift. Some snapshots of its real face are in order. In 2008, police were called because Randy Castro, 6, had swatted a female classmate’s butt; sexual harassment was written into his school record. In 2015, a school threatened to press sexual-harassment charges against a 9-year-old boy for writing notes to a classmate; one said “I like you” in a scrawled heart. In 2010, Palm Beach County police arrested a 5-year-old boy for sexual battery because he kissed the buttocks and penis of another 5-year-old.	

As citizens of the biggest prison state, we should consider how even arguments against violence may be colonized by it.

Nothing says patriarchy like the police state.

We had adjoining rooms at a hostel and didn’t lock the doors. We had talked for years about politics, race, earthly pleasures too. We had never spoken about our mutual attraction, but when I went to his bed one night unbidden I felt certain he would not object, and he did not. In a thousand ways we had signaled desire, and I would not have thought him presumptuous if he’d come to my bed. But only I could feel so unthinkingly insulated from the risk of miscalculation, being young and female and white, whiter then than now.

Young activists raising the banner of #MeToo did not make this world of punishment and fear. But every human alive is responsible to history. We inherit it, and will bequeath whatever it is we do with it.

It should be impossible to think of sex and accusation and not think about race. History grabs back. White America lynched some 4,000 black people, mostly men, from 1877 to 1968. Ida B. Wells documented the worst years. The rape of a white woman rationalized all vigilantism, but, she reported, two-thirds of those killed were not accused of this “outrage upon the community.” Murder was a more frequent accusation, but lynching’s apologists did not shout, “They’re killing our men!” One might consider how unstable the white man’s sense of his worth must have been; also how anti-miscegenation law emboldened this weak but vicious whiteness to become its enforcer. Any affectional alliance between a white woman and a black man was an outrage. A white man’s rape of a white woman was not, and black women had no rights that anyone need respect.

Wells determined that black power, not sex, was the real outrage: growing prosperity after Reconstruction, and the suspicion that a black man’s control of his own property and family and destiny might impinge on the white man’s destiny, power, and property, including his woman. The woman was hemmed in but not entirely powerless. She had only to say she’d been touched, as with Emmett Till. For the man or boy condemned, the accusation was the ultimate power; for the woman, in terms of what she could make of her own life, it was largely an illusion of power.

I expect that progressives today presume that all those white women were lying. Carolyn Bryant was in the Till case; she admitted it, as we learned last year. At her husband’s trial, Bryant had testified, “I was just scared to death.” Young Emmett didn’t scare her, but her husband may have.

It’s understandable that we should now not only disbelieve every accuser from that time but recoil at the suggestion of individual complexity. Discernment vanishes in a context where every accusation led to death.

So, here’s a problem: What if even one white woman was telling the truth?

It is a terrible question, not because it would justify the punishment—nothing could do that—but because it wouldn’t matter. Where every black man was guilty, truth was irrelevant, falsehood was irrelevant; justice was impossible, whether delivered by a court or a mob. It is reckless to forget that logic now, even if the stakes for the accused bear no resemblance, even if the headline predator is white and high on the hog.	

“You have to be able to understand how systems of oppression connect.” —Barbara Smith, co-founder of the Combahee River Collective

And what was justice for the black woman whom nobody believed? What is it now wherever the hydra-head of violence is interpersonal, is racial, is economic, is state policy? One in four women, one in two black women, loves someone in prison. One in eight women, one in five black women, lives in poverty—economic violence that makes every other kind more likely. It’s not an accident that experiments in restorative justice emerged from these communities. It’s not an accident that Tarana Burke invented the idiom “Me Too” working in the thick of life with women and girls of color. Burke’s “Me Too” was a tool for helping them talk about experience and engage the compound realities of their life with clarity and confidence. Its viral presence is said to symbolize a resurgent feminism. What does this mean?

Feminism has taken many shapes. In 1977, black radical and lesbian feminists issued the Combahee River Collective Statement. One of its authors, Barbara Smith, reiterated the collective’s ethos last fall: “You can’t work on one vector of oppression and think you’re going to solve whatever problem you’re addressing. You have to be able to understand how systems of oppression connect.” What conversations might we be having now if Combahee’s analysis of power—rooted in the black woman’s interrelated experiences of production, reproduction, and violence—had for 40 years been standard feminist analysis? If this black radical vision of sexuality, solidarity, and human liberation had entered all radical analysis?

The might have been is unanswerable. So much got in the way. Sexism, racism, homophobia, backlash. Among history’s legacies, there is another, related: the path that some white feminists and liberals took in the 1970s, and where their best intentions for supporting crime victims led. The roadbed they laid would be paved and posted “Victims’ Rights” by enraged citizen groups, law-and-order advocates, and policy-makers bent not only on the privatization of public interests but on dressing up racist projects in the name of safe streets, safe families, safe women and children.

The sympathetic aspect of the victim obscured the movement’s essential function: to assert vengeance as a social good. Consider now how far along that path we’ve traveled: how normal it is to speak of “victims” (rather than “accusers”); how expected are victim testimony, victim involvement in prosecutions; how widespread is the view that a criminal trial is not about impartially determining facts but about enlisting state power for the satisfaction of the aggrieved individual. Consider, finally, how placidly we are meant to nod our heads at sentencing as a victim or victim’s family wishes suffering upon a person who is convicted; how righteous a sentence of 60—no, 100, no, 235, no, 360—years is made to seem; how lightly we are meant to laugh at jokes about prisoners being raped.

Responsibility to history requires that we attend to its surprises. South Carolina’s anti-lynching law was supposed to target racist violence; in 2003, 69 percent of its targets were black men.

When I saw Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, people in the theater voiced approval as Mildred Hayes, the antihero seeking the resolution of her daughter’s rape and murder, tells the police chief:

    
If it was me, I’d start up a database, every male baby was born, stick ‘em on it, and as soon as he done something wrong, cross-reference it, make 100 percent certain it was a correct match, then kill him.

Mildred’s speech captures the wild agony of a parent whose child has been annihilated. The audience reaction was a souvenir of how much society has abdicated its responsibility in bowing to revenge.

I was a temp, sharing the office with the secretary of my boss’s second in command. She had been there for years. Her boss screamed from across the hall, “Get in here, you old cow” or “fat sow.” Farm-animal slurs. I told him his language was vile and complained to my boss, who must have stifled him, at least while I was there. My office mate told me to ease off. “He’s a good man,” she said. “When my mother died, he gave me three days off; he didn’t have to do that.”

Main­stream discourse separates the anti-harassment campaign from work’s full reality, which is to say capitalism.

Humiliation was the secretary’s daily work experience. Her boss was a sexist, but his cruelties were not sexual; they were part of a terribly ordinary structure. In that structure, a hand on the butt or an explicit joke or even the boss flashing his dick is the least of it. That is an indictment, not a justification. In that structure, three days to grieve is a blessing. What do we see when we inspect the hydra-head of the working day? When we look unblinking at the embodied experience of people—men, women, trans—wherever they belong to a workforce under control?

For the boss who does the controlling—who need not be a man—sexual harassment is one tool. Humiliation, inventively variegated, is another. Physical danger, overwork, layoffs, are others. Their aim: discipline, profit. Their form: assaults on body, mind, spirit.

An insurance adjuster is assigned to train the low-wage worker who will displace him. An electrician who smokes reefer picks up a flask of urine from his brother each morning and straps it to his body to keep warm in case he’s picked for a random drug test. A farmworker prunes citrus in the heat with no water, no shade, no toilets or washing facilities. An industrial-laundry worker sorts sheets stained with semen, blood, and shit, then must suffer captive-audience harangues because she wants a union. An office cleaner must work so fast “you can’t work anymore.” A nanny is raped, then fired by the rapist’s wife. (The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates 43,380 workplace rapes and sexual assaults a year.) A mechanic is ordered to crawl into a toxic-chemical tank to make a repair for which he’s not trained; he dies. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports 5,190 fatal workplace injuries in 2016, up 7 percent from 2015.) An exotic dancer walks barefoot down a stairway strewn with glass. A 14-year-old ballet dancer works in pain. (The BLS reports 2.9 million nonfatal injuries and illnesses for 2016.) A food co-op manager is murdered by an enraged worker. A beautician is murdered by her husband. (The BLS reports 500 homicides, up 19.9 percent.) A medical-supply worker grows faint from the glue used to make artificial-kidney hoses and is exposed to a carcinogen. (At least 53,000 workers die each year from occupation-related illnesses, a UC Davis study estimated.) A waitress develops blood clots. A recycler loses his leg. (The BLS reports 892,276 severe injuries or illnesses requiring days off.) An autoworker does mandatory 12-hour shifts; her younger part-time and precarious co-worker loses his mind. (The BLS reports suicides up 27 percent.) A female manager is shut out of all-boys planning meetings. A university tradesman says the professoriate makes him feel subhuman. A day laborer is never sure he’ll be paid if he’s picked for a job. A chicken processor stands in cold water all day. A prisoner works for nothing. A deputy warden sits in the parking lot wondering, “How can I do this another day?” Salma Hayek asks for Hollywood women, “Why do we have to fight tooth and nail to maintain our dignity?”

Hayek’s exquisite insulation notwithstanding, those real-work experiences are not intended to draw tearful sentiment. Workers in any struggle inevitably say, “It’s about dignity.” It’s about being used, and used up; it’s about life versus the depletion of the working day.

“I Am a Man,” striking sanitation workers asserted in Memphis in 1968, welding a rejection of racism and economic and physical exploitation. Activists like Saru Jayaraman, Ai-jen Poo, Ellen Bravo, and others have long added gender and sexuality to that. Mainstream discourse borrows the anti-harassment piece but separates it from work’s full reality, which is to say capitalism. The result is a pinched, again privileged, conception of power. If sex in the workplace were the sole measure of dignity, strawberry pickers who haven’t been sexually harassed should be happy agents of their destiny, sex workers who control the terms of their trade should be ruins, and 26,400 Hewlett-Packard workers discarded by Carly Fiorina should have had no problem.	
.

He was my professor. He kissed like a dream. I met him at a bar. I agreed to go to his house. I recall aquavit, “Sun Goddess” on the stereo. I was too drunk to walk home, and he too drunk to drive. I was surprised to wake up beside him because I had gone to bed alone. He offered to make breakfast and then to make love. It was tempting, but I was a hungover virgin and the room was ringed with photos of his estranged wife. Maybe she was not so estranged. Breakfast sounded nice. I learned recently that he still teaches, and wondered, dismally, “Were I to tell this story differently, might I ruin him?”

I don’t think I was lucky my professor was not a rapist, and I was not alarmed. College women were not naive to the risk of violence in those days, the mid-1970s. We walked together at night, and either signed up for self-defense training or shared tips on kicking, gouging, or otherwise disabling assailants. We’d come up watching westerns—also rebellions that exposed a nation hooked on violence and inequity. We were living at the cusp of the liberationist ’60s and the fear-jacked backlash. We understood independence brought risk. I gravitated to classes taught by women and men for whom freedom and the guises of unfreedom were weighty questions. Sexuality was part of the political territory everyone was negotiating. We were encouraged to explore desire, not to say yes. I was stupid to get drunk that night, as was the professor—as are people generally—but we weren’t playing a game of blindman’s buff.

#MeToo has put ambiguous sexual interactions and harassment in the same box. This is not a #MeToo story (my history of assault involves stickups with weapons for small change). It’s an awkward story about pleasure and hoped-for pleasure, and ultimately about honesty and eggs.

Like all stories, it exists in a social context. There, reality has many dimensions. People are worked by orders but also make decisions, and sex (not just for heterosexuals, who have dominated this discussion) is complicated: by personality and socialization, by class and race, by concepts of what is “normal,” what is “dirty” or “hot,” and by anyone’s experience of repression and desire.	

It’s been a long time since we’ve practiced what Herukhuti calls “grassroots organizing in [the] bedroom.”

What doesn’t alarm one might alarm another, but before asserting, “This isn’t about sex, it’s about power,” let’s confront that cliché’s central evasion. Because, clearly, while a boss imposing sex is about power, and rape is about power, what keeps tumbling out of the closets is also some pretty bad sex. And because bad sex often involves unsorted anxieties and lacunae about who we are and how we engage with others, to say that it’s beside the point is to say that we, storm-tossed persons, are, too.

Why, in these ambiguous stories, are the men so insecure and inept? Why are the women so pliable and prone to freezing in place? Sex therapists say temporarily freezing is a common human response, but going limp is no more desirable than being a self-centered clod. Speaking up can be arduous. That isn’t the answer, it’s the question. How do people practice sexual consciousness, confidence?

The monster/victim script forecloses that conversation. The personal story as public fodder does, too. Cornered in a false debate between belief and blame, it leaves room for nothing but silence or rage.

Being fiction, Kristen Roupenian’s popular, if superficial, story from The New Yorker, “Cat Person,” at least allows interpretation. The male character is a cardboard monster by the end. Before that, he is mainly awkward, fat, hairy—an ugly man like Weinstein, like so many men in the initial lineup of monsters—traits the reader is enlisted not to ponder but to rebel against. Why? One could scarcely imagine that such “ugliness” could be beauty for a vast gay subculture, or that the beauty trap might also stunt men. The woman is lithe, aware of her perfect body if nothing else. Neither sees the other. Sexually aggressive, she is also terrified. Sexually obtuse, he is a boor. Post-coitus, she wants to slither away; he wants to watch TV. The story should have ended at their first awful kiss. Simply asserting that women are conditioned to say yes—a response to similar, nonfiction accounts of bad kisses, bad dates, bad sex—skirts the problem that neither person seems equipped with sensual intelligence. Why? Is virtual communication anesthetizing? Has the long night of sex panic—shadowing generations, along with 9/11 and war—begot a kind of sexual nihilism?

Sex exists in personal and political time. Perhaps the hydra-head of fear looms larger, and more insidiously, than public discussion so far has allowed.

My stories here, vestiges from a time before sex panic became permanent, are messy, not simple. What besides backlash happened to the sexual revolution? Capitalism bit down, absorbed the liberationist impulse, mass-produced the sex but everywhere devalued education, manifold reality; and liberationist forces were too besieged or internally at odds to withstand it. What remains is a simulacrum of freedom: at one end, the ultimate symbols of marketable feminine sexuality protesting objectification; at the other, legions of ordinary joes opening e-mails urging, “Get bigger, last longer, become the beast she always wanted.” In between is only more dissonance, including TV sex as no-foreplay gladiatorial combat initiated by powerful female characters created by a powerful female producer.

As a dream-path to a world of peace and equality, the sexual revolution would always be constrained by the contradictions of the society that birthed it. The great diversity of human personality could be forgotten in assumptions about how “freedom” should feel. Yet getting free was a serious project. Gay liberation seized on it. Women’s liberation did too, until anti-sex feminists marched into a cul-de-sac, and radical analyses of pleasure and danger were sidelined. Straight men as a group never challenged the snares of masculinity; like others, they got what the activist sex therapist Leonore Tiefer calls “permission without real knowledge, real understanding, like people have in other domains of their life.”

So much of what we call sex, Tiefer says, is actually “about training, common sense, attention. Sex glamorizes things that are everyday. It makes something the best or worst experience, but the doing of it and the script in your head make it so. It’s not the thing itself, it’s the meaning of the thing. It exists in consequences of actions. It exists in interpretation. So when does coercion come in? As opposed to persuasion, as opposed to opportunity. It’s not so easy. If we could figure that out without calling it ‘sexual,’ we’d be getting somewhere.”

It’s been a long time since we’ve practiced what the sexologist/cultural polymath Dr. Herukhuti calls “grassroots organizing in [the] bedroom.” Since we’ve dug into the sensual. Since we’ve studied songs of freedom. So much of the culture teaches us to be afraid or ashamed, instead. Sex can’t be abstracted from that culture, any more than sexual violence can be abstracted from other systems of violence. Consequences of action, all of them, matter. The politics of Good and Evil leaves only righteousness and shame. Complex humanity evaporates in shame, and we’re back in the Garden, stitching fig leaves into garments.

The app is almost done, but we just lost our backend guy. The only backend left to do is the user management (login/registration). Because I listed Ruby as one of the languages I have used, they asked me if I could try to figure out so we can stay on our timeline, which is to submit the app to the app/play store by Friday. I foolishly accepted the task, because I figured how hard could it be? I know a good amount of Ruby, but I have never used Rails before.

When looking for resources on rails based authentication (because the rest of the backend is rails), I stumbled upon a gem called Devise, and it seems to be one of the more popular methods. When reading the docs, it mentioned that if you haven't used Rails before, they advise against using Devise, and recommend building an auth system from scratch instead.

How screwed am I? Is it realistic for me to pull this off, or should I just tell them to find someone else? If I try, but fail, we're gonna miss our deadline, and it will be my fault, but if I can somehow pull this off, it will look good on me, and I really want that.

I've been programming for 3 years, so it's not like I'm a complete beginner. Started as a web dev, and my knowledge consists of html/css, js and several variations of jsx, python, ruby, and C. Strongest in python and react.

Thoughts? Advice? Links/resources? Would love to hear it. I need to make a decision soon before I make myself look bad.

I figure it's probably fine just to use any DAW that works for me, but I recently saw a film composer speaking and he was using Logic, which is one DAW I don't know how to use. I use Ableton for most of what I do and Pro Tools when there's heavier audio editing. I love working in midi, so i'm really not interested in working in Pro Tools exclusively.

I am now wondering whether I should replace Pro Tools and start working in Logic. I just figure if i'm hoping to get intern type work with a film composer I will need to know the software, and if Logic is more common among these people I should be learning it ahead of time.

It also looked like a really brilliant UI, is obviously very powerful and has lots to offer, and seems to be better with composing to vision than Ableton (which is terrible at that but great at most other things IMO).

8es2ks,1,2018-04-25,How We Got a 32% Organic Traffic Boost from 4 On-Page SEO Changes [Case Study],bea12345,arte,https://www.reddit.com/r/arte/comments/8es2ks/how_we_got_a_32_organic_traffic_boost_from_4/,"Posted by [WallStreetOasis.com](/%22https://moz.com/community/users/301532/%22)

My name is Patrick Curtis, and I'm the founder and CEO of [Wall Street Oasis](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/), an online community focused on careers in finance founded in 2006 with over 2 million visits per month.

User-generated content and long-tail organic traffic is what has built our business and community over the last 12+ years. But what happens if you wake up one day and realize that your growth has suddenly stopped? This is what happened to us back in November 2012.

In this case study, I’ll highlight two of our main SEO problems as a large forum with over 200,000 URLs, then describe two solutions that finally helped us regain our growth trajectory — almost five years later.

Two main problems
-----------------

### 1. Algorithm change impacts

 Ever since November 2012, [Google’s algo changes](https://moz.com/learn/seo/google-panda) have seemed to hurt many online forums like ours. Even though our traffic didn’t decline, our growth dropped to the single-digit percentages. No matter what we tried, we couldn’t break through our “plateau of pain” (I call it that because it was a painful ~5 years trying).

### 2. Quality of user-generated content

Related to the first problem, 99% of our content is user-generated (UGC) which means the quality is mixed (to put it kindly). Like most forum-based sites, some of our members create incredible pieces of content, but a meaningful percentage of our content is also admittedly thin and/or low-quality.

How could we deal with over 200,000 pieces of content efficiently and try to optimize them without going bankrupt? How could we “[clean the cruft](https://moz.com/blog/clean-site-cruft-before-it-causes-ranking-problems-whiteboard-friday)” when there was just so much of it?

Fighting back: Two solutions (and one statistical analysis to show how it worked)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. ""Merge and Purge"" project

Our goal was to consolidate weaker “children” URLs into stronger “master” URLs to utilize some of the valuable content Google was ignoring and to make the user experience better.

For example, instead of having ~20 discussions on a specific topic (each with an average of around two to three comments) across twelve years, we would consolidate many of those discussions into the strongest two or three URLs (each with around 20–30 comments), leading to a much better user experience with less need to search and jump around the site.

Changes included taking the original post and comments from a “child” URL and merging them into the “master” URL, unpublishing the child URL, removing the child from sitemap, and adding a 301 redirect to the master.

Below is an example of how it looked when we merged a child into our popular [Why Investment Banking](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/why-investment-banking-0) discussion. We highlighted the original child post as a Related Topic with a blue border and included the original post date to help avoid confusion:

This was a massive project that involved some complex Excel sorting, but after 18 months and about $50,000 invested (27,418 children merged into 8,515 masters to date), the user experience, site architecture, and organization is much better.

Initial analysis suggests that the percentage gain from merging weak children URLs into stronger masters has given us a **boost of ~10–15% in organic search traffic.**

### 2. The Content Optimization Team

The goal of this initiative was to take the top landing pages that already existed on Wall Street Oasis and make sure that they were both higher quality _and_optimized for SEO. What does that mean, exactly, and how did we execute it?

We needed a dedicated team that had some baseline industry knowledge. To that end, we formed a team of five interns from the community, due to the fact that they were familiar with the common topics.

 We looked at the top ~200 URLs over the previous 90 days (by organic landing page traffic) and listed them out in a spreadsheet:

We held five main hypotheses of what we believed would boost organic traffic before we started this project:

  1. **Longer content with subtitles:**Increasing the length of the content and adding relevant H2 and H3 subtitles to give the reader more detailed and useful information in an organized fashion.
  2. **Changing the H1**so that it matched more high-volume keywords using Moz’s [Keyword Explorer](https://moz.com/explorer).
  3. **Changing the URL**so that it also was a better match to high-volume and relevant keywords.
  4. **Adding a relevant image or graphic**to help break up large “walls of text” and enrich the content.
  5. **Adding a relevant video**similar to the graphic, but also to help increase time on page and enrich the content around the topic.

We tracked all five of these changes across all 200 URLs (see image above). After a [statistical analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Df0p4ZQs17P2E9oYtlVSGrIJKlOzKe7z2UEk4wihYpY/edit?usp=sharing), we learned that four of them helped our organic search traffic and one actually hurt.

### Summary of results from our statistical analysis

  - Increasing the length of the articles and adding relevant subtitles (H2s, H3s, and H4s) to help organize the content gives an **average boost to organic traffic of 14%**
  - Improving the title or H1 of the URLs yields a **9% increase on average**
  - Changing the URL _decreased_traffic on average by 38% (this was a smaller sample size — we stopped doing this early on for obvious reasons)
  - Including a relevant video **increases the organic traffic by 4% on average**, while putting an image up **increases it by 5% on average.**

Overall, the boost to organic traffic — should we continue to make these four changes (and avoid changing the URL) — is 32% on average.

Key takeaway:
-------------

Over half of that gain (~18%) comes from changes that require a minimal investment of time. For teams trying to optimize on-page SEO across a large number of pages, we recommend focusing on the top landing pages first and easy wins before deciding if further investment is warranted.

8esvzj,403,2018-04-25,HORSEPANTS Chen QoL/talent suggestions (what he really needs imo) *LONG*,HORSEPANTSU,heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/8esvzj/horsepants_chen_qoltalent_suggestions_what_he/,"Hello.  I like Chen here's proof: https://i.imgur.com/8CJP2CB.png

He's my favorite hero in the game and I've been playing him since alpha.  I've played every iteration of Chen.

The thing about Chen is his kit is broken.  5 second CDs, on demand massive shield, AoE damage that can wave clear, crazy mobility, two strong ultimates.   His design is to punish low mobility heroes, that's his niche so he should never be too strong or picked a ton.  That being said I believe he has one critical flaw that has been annoying me more and more as new heroes come out and the game has got faster.

&amp;nbsp;

**What Chen truly needs**

&amp;nbsp;

With new heroes, more mobility being added, etc., I think there is a simple change that he needs that isn't numbers or talents.  One thing I notice as a hardcore Chen player.

His W, and especially his E animations are way too fucking long.  Especially together.   Seriously, the biggest issue I always run into are his animations.  

I'm solo laning again sonya.  I walk up to combo harass her/wave.  W &gt; she fucking spears me, Ws me, autos me, &gt; i get to E and maybe auto her.  I lost.

I drink for 3+ seconds for max shield, W &gt; oh shit I can't E because if I do the animation will play and I can't drink in time and it's not worth me losing a 800 + shield to do 300 damage &gt; drink &gt; okay not under threat &gt; E &gt;.  You need to drink for like 3.5 + seconds until you can safely combo and retain your shield which is key to Chen.  It gets even worse if you Q to a target because that takes up shield time too.

Oh shit I'm gonna walk up to W &gt; E you.  Okay I W you at max range &gt; press E as fast as possibly, &gt; you backing up literally caused you to be out of E range betimes W went off my E is out of range.  So now I have to W at max range &gt; pause to move forward &gt; E you

Oh shit you guessed it gonna walk up to W &gt; E you again.  Walk up W you &gt; retreat because during the W animation you got into my safe space and now I need to retreat because if I dare play the E animation you'll make me extinct and all I did was 300 damage

Okay Jaina my natural food she's like bamboo can't move Q to her &gt; W &gt; oh fuck CCed to the next dimension couldn't E in time &gt; have to spend 3.5 seconds drinking to build max shield to safely reengage.  Okay noones around to help jaina Q &gt; W &gt; iceblock &gt; E &gt; oh shit can't melt that ice &gt; drink depression away then reengage.

Even things like ETC W can stop W/E and put it on cooldown just ruining the combo.

I can go on and on.  A key part of this hero is maintaing you built up shield, and comboing to harass/damage.  But all of these new heroes can punish you harder and quicker before you can even combo. Chen almost always fucking loses trades because he spends .5~ seconds doing his combo.  It's a low CD combo hero that feels slow and like he constantly lags himself for minimal effects due to the nature of his low CDs.  Meanwhile Genji can E on top of you &gt; shuriken &gt; auto &gt; parry/shuriken, all in the time it takes Chen to even play his E animation let alone combo.

This buff would be massive, because currently Chen's optimal combo is this: auto &gt; W &gt; auto &gt; E &gt; auto. But if I just want to do safe damage/CC from a small range with a quick W &gt; E because that other combo isn't an option due to how long it takes I usually can't because I'll get punished for even starting the combo.  So I don't even attempt that, I just drink a max shield then try to approach after 4 seconds of drinking so I can approach &gt; W &gt; E &gt; drink again to maintain the shield so I don't get deleted.  With this change he would have a lot less downtime and feel like a smooth combo hero that has more safe options than he currently has (which is showing the enemy you drank your dad's beer for 3-4 seconds and now you're approaching with a big ass shield cause if you didn't do that they would just trade and win).  A low CD hero shouldn't have so much goddamn lag.

&amp;nbsp;

**Talent changes (not really needed/the point of this thread, but going to dump thoughts while I'm on the topic skip if you want)**

&amp;nbsp;

Above is what I think he really needs before anything else.  That being said, with the recent changes to some talents he's getting into a better spot so these changes could help diversify the builds.

* Make elusive brawler baseline.  Even though other talents with the buffs are kinda approaching its spot, this ability alleviates some issues Chen sees now that more ways to CC him during his trait are in the game.  Elusive brawler gives him active damage mitigation which he can use when he sees an incoming interruption, or allows him to make an aggressive play.  If you're too slow, you are still punished.  If you activate it on time, you mitigated SOME punishment and now it's on a long cooldown.  The only way to get it back is to get in and auto a ton, meaning he won't be gaining shields/brew.  It has some skill too it, fixes some future/current weaknesses, and has a fair way to recharge/punishing way to recharge it back.

* Level 1:

 * Freshest Ingredients: 30 globes for a real reward is way too fucking much.  1 hp regen per globe isn't enough.  Needs to take less globals or have a 15 reward

 * Acumulator flame:  Make it based on duration enemies are on fire instead of enemies.  Could make it easier for him to pick this talent when he's solo lane.  This isn't desperately needed just an idea.

 * Add a new talent if you do make elusive baseline.  If not well the other two options won't get picked that much regardless of what you do xD

* Level 4:

 * These are fine imo

* Level 7:

 * Remove Bolder Flavor, put it on something else.  I used to think Brewmasters Balance was needed, and I would have argued for it being baseline because it is fun managing his brew for buffs, but they proved with purifying brew that it's possible to use this tier to change Chen's core gameplay a bit.  Bolder flavor has no place now that the other option give him AP/relentless.  It gives him the damage mitigation you'd want from bolder but just better.  While BB gives you a faster/hit n run/regen playstyle.  I think they should put bolder flavor onto Freshest Ingredients or Enough to share somehow.  

 * It's in this awkward position where the instant shield/duration doesn't justify losing AP/AP during shield/CC removal, and its instant shield for faster gameplay doesn't outshine the regen/MS from BB.  Yet its idea works well with deadly strike and the fact he gains an instant 30 brew nowadays.  Obviously they could buff it but I'd like to see it spice up his talent diversity since I think the immobile AP shielding playstyle vs. mobile regen playstyle works well with his other talents and he doesn't need another option here.


* Level 10:

 * These are both good ults imo

* Level 13:

 * Pressure Point:  Change this shit.  You're slowing to slow.  You don't slow you do weak slow.  To slow to slow you have to get close to slow to slow.  You jump to slow but you were already going to slow to E.  Now I don't want the range increase at 16.  Old PP was too strong, and if it was like old PP a touch of honey would suck.  I don't have any real suggestions at the time but make it play with the style of his level 4 talent somehow.  This talent's design is dicks.

 * A Touch of Honey:  This is fine.  Works well with toss/Another round

 * Withering Flames: For some fucking reason, Blizzard had this neat talent before his rework that would increase the range/arc of his E.  It even had a unique animation an intern had to slave over.  It sucked because well all it did was increase the range/arc of his E, and his other talents didn't help.  My suggestion is to bring this back and put it into this talent.  This would make it so when you take Keg toss/acumulator, you could actually fucking ignite the backline safely and apply this spell power reduction to a goddamn mage/backline.  Atm you can apply this to 1/2 targets at best, and betimes you do the enemy/backline probably already casted.  This talent would also benefit from the animation speed increase.  Obviously the duration/numbers/other things might need changed to balance it out.

Currently 13 is the worst tier because a touch of honey turns your W into a real slow vs. taking low duration hard to hit on the right target debuff/a touch of honey's retarded single targeted cousin

* Level 16: 

 * Flying Leap:  This is fine.  I think if PP was changed somehow this would be spicier.  Maybe buff back to 20 percent since you let diablo charge all the way from Africa and Blaze to dash his way to the Olympics.  But yeah fine

 * Another Round:  This is fine and fun.  Opens up a plethora of playstyles for the hero.  Honestly one of the most fun talents/option opening talents in the game.  Can W &gt; E  spam to keep E reduction/ap reduction going.  W &gt; Q so 2 second CD kick.  If PP was good you could choose between this or range.  Or W &gt; W &gt; W &gt; W and become donkey kong with keg toss.  If anything I'd make this baseline just because of how much fun it is but that's just me having fun.

 * Enough to Share:  I used to think this is hot garbage but turns out giving your team a constant 100 shields/effective healing a second at 16 is strong.  It literally makes chen do something than just CC himself for benefits.  He does something for his team while drinking, good against poke.  Think this is fine for the moment.

* Level 20:

 * Think his ult upgrades are fine.  Maybe SEF a tiny bit too strong.  Stormstout secret recipe I think needs a slight buff.  Maybe add a new option since the removal of puryfing here.

&amp;nbsp;


**Final thoughts**

&amp;nbsp;

All of these changes are recommended to increase his ingame options and to build upon what he already has.  The crucial first changes (W/E animations faster) would just make the hero more enjoyable to play, and wouldn't make him as weak to newer heroes.

The talent changes were suggested to increase diversity.  Chen has really good talents, infact a joke is Chen is the worst hero with the best talents.  Just elusive is too strong for level 1 unless nerfed to the ground.  13 needs work.  Could open options since the hero has so many diverse talents that literally change his playstyle.

His numbers can be adjusted after his core issues are fixed to compensate for any changes.

&amp;nbsp;



tl;dr: Improve W/E animations so he can combo smoothly and not drop shield and not get super punished while he CCs himself for a 25 percent slow 300 damage 2 ability thing thanks.  There was more but that's the most important thing.

 Edit***

I know acumualtor and bolder were picked in HGC.  I've been going accum myself a bit.  Talent suggestions are just optional thoughts.  I can be wrong, this is just how I feel about the hero as of recently and I'm open to changing my thoughts if there's a good argument.

I am a French student in IT engineering, willing to move -again- in Estonia next year. I already spent 5 months in Tallinn during an Erasmus academic semester and really enjoyed this adventure! Now some questions are getting through my mind. I already found some materials online about legislation, saying that it is not mandatory to pay an intern, and saw a Reddit thread saying that not speaking Estonian is okay to work in some fields (at least the first months), as long as you speak fluent English. I also know that Estonia is willing to hire more engineers in IT sectors.

My questions are : what are the tendencies regarding end of studies internships and pre-employment? Are employers willing to pay a long-term intern ? Is the concept of ""pre-employment"" accurate for interns, meaning that you could take an intern and hope to hire him at the end of his work placement?

I'd be looking for a 6 months internship in an IT/new technologies company, for a Product Management / QA Engineering / Pre-Sales Engineering / Project Management job. I already have about 5 work experiences in various areas (IT architect, Business Developer, ToIP engineering...), meaning that I am globally looking for a ""real"" job, but under the name of ""internship"" :-)
(Edit: This will basically end my studies and I will graduate as an engineer right after this work placement)

I have generalist IT skills, i.e. various programming languages (C/Java/Python/.NET), data science, computer networks, ToIP, electronics, IoT, pre-sales, business developement... Some are academic, some have been learned during internships, and therefore are more valuable. For instance, I don't have a developer profile nor am I an expert (yet!). Any idea about the salary I can expect as an intern, and then as a junior engineering, with my profile?


Suur aitäh for your help guys!

8eu9fy,1,2018-04-25,Chances that it's a rebound / overall thoughts,idontfeelanymore,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/8eu9fy/chances_that_its_a_rebound_overall_thoughts/,"Okay, so I know it doesn't matter because at the end of the day she left me whether it's for someone else or not but I need to put this thought to rest.

Background: Me - 22M; Her - 21F, always stressed or complaining, has anxiety, cannot communicate (she has a hard time verbalizing her thoughts)
 
We were together for 2 years but were actually dating for a little over 1 year. BEFORE we actually started dating she tried cutting it off because she was too dependent on me for her happiness so anytime we were apart she was unhappy; she thought what was best for was to be on her own so she could grow and be happy with herself (how I wish i listened). This was after we spent the summer apart because of her internship back home and me staying at school to take summer classes.

So of course we end up dating and everything is great; she can't believe that she almost didn't date me and all that fun stuff. We end up spending a ton of time together and everything is great. Throughout the relationship she had her breakdowns about her cousin that died years back and a friend from 2nd grade who passed and even had a dream about killing herself.

Okay, so now we fast forward a year, out of the honey moon phase but we are best friends and love spending time together. She breaks up with me and says she can't do it anymore and that she's not happy and that I need to be more affectionate because girls need that (which i believe I was but not to the extent that she wanted). We still spend the following weeks with eachother like we never broke up and she's saying all these things to me like we were together which was messing with my head. One, night she ends up at one of her guy 'friends' house to hang and play some cards - she sleeps in his bed and ""he kissed her"". I find out and she's upset crying she doesn't know why she did and thinks she subconsciously wanted to push me away (complete bullshit).

We end up BACK together (I'm a fucking moron, i know) a month later and everything is great again. 3 months later she broke up with me again saying she's unhappy. we talk over text a week later and she says that im not the one and she didn't see us getting married even though we were compatiable now she didn't see us compatabile as a married couple (idk what that means). 

Another week goes by and i find out that she left me for a DIFFERENT friend. We ended up meeting up to talk about it and she's crying, holding my hands, smelling me becasue she loves my scent, saying she's gonne miss this and that about me, non stop hugging, and that there's still a spark between us. She told me that the day before she broke up with me she told him she had feelings for him while 'black out' drunk and now they literally spend almost everyday together (it's been about a month now).

She considers this friend to be one of her 'best friends'. They became friends after we started dating. They spent a lot of time together because they had the same classes and would study together and eventually had the same group of firends so they would all go out together and stuff. I never felt threatened or jealous because to be quite honest he's not the best looking guy. and there was a point when we were together where she would cry because she didn't have a friend group so when these guy's came along i saw that it made her happy and i of course trusted her.

I honestly don't know why im posting this and feel kind of stupid. But i was hoping you guys can put this to rest and tell me what you guys think about her, if you think she's rebounding becasue she's mentally weak and needs someone to fill a void and that would be the second person she's most comfortable with or the complete opposite. Do you guys think her new fling will last long once things settle down? She essentially just replaced me but i just wanted your guys overall thoughts. Thanks for reading.

8eudsq,167,2018-04-25,Hose Beast's Attempt to Divide and Conquer (Long),DejectedDIL,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8eudsq/hose_beasts_attempt_to_divide_and_conquer_long/,"Thank you [unwritten2469](https://www.reddit.com/user/unwritten2469) for the inspiration and for triggering my memory of this Hose Beast event.  I kinda can't believe I haven't already fed this to the llamas, because it is absolutely one of the events that enraged me the most and it is the event that set it stone for me what she really was.  There was no putting on a false face to me after this.

After SFIL passed away, HB became absolutely unable to do anything for herself.  I'm surprised she was even able to wipe her own butt without asking my DH to help her.  No joke.  I'm being serious here.  DH is a very family oriented person and at that time he was deep in the fog, but I was starting to see through it.  He felt that he absolutely had to be at his mother's beck and call.

Need something at 7:00 on a Saturday morning? Call DH.  He will get out of bed and go get it for you even though it was his only day of rest.

Need something while he's at work?  Go ahead, call him.  He will leave work and get it for you.   Oh, Nevermind that he is on HIS JOB and you think you need a soda.

Oh you are so sick?  You are on the brink of death, Hose Beast?  Please tell DH every day so he can carry the weight of the world on his shoulders and feel like he has to be your sunshine and your servant.

Oh, you've got yourself in a heap of financial trouble?  Oh, poor HB.  You don't want to work and help yourself.   You quit your job two weeks after SFIL passed away.  Please whine to DH all those 10 times that you call him every day so that it is absolutely all over his mind and it becomes his to fix.  He absolutely has nothing  better to do.

Nevermind, that he has a full time job, he's in graduate school and he's in his internships.  Oh!  And he has a family and financial responsibilities of his own.  Nevermind that he is BIPOLAR and does not process these things the way anybody else would and it sends him to the bed with depression.  As long as HB is happy and well\-served, nobody else with any health problems matter.  Nevermind that DejectedDIL was almost begging and pleading with you to stop weighing him down and be conscious of his mental health.  Another note is that none of this was due to her grief.  She didn't grieve.  I honestly believe that SFIL's death just moved him out of the way for DH to be more involved in her life in HB's head.

This was several years ago and she still isn't near death and she's not even retirement age yet.

I became sick with worry over the affect HB's behavior was having on DH.  It was making him physically and mentally ill.  She was shouldering him with unnecessary and even fantasy burdens in order to get all of his attention and she replaced SFIL with DH.  She had done that for years emotionally, but it got 100 times worse.   I honestly believed he was at the verge of a severe mental breakdown and he was.  That's another story that I will share someday.  Mind you that even the stress of graduate school had not done this to him and he was almost finished with it.

So I go to an appointment at a place that HB has appointments, too.  Hers happened to be on the same day as mine. FML.  These appointments are the one thing I have always enjoyed and they are my peace for just a blip in time.  HB orders to me and to everybody there that DH is ""going to have to get her and take her to X place, Saturday.""  Before I go further, yes HB has a car and yes HB can drive.  She is just freaking lazy and feels entitled to someone constantly serving her.  Again, Saturday is his day of rest and the only day we get to spend any time together as a family, because our lives at that time were crazy busy and he worked a different shift than I did.  I never saw him during the week.  HB did...  Everyday...  She made sure of it.

By this time, I was getting angry at her crap.  In fact, I was beyond angry.  I could see a stay in the hospital for my DH coming soon.  It was evident it was happening.  So, I, very nicely, but also very directly, told HB that no, DH couldn't drive her Saturday.  She was only X years old and she had a car and there was no reason she could not take herself to this place.  She needed to spend time with the people at this place without having others there to interrupt and it was important for her to maintain some independence. She was entirely too young to depend on people all the time.  And I meant this as encouragement for her independence. Like I said, I was direct, but I was nice and I did not raise my voice.  I had already been asking her to stop shouldering him with so much that she could do by herself.   I thought nothing about it when I left, but thank God there were witnesses to my behavior, because she was determined to divide and conquer..

Setting:  Following Day.  DejectedDIL came home for lunch.  DH was already off work and in bed, but I came out of the kitchen to him sitting in the chair in the living room..  Laying in wait for me.  He said he needed to speak with me, so I sat down.  Sure. Didn't have a freaking clue what it may be.  AND THEN....  ""DejectedDIL, you need to stop being mean to my mother.  She does not mean to be so loud""  I sat there in shock. The. bitch. told. DH. that. I. was. mean. to. her. because. she. was. talking. loud. at. this. appointment.  After a few minutes, it clicked to me where that was coming from and what exactly was happening.  She had been subtle as she could possibly be with triangulation up until this point, but I had been catching on to it and had been reducing time spent on the phone with her.  I didn't want to be a subject of her lies.  So I replied and I told him that I was not mean to his mother, but if that was what he wanted to believe, so be it.  I got up, left the house and barely spoke to him for a week.

When I got ready to talk, I told him the following:

1. I am angry that you accused me of being nasty without asking me for my side of the story
2. It has nothing to do with anybody being loud
3. I left it at that.  I KNOW my character and DH does, too.  He, also, knew that up until this point I had been very good to HB.

He continued to ask that I not be mean to his mother and for the next two weeks he would come in and ask me to answer her calls or call her to assure HER I wasn't mad.  Say wha?  For two weeks, every time he spoke to her she carried on with the story that she was loud and she knew it made me upset, when the entire time she knew what the truth was and what I had said.  She knew I was direct, but not mean, but the fact is, she didn't like the mention of her have any independence from DH and the mere mention of independence for her was being mean.     She, absolutely, intended to make DH so upset with me that he would become mommy's rescuer from me, the big bad DIL.  She absolutely meant to cause a problem between us.

I almost asked him to leave our home, because of it.  In hindsight, I should have, because some of the worst of the last year or so would not have happened.  I believe it would have been a productive stay away from home.  During our actual separation, he was miserable in the midst of HB.  It didn't take long.

It took me about a month to be able to speak to him enough to tell him what the real story was and offer up any witnesses.   HB's created events such as this are what started his roll into illness and our roll towards divorce.  At this point, he knows I'm telling the truth and he's out of the fog enough to know his mother is nothing, but manipulative and a liar.  He also doesn't want to be her replacement husband and I'm thankful for that, but he's still stuck at obligation, because she's his mother.  I am dealing with that.  Thank goodness for therapy.

The triangulation is strong with Hose Beast..  So are the lies..  So are the manipulation..  So is the victimhood.  I am so thankful I realized I could go NC with the beast."

Being a student my income was only from scholarship and internships that I've held (20-30k annually combined) and my full time position will be significantly higher. I have 2 questions:

1) I have a signed letter of employment with salary and start-date, would I be able to apply for the card and use my full-time salary in the income?

2) I have a credit score of 750 and my max credit limit is 3.7k. Would I be better off asking for a credit line increase on one of my cards before applying to the CSR or should I just direcly apply for the CSR?
(My concern here is that the minimum credit line on the CSR is much higher than the cards I have now and that might be reason for me getting denied.)

**EDIT: Start date for full time is beginning of July, not June. Let me know if that changes anything.

*I'm very responsible with credit and I dont plan on keeping a balance on the card, all the traveling I will be doing could be covered by cash - I just rather be rewarded and have my expenses contribute to something like the minimum spend on the CSR.

I'm hoping you can help me. I'm a PR Intern and I've been tasked with creating a video series for a small Downtown Business area. 

What they have in mind are a series of 60 - 90 second videos profiling various businesses with some b-roll. They would have beginning and ending bumpers. These will be shared out with various social media platforms.

Now I'm wondering what the best method of production would be. I'm a former journalist and took a broadcast course in 2012, at that time we used flip cams and a primitive version of iMovie.

I'm guessing things have changed as far as cameras and video editing programs. I also used to use Sony Vegas a fair bit back in 2012 or 2013. 

Wondering what the best method would be? They have an ipad, so I could edit using imovie with it. They are also willing to buy me Sony Vegas or a similar program should I decide to use a PC.

For cameras I guess we are going to just use our iphones, unless there is an affordable HD camera which would produce significantly better results.

Should I consider miccing the people I'm interviewing to improve audio quality.

Any assistance with this would be appreciated.

Thanks!"

I was originally the one to raise flags about Nmoms erratic and bullying behavior about 5 years ago. I sent fiancé some resources and he independently identified her as a narcissist. This has really helped us deal and understand and given him great strategies. 

Anyways. I've had a lot of feelings coming up lately as we are getting married in November after a lovely two-year engagement. We decided we don't want Nmom to come, but are fine with Edad and ?sis attending. 

Mostly I am just upset that the whole family (Edad and ?sis) just gives no notice to the fact that my fiancé is VLC with them. No Christmas, no Thanksgiving, etc. We celebrate my family and other family members Nmom has excommunicated- her own father and her half-sister. They're lovely. Edad has seen fiancé a few times and calls him every now and then to say hello. ?sis has us both on Snapchat, and makes small talk occasionally, like ""your cats are so cute!"" Kind of stuff. There is no acknowledgement that anything has happened. Edad very occasionally has prodded fiancé about reaching out to Nmom or the most recent ""please talk to your mom so we can all come to the wedding"", but it's half hearted and very minimal. THEY MOSTLY JUST ACT LIKE NOTHING IS WRONG? It's the thing that messes with me the most. They never ask our side, they never get mean with us? It's just... nothing. Does anyone have insight on this?

Some background. 
Three or four years ago, it really blew up with Nmom. Fiancé grew up in an abusive environment, but shit really hit the fan when he was close to graduating college. Lots of things were involved, but basically fiancé was minding his own business, working, then working for free at an internship to get college credit, and taking an online class to finish his degree. He was living at home at this point, but wasn't there hardly ever due to being busy. She kicked him out via text at midnight one night while he was out with a friend for the friend's birthday. 

There were a lot of factors I think that contributed to the kick out. His sister got caught attending ""gay-straight"" alliance meetings at school. (The shaaame /s) ?sis then, after being pressed by Nmom, confessed that she told fiancé she was bi and he said not to tell the parents (this was like 2 years prior). Nmom accused him of ""interfering with her parenting"". 
Fiancé had opted out of the graduation Disney trip Nmom had planned for herself- I mean, for him. 

I had recently helped foil her plan to prevent him from getting an important graduation related item- a big deal at our school. She had secretly promised to get for him for two years, and had me on it on discouraging him from saving for it so it would be a surprise. She pulled out at the deadline to punish him. But one of our mutual friends literally crowdfunded the item in two days, so she was SALTY as heck. 

She privately messaged me and apologized for how poorly fiancé treated me (?????? We barely even saw them?). I stood up to her about it and she got enraged. When he was packing up his belongings to move out she was following him around screaming that I'm not her equal and I can't talk to her like I'm her equal. 

She called my mom who she has met once and complained that fiancé left his room messy and never helped around the house. (He had already moved out at this point) She heavily implied he was a drug addict. Then she snapped on her and accused them of buying his important graduation item for him and financially supporting him (um, all make believe). She forbade them from giving him money because she was ""trying to teach him a lesson"". My mom didn't play. She said nice things about him the whole time and then offered to pray for Nmom's family and got hung up on. 

That's the basics of what was going on. I told fiancé to book it on out of there for his mental health and if he needed financial help I would help- I was living in a different city. 

This was the time period of Nasty Text Messages. She'd just text him and rant and rave and accuse of being a drug addict, being an alcoholic, not graduating on time because he partied too much, falling away from God, pages and pages of untrue vitriol. Sure, we smoked a little weed when we weren't going to need to deal with drug tests, and we went out with our friends occasionally? Normal young people stuff. But far from her claims. 

He screenshot some things and sent them to Edad, who would cop out with ""that's between you and Nmom"" and basically just ignore it. 

In the last two years we don't hear much from Nmom. Every now and then she pops up with crazy accusatory messages and he just ignores her, screenshots them, and sends them to Edad.  Edad ignores it. Once a while back he said he was disappointed in fiancé for not ""reaching out"" to Nmom, but dropped it quickly. No more hiding this stuff. Fiancé has come leaps and bounds. He was always great, but now he is more cheerful and has much more confidence and self esteem. He's successful at work and more driven and motivated than ever before. We also live 1000 miles away. But our wedding is back near where my parents and Nmom, Edad, ?sis live.

Our wedding is approaching. We feel the need to clearly and specifically uninvite Nmom. But fiancé wants Edad and ?sis to come if they are willing. 

I'm angry at them. Why do they get away with pretending like nothing happened? Why is that the response? Are they even going to come? Are they going to be mad we uninvited Nmom? Ugh just ugh.

Any insight appreciated. Thanks for reading.


TLDR; my fiancé's family pretends like nothing is weird when we've been VLC for like 2 years. I'm mad and i don't get it. "

Now I'm wondering what the best method of production would be. I'm a former journalist and took a broadcast course in 2012, at that time we used flip cams and a primitive version of iMovie.

I'm guessing things have changed as far as cameras and video editing programs. I also used to use Sony Vegas a fair bit back in 2012 or 2013.

Wondering what the best method would be? They have an ipad, so I could edit using imovie with it. They are also willing to buy me Sony Vegas or a similar program should I decide to use a PC.

For cameras I guess we are going to just use our iphones, unless there is an affordable HD camera which would produce significantly better results.

Should I consider miccing the people I'm interviewing to improve audio quality.

Any assistance with this would be appreciated.

8ewl8j,5,2018-04-25,I (21/M) am worried that my girlfriend (21/F) may have undiagnosed medical depression/anxiety.,JC-321,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ewl8j/i_21m_am_worried_that_my_girlfriend_21f_may_have/,"My girlfriend (21,F) has a real challenge when it comes to dealing with (what she perceives as) failure and negative feelings. She came from a broken home in the formative years of her life, receiving no love or support from her birth father. At age 7 she moved to the USA with her mother, who has since remarried; the stepfather is extremely loving and supportive, and my girlfriend has even taken his last name. 

We are both in college, I am a graduating senior, and she is a rising senior. My girlfriend has always had high expectations for herself, as she is extremely intelligent (she got a 90 on our Strategic Game Theory midterm without studying) and has a high drive for work. 

Since I started dating her, I have noticed that when things do not go her way, or that a negative thing happens in her life, all sense of rationale and coping go out the window. At the end of her freshman year, she got in trouble for alcohol-related things and became so stressed and distraught that she would lose her full tuition scholarship over being getting probation. At the end of her sophomore year, we had a breakup, and she fell into a semester long depression. 

We got back together this past semester after not seeing each other (she went abroad, and we are from different cities in the US), but the issue largely seems to persist. Her grandfather of over 95 years passed, and she blamed herself saying that she was a failure and a bad granddaughter for not being able to see him back in Romania one last time. She didn't land an internship she desperately wanted and fell into a depression about how she was a failure and a waste and that she would never be good enough. She went home for a weekend, crying about how she was returning to her family as a failure. 

Earlier today, she broke down crying because she walked into her common room and found a freshman who was being photographed by the school in recognition for something he did, jealous because she feels she hadn't succeeded in anything. This is someone who has a 3.75 GPA, a full tuition scholarship, and created one of the most popular clubs on our campus in the last four years. 

At this point, I am feeling that this problem is being caused by far more than just a negative outlook. I have spoken with her several times about taking a free counseling session that our college offers to try to deal with some of the anxiety and depression, but she refuses to see one. I have also spoken with her mother, who is a medical doctor, about this several times as well, and her mother also recognizes the issues. For whatever reason, she has such a negative view of looking for help from that avenue. What do I do as her boyfriend, Reddit?

edit: This has been a factor affecting our relationship since the beginning, and I am worried that it is beginning to really put a damper on things. I want her to be happy and successful, but it is so incredibly draining for me to continually try to support her and help her when this happens on a near daily basis. She thinks that seeking help from counselors or trying medication is for weak people and is a waste of time. I am getting to the point where I am getting frustrated or even angry when this happens and things don't get better, and I don't want that. I love her very much and I just want her to be better equipped to deal with negativity in life, because I know that things may only get harder for her. "

Not every time but quite often if i activate the USB Fans on my headset the screen is turnin white for a few seconds or stay white. If i turn off the vive n chill the screen comes back but audio is missing.

If i jerk off with this fan button \(joke, just pressing 3\-4 times in a few seconds\) SteamVR is telling be that there is USB Connection Problems. So my 2 cents are that the Fans suck to much current of of the usb or the vive cannot provide enough.

***Christian Heidel:***


**Köln**

- Tedesco war bereits „in der Halbzeit ziemlich angepiekst“ und hätte vor einem Schlendrian gewarnt

- „Der Mann im Kölner Keller hat wohl auch gepennt“, dies sei für ihn aber ein anderes Thema und kein Grund für den Punktverlust

- Tedesco hat die „Arroganz-Wortwahl“ intern bereits relativiert und der Mannschaft erklärt, was er damit meinte


**Planung 2018/19**

- „Saisonplanung heißt nicht nur 'Spieler kaufen und verkaufen', sondern ein langfristiges Ziel zu verfolgen“

- „Langfristige Ziele sind wichtiger als kurzfristiger Erfolg“ (so wie er es rübergebracht hat etwas, was ihn in der Vergangenheit wohl gestört hat)

- „Wenn du heute viel richtig machst, gewinnst du in 5 Jahren 5 Spiele mehr“


**Infrastruktur**

- „Die Infrastruktur MUSS verbessert werden!“ (da war er sehr energisch)

- Die Profiabteilung hätte bei seinem Antritt infrastrukturell „Drittliganiveau“ gehabt...der Trainingsplatz der Profis war top, der Rest wäre früher nicht so wichtig gewesen

- „Die besten Jugendspieler Deutschlands haben die schlechtesten Trainingsbedingungen“

- Laut den Profis sind die Voraussetzungen in den letzten 2 Jahren bereits „deutlich verbessert worden“

- „Wir hatten ein Büro für 8 Trainer, jetzt haben wir 8 Büros“

- „Wir wollen besser aussehen als die Konkurrenz“

**Tedesco**

- „Domenico vertrauen wir mittlerweile blind“

- „Er ist einer der fleißigsten Menschen, die ich kenne“

- „Er hat diese Saison aus dem vorhandenen Spielermaterial eine gute Basis gelegt und jetzt können wir gemeinsame eine Mannschaft aufbauen“

- „Bei Domenico waren wir alle nach dem ersten Gespräch umgehauen“

- „Man muss keine Nationalmannschaft gespielt haben, um ein guter Trainer zu 
sein...Erfahrung als Trainer ist viel wichtiger als Erfahrungen als Spieler“

- „Tedesco wird seinen Weg gehen“

- „Das Risiko, einen Trainer mit bereits 7 Entlassungen einzustellen ist größer, als ein erfahrener Trainer aus dem Nachwuchsbereich“


**Transfers**

- er freute sich, dass zu Sané und Uth die ersten Infos erst dann rauskamen, als praktisch bereits alles fix war

- „Es ist eine Veränderung zu früher, dass mehr gehandelt als geredet wird“

- „Die Spieler, mit denen gesprochen wird, wurden bisher in den Medien noch nicht genannt“

- „Uth ist ein super Typ...ich habe ihm zum Sieg in Hoffenheim gratuliert da hat er geantwortet, dass er sich bereits auf sein erstes Derby am 34. Spieltag freut, wenn unsere Nachbarn nach Hoffenheim müssen“ (da freute sich Heidel sichtlich)

- Bei Sané weiß ich den genauen Wortlaut nicht mehr, aber er dachte im ersten Augenblick vom Auftreten her (Kleidung) an Aubameyang, musste aber nach wenigen Sekunden feststellen, dass „Sané ein sehr angenehmer Zeitgenosse ist, der wohl der begehrteste Defensivspieler der Liga war“...er sei „super intelligent“ und spiele zur Entspannung gerne Piano

- „Wir haben den Anspruch, dass die Mannschaft nächste Saison besser ist, als diese Saison“

- „Auch wenn wir die CL erreichen, können wir uns keine Transfers über 30 Mio. erlauben“

- „Nachhaltigkeit ist wichtig“

- „Wenn man Champions League spielt, hat man mindestens 6 Spiele mehr und eine größere Ballung an Spielen auf engen Zeitraum. Man braucht keinen 30 Mann-Kader, aber 2-3 Spieler mehr werden es vermutlich sein. Die Planungen gehen in Richtung 4-5 Neuzugänge.“

- „Ein zu großer Kader führt aber irgendwann zwangsläufig zu Unzufriedenheit, deswegen muss man den richtigen Mix finden.“

- „Spieler können uns nur mit unserer Zustimmung verlassen.“ (heißt für mich, KEINE Ausstiegsklauseln im Sommer)


**Wechsel von Mainz auf Schalke**

- „Mainz ist mein Leben, aber das Leben ändert sich auch mal“
ein guter Freund von ihm sei verstorben und er hat daraufhin für sich den Beschluss gefasst, nochmal was neues auszuprobieren...dieses müsse aber was „außergewöhnliches sein, um Mainz zu verlassen“

- „Nach dem ersten Gespräch mit Herrn Tönnies in Hamburg dachte ich 'Ok, da gehst du nicht hin'“ (Gelächter im Saal)...Grund war Tönnies seine Aussage „Ich suche einen Sportdirektor für den Trainer“ woraufhin Heidel entgegnete „Ok, da sind sie bei mir falsch“

- Tönnies wäre aber von diesem Kontra so beeindruckt gewesen, dass er wöchentlich nachhakte...irgendwann wollte Heidel dann in einem persönlichen Gespräch in Rheda-Wiedenbrück endgültig absagen, da er Mainz zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht im Stich lassen wollte...Heidel: „Nach dem Gespräch musste ich dann meiner Frau beichten, dass wir ins Ruhrgebiet ziehen müssen“ (noch mehr Gelächter)

- Er hat den Schritt bisher keine Sekunde bereut und wohnt selber in Essen


**Letzte Saison**

- Trotz des schlechten Starts letzte Saison (5 Niederlagen) war eine enorme Ruhe im Verein, was ihn beeindruckte, da er das früher aus der Ferne anders vernommen hat

- „Ich bin nicht der Typ, der Weinzierl die Schuld gibt...ich kannte Schalke nicht und habe das ganze (neuer Manager, neue Mannschaft, neuer Trainer) anfangs unterschätzt“

- „Wenn ich das Gefühl gehabt hätte, dass ich der falsche für den Posten wäre, hätte ich meine Ämter niedergelegt“

- „Mein Gefühl für Trainer kann nicht so schlecht sein...der eine trainiert Liverpool, der andere in Zukunft PSG, laut Medien“ (da hat er sich meiner Meinung nach verplappert)


**Finanzen**

- „Schalke ist im Gegensatz zu den meisten anderen Klubs im Besitz aller Rechte“

- „Wenn wir alle Rechte verkaufen würden, wären wir auf einen Schlag schuldenfrei, das steht aber nicht zur Diskussion, denn wir wollen Herr im Haus bleiben“

- Andere Klubs geben bis zu 20 % der Einnahmen aus verschiedenen Bereichen an Vermarkter ab

- „Schalke ist hochverschuldet“ sei daher nur die halbe Wahrheit, da man alles in eigener Hand hält

- „Man muss bei den kursierenden Zahlen über irgendwelche Schuldenberge keine Angst haben“

- „Wir haben eine Finanz- und Controllingabteilung, die seinesgleichen sucht“

- „Wir gehen keine finanziellen Risiken ein, die nicht überschaubar sind“


**Verträge im Profifußball**

- „Hector hat mich heute positiv überrascht. Alle meine Informanten sind von einem Wechsel zu unseren Nachbarn ausgegangen“

- Er sieht den Fall Hector aber auch als Ausnahme im Profifußball

- „Immer weniger Spieler werden in Zukunft ihre Verträge verlängern“

- „Wir profitieren bei Uth letztendlich auch von einem ausgelaufenen Vertrag“

- „Spieler haben in der Regel 10 Jahre Zeit, ihre Schäfchen ins Trockene zu holen“, da könne er diese Entwicklung nachvollziehen

- „Wer bei Schalke gut spielt, wird automatisch ein Kandidat für wirtschaftlich stärkere KLubs“


**Goretzka**

- „Wir waren uns mit ihm einig und die Unterschrift sollte nach dem Confed Cup erfolgen“

- „Nach dem Turnier bat er um Bedenkzeit“

- „Man muss dem Jungen zu gute halten, dass es da um finanzielle Dimensionen geht, die sich hier keiner im Raum ansatzweise vorstellen kann, ich kann seine Entscheidung am Ende sogar leider nachvollziehen“

- „Wenn wir Leon im Sommer abgegeben hätten, hätten wir von der Ablöse weniger als 50 % bekommen. Der Rest wäre an Bochum und den Spieler gegangen. Für das Geld hätten wir auch keinen Ersatz bekommen.“


**Meyer**

- „Max hat ein sehr gutes Angebot bekommen, dieses wurde von seiner Seite abgelehnt, was legitim ist“

- „Schalke ist kein Verein aus der 7. Kreisklasse, der Angst haben muss, noch Spieler zu bekommen“

- „Wir haben erneute Gespräche angeboten, es bestand aber kein Interesse seitens der anderen Partei“

- „Keine Ahnung, wohin Max wechselt, aber er wird gehen“

- „Domenico hat sein Okay gegeben, dass man Meyer ziehen lassen kann“

- „Ich glaube nicht, dass Max nochmal auf uns zukommt, unsere Planungen gehen jetzt aber auch in eine gänzlich andere Richtung“ (auf Nachfrage, ob eine VVL unter Umständen noch möglich sei)

- „Im Winter gab es keine Anfrage für Max, ich kann mich dann auch schlecht mit einem Schild auf den Parkplatz stellen“

- „Letztendlich erfüllt er aber auch seinen Vertrag“


**Kehrer**

- „Thilo hat noch ein Jahr Vertrag und wir sind in Gesprächen. Irgendwann muss er aber für sich entscheiden, was er möchte und dann ist das so. Jeder Spieler und auch der Klub hat das Recht, 'Nein' zu sagen.“

- „Ich bin bei Thilo alles andere als skeptisch“


**Vorstandskollegen Peters/Jobst**

- „Alex ist der beste Marketingmann im Fußball, den man sich vorstellen kann“

- „Die guten Marketingergebnisse sind sein Verdienst“

- „Peter Peters ist im Führungsgremium Mr. Schalke, er weiß alles über den Verein“

- „Wir ergänzen uns im Vorstand sehr gut, alle Türen sind geöffnet, jeder kann 
hören, mit wem der andere spricht“


**Höwedes**

- „Mir ist folgendes ganz wichtig: Niemand hat Benny weggeschickt! Wir haben 3 Stunden bei mir im Garten gesessen und Benny hat mir gesagt, dass er nach Turin möchte. Sein großes Ziel war die WM 2018 und er hat dort für sich größere Einsatzchancen gesehen als auf Schalke.“ (Dies begründete Heidel damit, dass jeder Spieler ein Gespräch mit Tedesco hatte und Höwedes für sich entschieden hat, dass es für ihn schwer werden könnte...)

- „Wir waren nicht begeistert, aber wir haben dem Wunsch eines Weltmeisters entsprochen, weil wir aufgrund seiner Verdienste im Verein nicht Schuld sein wollten, dass er eventuell mangels Einsätzen die WM verpasst“

- „Wir sind das ganze Jahr über in Kontakt. Leider lief es für ihn bisher nicht so, wie erhofft, aber die letzten 2 Spiele durfte er jeweils starten und er machte sogar ein Tor. Wir müssen jetzt in den nächsten Wochen gemeinsam besprechen, wie es zukünftig weitergehen soll.“


**U23/Knappenschmiede**

- „Als ich kam gab es bei der U23 insgesamt 37 Spieler und an Spieltagen saßen 20 Mann im Trainingsanzug auf der Tribüne, weil die Bank voll war“

- „Die U23 war nicht das fünfte Rad am Wagen, sondern eher der Klebstoff fürs Reserverad“

- „Asa hat sich brutal reingehängt, eine schlagkräftige Truppe zusammenzustellen“

- „Die Mannschaft ist im Vergleich zu anderen Oberliga-Teams extrem teuer“

- „Wir werden eine Änderung in der U23 vornehmen. Wir wollen keine zweite Erste Mannschaft, nur ein paar Ligen tiefer“

- „Peter Knäbel hat eingesehen, dass er im Nachwuchsbereich am besten aufgehoben ist“

- „Wir werden gemeinsam mit Peter besprechen, wie es weitergeht“

- „Wir müssen einen Weg finden, dass die U23 einen für den Verein hat, das ist in der U23 aber brutal schwer“

- „Wir können keinen U19-Spieler, der zwar Anfragen aus der ersten oder zweiten Liga hat, für unsere Profimannschaft aber noch nicht in Frage kommt, in die Oberliga nach Rödinghausen fahren lassen...“

- „Es ist noch zu früh, 'Nein' zur U23 zu sagen“


**Geis**

- „Geisi hatte wie Benny Bedenken, dass die neue Spielweise für ihn gut wäre und wollte unbedingt das Angebot aus Sevilla annehmen“
„Fakt ist, Geisi hat Vertrag bei uns, aber ich bin sicher, dass es demnächst Gespräche mit Domenico geben wird und dann müssen wir gemeinsam entscheiden, was für alle Seiten das richtige ist“


**Hemmerich/Wright**

- „Wenn man Stand heute ein Fazit sind, sind beide bei ihren Klubs stark angefangen, dann aber in den jeweiligen Hierarchien durchgerutscht“

- „Wir müssen jetzt alle gemeinsam schauen, ob es im Sommer Sinn macht, dass beide zurückkomen“


**Fans/Ausschreitungen**

- „Wir sind dabei, die Krawalle von Mittwoch (Frankfurt) aufzuarbeiten und werden danach Maßnahmen entwickeln. Im Gegensatz zu Frankfurt sind wir aber vorsichtig mit voreiligen Aussagen.“

- „Man darf das ganze Thema aber auch nicht zu hoch hängen, auf dem Oktoberfest passieren beispielsweise in 2 Wochen wahrscheinlich mehr schlimme Dinge als an 17 Heimspieltagen. Der Fußball steht bloß mehr in der Öffentlichkeit.“

- „Gegen Frankfurt war das pure Gewalt, die Pyro-Aktion beim Auswärtsspiel in Mainz war eher eine politisches Thema“


**Avdijaj**

- „Nicht jeder, der in der U19 herausragt, wird automatisch Fußballprofi. Donis ist da leider unser Spezialfall.“

- „Wir haben ihn alle lieb und kein Profi war öfter bei mir im Büro, als er. Was ihm aber bei aller Fröhlichkeit bisher leider abging, war die Ernsthaftigkeit, die man als Profisportler haben sollte.“
lachend: „Wir leihen ihn einfach Holland aus, da versteht ihn keiner und er kann seine Späße nicht mehr machen“

- „Es gab im Winter einige Klubs, die ihn haben wollten, aber dann einen Rückzieher machten. Das war nicht leicht für ihn.“

- „Donis ist ein Riesentalent und braucht einen Klub, wo er sich wohlfühlt. Aber er muss jetzt den Sprung vom jungen Bengel zum erwachsenen Profi schaffen.“

- „Von Köln habe ich bisher nichts gehört. Wir waren ja Sonntag erst da gewesen, da wollte keiner mit mir über Donis reden.“

- „Ich habe ihn unheimlich gerne und er ist ein super Junge und wir wollen in den nächsten Wochen alle gemeinsam schauen, was in Zukunft das beste für alle Beteiligten ist.“


**Tönnies**

- „Clemens ist das Schalker Staatsoberhaupt, ich bin sein Sportminister“ (Gelächter im Saal)

- „Wenn Clemens irgendwo auch nur eine Silbe über Schalke sagt, wird ihm das wahrscheinlich auf 3 verschiedene Arten ausgelegt.“

- „Clemens lebt Schalke und will nur das beste für den Klub.“


**Nürnberg**

Hier las jemand einen offenen, nicht ganz ernst gemeinten Brief von einem Nürnberg-Fanclub aus Herzogenaurach vor. Es ging darum, ob Schalke nicht zur Abwechslung mal bei anderen Klubs scouten könnte. (wie gesagt, eher mit Augenzwinkern zu lesen). Antworten von Heidel:

- „Burgstaller wollte damals ursprünglich im Sommer ablösefrei nach Gladbach wechseln. Da wir aber Bedarf hatten und Nürnberg auf die Ablöse angewiesen war, stachen wir bereits im Winter ein.“

- „Teuchert wäre im Sommer ablösefrei gewechselt. Domenico war aber von dem Spieler begeistert und wollte ihn gerne haben, sodass wir den Nürnbergern bei der Ablöse enorm entgegengekommen sind.“
er sei sich der vermutlich besten deutschen Fanfreundschaft bewusst und pflege außerdem zu Andreas Bornemann ein hervorragendes Verhältnis


**Verhältnis zu Schuster**

- „Axel ist brutal zuverlässig. Wenn ich ihn nachts anrufe und sage wir müssen nach London, dann würde er mir innerhalb einer Stunde den gesamten Trip für das Team organisieren.“

- „Leider verträgt er keinen Alkohol. Nach 2 Glas Wein ist er ein Mensch von einem anderen Planeten“ (lautes Gelächter)

- „Als ich Axel mitgeteilt habe, dass ich zu Schalke gehe und er mich beerben kann, war ich heilfroh als er sagte 'Ich komme auf der Stelle mit'“





***Axel Schuster:***

**Verhältnis zu Heidel**

- Lachend: „Christian kann nicht ohne mich“

- „Er ist zwar mein Chef, aber trotzdem ein guter Freund und diesen Spagat schafft er hervorragend.“

- „Nach dem Frankfurtspiel war ich aufgrund der Ungerechtigkeit auch weit nach Abpfiff noch geknickt, da war Christian bereits in Angriffsstimmung auf die CL.“

- „Früher haben wir uns über Frauen und Fußball unterhalten, heutzutage über Krankheiten...man wird halt älter.“


**Aufgaben**

- Er versteht sich als „Organisator für alles, was im Profibereich anfällt“

- Er koordiniert alle Anfrage für Mannschaft und Trainerteam und plant die Termine

- Er hat gestern noch mit Tedesco die Vorbereitung durchgeplant, Tedesco: „Axel, das ist noch so weit weg, wichtig ist Gladbach“, Schuster daraufhin: „Ok, mach du Samstag die CL klar und ich plane die Zukunft.“


**Knappenschmiede**

- „Hervorragendes Personal mit Norbert Elgert an der Spitze“

- „Es mangelt an Räumlichkeiten für die Knappenschmiede“

- Er kenne Knäbel bereits seit Mainzer Zeiten, als dieser als Referent auf einem Trainerlehrgang war, Teilnehmer waren u. a. Thomas Tuchel und Martin Schmidt

- Er sieht Knäbel als „hervorragende Verstärkung für unseren Verein“

- Thema Ausstattung, Knäbel: „Axel, haben wir Kameras zur Trainingsaufzeichung?“
Schuster: „Peter, wir haben nicht mal Büros für die Trainer.“
Knäbel: „Puh, es gibt so viel zu tun“
Schuster: „Deswegen haben wir dich geholt“

- Voraussichtlich werden einige Nachwuchsspieler mit den Profis nach China fliegen, Namen wollte er aber nicht nennen




***Professor Stefan Gesenhues:***


**Aufsichtsrat**

- „Zurzeit sehr entspanntes Arbeiten“

- „Sehr harmonisches Miteinander“
man hat ein „klares Vereinskonzept, Stichwort Knappenschmiede“

- „Es gibt wenig bis gar nichts zu kritisieren“

- „Menschlich passen alle hervorragend zusammen“ (bezogen auf Vorstand und Aufsichtsrat)


**Finanzen**

- „In den letzten Jahren wurde viel Geld verbrannt“

- „Die Liquidität ist auf Schalke natürlich nicht die größte, dafür gehört jede Bratwurst auf dem Gelände, im Gegensatz zu anderen Klubs, dem Verein FC Schalke 04 ev“

- „Die geplanten Investitionen sind alle wirtschaftlich sinnvoll und vor allem nachhaltig“




**Allgemeine Anekdoten**

- Schuster bestellte bei einer Frage erstmal ein Bier. Als das Bier gebracht wurde fragte Heidel: „Warum bringen Sie denn jetzt nur eins?“ (Gelächter)

- Angesprochen auf Heidels größte Schwäche meinte Schuster: „Fahren sie nie mit ihm in ein Parkhaus, das wird die Hölle, weil Christian immer, also wirklich IMMER sein Ticket verliert“. Heidel erzählte dazu: „Vor zwei Wochen hat Alex Jobst mich nach Madrid zum Rückspiel Real-Juve eingeladen und ich bin selber zum Düsseldorfer Flughafen gefahren und habe mein Auto dort abgestellt. Als ich am nächsten Tag wieder nach Hause fahren wollte, habe ich völlig vergessen, wo mein Auto stand und ich bin eine halbe Stunde kreuz und quer durchs Parkhaus gelaufen. Als ich dann endlich das Auto fand und an der Schranke zur Ausfahrt stand bemerkte ich, dass ich das Ticket verloren hatte. Hinter mir standen bereits einige laut hupende Autos, doch ich kam weder vor, zurück noch konnte ich aussteigen, weil da die Gegensprechanlage war. Also musste ich zur Beifahrertür klettern, da aussteigen und mir am Automaten ein neues Ticket holen. Dort hatte aber jemand bereits ein bezahltes Ticket gefunden, MEINS! Ich hatte es wohl im Automaten stecken lassen...“ (großes Gelächter)
Schuster: „Schlimm ist es, wenn man mit Christian Essen geht und er seine Brille vergessen hat. Dann darf man ihm die Speisekarte vorlesen.“"

I'm a 20 year old guy looking for a place to stay for the summer in Livermore. I'm doing an internship at NIF, and unfortunately my housing just fell through. 

I'm having a very hard time finding anything affordable, and many people I contact do not reply to me. If anyone has a place I could stay, or any advice on finding something less than $1250/month, I would be very grateful. 

I'm planning to stay June 1st to August 19th

Thanks for reading! :)"
8ez734,1,2018-04-25,Would you take a unpaid position at a well known firm or a full time paid position at a lesser known firm?,jonnybrav0000,AskMarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMarketing/comments/8ez734/would_you_take_a_unpaid_position_at_a_well_known/,"So I'm a third year business marketing student in LA, applying to many summer internships. Being in LA, there are many opportunities and businesses here, which has proved to be both a good and bad thing. 

I have applied to many prestigious companies and successfully interviewed with them, but a majority of them are unpaid. Not only are they unpaid but they require a lot of time and transportation costs. 

On the other hand, there are a lot of start up companies that I interviewed at that offer a higher than minimum wage compensation. Currently i'm in the waiting game where if I hear back from any of these companies, I don't know which offer to take. 

One part of me realizes what I am capable of bringing to the table and I feel like i deserve at least a stipend of minimum wage compensation, but a part of me also see's the potential in working with a larger firm. Another thing to note is that the larger firms also mention that intern retention to a full time position is not easy to come-by due to competition as opposed to the smaller firms, who are more likely to retain their top interns. 

What would you do?"

Now a Transcript?,AccountingDude1234,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8ezesr/finally_got_the_job_now_a_transcript/,"I am finally graduating with my BBA in Accounting. It has been a long and challenging journey, but I am finally here. I had a job interview recently and have been extended an offer, but I am concerned that they will be asking for a transcript after my graduation date.

The bad news: My main concern is my GPA. It is a 2.79 (they never asked), another concern is my past performance in my accounting courses. I have several Ws and Fs in my major accounting courses. I am concerned that if they are made aware of my past failures or struggle to make it through the program that I will be denied the Job.

The good news: 
1. They really like me, and I like them. It is a local and relatively new company that has grown phenomenally in the past few years, and they now have a national presence. 
2. They gave me a pre-assessment to test my basic accounting knowledge, and I “passed with flying colors.  Your school has obviously done a good job preparing you”
3. I have excellent work and prior accounting experience in internships and references that have contacted the company directly with recommendations. 
4. I have provided one of my prior accounting professors as a reference. 

All taken into account, I am unsure of whether to be concerned or not. I am genuinely excited to work for this company, and with the accounting team I have met so far. My main questions are, do I have anything really to be worried about? And what do I do if they were to ask for a post graduate transcript?

8ezmlx,46,2018-04-25,Me [27f] and husband [25m] have clashing ideas about our future,throwitawaynow4757,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ezmlx/me_27f_and_husband_25m_have_clashing_ideas_about/,"My husband and I got married last year and we have a wonderful relationship together. Healthy levels of mutual respect, communication, affection, and smooshing booties.
Not to say we don't have our problems from time to time, but overall, everything is great.
The problem we're encountering is this.

I'm finishing up a double degree in International Relations and Political Science (I'll graduate next year), and I'm looking for opportunities to build my resume and start my career. Currently I'm working on applications for a 6 month internship at NATO. I want my career to have an international aspect to it because I love traveling and I've never really been super attached to living in one place. The idea of picking up and moving to a different country doesn't bother me. Working for an IGO in Europe is like a dream job for me.

My husband on the other hand, is very different. He values living where we are currently because he's close to his family, which long story short, he was separated from for many years as a teen because his father was abusive. His job is a little more specialized, and he worries that he wouldn't be able to find work if, after I graduate I start working and would have to move.
I totally understand his fear; not only that but I would be taking him away from family, friends and everything familiar, with the additional struggle of him being potentially isolated because of language barriers. (I speak German and a bit of French in addition to English).

To be clear, he wouldn't move with me for the 6 month internship, but if it led to a permanent job afterwards, then we'd have a potential problem.

I don't really see how we could compromise on this. It's very much ""one way or the other"", it's hard to find a middle ground when it comes to staying or moving. I will not force him or give him an ultimatum or anything like that, because his viewpoint is just as valid as mine, and his reasons for being hesitant to just pack up and move are legitimate.
We're just struggling to brainstorm solutions to this incompatibility. We're both dedicated to each other 100% and are determined to find something that works for us.

I'm hoping people here have been in this position, on either side and can offer perspective or ideas. He and I have talked about this to death and we still don't know what to do about this apparent incompatibility.

TL;DR husband and I don't see eye to eye on how to build our future together because our careers drag us to literally different corners of the world"

A little background: I was discharged from the Navy about a year ago. Shortly after I moved to Portland where I have been working on my associates degree (I'll have it in a couple months!). I have been using the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which pays for 100% tuition and an allowance for rent.

Both PSU's and OSU's programs seem solid, however I've heard that the quality of education is somewhat better at OSU. Additionally, I was not too impressed with PSU's campus (it didn't really feel like a university).

Here's where the conflict lies:

-The allowance for rent is much higher in Portland VS Corvallis (by about $800/month).

-I am 27 years old, and am worried that it would be difficult to make any friends in Corvallis

-Portland is such an amazing city! I've heard there's not much going on in Corvallis

-PSU has the CAT Braindump, which seems too good to pass up

-PSU seems to have zero school spirit, whereas its huge at OSU (I've always been a beavers fan, too!)

8f0965,4,2018-04-26,My mom is (still) threatening to cut me off financially unless i live with her over the summer,jessicaat123,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8f0965/my_mom_is_still_threatening_to_cut_me_off/,"So about a month and a half ago my mom kicked me out of the house 3 days into spring break because I mentioned I was thinking about getting an apartment and job in the town where my university is located. She told me that the consequence for my decision would be that my parents will no longer support me financially. Right now they pay for my phone bill, car insurance, and health insurance, and probably a bunch of other things that they never taught me about because they suck.

Fast forward to today. I've been in touch with someone at a company in my college's town about internships, and I had emailed them today to follow up with my application. My contact told me they'd know by the end of today, but they never responded. My mom called me today and asked about the internship, so I told her what was going on and she said ""so I guess that's a no."" Our conversation went back to the living situation and I told her I was just going to stay put for the summer. My sister has an apartment she won't be using, and I can work full time and pay the rent and stuff. I've also not been able to get a job in my hometown since I'd only be able to work there for a couple months before I'd have to go back to school.

I'm so frustrated that she doesn't understand or care about my opinion in any way. I could definitely save money by living at home, but the environment is just so unstable and stressful I don't want to be a part of it ever again. I couldn't even last 2 days without getting kicked out, how could I survive 3 months?

Her threats are most likely empty, but I'm still scared that if I don't come home for the summer she's really going to cut me off."

I'm thinking (and planning) about becoming a diving instructor and I have some questions for dive masters, instructors, professionals, ... Anyone with some experience or thoughts really!

Little bit of background &amp; info about me:

I have a degree in applied computer science &amp; I currently work as a software developer (Java). This is a decent 9-6 job (I get a lot of freedom, not a lot of work stress) though I still feel like I'm selling my soul. 

I LOVE the water, always have (if there's a pool with decent temperature, I'm in it). I dove a couple of times in Belgium (home country), Greece and Montenegro. This made me hungry for more &amp; wondering why I didn't think of this before. Last summer I went to Koh Tao to get my AOW. This was an amazing experience &amp; I still think about it nearly every day. 




So now I'm here, longing to go back. My plan is to save up enough money (€10k give or take) for everything (includes gear, course costs, food while getting DM, ...). I would also love to go back to Koh Tao as I loved the atmosphere, weather &amp; the diving school I got my AOW in. I would be doing this for a lifestyle that fits me, while doing something I love.

I read multiple other posts &amp; opinions on tips, but there's still some questions that I have &amp; I'm hoping for some advice as well!

* Do you think €10k will suffice for all the costs? 

* I want to do this in Koh Tao because people come there specifically to dive. I assume this means I'll be teaching a little more enthusiasts instead of just tourists who will dive once. Any other recommendations or reasons against Koh Tao?

* Do you get paid enough (&amp; steady enough?) as an instructor or is it best to have extra cash in case it's a bad month or anything?

* I see a lot of Dive Master courses, but also Dive Master internships. Does an internship imply you don't have to pay? Or do you still pay but less? What's the deal here?

8f3f41,0,2018-04-26,Belgian student searching for an internship,zOwn3Ds,melbourne,https://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/8f3f41/belgian_student_searching_for_an_internship/,"Hi all,

I’m a Belgian student in Applied Computer Sciences with the option Computer and Cybercrime Professional and for my last year I need to do an internship. This would take place from February 2019 till May/June 2019.


I want to do this in Melbourne because I want to work and live there after I graduate.


The reason why I post here is that it’s hard as a student from overseas to find an internship because most of the company’s request you to be an Australian / New Zealand citizen or you need to be an Australian permanent resident. I’m none of those because I still live in Belgium.


Is there a way that you guys can bring me in contact with company’s that accept international internships? The type of work I would prefer is more security based due to my studies, but I would also like doing more data analysis.


This would be a big opportunity for me and maybe later for students from my school who wants to go to Australia.


If there is anything more you want to know about me or what I would like to do feel free to ask me. 

Thank you in advance and kind regards.

Last weeks chapters was one of the best one's I've read in the past year.  I was so satisfied with Yomo's development.  I was pleased that the clowns nonsense is coming to an end and it raises a question.  

The mangastream translation brings up an important piece that Ishida has sprinkled in with Uta.  The word ""emptiness.""  If I'm reading this correctly, Uta and the clowns have been doing everything to avoid feeling empty inside.  In my eyes, this is very important.  It's no coincidence that Amon is fighting Don and he is the person that knows emptiness the most.  Unlike the clowns, he has never run away from it and had to confront it.  Amon's ability and endurance to do what's right has allowed him to overcome all obstacles.  For right now.  

Where Uta begins to irk me is that he does have a counterpart that proves he can overcome his own self-destructive issues and immaturity.  Someone that is similar to what he is and could learn a thing or two from this person.  We all know this person as Shuu.  The parallels between these two are similar. 

 Shuu took pleasure  watching people get mauled like Uta.  Then he meets Kaneki and like Uta wants to eat his best friend. They have a major fight and Shuu, for the most part gets over it, and becomes a valuable asset to the GOAT team.  He starts caring about other people and grows a character.  Shuu gives me hope for Uta and makes me realize that he can overcome his own suffering, if he just believes in himself.  

 This is a bit different then Hide who wants to get eaten by Kaneki, although I would wager this was a no-win situation for the both of them and it was a necessary sacrifice to keep Kaneki alive against Arima.  Let's face it.  Everyone has speculated endlessly (including me) what Hide is.  He's a clown, secretly Uta, shape shifting Furuta, works for V, Washuu, sunlit garden, underground etc.  Is a quintuple agent working for a bunch of people at the moment and playing all sides. 

 If Hide was a clown, I see a connection to Itori with motherly issues at the forefront.  Hide would be doing all of this because he wants to keep it going.  He's in it to get the full effect and is sort of like a director that wants to see the pay off.  But if he is something else, that speaks to a major problem.  Sometimes, you don't put your bread in one basket and let the intern run things at the CCG.  

But when does trolling go to far.  This is something the clowns need to ask themselves.  They're need or addiction to derive pleasure from pain or having it inflicted on themselves is self-destructive.  Many have pointed out this is immaturity and Ishida has spoken the same thing through Yomo ""grow up Uta."" He's echoing the fan base.  The message is time to move on.  

The mutual destructive relationship speaks to a situation that I've seen in NieR Automata.  Androids vs. robots ,which gives them a purpose, although humanity has died out a long time ago and there's no reason for fighting.  Like TG, it raises the same questions regarding despair and suffering. 

Machines give birth to humans just like centipede giving birth to dragon Rize.    

 ""We will die and become as Gods.""  Kierkegaard machine followers leaping into lava, various philosphers, rethought  and critically analyzed.  Pascal seems to be the most well intentioned machine, but it makes you ask the big questions. I erase his mind and then he proceeds to sell his village body parts to me.  Was this really the right choice to be (lol) making with A2?  

Throughout the entire experience.  Gamers see that emptiness with the isolated environments.  They have to overcome their own suffering and help others persevere.  You can't do it alone, unless Ishida wants to invert this trope and allow Furuta to win.  

They're similar in the context of the lie to keep all of this going.  We find out there's a bit more going on with the Washuu's.  It's echoing the same reason the commander did everything in NieR universe and talked with 9S.  Let's face it we are in Route C ending right now and Ishida called his anime Root A with a mathematical abbreviation.  

Suffering rears its head again.  Will I delete my save file to help someone else?  Will I write a positive message for others suffering through NieR Automa? 

Overall, the message (imo) despite how it reads is a good message.  Suffering isn't worth it.  It can go to far and refusing emptiness, causesKaiju destruction.  It's one thing to joke around, but when you start causing chaos, release Kaiju, and then unleash some unstoppable plan for no apparent reason.  It's going to bring tragedy to everyone, even the clowns.  No one could win.

I guess that's the question I ask myself.   But I do think that its time for the Uta and the clowns to grow up.  Thoughts? "

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

I even thought the interview went well, but during the interview it was basically expressed that they were looking to hire immediately for a training course starting in 2 weeks.  

After then being referred to the selecting official and then not selected I figured it would be ok to apply again come the next hiring cycle. Come this most recent spring cycle I was immediately referred to the selecting offical and didnt have to interview again.  That was 2 months ago and today I finally heard I was not selected.  They gave me zero details and have been basically silent this entire time. 

With graduation a month out (this seems minor to me) could this have effected my selection? If the answer is ""no they just decided you werent worth it"" then I will accept that answer.  I felt that I was qualified for the position (why apply otherwise) having taken 4 courses on patents, regulation of products, composite materials and medical device development which all dealt heavily with the patent process and with 2+ years of hands-on industry experience from internships and jobs. 

Am I a victim of my schools late graduation or just an underqualified applicant? Should I apply again later? I really would like to work there."

I'm a 2nd year computer science student and for the 2nd semester of my third year I'm required to get a 4 month internship. I'm not sure who I should be emailing my CV to or what specifically I should be looking for.

I'd like to do something with programming as I enjoy the problem solving and critical thinking. Would there be any major do's and don'ts I should watch out for or anyone know anyone I could shoot a CV too?

I completed my undergrad internship at an organization specializing in sexual addiction and working with sex offenders court ordered to a treatment program. I decided to go on and get an MS but couldn't decide which program to apply to. I worked with plenty of amazing women, none of whom made my decision about future licensure any easier. 

I finally decided I wanted to go into our school's Clinical Mental Health Counseling program and become an LPCC. Long story short, there was an issue with the schools emaling systems and I was never notified about any of the interviews that I was invited to. The head of the MFT program called me two days before the interview for his program, and I was notified of the interviews for the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program only after they had already occurred. 

During the interviewing process for the Marriage and Family program, I fell absolutely in love. I felt like I was almost under a spell, it felt like the program was designed for me. I thought for sure LMFT was the way to go. I thought maybe it had all happened for a reason (fate).

The CMHC program did offer to interview me still, but I had to make a decision about the MFT program because they had accepted me the morning after the interview. I was so distraught and upset with the way the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program had handled things, and still dizzied by how amazing the interview process( where they also talked about the program and ""sold"" it to me) I declined the invitation.

I also have a professor whom has been a mentor to me for many years and advised me to go MFT.


I was accepted into the program and start in August, but as I read different threads about licensure, eligibility in the workforce, income and so on, I am starting to question whether I made the right decision. 

I live in MN, any MN natives or midwesterners have any advice? I would love to hear all and everyone's thoughts!"

* Prestige: Northeastern's gaining in prestige, their CS program is fantastic (#20 on csrankings.com), good UG research opportunities. Not much brand name due to its recent history though.

* Internships: Co-Op allows for three 6-month internships, lots of experience after I graduate, Boston has plenty of companies for hire.

* Finances: Should be covered for housing and tuition by parents, received heavy scholarship from Northeastern. Honors program allows me to travel for a short stint with dialogues if I ever want to too.

* Fit: I feel at home and there's comfort in knowing I'll receive a great education and most likely get a job due to being a big fish in the pond with co-ops. 
The people are cool but I'm concerned I'll be bored due to lack of sports, greek life, parties.


**USC**

* Location: New experience and being away from parents forces me to learn to be independent. Feeder school for Silicon Valley (+Big Four recruits much more heavily) and the startup scene there is enormous. However, I'll rarely see my friends and family being so far away and I don't know anyone there.

* Prestige: USC's CS program is top tier (#14 on csrankings.com). If I end up switching majors, their other majors in data, business and engineering are also top notch. 

* Internships: Trojan family and I'll be in LA/ California so they'll be abundant. However, it's much harder to coordinate internships with school and find them as I'll be competing with others.

* Finances: USC is 30k more and LA COL is high, but I'm able to afford it bc I am a spoiled child. Parents will cover it and I won't be in debt, but is it worth it? 

* Fit: Social life fits me well and their more creative, variety of student body also does, too, personality-wise, I'm a work hard, play hard kind of person. The USC student body seems stronger and more connected, so it'll be more competitive. I am concerned about the stereotype of snobby, rich kids though.

1) I know prestige doesn't matter too much for CS, but is the recruitment by Big4/Unicorn or entrepreneurial atmosphere differences between the schools considerable enough?

2) How are the schools viewed by the industry?

3) Boils down to ROI for me. Finance-wise, CS is generally lucrative, but are the entrepreneurial/industry connections associated with USC's brand-name and social life worth the extra price?

We met while we both worked as interns in the same company. I left after 2 years while she stayed for one more year and then also found another job.

While we were both in that company, everything was great. The job was fun with a lot of awesome coworkers, a very young and relaxed atmosphere, but eventually we both had the same criticisms, which is why we left. She also moved into a new flat to be closer to her new job (we don't live together).

While I like my new job, she had big problems with hers at first. In the first month or so she kept saying it was fine, but I could feel she wasn't honest. Eventually she broke down and told me she hated it because everything was so different from our old job and less fun. She seemed really depressed for a while and kept saying she regretted leaving the old job. I thought she just had to get used to it, but also told her it would be fine to quit and find another job. 

After a few months she changed into another department and says it is much better. But she is still often complaining because she says the old job was much more 'special' and 'exciting'. She has said that since leaving, her life has been feeling less 'intense and vibrant' and more 'flat and boring'. She also doesn't like her new flat. She says she doesn't feel at home there and just doesn't enjoy being there. I encouraged her to find something new then and while she is looking, she has been to look at maybe 3 flats and admitted she isn't even sure what she is looking for.

Now, she is clearly not very happy with her life but she also hasn't really changed anything substantial to make things better. She keeps going back and forth on the things she wants to do. One day she decides she will apply to job X which would be totally great and super and surely much better, and tells me about it like she has really decided 100%. When I ask after a while she says she never applied because she reconsidered. She even suggested she might go back and study again, 'something with science'. For a while she talked about moving to the countryside or even moving to another country. Then, that seemed off the table again and instead she wanted to move to another part of the city. Then, move into a shared flat with her best friend. So on, so on. It seems to change every few days yet she still hasn't actually committed to anything. But, while she is stable and in a good to neutral mood most of the time, she still gets phases where she seems really unhappy again and says she just hasn't been excited about anything in a while and life is just passing her by. She can then also get very irritable and wants to be alone. 

I think she is depressed or something similar, but she says she has been depressed in the past and it felt different? I'm not sure as I think I never had it.

---

tl,dr: My girlfriend hasn't been happy with her life for a while, keeps thinking of new ways to improve it, but never follows through and I don't know how to support/help her anymore"

8f6lfm,0,2018-04-26,Question regarding guards at a federal building,Holymolywtff,LosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/8f6lfm/question_regarding_guards_at_a_federal_building/,"Hello,

I was trying to renew my passport at the federal building at wilshire and noticed that the guards are excessively rude and hostile. I get it, their job is stressful, but it seems like they're intentionally being extra rude and aggressive. It's like they're looking for a fight even when it's just asking for instructions. 

I tried calling Mayor Garcetti's office because I wanted to know who to report this type of behavior and online wasn't very helpful. Even if nothing comes out of it, I didn't want to just passively sit there. I probably scared some poor intern because all she told me was to call the cops... as in LAPD... but doesn't that mean I'm basically calling the buddies of the guards? When I pointed this out, Mayor Garcetti's office person hung up on me.

I'm a bit... disturbed. So there's no one keeping these people in check? I know LAPD is corrupt as fuck, but there's really nothing being done about this? I just wanted to know if anyone knows anything more in depth about the current circumstances because I'm not completely unaware of all the shitty stuff happening. I always read about issues happening, but nothing about steps in fighting this. Is anything really being done? Do we have to harass our representatives like we're doing for net neutrality for them to do something? I feel like many people are very apathetic about stuff like this until it directly affects them. Even if this post goes no where, I still wanted to ask.

PS: Most of the people working IN the passport agency were very helpful and nice, especially the man dealing with the people in line. The guards during the afternoon shift (and I've seen different guards during the afternoon because I had to go multiple times for reasons. They're all like this. Morning shift isn't as friendly, but don't seem out to get you)... they act like everyone was insignificant and were enemies that need to be 'put in their place'.

Edit: Tried calling the mayor's office again to learn more. Finally someone picked up after over a dozen tries. They asked me what agency I was from, asking about police corruption, and when I said I was just a concerned individual, they transferred me to their voice mail. This is such a joke (and sad). No wonder people around me are leaving the US."
8f6lwp,2,2018-04-26,My Heart Hurts...,dmarsee96,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/8f6lwp/my_heart_hurts/,"Last week, my girlfriend of a year and nearly two months broke up with me. I don't know what to do. For background information, we were very happy together for months. Then seven months into our relationship, she was taken advantage of by someone close to her. This led to changes. We lost intimacy due to her being afraid and I began to smother her (as I just recently found out). A few months passed and she left for an internship across the country. During this internship, we had plans to get together with a couple of her other friends but I was unable to go. The friend that went was one that was a lot closer to her than I liked, but he was good support and I didn't want to be controlling of her so I didn't force her to stop spending time with him. As it turns out, while he was there, they cheated on me (which I just found out a couple weeks ago). After they cheated, a coworker then took advantage of her. So she was devastated by this. When she finally returned two weeks ago, she wasn't very intimate still. We had had no intimacy at this time for several months, but I gave her distance because I wanted to make sure she would heal properly. That is the time I learned more about the cheating and how serious it actually was. I was so willing to work with her and to fix our problems, but she told me that she was too afraid of commitment and didn't want to hurt me anymore, resulting in our breakup. This happened last Friday and we keep chatting (a lot slower than normal) because we agreed that we are good for each other and we should at least remain friends. Except I'm still not ready to give up on her. I just have no idea what to do. I can't tell how she feels about everything, and adding to the confusion, we are in a large group chat together and she said she would be the one to inform everyone of the breakup, yet she still hasn't. And on top of that, she still hasn't removed our relationship status from Facebook. So does anyone think there's any chance to fix the damage? Another thing to note is that I will soon be graduating college and we may be far apart.

tl:dr : Girlfriend and I have been together for over a year and have gone through a lot, and then she cheated and is confusing me on how she feels and I want to try to fix things with her."

We were ecstatic, and when we found out it was Triple Eviction night our hype levels were through the roof. Both of us are huge Big Brother fans and are constantly following live feeds and many past house guests.

My sister and I BOTH used a vacation day from work to go today. We get there and there's a long line. We thought no problem, we have reservations so it will be fine. While in line, we were told that they let in more sponsors than they expected so seats are limited. We got a bit concerned, but we were still ok. To our amazement the intern running the door was letting in non ticket holders before people with reservations!

The intern just decided that because she wasn't given clear enough instructions, she decide to let non ticket holders in before a lot of ticket holders. We were all pissed. After some rabbling, they decided to compensate us with finale tickets... 

Are you fucking kidding?! How do you expect us to believe that we'll be let in again despite your ""guarantee"" of tickets after this shit show? We used vacation days for today, not for the fucking finale! Especially when tickets were for a Triple Eviction! Even with their finale tickets offers, everyone with tickets that weren't let in were still pissed. Many of us think that the interns were letting in their friends.

Also, if you haven’t read the summary for [Chapter 2 on Respect](https://old.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/8cnh7l/for_women_only_respect_and_love_chapter_2/) you *may* want to do that as well. This post will assume you’ve read it.

*Disclaimer: this is a summary of Chapter 3 in the book [For Women Only](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Only-Revised-Updated-About/dp/1601424442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1523799560&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=for+women+only) not my own thoughts, feelings or research.*

Let’s get started.

***

The fearful question that a woman quietly asks herself is “Am I loveable”. We have a deep and innate desire to be loved and cared for.  In the last chapter we discussed our men’s correspondingly deep desire for respect. **The question for men is not then “am I lovable” it is instead “Do I measure up?”** And a man will look to those who know him best to answer that question. 


We think of our men as strong and confident with no self doubt. But in truth men have an inner vulnerability that stems from two competing drives. Men wants to tackle great challenges, try difficult things and conquer the world. Competing with this is the very real possibility of failure which is excruciating for men to consider and cope with. As we learned from Chapter 2, one of men’s greatest emotional needs is to feel competent at what they do. The problem is that men overwhelmingly feel that what they do is constantly being watched and judged. Though they have the drive to succeed they *feel* that they are one mess up from being found out as impostors.

The author’s studies found that about three quarters of men feel insecure and doubt their ability to ‘hack it’. This comes up in nearly all areas of their lives. This means work, home and play. The word she, and the men in her surveys, use to describe these feelings is “impostor”.  

The men in our lives are hiding a deep sense of self doubt. The inner uncertainty leaves even the most confident man dreading that he will be exposed for the imposter he feels himself to be. Even the most confident and in control men will often feel like like sometimes they are faking it and fear that their inadequacies will be discovered. 



Every man wants to do well and appear competent at whatever it is he sets out to do but 76% claimed that they are *“not always as confident as I look.”* A man worries that if anyone, like his boss or his loving wife, knew him for who he really is, they would realize the truth. This truth, of course, is that at least some of the time he’s not who he appears to be. He’s not the confident, self assured, competent man who he projects to the world. And the idea that someone knows he can’t cut it is humiliating.

&amp;nbsp;

### What is he thinking? 

It probably doesn’t cross your mind that your man is lacking in confidence. After all, you chose him and you have the utmost confidence in him. And when expressed properly, our confidence in him *can* translate into confidence in himself. But many men express these fears of inadequacy or being found out.

The surveys show that men think: 

* “**I’m always being judged** - Men are hard enough on themselves without any external pressure. But there *is* external pressure. And whether it is true or not, they feel that the eyes of the world are trained on them. Though it is us women who receive the blame for caving to social pressures; men also think about how others perceive them. They are being judged and so are their abilities. **Jokes about men’s inadequacies hurt most because they confirm men’s fear that they are being judged and are falling short.** 

* “**I have no earthly idea how to do this**” - Men can feel like they are impostors at what they do and often feel that they are running to stay one step ahead of others. This especially occurs when they have to do something new and unfamiliar. One man told the author that when given a new task or challenge he thinks, *“I have no idea how to do this and I hope I learn it before someone finds out”*. She originally thought that this was an attitude that affects only the young and inexperienced but through her research she heard the same sentiment from highly accomplished men as well. 

* “**But I want to do this**” In the face of self doubt, men still want to try something new and possibly fantastic. There is a fear that if they try they will be publicly outed as an ‘impostor’ but the only way for a man to move forward in the world is to try new things. **The times when men are attempting something new are the times when they will feel the shakiest and need the most encouragement**

&amp;nbsp;

### They can feel like impostors at work

There has always been uncertainty for a man regarding his adequacy at his job. This has only gotten worse for our men as companies act with less loyalty and fewer people stay in one firm for their entire careers. Men can feel incredible anxiety and uncertainty about how they are performing at work. There is usually an underlying fear of being found out and of course the subsequent consequences of being deemed an impostor by your boss. 

If you aren’t sure whether your man falls into this category, well, he probably does. But think about his behavior with work. Does he he works long hours to prove that he can provide for you? Does he come home drained because of the constant need to appear competent and on the ball? 

Professional sports and corporate America share the same “What have you done for me lately” attitude. Everyone is on the replacement list and you have to stay off the top. Insecurity seems logical when you look at it that way! This is often why men work such long hours. It is insurance in his mind that he won’t fall behind.

And the fear of failure isn’t entirely negative. It can drive him to get out of bed in the morning, to get to the gym, to accomplish his goals.  

&amp;nbsp;

### They can feel like impostors at home

A man’s performance anxiety doesn’t end at the front door. Many men reported feeling as concerned about inadequacy at home as in the office. Men want to be good husbands and fathers but they worry that they may not know how to succeed at everything required of them. And unlike the office, where success can be attached to numbers and performance reviews, the measure of success is *much* harder to pin down at home. 

**Many men judge their success as husbands based on the happiness and respect of their wives.** If a man is trying to bluff his way through being a husband, he will feel relieved when his wife feels loved and happy or publically honors how well he does at husbanding. If he gets the cold shoulder, a wife who challenges him or expresses displeasure or lack of respect it’s a sign to him that he’s an imposter and not doing well at his “good husband” goal. 

No man thinks he has all the answers. He’ll often look to his father as a role model. If he has a good father, he will mine those experiences for guidance. If, however, he had a bad father he’ll feel like he’s making it up as he goes along. 

Sometimes, if a man has the sense that he’s an impostor as a husband and father he will  withdraw from taking an active role with his wife and kids. He pulls away to protect himself if he doesn’t think he can do it well or be affirmed in what he’s doing.

Fair, probably not, but emotions aren’t fair. 

&amp;nbsp;

### What should we do for our men? 

It is often said that you cannot change a man. This is particularly the case when we are talking about the way he is wired. We can, however, impact how he feels about his ability to make his way in the world. 

Because men have these private doubts about how they measure up, our respect can be immeasurably important. Once we understand that these fears underly how he moves through the world we can see that our words and actions can make a huge impact.

The key is to soothing a man’s worries is affirmations and a bit of plain old flattery. If the person who knows him best believes in him, he is empowered to do well in every area of his life.  If he isn’t receiving affirmation from us, he’ll seek out places that he can receive affirmation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Never tear your man down. If a wife reinforces her husband’s fears of inadequacy it can become a self fulfilling prophecy**. In the survey’s the author found that *only* 1 man in 4 felt appreciated by their families. She suggests that it is unlikely that 3 out of 4 families did not appreciate their men but perhaps were not expressing their appreciation enough.

So even if we do truly appreciate our men, *and of course we do!*, are we showing it enough?

Your husband has to be convinced that his wife thinks he’s the greatest. If he doesn’t feel this way, he’ll seek out validation elsewhere. There are many place men will seek solace from an unappreciative family: 

* Maybe he’ll spend more time at work where he feels alive and on top of his game, 

* He might spend too much time watching sports for the competitive thrill 

* Some men will retreat to a workshop or office where they are in control of their environment or tasks 

* Another will seek out the intern who admires him.

* Some participate in sports where there is built in admiration and accomplishment 

None of these (well maybe the intern) are negative indulgences for your man. If he finds something that makes him feel alive and encouraged, great! However, other pursuits should not be a retreat for an unsatisfying home life.

&amp;nbsp;

**Our goal is to make him feel alive and encouraged at home first and to act as a cheerleader for his other endeavors. This means admiring him for his accomplishments, bragging about him to friends, expressing what a wonderful father and husband he is. And of course sex.**

Sex **is** affirmation!!!! It plays a huge role in a man’s self confidence. A man can be having a horrible time in every other area of his life but if his woman wants him physically he’ll feel capable of handling it all. On the other hand, if he gets the *don’t touch me* message at home then it will be more devastating than failures in the other areas and he’ll feel an impostor in every area. 

Home should be a comfortable safe zone for a man. If work is a place of judgement, then home should be a place where he can relax and open up. It should not be a place where a man feels one misstep away from being exposed. 

And this can be hard. If we don’t pay attention, it’s easy to only notice our men’s mistakes. If we find ourselves in a pattern of noticing mistakes too often (and not praising accomplishments large and small) we create a situation where our men cannot relax and open up at home. It is up to us to create the intimate and safe environment to make it possible for him to let down his guard. 

**Home should be a retreat from the pressure of having to perform.** 

&amp;nbsp;

### The gift of confidence. 


Men put a lot of pressure on themselves. One man told the author, “I want my wife to understand my weakness and shortcomings and still want me. I want her encouragement to become the man I can be.”  And ladies, I’m sure you already feel confident that he can be everything he believes he can be. The only additional step is to express those feelings!

By staunchly supporting them and their goals, by constantly showing and telling them that we believe in them, and by providing a safe environment for them to come home to, we can give our men the confidence to dive into the work fray. 

Jack Welsh explains (*emphasis mine*): 

&gt; Perhaps the greatest single gift she gave me was self confidence. It is what I looked for and tried to build in every executive who has ever worked with me. *Confidence gives you courage and extends your reach. It lets you take greater risks and achieve far more than you ever thought possible.* Building self confidence in others is a huge part of leadership. It comes from providing opportunities and challenges for people to do things they never imagined they could do; rewarding them after they reach success in every way possible.

A wife can give her husband that confidence. You must realize that in spite of the veneer of confidence our men still crave our affirmation that they’ve done good. Tell him, often, that you are proud of him and believe in him, brag about him and his accomplishments loudly to the world and show him how much you desire him as a man.

**Life is a battle and if he can return home to someone who supports him unconditionally, he can slay dragons.**

8f73wx,1,2018-04-26,Cal Poly SLO vs. UC Davis,ajunnice,collegecompare,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegecompare/comments/8f73wx/cal_poly_slo_vs_uc_davis/,"I got into Cal Poly SLO with a major in graphic communications and UC Davis with a major in Cognitive Science (trying to have a Computational Emphasis as well). 

Both schools were very high on my list when I applied. I've visited UC Davis and Cal Poly SLO more than once and I love the social aspect at both colleges.

So What I am really torn about is the academic part of both schools. I want to do something in the field of UI/UX. I know there isn't a major exactly geared towards UI/UX so I tried to choose a major that would best prepare me for the field. I don’t know which college will best prepare me for this, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!

I have also heard that Cal Poly SLO is really good about getting students internships and jobs, which is really important. How great is UC Davis at getting jobs and internships for students?

I know my post seems sortve specific, but I would really appreciate any advice and/or experiences, even if it’s general. Thank you !!"

8f8i39,1,2018-04-26,Next step with this girl I like.. she may have a BF. [22M],_okal,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8f8i39/next_step_with_this_girl_i_like_she_may_have_a_bf/,"So about one week ago, I [22M] met a girl [23F] at a concert in my hometown.  We hit it off right away, and we talking/hung out the entire concert.  She ended up coming over to my friend's place later (who was throwing a party), and we talked and were really hitting it off more. We exchanged contact info then, and i saw on her instagram that she had a boyfriend.  I wasn't sure if they were still dating or not, since it was a post from like 5 months ago.  Anyway, I found out that night that she lived across the country for her internship, but was finishing in up this summer and is moving back after that.  

At the end of the night, we hugged and she seemed sad to go (her friends and her were flying back at 8am).  Even though we were at a party and both drunk, I didn't pull any moves because of that BF post I saw.  Like a day went by, and I kept thinking of if I should message her, even though she was so far away.  Luckily, she ended up replying to one of my instagram stories, and we have been messaging pretty much nonstop since then.  And they're good conversations..ones that we are both putting good effort into. Now, if this were any other girl, I would definitley think she was interested in me.  However, because of the boyfriend posts and stuff, I'm not sure she might not just be a very friendly person that happens to get along super well with me.  Either way, she's is definitely interested in conversing with me.

I'm kind of at a loss with what to do.  Should I ask her about the boyfriend? Or would that be pointless at this point in time, given that she lives far away and wouldn't even be moving back to the general area for at least a few months? In the very least, I'd like to be friends with her since we have a ton of common interests.  I wouldn't want her to stop talking to me if i ask about the BF.

Thanks yall"
8f8k3f,19,2018-04-26,I'm Burnt Out- How Do ya'll Cope when your whole life is falling apart?,Cojesita,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/8f8k3f/im_burnt_out_how_do_yall_cope_when_your_whole/,"This is a sad rant, ya'll, so gracias. TL;DR: I feel like nothing is going well in my life, and being pre-med has just made it worse. How do you cope with these problems?

1. **My visa was rejected for my summer internship and now I don't have time to apply for a new one.** My program told me to apply for a certain type of visa, and so I did. It turns out that I was supposed to apply for another type, which takes 6-8 weeks to process and my 1k flight (round-trip) is leaving May 30th so I don't have the time to re-apply. I'm still going to do it, but this is what broke me. This is going to upset my ability to graduate, my scholarship for this program, and the fact that I'm going to lose $1k (yeah I know you don't book flights early, but right now the flights are going for $1.3 minimum).

2. **My grades are bad** I have a 3.7x right now, which is okay but I'm behind in all of my classes and finals are right around the corner and I don't know if I can catch up. I also know that I'm going to get a B in one of my science classes which isn't bad but I don't deserve that grade.

3. **I am pretty sure I did poorly on the MCAT** I tested 4/21 and I am god-awful at physics and organic chemistry, and I really didn't want to take a second gap year.

4. **I have not had time to grieve for the death of a close family member** This is the worst one on my list. Granted, this person was old and it was expected, but it still tore my heart into pieces. I didn't visit them as much because I'm studying out of state, and I was studying for the MCAT, and now I won't ever see them again. Their death was also two weeks before the MCAT, so I was definitely in a good mood for it /s. I feel like I chose the MCAT (and failed) over spending quality time with this person I loved so deeply. I also am ashamed that I wasn't able to protect this person from another manipulative, money-selfish person because I'm a college student and not a real adult. I can barely support myself.

I promised them that the moment my MCAT was done, I would go and visit them the day after. The last time I saw them, I gave them a quick hug and ran because I had to catch a bus back to college. I didn't say goodbye.

5. **My senior project came out bad** Because of everything, I didn't give this project as much attention as I should have, and I really, really, liked it. I'm supposed to be proud of this project, but instead I'm ashamed.

6. **My mental health is no bueno**. I am finding myself crying on small things, I start laughing while crying, and honestly I feel like my heart is hurting a lot. Also, I'm so unhealthy right now thanks to late night take-out because I didn't have time to cook. 

7. **Goodbye $$$* The MCAT was expensive, and I also couldn't work this semester because I was doing too much. Also take-out food was hella expensive and now I have no money (I am the culprit for this one, don't feel bad for me).

8. **What's the politically-correct word for ""at-risk of homeless""?** With my family member's passing, I don't have a safe place to store my possessions during the summer. I have a parent, but this parent is irresponsible, abuses alcohol, doesn't have room for me in their house, and uses my health insurance and residency to manipulate me. Like I've been threatened to get kicked-out because I don't agree with their political opinions, or tell them to stop drinking, etc. 

This cycle wrecked me, and it hasn't even started. Between MCAT, LoRs, clinical experience, I'm so stressed, apathetic, depressed, and angry. I feel like I can't keep it together, that my head is stuck in a vice grip or that there's an artery in my head that's gonna blow. I'm seething that the MCAT touts the information of how stress is bad for you, my cortisol levels are high, perhaps I'm using learned helplessness or low self-efficacy or I'm not meeting Mazlow's basic principles or I'm using self-serving bias, and it causes so much of that .

And the worst part of it all, it makes me question my ability to become a doctor. I used to think of myself as a strong, independent, resilient person who could get into medical school. But now I feel like I'm a ghost of what I was, that I'm this neurotic ball of anxiety and depression. How can I expect to help other people's health when my own is so bad? 

I feel like I'm drowning. Applying to medical school is hard, and it's absolutely ridiculous when you come from a poor(ish), split, dysfunctional family. And I'm not talking ""oh boo hoo, I have to go to my dad's house on the weekends"". I'm talking about trying to feed my sibling and I because no one buys groceries, during the winter there'd be no heat, in the summer no running water. Substance abuse is a problem in my family (nothing hardcore), I've been arrested thanks to my parent's negligence. This has been going on for years, and it never stops. I always tell myself it'll get better, it was a bad day. But a bad day becomes a bad week, a bad month, a bad year, a bad life. And I'm angry that I could be perceived as weak from being tired just trying to apply to medical school, BUT IT IS SO DAMN HARD TO APPLY AND WORRY ABOUT ACADEMICS WHEN YOUR REAL LIFE OF HOUSING, FAMILY, REALITY IS JUST PLAIN AWFUL.

What do you guys do when you have the premed blues? What are you guys going through, and are you okay? When you feel defeated, how do you tell yourself that it's okay that you want to be a doctor?

Thanks for reading, ya'll."
8f8rxw,26,2018-04-26,[14x21 Spoilers] I can hear it now...,SyanideElix,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/8f8rxw/14x21_spoilers_i_can_hear_it_now/,"*""My client, Dr. Roy, had a brief yet very sexual relationship with one of the Head of Trauma surgeons, Dr. April Kepner. They would party together, he would stay over her house, they once even showered together, however, when it came to acknowledging him in public, she would completely shun him out. It wasn't soon before she abruptly ended the relationship without any reason. And then, he was shortly fired after that.*

*Firstly, a superior getting involved with an intern? Already there is a power imbalance, seeing that she has the power to ruin his brand new career at any given moment if he ever did something she didn't like. But! With her being the ex-wife of Dr. Jackson Avery, Harper Avery's grandson, could she have ended the relationship out of.....perhaps, appearance sake and had Dr. Roy fired with the excuse of ingesting marijuana cookies? The same cookies that were supplied to him by Dr. Arizona Robbins?*

*Especially in the midst of a huge, breakout sexual harrassment scandal, could they, meaning Dr. Kepner and Dr. Avery, have conspired against my client and fired him to keep another incident from hitting the news?""*

I can hear Roy's lawyer pulling a Calzona custody battle kind of slugfest. And I can also see Maggie flipping out once again, accusing Jackson of firing an intern for April. Knowing Grey's, they're going to make this lawsuit be a fucking mess."

However, I saw the reputation Fisher at OSU has and decided to pursue business instead; I chose finance as I figured this would be the most quantitative. My undergrad experience will be over in SP19 and, although I loved the instructors and the content of the courses, I with there was more stats. I'd really like to advance to grad school and study something related to stats (PhD in Stats, Ops Research, Biostats, Applied Maths, etc.) and I believe I have great credentials to get into a top school (&gt;3.9 GPA, 3 great internships, undergrad thesis) but I am stuck on the 'in-between'. My long-term goal is to do something research-based in industry that requires heavy statistical modeling (quantitative finance, biostats (my dad worked in pharmaceuticals as a statistician and the projects were really interesting)).

Should I go straight to grad school or get work experience? If work, would employers help fund a PhD program (I know some fund Masters so this is a potential option too)? When selecting a school is there any sources that help list the best programs for Stats &amp; Biostats PhD's? 

On a side note, I know I will need to learn programming. I've only used Minitab and Tableau for my stats projects in undergrad but I know coding will be crucial. Any tips for how to begin? Which ones are common? Any ones with easy UI's? "
8f96xc,3,2018-04-27,Does he still love me?,Rose22224,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8f96xc/does_he_still_love_me/,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for roughly 2.5 years. We met Freshman year of college as lab partners. Things were great at first, he would write me love notes, buy me flowers, and just overall want to be with me. I understand once you are with someone for awhile obviously much of this stuff goes away. We moved in together roughly about a year ago and that is when stuff started to go downhill. I have let myself go the past year and half. I have gained about 30-40 pounds. I should also mention that him and I are in the same major. We see each other everyday at the house, in class, and on the weekend when hanging out with our friends. Within this past few months I noticed whenever I try to cuddle around him, he would not respond, and he no longer would want to do things like hold my hand, go on dates, let alone sleep together. I decided to sit down and talk to him about it, and he said that lately we have been in a rut. That it is not as special to see one another because we are always together. I completely understood this, and we both agreed to try and do more individual activities. However, it has been a few weeks since our talk and he has not really changed... When I try and get close to him he does not respond, he has no sex drive towards me.. When I ask if he still cares for me he says he does. I know part of it might be that I have gained weight and maybe that is why he is not as attracted to me, but he would never say that to me. I am leaving in a few weeks for an internship that is a couple months long, and I am hoping time apart will bring back the sparks. Overall I just generally feel undesired and unwanted by him... I have no one to really talk to about this that would understand. I can't understand how he is feeling and I just have to know, is this a savable relationship or has his love for me gone away?"

I am currently a sophomore year college student facing a financial dilemma.

So currently, I am working at a job where I make $15 an hour. The past year and a half I worked full time, and was able to amass $6k in an employer 401k, $1.2k in a Roth IRA, $5k in a 529 education account (father set it up years ago), and $1.2k in a high yield savings account.

Here is my dilemma: I currently save around 50% of what I make after tax, and project to have around $5k in Savings by the end of the summer (Start of next semester). My retirement accounts will increase by about $1k each as well. My school schedule conflicts directly with my work schedule, and there is a high probability I will have to quit the job, but I will try to do what I can to keep it (20hrs a week max).

Given that I quit, would it be in my best interest to cash out the 401k plan if I leave? After federal and state taxes, minus the penalty, I should get approx $5500 back. My expenses only include car insurance and gas, which total to no more than $350 a month. I figured if I just cashed it out, I would have money to cover my bills for the next 3 years, and even then I'm on track to have a decent paying job out of college (CS internships).

In the case that I don't cash out, however, by the time I retire (47 years approx), the money would be worth north of $150k with a rate of return of 6%, minus inflation cost. That would be valuable money in retirement.

In the case that I don't leave the job, and resume working a forecasted 20hr a week schedule, all my expenses would be covered without worry, and each 6 month period, minus car insurance, my savings would have a net gain of $1k, so $2k a year total in savings gain, and my retirement accounts would also increase, albeit a lot slower than I am used to.

I guess my real question is, should I focus on building a solid cash reserve NOW, and therefore have the ability to focus fully on my studies, or just leave the money in the 401k, and let it grow until retirement? 

EDIT: Added the fact that I have a 529 education account in the beginning.

8fbita,6,2018-04-27,Incurable,cosmicoutlets,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/8fbita/incurable/,"**This story has depictions of suicide in it, if that is triggering, please don’t read it**

Today is not a good day. I sometimes have those, but they’re becoming more infrequent as the months pass. Sometimes they’re all I have left to hope for. Then again, hope is for losers, so I just twiddle my thumbs in this hospital bed waiting to croak. I just wish they could turn the sound down on the machines I’m hooked up to. The last thing I need is to be reminded my body wants to keep going.

I shouldn’t think like that though, my mother often worries when she sees me looking off into the distance in deep thought. It’s almost always about how I’ll die. She reminds me that thinking about my end will only make it come faster. At this point, that might not be so bad. I’ve been past the point of living each day to its fullest for the last year.

I’ve been here for three years, battling an illness with no name. All they know is that it’s chronic. My muscles are always sore, whether I move them or not. My hair is falling out, and I can’t gain weight no matter how hard I try. My face is sometimes swollen beyond recognition and goes into fits of pins and needles or numbness. Amid that, there are random aches and pains that make my life miserable.

Since my diagnosis, it’s been a long process for me to accept the fact that this illness has no cure. Now that I have, I spend a lot of time thinking of ways for it to happen. Maybe I’ll have a seizure. Could be that this thing will suddenly crush my lungs or drown me the next time I drink some water. The only thing I’ve never contemplated is ways to do it myself. Nature is way more creative, and I love surprises.

My family has already had someone write up a will, signed the DNR, and paid for my funeral. It’s all just a waiting game from now on.

It’s now that wonderful time of day where the nurse who changes my colostomy bag comes in and tries to make small talk. I can hear her shrill laughter down the hallway approaching and my stomach turns. She speed-walks into the room, bending her arms at the elbows and swaying them as she approaches my bed. She shoots me a toothy smile that wrinkles her eyes and asks me how I’m doing.

“Fine I guess” I reply curtly.

“Well isn’t that great news!” she exclaims. Somehow she seems even more cheerful than normal.

My mother jolts awake at the pitch of the nurse’s voice. Sitting in the recliner to my right, her greying hair and bloodshot eyes make her look like more of a patient than I do.

“Good morning” she mumbles, smoothing out her hair and pulling on her shirt to release three-day-old wrinkles.

“Good Morning, Mrs. Frank, I hope you slept well” the nurse says, smiling face in-tact. “Now, Jenny” the nurse begins, reaching for the bag under my shirt. “I’ve heard some really exciting news buzzing around the hospital lately.”

“You don’t say” I reply, wincing as she removes the giant adhesive bandage from my side.

“Oh yes, it seems there’s a new treatment trial to alleviate some of the symptoms you have. Dr. Geyman says you’re a perfect candidate.”

My mother and I look at each other, her with a giant smile and me with a look of terror. Hearing the words “treatment trial” was basically her bat signal. She started crying and without saying anything, pleaded with me to consider it.

“What does the trial entail?” I asked. I’ve been through chemo and radiation therapy with only minimal results. I wasn’t about to do either of those again.

“It’s a surgery. They place a chip in your brain so it hard-wires it back to the way it was when it was healthy. It helps the rest of your body function properly and gives it time to heal in the process.” She was practically jumping out of her skin.

Granted, this was expected after being in this stupid hospital for so long. It wouldn’t surprise me if she was this chipper because she had money on finding a cure.

“That sounds too good to be true” I mused.

“Well what do you have to lose?” my mother interjected. “You’re so ready to die, what if this seals the deal? It can’t hurt to try, right?”

I knew she was being manipulative, but she had a point. I only slightly nodded and sent the nurse into a frenzy of jumping and clapping, forsaking the task at hand.

***

“Alright Jenny, I need you to count backwards from 10 for me.” A tall male nurse was hovering over me, my face covered with a mask. They’d shaved my head and prepped me for surgery. The room smelled sterile and metallic. It was the culmination of weeks of testing to make sure I was a good fit for the chip. It really helped that I kept answering every question with “I’m ready to die, so why not.”

The room blurred out and as I reached number 4, my eyes closed on their own, sending me into a deep sleep. The next thing I remember was waking up in a hospital bed. About five people were crowded around me. Dr. Geyman, my mom and dad, younger sister, and the chipper nurse. They were all leaning in and staring at me expectantly. I noticed, to the left, a group of people in lab coats, furiously scribbling things down onto clipboards.

I tried to speak, but as I opened my mouth, Dr. Geyman reached towards me and motioned for me to stop. His voice was muffled. I must have looked confused, because he smiled and patted my shoulder.

I couldn’t feel the top of my head and the wires I had attached to me made moving very difficult.  I’d even tried to reach for a glass of water at one point and nearly pulled out one of three IV’s. As the day progressed, my hearing got better, but it was still strange to see lips moving with no sound.

I also noticed that as the day went on, the consistent pain I felt in my lower back and aches in my muscles were gone. This made me nervous. I didn’t think this was going to work. Hell, I didn’t think I would wake up at all.

A whiteboard and marker appeared to my left in the hands of the male nurse from before. On it was written how do you feel? in black marker. I wrote Fine, can’t really hear. Muscles aren’t sore.

When my mother read it, she burst into tears and clutched onto my father for dear life. I guess that was a good thing. Uh-oh.

Dr. Geyman wrote something down for a while and handed it back to me. It said hearing loss is normal and should be temporary. The fact that your muscles aren’t sore is a great thing. It means the chip is working.

I wanted to cry. Not because I was happy, but because I didn’t want the chip to be working. I didn’t want this stupid surgery in the first place. I thought brain surgery would kill me. How badass would it be to be a corpse with a hole in my head and brains spilling out of it?

Without my say-so a tear slipped down my cheek. The fact that I could feel it without pins and needles was only more upsetting. My parent’s both reached for my hand when they saw me crying and squeezed it tightly. I’d never seen them so relieved.

***

It’s been three weeks and already I feel like my old self. I can walk without pain and my face isn’t swollen and painful. I’ve gained 10 pounds, and have a thin layer of fuzz on my head.

I hate it.

I’m trying my best to stay positive for my parents and the doctors that are so invested in my progress, but apparently the chip isn’t strong enough to change my thought patterns. I’m still ready to die and don’t have the hope I did before that this will all soon be over.

If anything, it’s making me more depressed than I was that I might survive this. I might be the girl they name this disease after, I might be the sole survivor of this chip thing. It’s almost too much pressure. I might look happy and feel better, but I’m falling apart at the seams.

Right now I’m lying in my hospital bed, a zombie, staring out of the window. I’m alone, save the beeping of that damn monitor. The dark thoughts start creeping in yet again, but I hang on. They’re the only thing left that feels like me.

You know, they’ve already paid for your funeral, you’re ready to be gone. Why not take care of it now? The doctors got what they wanted, they know the chip works, let them try it on someone else once you’re gone.

It’s like a subtle whisper through my mind, wrapping me in warmth and comfort. I consider it for the first time; ending it myself.

This illness won’t take you now. You’ll have to do it on your own.

A nurse entering the room with a tray of food breaks my train of thought, but before the voice disappears, I’ve already made up my mind.

***

I’m alone yet again, my mother at work and the nurses on their lunch break. It’s been a few days since I’ve made up my mind and I know how I’m going to do it. It’ll be quick and painless, or so I hope. I saw this on a TV show once and it didn’t look too bad.

I grabbed an empty syringe from a nurse cart when I went for my walk earlier today. It was now clutched in my clammy, yet steady hand. I took some deep breaths. I’m not going to lie, I was scared, but more anxious to get it over with than anything else.

The syringe was thick, with an end that screwed onto an IV port. I pulled the plunger all the way back and screwed the top to the piss yellow IV port in my left forearm. I took one last deep breath and quickly pushed air into the IV tube. I watched it go through the tube and into my arm. Almost immediately, I seized and felt like my lungs had exploded. My body was jerking around and the monitors were going nuts.

A frantinc new intern ran into my room and screamed before she smacked the code blue button above my bed.

The lights faded as I was surrounded by people, just standing there. The nurse didn’t know I was DNR but hit the button anyway.

As the seizure calmed down, I took my last gasping breath and serenely closed my eyes for the last time, a smile parting my thin lips for the first time in three years."
8fc3p5,35,2018-04-27,"Brent Hubbs: ""Vols football commitment at an all-time high""",RobertNeyland,ockytop,https://www.reddit.com/r/ockytop/comments/8fc3p5/brent_hubbs_vols_football_commitment_at_an/,"https://tennessee.rivals.com/news/titles-titles-titles?guccounter=1

&gt; When Jeremy Pruitt was introduced as Tennessee's head coach on Dec. 7, new athletic director Phillip Fulmer was asked directly about the program’s financial commitment to football moving forward.
&gt; 
&gt; The former Hall of Fame head coach had been on the job less than a week, but since Pruitt was coming from Alabama, where the investment of resources into football is the benchmark for every school in the country, it was a pertinent question.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there a plan to expand Tennessee’s commitment to football?
&gt; 
&gt; At the time, Fulmer admitted he wasn't clear on what all Alabama was doing, but the new AD acknowledged his program would do whatever it took to be competitive.
&gt; 
&gt; “I have to get into it a bit more to know what Alabama has done,” he said
&gt; 
&gt; “Whatever they have done has been very successful. We will commit to being competitive with the top of this league. I will leave it at that.”
&gt; 
&gt; Nearly five months later, the first-time AD has certainly backed up those words.
&gt; 
&gt; The school’s 2018 football salaries for new head coach Jeremy Pruitt, strength and conditioning coordinator Craig Fitzgerald and the 10 on-field assistants is over $10 million — easily a school record total in money allocated.
&gt; 
&gt; Pruitt will make $3.8 million in 2018, which currently ranks fifth in the SEC behind only Nick Saban, Jimbo Fisher, Dan Mullen and Gus Malzahn. Kirby Smart will jump Pruitt in the near future once his raise his announced.
&gt; 
&gt; Tennessee’s strength coach and 10 on-field assistants are set to make more than $6 million this year. In 2017, former Vols coach Butch Jones made $4.1 million, while nine on-field assistants plus strength coach Rock Gullickson made $4.975 million.
&gt; 
&gt; So in Pruitt’s first season, his on-field staff will make $1.025 million more than Jones’ final staff ($9.075 million) at Tennessee. Additionally, five of Pruitt's assistants are on 3-year contracts, while none of Jones' assistants ever had a deal with a 3-year term.

**COMPARING TENNESSEE'S FOOTBALL INVESTMENT: 2017 vs. 2018**

**2017 ** | **2018** | 
:---: | :---: | 
Total staff salaries: $9.075 million | Total staff salaries: $10.095 million | 
Total support staff salaries: $703,398\* | Total support staff salaries: $1.236 million\* | 
Average salary for on-field assistants/S&amp;C coordinator: $497,500 | Average salary for on-field assistants/S&amp;C coordinator: $572,272 | 
Number of 3-year contracts: 0 | Number of 3-year contracts: 5 | 

*Only quality control analysts, administrative staffers and player development coaches were counted.

&gt; The Vols are definitely still playing catch-up to Alabama — the Tide’s nine on-field assistants, not including strength coach Scott Cochran, made over $6 million in 2017 — but their increase in support, on and off the field, is noticeable.
&gt; 
&gt; One of the key components to the “Alabama model” is building a deep support staff.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2016, CBSSports.com reported that the support staff salaries — including the entire recruiting office, video department, strength staff, training staff and equipment staff — for both Alabama and Clemson were over $3 million.
&gt; 
&gt; Schools can have 10 on-field coaches, five strength and conditioning staffers and four graduate assistants, per NCAA rules, but support staffs are unlimited. As are their salaries. Alabama has taken full advantage of that liberty for years.
&gt; 
&gt; Last May on a radio show, former Tennessee coach and Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin said the Tide’s was so big that “I was there three years, and I still didn't learn everybody's name in that building. There were so many people. There's somebody for everything. (Coach Saban) has a very large staff of a lot of people. Obviously, he's done that so he that he's got all areas covered and everybody for something.”
&gt; 
&gt; Under Pruitt, the Vols are aggressively getting into that game now, too.
&gt; 
&gt; Remember what Tennessee’s head coach said at his introductory press conference?
&gt; 
&gt; “Let's get our hands out of our pockets. Let's roll our sleeves up. Let's get ready to get in the streets with everyone else in the SEC,” Pruitt said.
&gt; 
&gt; “Let's not talk about it. Let's go do it.”
&gt; 
&gt; They are.
&gt; 
&gt; Already, Fulmer has given Pruitt the green light to follow the Alabama model, significantly upping its level of commitment with administrative and off-field support staffers.
&gt; 
&gt; In Pruitt’s first season with the Vols, his quality control analysts and administrative salaries combine for $1.236 million, per an open records request by VolQuest.com.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s an increase of nearly $533,000 compared to Jones’ final staff at Tennessee, which totaled $703,398 in 2017.

**NAME** | **TITLE** | **SALARY** | 
:---: | :---: | :---: | 
John Lilly | Assistant to the Head Coach | $140,000  | 
Drew Hughes | Player Personnel Director | $190,000  | 
Danny Stiff | Assistant Player Personnel | $50,000  | 
Todd Watson | Director of Operations | $225,000  | 
Kevin Simon | Player Development | $125,000  | 
Joe Osovet | Player Development | $85,000  | 
Patrick Abernathy | Player Development | $70,000  | 
Bert Biffani | Quality Control Analyst | $40,000  | 
Carter Blount | Quality Control Analyst | $40,000  | 
Montario Hardesty | Quality Control Analyst | $65,000  | 
Tino Sunseri | Quality Control Analyst | $85,000  | 
Kevin O'Brien | Quality Control Analyst | $40,000  | 
Ryan West | Quality Control Analyst | $41,200  | 
Brandon Deaderick | Quality Control Analyst | $40,000  | 
Vince Lewis | Quality Control Analyst | Volunteer | 


&gt; Last year, Tennessee listed seven quality control coaches who were interns or analysts. Those seven were paid a total of $355,850, per open records.
&gt; 
&gt; Pruitt's first staff has eight quality control coaches, one of whom is actually a volunteer coach. Combined, the seven analysts will make $351,200.
&gt; 
&gt; The difference with Pruitt's staff is the administrative positions and salaries. Butch Jones' 2017 staff had four player personnel staff members, who made a total of $347,548.
&gt; 
&gt; Pruitt has five administrators with a job title of player personnel or player development, and that doesn’t even include “assistant to the head coach” John Lilly. Combined they make $660,000.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2017, Jones’ director of football operations Jake Kirkendoll made $85,000. Pruitt's ops director Todd Watson is making $225,000. In total, the seven administrative positions are making $885,000. That's double the salaries Tennessee paid out for similar positions in 2017.
&gt; 
&gt; VolQuest.com did not compile the numbers or salaries of the entire recruiting office, video department and training/equipment staff, as those positions are still being filled and managed. The changes will certainly add to the new bottom line, though.
&gt; 
&gt; Pruitt still has additional positions to fill, too, as his on-campus recruiting coordinator Makenzie Franklin is departing the program, per sources, and that position is expected to command a six-figure salary in 2018 — nearly doubling what it was in 2017.
&gt; 
&gt; Pruitt also moved Patrick Abernathy from the position of high school relations coordinator into a player development role, so that position is open as well, should Pruitt elect to fill it.
&gt; 
&gt; What’s most notable about Tennessee’s increase in resources and support under Pruitt is the school’s new philosophical change of reinvesting in the football program.
&gt; 
&gt; The money has been there for years. Now they’re spending some of it — both on staff and facility upgrades like redoing the weight room floor for the second time in less than five months.
&gt; 
&gt; Tennessee led the SEC in both revenue ($109 million) and profit ($80.6 million) in 2015-16, per the U.S. Department of Education athletic filings as reported by TheAdvocate last June. However, the Vols ranked in the middle of the pack in expenses, spending almost half ($29 million) of what Alabama ($56.1 million) put back into its football program.
&gt; 
&gt; Fulmer has charged Pruitt with turning around Tennessee's program. He's allocating him the resources to do it, too. The reality is that the cost of playing football in the SEC is greater than it's ever been.
&gt; 
&gt; Pruitt knows it. Fulmer understands it, and Tennessee's payroll ledger in 2018 shows it.

My adult son with ASD has graduated college but does not have a job yet. He is quite depressed over this. Now he has a job interview in another town for being a cashier. He has a degree in computer science but cannot get a job.  The store in the other town is one that he really liked going to growing up. 

He had an interview earlier this week. At the interview, they set up for a second interview, which is today. Well, I am supposed to go to a school picnic for my 2nd grader! Today! At 12:15. My son's interview is in the other town at 1pm. Now I have to miss the school picnic, the last big event of the year at the school, because my adult son will have my car. 

Part of me feels like I just need to be supportive. He has ASD and has had a rough go of things, so, just re-arrange my life and miss things. But the other part of me feels like if only he had bothered to get a job during the summers all these years, in high school and college, we would not be in this situation. I even tried to get him to apply for internships when in college and he refused to do that. He actually said that last summer ""this is my last summer that I get to relax so I just want to do that, not work all summer.""

Any advice? There is no public transportation here and since the job is just some minimum wage job, it is unlikely that he will earn enough to cover the cost of buying himself a car."

The very first company that I applied to gave me a human email response  (not the robot like or automated responses here in the US), went through 3 rounds of interviews, they're processing my visa and I'm flying out in a few days. 

That's it! This company saw enough value and potential in me to justify getting me a visa and flying me out there vs hiring a local candidate. 

I guess what you can take of this is that employment here in the US is going to shit. I would suggest to all of you look into employment abroad. 

P.S. I can speak the local language so I guess that was a big plus for the company to hire me, however they do conduct business in English and all the interviews were in English so I think it would't matter. 

Good luck to all of you
Don't give up

8fdc1y,1,2018-04-27,[M4F] Hopeless romantic goofball seeking literate partner for sickeningly sweet role play,PicklesTheRealtor,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8fdc1y/m4f_hopeless_romantic_goofball_seeking_literate/,"**Everything here is 18+**


So, I'll get this out of the way quickly, I'm really just looking for some folks who write well and can provide additional fun things to keep the role play going along. If you can do that in a couple of paragraphs, perfect, short and sweet is always fun and usually makes things go faster. If you'd like to write 6+ that's also fine, I adore details and it gives more insight into the character's actions and thoughts. What I'm trying to say here is I'm fine with whatever! As far as writing style if you prefer first or third let me know and we can go with whatever you're more comfortable with!

Now, onto the actual meat of this whole thing. What I'm looking for is just a fun and entertaining role play that starts off with two people probably awkwardly getting to know each other as it grows into a relationship. This could happen in a ton of different ways and depending on any particular pairing you might have in mind that could change how things can start or change drastically. I'm open to pretty much anything, but I prefer playing a somewhat awkward and goofy fellow who probably doesn't have much of any real experience with ladies. I think I've gotten pretty good at that kind of character, also it's definitely, totally, for sure not from my own awkward first hand experience. 

As for actual role plays I'm open to pretty much whatever honestly, though do keep in mind I heavily prefer playing the kind of character I stated before. I promise it's not always awkward, he tends to transition into just a sarcastic, teasing goofball fairly easily. Side note, I fucking love sass. If there is one thing I love more than boobies it's wit and sarcasm and someone that can put up with quips and other goofy things that tend to come from my characters. So I guess what I'm saying is I love a strong independent woman who don't really need no man but can't help but enjoy the company of this goon who won't stop trying to make her chuckle at inappropriate times.

For particular pairings though I'll list out a couple and bold the character I would enjoy playing;

- Teacher x **Student**

- Boss x **Intern**

- Journalist/Bandmate x **Rockstar**

- Best Friends

- Nearly anything incest related (I really just like the taboo and heavily prefer to play pairings as the younger of the two characters such as a mother x son or older sister x brother)

- Celebrity x **Childhood Friend** (Or enemy depending on how you'd like things to go, also could be a real or fake celebrity. Whatever you prefer!)

- Roommates / Neighbors

I do have a few ideas but I would love to hear what you have in mind for any pairing you might be interested in. I love brainstorming and throwing ideas around and coming up with fun little twists and turns and stuff. As far as the actual dirty stuff I'm fairly vanilla, which I suppose this prompt may have given away. I'm not opposed to anything save for snuff, gore, and scat so I suppose those are my limits. I've already kind of stated the things I like, pretty much anything like kissing, cuddling, teasing, all that kind of stuff is 100% up my alley although I know that seems like it's not around much when everyone around here wants to fuck a guy with a giant dick until their insides have been completely rearranged. Which is fine! I just hope there's also a few people out there who would like to at least start things off a bit more tame and I'm certain we can work our way up to things like that!

Well I suppose I've been rambling long enough so I figure I'll do my best to keep from doing it anymore. I will add just one last thing if you'd like to use a celebrity as your character, or a rule 34 character, or even set something in a different time period or universe feel free! I'm open to exploring all kinds of things and love seeing what people come up with and where we can take it. Also also, I adore Pokemon and I'd enjoy some kind of role play set in that universe as well (I had some idea for some weird apocalypse type role play that we could add some kind of 'us against the world' kind of angle to for a more romantic thing I suppose) but really anything is fine! I hope to hear from some of you soon!"

8fe7pc,7,2018-04-27,Welcome to Flavor Country,GoatOfThrones,comedywriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/comedywriting/comments/8fe7pc/welcome_to_flavor_country/,"Thought I would share an old sample - hope you enjoy.

Welcome to Flavor Country
4/7/05

After watching Morgan Spurlock's Supersize Me, my life has been transformed.  Now, I have to admit that I fell asleep at some point during the movie, and it was only later over coffee that my girlfriend Karen explained to me that Spurlock maintained a strict diet of McDonald's menu items for one month to find out if the food was nutritious enough to sustain a healthy life, and not, as I maintained, because ""it would be awesome."" 
Why did Spurlock conceive such a diet? My girlfriend and I disagreed on this as well. She claimed that Spurlock got the idea for his film after watching a news story where two obese girls had sued McDonald's for making them fat. I suggested that he probably just wanted a burger and his creepy Vegan girlfriend wouldn't make him a quarter-pounder, but Karen insisted that her opinion was more valid than mine, simply because she hadn't fallen asleep during the movie. 
At any rate, the movie got me thinking. What else aren't ""they"" telling us? If McDonald's isn't good for us, then what about tuna fish, the Internet, or Clay Aiken? I figure if some Hitchcock wannabe from West Virginia can get famous exposing the obese underbelly of America, so can I. Only I wouldn't take potshots at an easy target like McDonald's; I would take on an institution that helped make this country great: tobacco. 
To quote Spurlock, ""There are rules to what's going on here in this whole process."" God, what a hick. Here are my rules:

    1. I must smoke 3 packs of cigarettes per day for one month

    2. I must smoke at every cliché opportunity (e.g., after meals, after sex, after my first cigarette)

    3. I must smoke a different brand every day
    
 I will not have the benefit of a camera documenting my progress so the  following journal will be the only record of my experiment. My hypothesis: Smoking may (or may not) be bad for me. I've enlisted a nurse I know to monitor my health during the course of my experiment – his name is Dan. After a short physical (no need for Dr. Jellyfinger today, Dan), he determines my health to be average to below average. Like Spurlock, I will not be exercising for the entire month – it's a small sacrifice, but it's one I'm willing to make.

Day 1  - Camel Lights
 Man, these are smooth and refreshing. I feel a nice buzz when I smoke  the first couple cigarettes, but not so much as I near the end of the third pack around Sunday night HBO. Karen starts bitching when I accidentally burn her while we're watching Deadwood. Serves her right for laying on me – I'm not a goddamn throw pillow. She leaves in a huff. I've still got a lot of energy. I think I'll stay up tonight and work on my novel.

 Day 2  - Marlboro Lights
 Jesus, these taste like cleaning products, and not like the pleasing, lemon-tinged ones. I meet some fellow smokers outside at work. I hide the Marlboros because smoking such a pussy brand makes me feel a little like a high school lacrosse player. Anyways, with all the smoke breaks, I figure I'll spend about ten hours less in my cube a week, which works out to about 21 days less cube time per year – score another one for the experiment. 

Day 3 -  Marlboro Reds
 Now here's a brand I can roll up in my sleeve like Schneider did on One Day at a Time (before possibly dying of lung cancer). These are a little harsher, but it's worth it not to feel like a fag, which is not a pun, you wankers. Karen and I do dinner at Ruby Tuesday's and there's a funny moment with the host when Karen says, ""First Available,"" and I say, ""Smoking."" I compromise, and we eat at the bar.

 Day 6 -  Winston
 I haven't had a chance to write because I've been fighting with Karen a lot. She says my kisses taste like death and I smell like a strip club. I KNEW SHE WAS A FUCKING STRIPPER!  


Day 7  - American Spirits
 Today is going to be a challenge because these cigarettes will not stop burning – it takes about ten minutes to smoke one. My mouth tastes like an ashtray, which I know because last night at a bar, after having finished my requisite three packs, I licked an ashtray in a pitiful attempt to ingest more nicotine. Also, smoking is fucking expensive. How do bums afford to live so lavishly? 

Day 8  - Parliament
 I'm not sure how this recessed filter technology works, but I find it oddly reassuring. I met with Dan today. He says my blood-pressure is slightly higher or he mistook the reading during my first physical. He admits he's not ""technically"" a nurse until he completes his final and mails it in. 

Day 9  - Basic
 Pretty standard smoke. I came home tonight to find ""IT'S OVER!"" spelled in cigarettes on the floor – I think it was Karen. I smoked the exclamation point first. DON'T YELL AT ME, BITCH! 

Day 11 -  Lucky Strike
 Smoking these makes me feel like I successfully stormed a beach at Normandy. I imagine having a Lucky after a tough day of shooting Krauts and then screwing a French farm maid in a barn. Man, they really were the greatest generation. 

Day 12  - Pall Mall 
I have to admit, I can't really taste the difference between these cigarettes anymore. Also, I can't feel my tongue. I mean, if I grab it with my fingers, I can feel something in between them, but there is no sensation in my mouth. On the plus side, food holds almost no power over me now; I've lost ten pounds already! Suck on that, Spurlock, you fat hillbilly. 

Day 14  - Black Death
 I'm not making this brand up, and I applaud their honesty in marketing. I went to a Cinema Draft House today so I could embrace all my passions at once: Smoking, drinking, and cheap movies. Ten minutes into the film, a guy asked me to put my cigarette out. I told him smoking was not only allowed but encouraged in these types of theatres. He asked if I could make an exception for his two little girls during a matinee of The Incredibles. I flicked my cigarette at him and told his daughters to quit fucking looking at me. 

Day 15 -  Newport Lights
 Before I tried them, I was always skeptical of menthol cigarettes, but I think these black people might be on to something – menthols are smoooooth. I'm half way to completing my experiment. I met with Dan today. My blood-pressure is definitely up, and he thinks I may have ingested a whistle. 

Day 19  - Kool
 That's it – I’m a menthol man. I've been spending a lot of my time in bars, which are really the last sheltered refuges for smokers in this country, unless you live in a trendy state like California or New York. I've met a lot of women who smoke, and I've discovered that women who smoke are likely more willing to put just about anything in their mouths. Call them orally fixated or whores or whatever. 
 
Day 21 -  Capri Slims 
The rules are the rules; these were the only cigarettes at the gas station that I hadn't tried. If it's possible that smoking a particular brand of cigarette could make you gay, this would be the brand. I feel like I should be wearing a red velvet scarf and drinking brandy while I smoke them. In private, I power through my three packs and then buy some Newport Lights, which I'm smoking on my own time.
 
Day 26 -  Newport Lights
 Well, this whole experiment is kind of shot. Last week, Dan spilled a bedpan on the doctor at his internship and got canned – he's really down now and he refuses to evaluate my health. I feel fine. My teeth are showing some wear and I have nicotine stains on my fingers, but I think it lends me a working-class kind of charm. To be honest, I kind of abandoned the other brands in favor of Newport Lights. Newtie Booties, as I call them. I considered going with a brand that offered a prize currency, to really get a return on my investment, but in the end I went with the flavor and smoothness I rely on.

Day 42 - Newport Lights
Without the fancy cartoons and marketing gimmicks of Spurlock, my article has failed to garner any interest or make me famous. I thought about ending the experiment at Day 30, but hey, I'm still
alive and kicking. And now that I'm single, I have a lot more money for cigarettes. Besides, I can quit anytime I want.

* Are there any classes that you recommend knowing something about X programming language or understanding Y concept before entering?



* What languages are good to have experiences with and why? 



* What concepts should you know before graduating that might not be taught explicitly in a required class?
 


* How do you get involved with or get started on out of class programming projects? I'm not sure if I have enough experience to do stuff but I'm also not sure when I would be good enough to start. 



* What things would you wish you had studied?



* What online resources for programming do you really recommend? (I know there's a lot but some are better than others.) Which ones do you want to warn others against?



* What should you do to 'git gud' and improve as a CSE student / programmer?



* What would be a good use of my summer? (I already have a (non-tech) job and I'm going to take a couple credit hours so beyond that)



* What is good to learn to get an edge against other people?



* When do you recommend getting summer internships etc?

 The two colleges I’m having trouble deciding between are Purdue and UGA (honors college at UGA). Because of the instate price, Zell, and some other scholarship UGA is significantly cheaper, but compared to Purdue, its computer science department is practically nonexistent. Purdue is pretty consistent top 20 and UGA, well, I’ll just say there isn’t even a dedicated CS building on campus. It’s ranking isn’t great (its usually not even ranked).

I know the merit to these rankings are limited, but I am worried about getting internships during summers and especially the types of internships. Is it difficult to get CS internships at UGA? Especially internships with tech-based companies (of course UGA has good connections with companies like The Home Depot, but what about tech companies)? 

This is my primary concern about UGA, so hopefully you guys/gals can help me make a decision :]"

I am soon to start my first job as a junior civil engineer at a very large firm in NJ.  Just have a few questions about how to advance my career in the future.  1) I have been looking at mid-level positions just to see what qualifications I should aim to achieve in my early years.  A lot of requirements would say '5-10 years experience' or '8-15 years experience'. Why such a wide range?  It seems to me that at 5 yrs, you'd prob just just got your PE for a year or so, and at 10+ years you'd be much more senior.  

2) This is probably a jaded question but how do I get compensated more? I'm starting at 57k even though I had about a year and a half of internship experience and a lot of software knowledge.  What should I be expecting to make prior to getting my PE? What can I do to make myself worth more money? 

3) In the field of transportation, highway, or civil, what is the most valuable advanced degree?  I am planning on going back to school in the future, but I'm not sure if I should get an MBA, CM degree, or a technical Master's degree.

I will try to make it short but I have to say that I have a meeting with my doc next week but I really want to hear what you guys have to say about my current situation.

So, I slowly turning depressed due to my poor life condition. I have always had low BP but lately it has been getting really bad. Almost always under 90/60 even after I drink plenty of water and eat a salty meal. I eat a proper breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday and I have proper heart cardio. I walk at least 45 minutes everyday and I have no problem doing light exercice for a long time. The problem is when I have to do a decent to heavy exercise or recently, living is painful for me. My pulse is normal around 70-90.

Here is some symptoms (event that happened ealier this week).

-Can't seem to be able to wake up without nearly passing out. Seriously, I wake up, walk abit and then I feel like passing out.

-I have no fucking energy. I have been sleeping 10 hours for the last days and I cannot seem to have any energy. Even cooking some basic food is becoming a huge task.

-Constant low BP and feeling my heart pouding through my chest (panic attack, anxiety attack). I do not fucking know what to call them. Those do not bother me since I know there are nothing more than my brain panicking.

-Permanent tension headache that cannot seem to get away. Seriously, the moment that I  do something that require a decent amount of energy I will get a mild to decent tension headache that cannot get away.

-Blood nose that won't stop. I know this is maybe not related but I had a blood nose and god, it was a red river coming out of my nose. I had to lay down to not pass out.

-Feeling extremely weak and not happy even though i'm always an happy fellow.

-Sleep halucinations and heavy night sweats. Waking up in the middle of the night with heart palpitation isn't something rare.

-Cannot take any weight. Do not even try to argue with me. I tried everything for the last two months.

Seriously, this was long but I do not know what to do anymore. This situation has only been getting worse and lately, the thought of ending it altogether has been popping more and more often. I can't drink coffee or a single bud light without feeling like shit for the rest of the day. I have no energy and my internship is begining in weeks which I know I will not be able to do if it doesn't get better.

Thank you.

I'm currently in an LDR because of my internship, for which I'm on the other side of the world for 5 months (with 2 more to go). I really love my girlfriend but there has always been something I cannot stand: her staying friends with her last 3 exes. Next to that, she has only 1 real other friend (who I know very well too, he's a nice guy though). 

She knows I don't like the fact that she's in so much contact with her exes, but of course I cannot force her to say farewell to all her ""friends"". So we set boundaries before I went away to prevent nasty feelings to tear us apart (we both know well that we are shit in an LDR). But all of the boundaries she stepped over, and afterwards asks me why I wanted them in the first place: ""Why do you hate the contact so much? Why can't you accept it? I'm not cheating"". Which I believe by the way, she really doesn't seem to have any interest in a relationship with those guys anymore. So it makes logic that I shouldn't care right, right?

I don't mind her being friends with her exes if she keeps it cool, but in my opinion she always pushes it too far. Examples:

1.     Most of the problems started last summer: she was away to her home country for a month to visit her parents. When she came back I really felt like seeing her, yet she decided to stay for 2 nights at her ex's parents' place (the guy still lives with his parents, whom she's also great friends with). This really hurt me because it felt like that family was more important to her than me, when I protested she became very cold. We almost broke up but we managed to keep it together.
2.    The amount of text conversations and calls she has with that same ex is A LOT, I'm talking every day, sometimes twice a day. Too much in my opinion, it happened multiple times before that he called during sex and wouldn't stop calling until she picked up (he has a depression/mental problems for which she cares a lot and tries to help him).
3.    The guy has feelings for her, which he expresses in those texts too. This made me very suspicious (yes, I snooped through her phone because of this but I don't anymore). Things like ""you had too many dicks in your life"", ""I miss your naked body"", ""I miss our sex"", you get the idea. She ignores this but it still hurts to see that she didn't say anything about it. I had to ask her 4 times to make this stop before she would say anything to him. This went on until I went abroad by the way.
4.    Before I went abroad, I told her that I do not accept this kind of behavior from him and if I notice it again I'll force her to quit contact with this guy while I'm abroad, because the relationship can't take it. She agreed to this. I also had a (quite nice in all honesty) Skype conversation with this ex and told him he's pushing us apart. He excused himself and told me he wouldn't do it again. Sadly this wasn't the case, we had a big fight (while I was already abroad) but she refused to cease contact with him.
5.   She ranted about this to another ex even after promising me to not tell our relationship issues to any of her exes. To make matters worse he replied ""should punish him for snooping through your phone by escalating on these sexual comments"". Yeah thanks.. Really makes the whole exes situation better.
6.   She rarely asked me how things were going and she could be quite cold from time to time. But when her other ex got a promotion at work she baked a cake for him.

And the last one,
7.    After the holy promise she wouldn't sleep over at that family again (I was okay with visiting for a day), she still did it a couple of days ago just before she went abroad to her home country. She plans on staying there when she comes back in a couple of days as well.

She really doesn't want to take distance from her ex's family because they ""helped her through rough times and feel like a family far away from her own"". And I get that, I do not want to take that away from her but she makes it so difficult to accept under these circumstances. My questions are:

1.    Am I being fair or am I projecting a jealous image on this? I see that she means no harm but it's just very very weird in my opinion.
2.    How should I solve this?

Thanks in advice lads and ladies."

It recently came to light (back in February) that EAR was likely responsible for ANOTHER earlier crime series that became known as the Cordova Cat Burglar. The Cat Burglar struck in many of the same areas (primarily Rancho Cordova) that EAR did, except this series happened years earlier in 1972 and 1973. DeAngelo was attending Sac State at this time (for a degree in CRIMINAL JUSTICE) and also had an internship with the Roseville Police Department during this time. Then, right around the time that the Cordova Cat Burglar stopped, Crazy Joe took a job with the Exeter Police Department (while his wife attended Fresno State) and soon after that the Visalia Ransacker started. 

The Cordova Cat Burglar was a logical precursor to the VR. He was bold and disorganized, breaking into homes unmasked, often in the middle of the day (and yes, the sketches match too). He also brazenly attempted a home invasion on the home of a woman who was alone and had a gun! So that series saw an escalation towards assault as well. Plus, apparently the Cat Burglar bludgeoned 3 dogs to death during this crime spree, similar to the way ONS operates later on...

Why does this go back to Hakari and Bennallack? I obviously don’t have any evidence here, but I think it adds up logically.  There were some similarities between these murders and some later GSK crimes. 

Judith Hakari: She was a young Nurse (brunette like DeAngelo’s wife) who was kidnapped from her apartment and found 7 weeks later in a shallow grave in a foothills town called Weimar (Placer County). 

Weimar is 12 Miles up I-80 from Auburn, where DeAngelo’s parents lived at the time and where DeAngelo later became a Police Officer. 

VR attempted to kidnap Claude Snelling’s daughter the night Snelling was killed. There are also 2 unsolved murders in Placer County (specifically in upscale Granite Bay) where the women were kidnapped a later found strangled, years apart.  Both murders happened in the early 1990s, not long after DeAngelo started working as a mechanic at Save Mart in Roseville, which is about 3-5 miles away from where these women were kidnapped in Granite Bay...

Nancy Bennallack: Also a brunette. Nancy apparently left her sliding glass door open regularly so her dog could go outside. Somebody climbed upstairs to her balcony while the patio door was open and stabbed her in her sleep within a few months of Hakari’s murder.

EDIT: Apparently Nancy was a Court Reporter, and at the time she was murdered she was engaged to the Sacramento County District Attorney of all people. 

Obviously GSK committed many of his crimes in almost the exact same way, except I don’t believe ONS actually stabbed anyone to death. But he certainly broke into homes through sliding glass doors while people were sleeping.  

Whoever killed Judith Hakari and Nancy Bennallack, whether it was the same person or not, seemed to have known what they were doing, because they left such little evidence that the crimes are still unsolved nearly 50 years later. DeAngelo certainly fits the timeline, he fits the profile, we know he was in the area.... Wouldn’t surprise me if it was him. 

So if this were true, hypothetically speaking, that would mean that he was already a cold blooded killer before he became EAR, and before he went to school to become a cop. Maybe this goes back even further, into the 60s? Maybe he became a cop just so he could learn how to keep himself out of prison?"

8fjfog,8,2018-04-28,[Review] Please rate my first schematic and PCB layout,jitter_electronics,PrintedCircuitBoard,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrintedCircuitBoard/comments/8fjfog/review_please_rate_my_first_schematic_and_pcb/,"Hi,

I would appreciate some feedback on my first project. I am trying to improve my skills to a professional level, as I start an internship as an Electronics Hardware Development Engineer in July.

In brief, it is a controller board for a solder reflow oven, using an ATMEGA328P and a MAX6675 thermocouple amp. It's kept as basic as possible, with a momentary push button switch controlling the start/stop process, and an LED blinking at various frequencies to give some feedback. I have also included the proposed enclosure layout to give some extra scope. I plan to get this PCB manufactured by JLCPCB.

[Enclosure Layout2](https://ibb.co/iDKuEH)

Traces are 10 mil for signal and 20 mil for the 5V.

**My questions/concerns**

* Crystal Osc layout - I have followed the 'AVR Hardware Design Considerations' appnote, but other searches outside of this document show conflicting opinions regarding layouts. Is the layout acceptable to minimise any possible problems? Even if its overkill, I prefer to be safe than sorry.

* Crystal Osc caps - As outlined [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/159820/how-do-i-deal-with-different-xtal-pin-capacitance-when-selecting-xtal-and-load-c?rq=1) the datasheet for the ATMEGA328P states different pin capacitances for XTAL1 and XTAL2, 18pf and 8pf respectively. The pin capacitances in series are 5.5pf and the strays are 2.5pf, totalling 8pf. The load capacitance of my crystal is 10pf, so selecting 2pf for the XTAL caps is theoretically correct. Can I get some reassurance of this?

* MCU Grounding - Following some advice [here](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/39136/competing-pcb-crystal-layout-recommendations), I have kept the grounds of the crystal and MCU all tied to the same net and only connecting this to the ground plane at one point. Although admittedly I am still struggling to fully understand grounding loops/noise, just a confirmation that this is a good idea will suffice (I need to do some more reading on the subject).

* Professionalism - *If* I was designing this for a professional company (NB. I understand that design/schematics and layouts are not always one persons job), is there anything that could be improved. Any IEC requirements I need to watch out for, for example.

Thanks in advance!

8fjtkv,1,2018-04-28,Need some Sage Advice,Laughing_Lazily,StructuralEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/StructuralEngineering/comments/8fjtkv/need_some_sage_advice/,"So my semester has been pretty rough. To keep it short, I started with 2 master classes, senior design and an undergrad class along with an internship. I had a burn out and withdrew from one master class. The semester has been wrapping up and I've been pretty unhappy with my internship. It's been all C3D CadWork, even though I was told I was being brought on as a structural intern, and the turn over is ridiculous. Effectively, I have no structural engineer to refer to as my mentor because the one that's most competent at that is the owner and he's always out. He gave an assignment to come up with some preliminary loads for a site so we could finally start design. Excited, I wanted to get as close as possible to the right answer. I spent a day or two and got snow loads, live loads, some dead and got to wind. I got really bogged in wind and had questions but no one to ask. Sure enough I get pulled to another CAD job and was told it's urgent. It's always urgent, the owner can't use CAD. Keep in mind this is my first internship. I've taken some grad courses and passed the FE, but I'm not an official EIT for other reasons.

Long story short, I start applying for internship s at a actual structural firm where I can get mentored and learn. He tells me before I find out I get accepted to a new place he's pretty disappointed he hasn't gotten the loads (I've had to reduce work to 8 hours a week because omg what did I do to myself). I find out I get the internship, tell I'm sorry but I'm going a different direction for the summer . He cuts me off and says hes not impressed and that I'm not as good as I think I am.

So, here's the sage advice I need. I know loads are my biggest weakness because in my opinion, university rarely covers it well enough to fully interact with the IBC, ASCE. I'm pretty devastated from this semester and I'm unsure if im competent/passionate enough to continue. How can I assess my competency. Is there some reference or trick I can use to guide me? It's so bad I've considered stopping myself from pursuing my masters and going to IT."
8fk8vh,29,2018-04-28,Day 8 &amp; 9 (repost),PhantomPhanGirl,u_PhantomPhanGirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PhantomPhanGirl/comments/8fk8vh/day_8_9_repost/,"Hi guys I want to start out with apologizing for worrying so many of you. So I’m going to say this now me and B1 are fine. We are in a new location and far away from my grandparents and church boy. We will not be returning to Arizona until we need to fly home. 

I have since changed my phone number again and there is one person who has it and that is B1. I also called my phone company to ask who got my number. Turns out my parents called asking what my new number was and they gave it to them. Once I reamed them as to why they would give my number out to somebody without asking I set up a password that is required for any future transactions. 

I have also revived many questions asking me how I am able to afford all of this. I explained in a previous post, that I deleted, that while I don’t come from money I am financially independent from my parents. I have been volunteering at different locations since I was very young. Places such as nursing homes, libraries and internships so I have a lot of work experience. As soon as I was old enough I applied for jobs like a crazy person. 

I got my first job at my local library and since then I have grown in my position. I also have many part time jobs one of which is a secretary position that has many great benefits. So I am financially stable and I am able to live on my own. 

I am not a huge spender. Honestly in this week alone I have spent more money on random stuff then I have on the 4 years I have been working. When I got my first paycheck I immediately started saving until I was able to start paying for my phone. After that I bought other necessities so I wouldn’t have to rely on my parents for anything. I also have an inheritance waiting for me when I am 18. 

Long story short a nice older lady I volunteered with left me a lot in her will. Technically she left it to my parents with very strict instructions that when I was 18 I would be given money she placed in a savings account and a stock. She left me some other things but I legally signed them to other positions (my parents had to sign but everything was my call). 

So my parents haven’t helped me pay for anything. The only thing they did was send me money for 2 plane tickets and I ended up buying one. We have used the rest of the money to stay in hotels. B1 on the other hand does come from money and has insisted many times to pay for things but I refuse because I don’t want to depend on him like that.  But we are both fine and very very happy. 

So yesterday I started the process of getting a restraining order against my grandparents and church boy for myself and B1. I don’t want them to come after him as well. So we started the process and have emailed all my evidence to my lawyer (yes I have a lawyer from the office I work at). He started getting everything in order for me in Boston. 

So we drove down to our new location and checked into the hotel. Even though I know they won’t find me and B1 I still set up precautions. After that me and B1 went out to eat dinner and we went to go and see a comedy show. We had a great time and when we went back to the hotel we fell asleep. 

Today was also a great day. It was the first time I didn’t have to worry about my grandparents or church boy calling me. Or them randomly showing up at our location. It was peaceful me and B1 decided to explore new things. 

So we ended up going out on the town for the day. We saw a Love by Cirque and if you happen to be in the area I recommend watching it. We tried flavored oxygen (it’s very cool and weird at the same time because your breathing but it can taste like oranges). Rode on a Gondola and went to see a comedian and a magician. 

I did get one scare when I had one number call me. It was my parents I let it go to voice mail a few times before I answered. It was my parents once more trying to apologies and ask where I was. I said I was safe and away from my grandparents and Church boy. Once more I was told that I needed to apologize. 

I ended up face timing them so they could see my face. 

“ I will not be apologizing for anything they have been doing to me for the past 8 days. Did you know they tried to get me married. Did you know they wanted Church boy to force himself on me. Do you know the abuse I faced in the past when you would send me to them. Do you know anything about me. About what I have faced. Why do you think I went to college so soon. Why do you think I moved out at 16. Why do you think I never say I love you anymore. You are not my parents you never were. Parents love and protect their children form monsters that exist in this world. You threw me into their grasp and said for them to do with me what they wished. 

I will always love my sisters and I will die before I let you or anyone else harm them. But you need to know this you loose all power over me in 2 months. After that you will never see me again. Actually this right now this video call is he last time you will ever see me outside of court. I am applying for a restraining order against my grandparents and church boy and I will now be adding you to the list. The only family I have left are my sisters and B1. You will be lucky to ever hear my name again. So let this be the last time you hear me say this

Good bye”

I hung up and I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. I didn’t feel anything. Not happiness, sadness, anger, I was numb. I snapped out of it when B1 hugged me. 

“I love you”

Was all he said and I won’t lie I said it right back. That was the only time that I said it and it meant something. Later me and him went out on a date and now we are currently back at the hotel. I’m going to go to sleep after I post this but I wanted to let people know I was okay. Thank you for the concern you have shown it means a lot. 

Edit- Also I ended up deleting some stories because CrazyFriend3090 asked me to delete  them. I said okay and deleted the ones he asked. I also ended up deleting my first post as it showed B1 in a bad light and I didn't want people to think thag is who he was. He has been there for me and I felt ashamed that I had doubted him like that. Hope this answers your question. If anyone had any more questions please let me know I'm the comments section and I will answer all of them to the best of my ability"

Since I decided pursue a career in public service but I lack work experience, I want to apply for an internship at a political NGO in Brussels. Although I generally have ideas as to what to write in my cover letter,I’d like to know your own successful applications that got you stand out, in a good way of course. 

I’m an American Studies graduate. So another piece of a puzzle is how to make it sound relevant as the NGO I’m applying for is oriented towards Europe/European Union. 

Shall I stress also my hobbies, such as that I’ve started an interview podcast on social change. My fear is that this can sound amateurish or pretentious. 

Is it worth brag about your achievements in general? 

Appreciate some thoughts.

8flgea,5,2018-04-28,"[Rant/Support] It's hard to relate my abuse because of how subtle and sophisticated it is, no one ever acknowledges that it's abuse",underdone_toast,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8flgea/rantsupport_its_hard_to_relate_my_abuse_because/,"Help me understand this, because it seems most people complain about narcissistic parents being very sadistic, belittling them and physically abusing them. My abuse was of a different flavor. My dad didn't belittle me, but he constantly undermined me and only praised me on things that he liked. He never acknowledged anything I did in school (good or bad) and basically he ignored me 98% of the time. The only times he gave me praise is when I did something that was also of interest to him.

Growing up, he was so wrapped up in his business that he neglected his family. He'd barely ever be home and many nights, neither was my mom. He didn't hit any of us, but he didn't have to. He could have a terrifying presence when he was angry, which is in stark contrast to his 'normal' personality which is a cheerful, charismatic. When he was in a good mood, he would start singing. I have distinct memories of us walking with my family and him singing 'Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay. My, oh, my, what a wonderful day'. I think he thought it would cheer us up but it always seemed somehow creepy to me. I knew what he could be like. 

He wouldn't tell me I would fail, but he would make it seem like there was something wrong with me. He would draw attention to things that I wasn't sure about or uncomfortable with in ways that made me doubt myself. He never wanted to say anything straight, he always had to be indirect so that it wasn't really criticism but it still had a strong influence over our behavior. When I was going through severe depression and social anxiety in school from incessant bullying that he's been in denial about since I was a toddler, he would say stuff like, 'You really like the melancholia, but you shouldn't over indulge in it'. When I was struggling with keeping up with the other boys in little league (I was never taught to throw properly, even though he was me and my older brother's coach), he would compare me to my (vastly superior) brother and say 'You should be able to to do this, you have the same genes'. When I spoke highly of one of my few friends for being energetic and optimistic, he said, 'Yeah, but you notice how people can't spend long amounts of time with them.' 

He never gave me confidence to do anything, except one thing -- my writing. He read one book to his children in his life, the Hobbit when we were in the 7-12 range and it left a big impression on us. We loved it and it inspired me to start writing fantasy stories of my own. That was the one thing he praised me for that was actually something I felt proud of. But I would never share it because I couldn't handle the possibility of someone shitting all over it. I was the scapegoat in every circle I was a part of, so I inherently knew it would not be judged fairly so I would keep it a secret. 

He would never talk to the family about anything, even when we all knew something was wrong. When the business wasn't doing well and the family was going through money struggles, my parents wouldn't talk to us about it, there would just be this palpable tension when we'd go shopping and they'd guilt us over asking for things. So I just stopped asking for things. My brother and sister did not -- in fact, they'd still ask for everything they wanted and they'd get it. My brother was the eldest and my sister was the princess. It always bothered me that they'd get special treatment, but I could never speak up because I knew my family was going into debt to do it and that debt translated into more stress which lead to more shaming. 

My mom would always be terrible at handling stress, which sucks because there was so much of it due to my father never properly handling his business's finances. He would make bad short-term decisions and ended up owing so much in taxes and rent and bills that by the end, he was cutting bad cheques to buy him enough time to move his business assets at night so no one could seize them. I experienced it all first hand when I started working for him to help him out. My mom would be an intermittent control freak, who would always make sure you were sufficiently terrified of any possible negative consequences of bad financial decisions before dropping the topic. If you didn't acknowledge her terrifying view of the world, she would keep hitting on it until you were also terrified and then she'd insist that she take control. The moment you tried to take control back, she would go hands-off again. So my father would humor her momentarily and when he wouldn't change as quickly as she wanted, it would just go back to doing the same old. 

Years after the business closed and I'm now a full-fledged adult doing the same kind of business, he would reminisce to me about how he 'almost made it'. He blamed the two main staff who kept the business going all those years. He said the programmer kept taking short-cuts and the office manager let the business get so far behind. Certainly it's not to blame on the owner, right? Well, after 3 years of me in business for myself, he decides he wants another shot at success and contacts a friend of his to pitch building him a software system for his business with me as the developer. Boy, do I have some stories to tell of this tale, but that'll be for another post. The end result is that I was set up to fail. After we got the deposit, he got his cut and promptly disappeared for the remainder of the project. I was given a tight schedule to produce prolific results and then had no help from anyone, then worked to the bone with no pay, then blamed for everything that went wrong, then threatened with legal action to get everything back only to have my dad side with them and say that all the abuse and exploitation wasn't that bad and that I should 'drop the angst' and go back and finish. And I did finish it, then I had a mental breakdown from which I have not fully recovered. I've got PTSD from this now. Every time I start programming again, I have flashbacks and it sends me spiralling into depression again. I used to have so much enjoyment from my work, now it causes me constant anxiety.

What makes it so hard, is that it's clear that in his own mind, he's this great guy who is a charismatic leader and does wonderful, generous things for people. People would praise my dad all the time and it made me so uncomfortable. They had no idea what he's really like, but I would hear it so much that I started to think that I really was just a spoiled brat. He always had to have it his way. Nothing was more important. If we didn't do it his way, he would sulk and explain why his way was better. When we did it his way, he would make us insist that it was indeed the best choice. I learned from a young age, not to over share with him because it's taking a risk that he'll use that to subtly neg me in a misguided attempt to 'help' me. 

Nowadays, I barely speak to my parents when I don't have to. He just demands that I call him and come visit more often, reminding me that I have 'no excuse, because it's not like you live outside the province or something' (alluding to both my siblings now living multiple time zones away). The last time we talked was about a month ago and it's my birthday in 2 weeks, so I'm fully expecting he demand we do something. Then it's his birthday and father's day within a few days so he's going to insist on having his 'birthday week' again. The thought of spending time with him triggers my anxiety, so I don't know how I'm going to handle this. He's totally oblivious to all this. I don't know if he'd accept any of this even if I did confront him about it. When I play it out in my head, I just imagine him explaining it away and spreading the blame around, then creepily moving in for a hug and it makes me want to lose my shit.

I'm taking steps now to learn to love myself and build self-confidence and self-esteem. I've gone through a few counsellors, but they are either interns who are on a short stay or were narcissists themselves and would just try and make it about them. I still have so many barriers and blocks in my mind to success. When I start to do things for myself, I get this foreboding sense of impending failure. It's as if internally I think that I'll never make it and no one is going to help me. Everyone is just going to watch me drown while laughing at how silly I look while I struggle. I don't trust anyone implicitly, even those who have proven themselves trustworthy. I'm so afraid that they'll finally realize that I'm a fake and tear me down and point out all my flaws. I wish I could be normal. I wish I could believe in myself like other people do. I wish I didn't have these mental blocks, but they are there to protect me from more psychological trauma.

I could go on and on, there's so much more to tell, but that's all I bring myself to talk about now. Thank you for taking the time to read this far. Any feedback and support is welcome."

Can someone please guide me on where to search/what companies offer internships for undergrad students. I REALLY REALLY want this opportunity but it is proving pretty difficult to find.

Looking to get some advice (hopefully from a woman's perspective) to the situation I'm in. Here is some background:
So I met this girl at work who was interning with us (I work in a very small office, like 10 employees) We just so happened to have our cubicles next to each other so we would always talk and pass the time around talking about stories, life, etc. At the beginning, she had a boyfriend so I kept the relationship just friendly to respect what they had. Well halfway into her internship, they had broken up. When I finally found this out a month ago we started getting a lot closer, flirting more, etc. Her last day was Wednesday but that whole week we talked about how we each love brunch and food and she gave off the vibe that she wanted to go with me sometime. I would pick up on those little comments all week. So on her last day, I built the courage to ask her to brunch and she was very excited from what I could tell, even going to far as to say that she would pick the spot. So I gave her my number and told her when she gets back in the area from visiting her family to let me know so we can have brunch. It has been a couple days and I still haven't gotten a text or response from her. I would text her myself but I didn't grab her number - I didn't want to come off too aggressive. 

How should I go about handling this? She seemed very excited about our potential date and took my number with no problem and even hugged me on her last day saying that she ""left the best for last"" I can get her number easily from one of my coworkers to set something up but I feel this would come off creepy. 

Also one of my coworkers mentioned that she had been going on dates with some other guy. My coworker said she didn't seem excited about dating that guy but things potentially were getting serious with them. But she would never bring that up to me when I would ask about her weekend so I took it as maybe she wanted me to make a move without the pressure of knowing she was going on dates with someone else. 

Should I wait for her to get back to me or should I be the guy that gets her number from someone and schedule the brunch date out of the blue?

Any advice is appreciated and sorry if this turned into a long post."

For example, [in this round of Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/) there are [a long-term open-source contributor](https://github.com/davidhedlund), [a doctoral student in physics in Geneva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoaneta-damyanova-66766339), [a software developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahithi-yarlagadda-1b1aa076/), [a very active contributor](https://github.com/ramyaragupathy) and [experienced developer](https://blog.mapbox.com/ramya-ragupathy-joins-mapbox-7e5d615076a4), [a front-end dev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konikodes) and [virtual success assistant](https://konikodes.com/index.html), [a software intern in a company](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shruti9520/) and a lot of others. Do those people really need help? Or are they really underrepresented in tech? (Outreachy project is for people traditionally underrepresented in tech like women, trans, etc)

8fndqu,11,2018-04-28,I lied on my resume and cover letter,courtneyf94,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/8fndqu/i_lied_on_my_resume_and_cover_letter/,"Last month I graduated from college, but I've been unable to find any job offers outside of sales, temp\-office spots, or call centers. Even the entry level jobs at midsize and large companies seem to want 3\-4 years of experience and advanced degrees. 

So last week I caved in and I lied about my work history on my resume and cover letters. I know that on one hand, lying is morally wrong, and I could get caught and be fired or have a job offer revoked in the future. Additionally, lying makes it more difficult for other people who aren't lying to get a job because they are competing with a bunch of liars. 

On the other hand, my parents are putting a lot of pressure on me to find a job and I know they are really disappointed in me. I'm about to run out of the money my grandparents gave me for college, and my parents are not interested in helping me out, and I don't want to have to ask my friends if I can stay on their couch. The work experience is also the only thing I'm lying about. 

I'm very conflicted and frustrated because I received an AA computer science from a local community college before transferring to a good public university. I quickly discovered I wasn't that great at programming and I switched majors to general business, and minored in statistics and Japanese \(I grew up speaking some Japanese in the house so it wasn't hard\). I graduated with high honors and a 3.91 GPA. During my studies I also did several unpaid internships from decent midsize companies. 

I thought for sure between my degrees, GPA, and internships, I'd be able to find a mid level position in a small company or an entry level one in a large company. Unfortunately, it seems like I underestimated the importance of paid work experience. My only ""real"" work experience was in retail as a teenager, and I simply can't list Ross sales associate from 6 years ago on my professional resume. 

I don't want to disappoint my parents, I don't want to couch surf, and I don't want to work in a call center \(which at 8.50 an hour would not afford a 1BR apartment outside of the ghetto in my area\). But I hate lying, I fear I will be caught. What should I do?"

8fngj0,1,2018-04-28,Help picking financial choice!,Erikzen,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8fngj0/help_picking_financial_choice/,"Hi everyone, 

Long time lurker! I am a sophomore at college studying finance (yeah don’t give me shit haha). I am currently deciding what I should focus on for next year as financial goals:

I have an internship and will make close to $8,000 after tax this summer, and after expenses I will have saved $3000 and have the rest for fun! 

I have three goals but not sure which one to pursue. If I do one I can’t do the other. 

First: I have a car loan for a BMW 528i (not my smartest purchase I know), total right now is $19,800.  Between loans next semester and saving this summer I could pay off $10,000 of the car leaving me at roughly $9900 after interest-ish. 

Second: I want to travel to France and study abroad for my spring year 2019. Total cost is about $9000 everything included with going out and etc... however if I do this I won’t be able to pay that much in my car.

Third: save everything, don’t pay off loan yet, keep it in my savings and pay off 90% of my student loans which will total $15,000 at end of year 2018. So I will still owe around $5000 after I graduate. However I can’t do the other two.

Overall, I really want to go to France and experience all the awesome and beautifulness of my roots, my aunt lives in Switzerland and it will be a lot of fun! A life changing thing. However, paying my car loan which I took dumbly is another goal! It would increase my credit score significantly and will pay it off 4 years before I have to which is great. I am not sure what to do, and honestly graduating with student loans is not a problem as I will have about $18,000 and that’s it, which could be paid in a year easily. I have about $2000 saved up for emergency and by the fall I should be able to save another $2000 for my Efund. I would love some advice. Sorry if it’s long and cluttered.

Im on mobile, so sorry for the format.
English is not my first language, but do correct me if I made any spelling mistakes.

This is the full story of my last reddit post on this sub:
https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/8cp9qd/she_she_asked_me_on_a_date/?st=JGK7PODN&amp;sh=d87d9c7f


So, lets begin.

**A little backstory**
I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for almost 7 years now, its going better now but still struggling. Whole my life I’ve been overweight and to top things off 4 years ago I started balding (i’m 19 years atm, you do the math.)

Ive never really been in a relationship, or ever been with a girl. Sure, I had some flirting going on but not on a big scale. January 1st 2014, I was 14 at the time and I wanted to change. I wanted to loose weight, be cool, be the guy every girl wants. I was sick of being myself. 
So i joint a gym, worked out, got a job and made some money. I really changed and was... happy.

Now if you’re familiar with depression, it sometimes comes in waves. So I was happy, but for a time. Because a year later I started to feel down again, I made myself paranoid, suicidal thoughts and all that fun stuff. All the weight I lost came back, twice as hard. 

Skipping forward 1 miserable year, I went to a new school, a school which I don’t know anyone. A place full of strangers. So little anxiety me wasn’t happy. 


**So now you know a little bit about me, so here is were the seduction part begin. (please keep in mind my backstory)**
First day of this new school, I had a class of 20 guys and 2 girls... Yeah...
So the first class started and we were 20 minutes in and the door opens. And believe brothers, the most beautiful girl I have ever seen walks in. Every jaw in the class drops, even from the other 2 girls. We are talking about a HB 9.5 here. 

So you know what I did?
My insecure self said to myself: *I wont make a change with this girl so I wont even try it*. 
So thats what I did, I didn’t talk to her for the rest of the year... We had 1 or 2 conversations, but short ones. We were in a group project once but not many words were exchanged.
That was pretty much all the connections we had for the year.

So the first year of school was done, the first 6 months of the second year we needed to take an internship. And that might be the best thing that ever happened to me, my internship. I don’t know what it was, but I found something there. I found myself, I had motivation to change myself again, to become social, to become that guy again i once was. Weird right? I know.

So i started my journey on self improvement again, lost some weight, came outside my comfort zone. Did things I haven’t  done before, I even gave girls a shot. Approaching them more, talked to them more, some flirting and even some dating.

Internship finished and I was excited for school.
So back on school, seeing al my friends again. I was full of confidence and was once again... happy!
And then she came in, HB 9.5. 
And... and I said Hi to her, can you believe it? ME, I said hi to HER. AND SHE EVEN SAID HI BACK! It doesn’t sound like much. but for me at the time was HUGE! I even started a conversation with her, you know, the standard stuff, “How are you!” “I’m also fine, thanks.”  That kind of stuff.

So after a week of school we had a new project, a big one. This project would go for the entire year! The class would split up in 2 groups. 2 groups with 2 leaders. Wanna guess who the leaders are? Exactly! HB 9.5 and me, we are the leaders for this project. After we heard this I went to HB 9.5  and said in a funny way that it wasn’t a competition but she was gonna loose. This was the first time I made here laugh.

So quickly we were “forced” to spend time with each other for this project. Im still on my journey of self improvement and at the time I was full of confidence. So when we worked on the project, I wasn’t nervous, I just acted like the guy I want to be. And to my surprise, I didn’t scared her away. She exually thinks I’m a pretty cool dude. (Her words). So she upped our status, she became touchy. Touching my knee and let her hand rest there for a moment. Touching my shoulders, talking more about private stuff, she even text me... first. But when she does that and I reply to here she ignores me...

So yeah, here I am. A guy who have 0 experience with girls, playing the game with a HB 9.5.
The thing you need to know is, she has a boyfriend. She talked about going to Japan, I asked if she was going with here boyfriend and she said: “Only if were are still together.” 
I know there is allot of controversial stuff about girls with boyfriends on this sub. But still.

**This is the crazy part**
I have 3 girls in my class, The HB 9.5 and the other two aren’t HB’s Lets call them Girl 1 and Girl 2. 
Girl 1 bought a house were she lives alone, she invited Girl 2 and HB 9.5 over to drink at her house.

So here I am replying to a  mail from school thats about the project. HB 9.5 saw the mail and texted me to thank me for replying, because she was to drunk to reply. I replied to here asking if she was having fun because she told me were she was going that evening. She then send me some pictures of herself drinking and indeed having fun. Then HB 9.5 asked me to come to Girl 1 house. First i said no but she insisted i should come and that Girl 1 was okay with it. So without thinking twice I took my dads car and drove to Girl 1 house. 
I arrived to 2 drunk girls and a sober Girl 2, because Girl 2 doesn’t drink. I didn’t really care about Girl 1 and Girl 2 and went straight to HB 9.5 and sat next to her. We drank some shots and had allot of fun, we touched allot and even hold hands. Because I was with the car i couldn’t drive back home so I slept In Girls 1 house together with Girl 2 and HB 9.5, Girl 2 slept in Girl 1 bed and Girl 1, HB 9.5 and me slept on the couch. I slept almost next to HB 9.5 and Girl 1 was laying at the end of my feet. Sorry to say but we were way to drunk to do anything, we were all asleep after 5 mins of saying nothing.

The next morning I woke up and i couldn’t believe what happened. I woke up next to HB 9.5! THATS CRAZY! She woke up as well and we smiled to each other. She layt here legs on top of mine and created a little tension between us two. Soon everyone was awake and we made breakfast. HB 9.5 needed to work that day. She lives kinda far away, about 3 hours with the bus. Because i was with the car and it was only 1,5 hour ride to her place, i offered here a ride. She refused the first 2 times but accepted my offer the third time. And hold my hand thanking me.

On the ride to her work we did allot of talking and goofing around with music, we like allot of the same music. we flirted a little but not to much because we where both kinda tired. We arrived at her work and she invited me in. (Its a beach bar). I declined her offer because I really needed to go, so we gave each other a big hug and said goodbye.


**Back in school** 
So the next week in school HB 9.5 didn’t really talked to me much, I didn’t want to look desperate so i just played it cool and did my thing. HB 9.5 started to talk to other guys but I still played it cool and let her do her thing. After 3 days of radio silence, she texted me while siting in class. She asked me out (This was the other reddit post) I looked at here and I smiled. We set up a date and went the next day. The date went great and was fun, but again, it didn’t go further then a little touch and flirt. (Keep in mind that she has a boyfriend.) 
After this date I have allot of mixed signals from HB 9.5, one day she ignores me and the other day she is all over me. We have allot of alone time with this project and in this time we goof around and just having fun with once again, a little flirt and touch.

We text regular now but she still does this thing were she starts the text but ignores me. We hug when saying goodbye and during the break we go out together to eat somewhere or to drink coffee, we do this sometimes after school aswel.

But I was kinda getting sick of the mixed signals. So before the holiday starts, I wanted to ask her out. If she said no because of a bullshit reason then I will move on and keep her as just a friend. And if she said yes, then, then I don’t what to do anymore.

So last day before a holiday of 2 weeks I walked up to her and she said she was going to smoke outside, what was perfect for me so we had some alone time. But Girl 1 overheard us and wanted to come with... Great. So we went outside and I kinda kept my distance form HB 9.5 and Girl 1. And as planned HB 9.5 walked up to me and rest her head on my shoulders, I thought that was the perfect time to asked her out but i chocked. And there was Girl 1, saying shit which i didn’t listen to because I was nervous as fuck to ask HB 9.5 out. Smoke time was done and we went back to class, and still didn’t asked her. The day was slowly ending and I was making myself crazy. Our last lesson was a test. And offcoursse, HB 9.5 was done before me. She handed in her test and left... Great, there goes my last change.
But 5 min later she walks back in with another test, this was a test we did last week and on that day she was sick. I thanked god for this. I handed in my test and said to my friends they could go without me because I needed to do “things”. After 20 mins HB 9.5 walked out and asked what I was doing, I replied by saying i waited on her and asked which direction she needed to go, she said it was very sweet of me for waiting and that her bus was leaving in a hour, i suggested to go for a coffee and she said that was a good idea.
So sitting at the coffee bar I searched for al my confidents to ask her out, and so I did. And... she said yes. She said yes.


So, yeah. This is it. Not all of it but the most of it. I asked her out yesterday and she said yes. Crazy right?
Thanks for reading this messy story, I apologies for the story. I like writing I’m just not very good at it.

If you have any advice for me please let me know, also questions.
Be aware of my insecurities and that I’m blown away that this girl is so into me. I still cant believe all the time we have spend together. And all the stories we have told and al the physical connection we had. 
I try to play the game the best I can.  
But its hard, I think its hard.
But its going good, Im only slowly going crazy about this girl.   
Thanks again for reading!"
8fp0du,0,2018-04-28,[M4F] Hopeless romantic goofball seeking literate partner for sickeningly sweet role play,PicklesTheRealtor,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8fp0du/m4f_hopeless_romantic_goofball_seeking_literate/,"**Everything here is 18+**


So, I'll get this out of the way quickly, I'm really just looking for some folks who write well and can provide additional fun things to keep the role play going along. If you can do that in a couple of paragraphs, perfect, short and sweet is always fun and usually makes things go faster. If you'd like to write 6+ that's also fine, I adore details and it gives more insight into the character's actions and thoughts. What I'm trying to say here is I'm fine with whatever! As far as writing style if you prefer first or third let me know and we can go with whatever you're more comfortable with!

Now, onto the actual meat of this whole thing. What I'm looking for is just a fun and entertaining role play that starts off with two people probably awkwardly getting to know each other as it grows into a relationship. This could happen in a ton of different ways and depending on any particular pairing you might have in mind that could change how things can start or change drastically. I'm open to pretty much anything, but I prefer playing a somewhat awkward and goofy fellow who probably doesn't have much of any real experience with ladies. I think I've gotten pretty good at that kind of character, also it's definitely, totally, for sure not from my own awkward first hand experience. 

As for actual role plays I'm open to pretty much whatever honestly, though do keep in mind I heavily prefer playing the kind of character I stated before. I promise it's not always awkward, he tends to transition into just a sarcastic, teasing goofball fairly easily. Side note, I fucking love sass. If there is one thing I love more than boobies it's wit and sarcasm and someone that can put up with quips and other goofy things that tend to come from my characters. So I guess what I'm saying is I love a strong independent woman who don't really need no man but can't help but enjoy the company of this goon who won't stop trying to make her chuckle at inappropriate times.

For particular pairings though I'll list out a couple and bold the character I would enjoy playing;

- Teacher x **Student**

- Boss x **Intern**

- Journalist/Bandmate x **Rockstar**

- Best Friends

- Nearly anything incest related (I really just like the taboo and heavily prefer to play pairings as the younger of the two characters such as a mother x son or older sister x brother)

- Celebrity x **Childhood Friend** (Or enemy depending on how you'd like things to go, also could be a real or fake celebrity. Whatever you prefer!)

- Roommates / Neighbors

I do have a few ideas but I would love to hear what you have in mind for any pairing you might be interested in. I love brainstorming and throwing ideas around and coming up with fun little twists and turns and stuff. As far as the actual dirty stuff I'm fairly vanilla, which I suppose this prompt may have given away. I'm not opposed to anything save for snuff, gore, and scat so I suppose those are my limits. I've already kind of stated the things I like, pretty much anything like kissing, cuddling, teasing, all that kind of stuff is 100% up my alley although I know that seems like it's not around much when everyone around here wants to fuck a guy with a giant dick until their insides have been completely rearranged. Which is fine! I just hope there's also a few people out there who would like to at least start things off a bit more tame and I'm certain we can work our way up to things like that!

Well I suppose I've been rambling long enough so I figure I'll do my best to keep from doing it anymore. I will add just one last thing if you'd like to use a celebrity as your character, or a rule 34 character, or even set something in a different time period or universe feel free! I'm open to exploring all kinds of things and love seeing what people come up with and where we can take it. Also also, I adore Pokemon and I'd enjoy some kind of role play set in that universe as well (I had some idea for some weird apocalypse type role play that we could add some kind of 'us against the world' kind of angle to for a more romantic thing I suppose) but really anything is fine! I hope to hear from some of you soon!"

I am a 20 years old college student, currently studying Computer Science. I am finishing my internship until the end of May and I usually stay in the office doing nothing for 12 hours straight.

Well, there are small tasks that I do once in a while, but it really kills me not having to talk to anyone around my age (my co-workers are usually 35-40 years old) for like, the whole day.

I love watching movies &amp; tv shows like: Silicon Valley, Westworld, GoT, Stranger Things, How To Get Away With Murder, etc.

I also would prefer to talk on iMessage or Telegram. Thanks!

Looking for career advice.",PooBiscuits,MechanicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/8fs1gl/graduated_bsme_no_work_experience_looking_for/,"I was unsure if I should post this here or in engineering jobs, but since this sub seems to be more active, this one seems like the better option. Anyway,

I'll start off by saying that I graduated last December. I've applied to nearly 400 engineering and technical positions across the United States, with nine interviews from eight different companies/organizations. Of those nine interviews, two were in person, and seven were phone screen interviews. 

I had my resume professionally reviewed, and I have had others tell me it's very good. However, my interview rate is only around 2% for online applications (the others were through my university). I have a very small professional network, and no one I know has been able to help me get a job, or even land an interview. Being a shy person, I'm kind of nervous with interviews even when I get them.

However, I think the bigger problem is my lack of professional work experience. I focused primarily on academics while in school, and when I mention this, I've noticed that HR and recruiters tend to roll their eyes at me. I try to be polite, truthful, and reasonably confident enough, but I know I'm probably not what they're looking for.

I'm a thermo/fluids guy. I liked doing the math, and I liked how these classes were primarily theory based. After I graduated, I started learning ANSYS on my own, as CFD is very fascinating to me. Above all else, this is the field I would like to work in. 

Though, unfortunately, not one of my interviews has been for a job in this field. I can only seem to get interviews for general engineering positions, CAD positions, or manufacturing engineering positions. Even if my interviews all went perfectly, I never lied about anything. So, it doesn't surprise me that I never made it past screening interviews for those of the latter two.

Considering this, I have a few questions. 

How common are CFD or related thermo/fluid analysis positions? I can't seem to find many, and I never hear back from the ones I'm qualified for. 

How can I set myself up to get a job in that field? Is there a certain type of job I should be looking for to use as a bridge to get there in the future?

And lastly, since I have been looking for work for five months with no success, what should I do? 

I am overqualified for most uneducated/blue collar jobs, and I much prefer intellectual to hands-on work, anyway. I would find a part-time gig to be soul crushing, but it could provide the ""real world"" experience that HR people seem to like.

I have some programming knowledge, and I enjoy programming almost as much as engineering. I've tried looking for low-level jobs in software/systems/IT, but that may not lead to the job I'd like to have in the future. Those seem to be more in-demand than anything in mechanical engineering, though.

Lastly, there's grad school. Being the kind of person that I am, I actually would enjoy grad school just for the purpose of personal knowledge. My parents have offered to pay for it, so if I went that route my only loss would be a lack of full-time work. Knowing what I know now, I could focus on getting internships, and as a grad student, I would be better qualified than many juniors and seniors. Still, I am very hesitant to do this. My problem seems to be a lack of experience, and I doubt that more education with little experience would solve my problem at all. That could push me farther into the direction I'd rather not go. 

Working in engineering is the goal I set for myself; it's what I'm really passionate about and what I really want to do. How can I get there?"
8fs8ll,4,2018-04-29,Post-Grad Job Dilemma,lawschool-throwaway,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/8fs8ll/postgrad_job_dilemma/,"I have a really hard decision to make in the next week or so, and I thought that I would post on here to get some thoughts. I want to start off by saying that I know this is a good problem to have, and I do not, in any way, intend for this to be a humblebrag. I've just talked this over with a lot of people, and no one has been willing to go out on a limb and tell me straight up what they think I should do and why.


This post will be long because I want to make sure you have all the facts. If you have any questions after reading, let me know and I will follow up.


I'm currently a 3L and have been on the public interest track in New York City. After graduation, I will be practicing family defense litigation. I accepted a position at Office 1 back in January. As part of a special program, I got to take the bar this semester and take the semester off of classes in exchange for working full-time at Office 2 beginning in March. I passed the bar and will be graduating in a few weeks. 


Things have been going exceptionally well at Office 2 since I started there. After a bad 2L summer internship experience (stifling, limiting), I didn't have the highest hopes for my remaining law school work experience, but my time at Office 2 has been everything I hoped for and more. I have had a lot of independence and in turn, a lot of success at Office 2. Last week, the co-director of the organization sat me down and told me that she knew I had accepted a position at Office 1, but they at Office 2 had been very impressed with my work and wanted to let me know that they would be prepared to offer me a position as well. I told her that it was something I would think about, but would need some time. And here I am. 


Office 1 is a large practice with a great reputation. It is a hard office to get into. I didn't think I was going to get an offer from them, but was absolutely thrilled, and quickly accepted when I did. I am the first person from my T3 law school who has ever been hired there (per my administration). Office 1 is known for their intense style of advocacy and the way they use their influence to bring attention to social justice issues. I will start my position at Office 1 in late-September, as they hire by class, and will then complete a thorough training program, which I believe lasts 10 weeks. I don't currently know anyone at Office 1, and cannot speak on their office culture. However, the class they hire is usually large, and I would have the opportunity to grow my social circle working there. This is important to me because most of my closest law school friends are leaving New York and this city is hard as hell to make friends in. If I follow through on my acceptance at Office 1, I will have to move to a different borough. Since my lease ends in July and I am down to the last dollars of my living stipend, I will also be putting my stuff in storage and moving out of state to live with my parents for the summer, immediately following graduation. I do not currently have a plan for income during the summer (despite many attempts to find something), and will probably end up working in the hospitality industry to save for the move and pay bills. 


Office 2 is a smaller practice, but is absolutely growing – they just signed on to rent another floor of the building the office is in. It also has a great reputation, but is lesser known due to its size. My academic placement with Office 2 ends on May 25. If I were to accept Office 2's offer, I would start as an attorney on June 4. Office 2 pays $3,000 less per year to start, but I would be employed 3.5 months that I wouldn't be with Office 1 and eligible for a raise after one year (as I would be with Office 1, too). I have never felt more professionally supported than I have since I've been at Office 2. It has such a familial office culture, and I was quickly accepted as a part of that family. Everyone celebrates everyone else's wins in Office 2, and the office maintains a good working relationship with ACS (child protective agency) and the foster care agencies. I almost feel like I am understating how much I love the office culture here. It really has been so great. I started working for Office 2 when they recently hired 5 new attorneys, so it worked out well that I was able to sit through most (&gt;80%) of their training with them as part of my own program, and I would not have to do this training again. I also may not have to move (still waiting on a response from my landlord). At minimum, I could stay in the same borough I am in right now (where I love to live and work), and would be able to use what I make in June to help make the move. 


I know Office 2 understands the difficult decision I have to make, and I do not necessarily think that choosing Office 1 would be closing the door to Office 2 forever. However, if I chose Office 2, I am certain Office 1's bridge would be burnt for good. I have thought about moving equidistant between the two offices and honoring my commitment to Office 1 on a year or so trial basis, leaving open the possibility to return to Office 2 if Office 1 is not a good fit. At the same time, I would hate to expend the energy of going through the financial/logistical difficulties bound to happen this summer if I were to honor my commitment to Office 1, only for it to not work out in the long run and for me to end up right back where I am currently. 


I would really love to hear thoughts. I have been back and forth on this decision constantly, and there are plenty of pros (as well as a couple major cons) to each decision.


**TL;DR:** Accepted a job offer at a great organization in January. Working full-time at another great organization right now and have been given the option to stay. Tons of pros with each, and a couple major cons. Can't decide what to do. Help!"

I inquired about the dress code and they said that they have a collared shirts and no jeans policy and that most of them wear polo shirts/and chinos in the summer.

First of all, what are chinos? I wear khakis occasionally and don’t know the difference. If I were to get some, what are some comfortable options that are below $70 or around that?

How many of them should I buy if those are the pants I’m going to be wearing all week.

Second, what kind of shoes should I buy? I currently have some brownish oxfords but I don’t know if they would go with that. 

For the polo shirts, should I go for solid colors or are horizontal stripes ones okay too? Any other collared shirt suggestions?

Finally, what kind of sweater(s) should I get? I only have hoodies right now. Should I get a jacket too?

As you can tell, I’m not very fashion savvy, so I really appreciate you answering my questions.

Thanks!!"

I'm in my second semester of my first year and recently I saw a job ad for a small firm (60ish employees) looking for an undergrad accountant. The job ad didn't preclude me so I thought I may as well have a go and somehow I managed to get an interview. It went alright, the partners I spoke to seemed like normal people and a week later I was offered a job as a junior accountant (35k salary). That offer is still in the air but I'm just unsure how to proceed. 

&amp;nbsp;

So I can take the job, which sounds amazing because holy shit I have a job, and I figure having a job at this stage is a decent headstart for my career. But on the other hand having a job now prolongs my degree for a while as at best I can do two courses a semester instead of the usual four. Also this place that has been kind enough to offer me a job would probably frown upon me looking at trying to get a nice internship at a bigger firm while studying. Also this place has national affiliation with other firms around the country, but doesn't really enjoy shipping out employees to other cities (and I do want to move to another city in the future, something I mentioned in my interview).

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah, I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm not sure if I should take this job straight away and try and pretend I know what I'm doing or hold off for now and try for a mid/large tier sized firm down the track."
8fstxs,1,2018-04-29,Why I want to change the world,CGD_16,u_CGD_16,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CGD_16/comments/8fstxs/why_i_want_to_change_the_world/,"Today I will post something about my work.

I have been working on the letter since yesterday. But my thoughts and my dreams to realize them for more than a year.

My dreams of making something for the world is a great honor for me and every time something new that I think about every day. Because I am so highly motivated and curious about what will happen in the future, I will tell you every day what I have learned today. Since not only the profits count in my life, of course I will also report from the loser side.

My dream started like this:

When I came to secondary school in February 2017, I did not have a plan yet, which I will do later. Until I was asked by the school to do an internship, which I did. My first internship (November 2016 -&gt; then I was in high school) was that I completed an internship at Bietigheim Wohnbau (BW) as a computer scientist. My second internship was at Isomedia. Isomedia is a mobile phone repair company that not only repairs smartphones, but also repairs computers, tablets, .... On the one hand it was very exciting for me, but after some time very monotonous, because the employees ""only"" exchanged the mobile phone materials.Where is the challenge? So I decided to look for a better internship for the next time, where I can use my school and everyday knowledge.

During the summer holidays of 2017, my family and I flew to China. Because Youtube is blocked in China for some reason, I started reading news. On the Samsung phone was the app ""Upday"", which I read the business news for the first time. That's how I got to know successful entrepreneurs and their history. One of them was Eon Musk. He still fascinates me to a great extent because he had created something visionary out of nowhere, which they certainly thought would not work!

At this time I wanted to work at Tesla. The company, the brand, the cars and much more looked like the future. After a while, other thoughts came into my head. I wanted and I will digitize the world. Many of my ideas, in the opinion of people who know me well, are nonsense or impossible. But when I think about it, all the people who are now successful start small! Since January 2018 I think about how to program a robot for everyday life. To program, you just have to start with it. Since I'm writing my final exam in April 2018, I had to wait until then. That's why I start today.

Start what you feel like. Do not let others influence you!

The future is and will be great if you start now!

have a nice day

8fswcn,3,2018-04-29,HS Junior with some questions regarding ASU,glutzz,ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/8fswcn/hs_junior_with_some_questions_regarding_asu/,"Hi! I hate to do one of these posts but I just wanted to ask some questions that current students will be able to answer! I'm seriously considering ASU for computer science. 

1. This is to computer science majors. How is job placement out of college? I read that ASU feeds a lot of its graduates into silicon valley companies but I wasn't sure if this is just because of the sheer size of the university of because of the resources it offers it's students. Have the career fairs been a good way of securing internships from top companies? 
2. How are the CS classes in general? Do you think you're benefitting from the material taught? 
3. Is Tooker House really as awesome as they are making it seem? 
4. I'm from Georgia, so I'm used to hot humid weather, but I hear the heat in Arizona is a different kind of heat. As in it's more dry than humid. Is this true? 
5. Are the people here generally pretty welcoming? How is the sports culture at the school? A lot of school spirit? 
6. Can you name one thing that you believe sets ASU apart from most other schools? Is there one thing you wish the school can approve on? 

EDIT: 7. Any cool clubs you guys are apart of? 

Sorry for the wall of text! I appreciate anybody that can answer some of these questions and help me on my journey of picking a school!

8ftawz,26,2018-04-29,Scenes that you're supposed to love but you hate,CaramelCold,GilmoreGirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/8ftawz/scenes_that_youre_supposed_to_love_but_you_hate/,"Do you have scenes that you know were written so that viewers would love them \- but you just hate them?

I can name two that stand out to me particularly \- season 6 spoilers:

1. Rory landing the job at the Stanford Eagle Gazette \- I agree with the general thought that Rory must have had, how she would be perfect for the paper because of her internship there and her skills. I just hate how she got the job. I'm sure we are supposed to root for her assertiveness and her confidence in this scene, and how we're probably meant to feel like the ""old"", smart Rory is finally back after being away from Yale etc.. But to me her attitude towards the paper's editor came off as entitled and snotty. It rubbed me the wrong way and I couldn't feel proud or happy for her. Plus she did it in that high\-pitched voice that I hate. I could not relate to her at all, and it was lost on me.
2. Zack's proposal to Lane \- It was meant to be a very sweet, happy moment, but I felt sad. I wish Lane would not have gotten a marriage proposal from a guy like Zack, while working a shift as a diner waitress, in front of the eccentric crowd of her small town. I wanted more for Lane! I was sad that the creators didn't write her a better story. That moment felt like a lazy way to end her character's development. Plus neither Rory nor Lorelai were there to witness it when it happened.

Edit: By writing that Lane was a ""diner waitress"" I meant that we saw her take the job right after she left her mom's house, out of sheer necessity. I didn't think that she'd still keep it by then. I expected a bit more progress for her, even with a day job that wasn't the exact epitome of her professional dream \(like maybe she could work for Sophie\). I was disappointed that she was still working at Luke's at that point.  "
8ftflq,0,2018-04-29,Suffering for the sake of suffering (Deadpool Comparison),Monsur_Ausuhnom,TokyoGhoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/TokyoGhoul/comments/8ftflq/suffering_for_the_sake_of_suffering_deadpool/,"WARNING I will discus Deadpool and facts from the movie trailer.  If you haven't played, read or seen Deadpool in theaters, on video or television/video games then I would advise you to find out ""what this Deadpool is.""  

Today, I wanted to discuss suffering.  The Uta fight with Yomo has led me to conclude that the clowns want to suffer.  

This suffering is something that they can choose to do. In real life, I wouldn't be able to stop someone being depressed if that was there mindset and they didn't wish to see it from other lenses.  It's naturally okay to be sad.  It' just with the clowns its a bit of obtaining pleasure from pain and suffering.  

In the story, I would argue that this clowning has turned into an addiction that is need of rehabilation.  The role of wanting to be treated with respect is something Touka said to Akira's Dad. Accept, you see imo that's sort of the problem.  Ghouls want to be humans, but most people aren't really extraordinary.  It seems to me that they should embrace their own powers and settle with being themselves.   Having a symbiotic/mutual relationship between the two groups helps with this department.  

Kaneki has pointed it out already.  Kaneki being naturally naïve and thrust into the story to fix everything as a new viewpoint seems to make the most sense.  He doesn't have the need to go wild and destroy for the sake of destroying (Eto-this gets her killed by Furuta and she admits this), nor does this lead to a create your Kaiju (Furuta)  sweepstakes and watch it rampage through Tokyo, nor does it mean committing suicide and having that person hold your own burden and suffering like Atlas (Arima)

I would argue that both Uta and Kaneki are at equal fault of not allowing the emptiness to be with them.  Kaneki doesn't want to be alone and so he would rather shoulder the entire burden of the world so he doesn't have to be alone.  This brings us to the next discussion Deadpool.

Imo, Kaneki could learn a thing or two from Deadpool.  Deadpool doesn't dismiss humans that want to join his team.  In many instances, Kaneki would have dismissed Hide if he wanted to join Banjou and Shuu's group in the original TG.  I do note this has changed in recent chapters. 

 This is exemplified by the new recruit Peter who saw the add, has no special powers whatsoever, and joins the X-Force.  I mean it seems to me that Hide became an intern the same way with the CCG.  Let's remember what Hide has done by just being human.  Anything is possible. Deadpool wants to see it happen and is ok with it.  Kaneki needs to learn from this and he is.  

Amon struggles the same way that Deadpool stuggled with Vanessa.  He isolates himself from Vanessa because he's too afraid she won't like him anymore because he's deformed.  Touka, like Vanessa, is quite committed to Kaneki went he goes Kafka on the reader and rampages through Tokyo.  Initially, Kaneki and Amon are guilty just like Deadpool.  Kaneki with Hide and Touka.  Deadpool with Vanessa.  

Where Deadpool excels is that he isn't trying to be very special.  He's just being deadpool. In the movies, Deadpool is at top his game.   He has shattered box office records and seems to achieve a perfect balance of not being a complete sadistic psycho like Francis nor a moral code follower like Colossus.  Deadpool has failed many times.  He has killed the Marvel Universe at one point.  Accept, he is still trying to do the right thing for the most part and in Deadpool 2 is still in a relationship.  Let's face it.  How many superheroes have a functioning relationship being a superhero in Marvel movies without something going wrong or awry?

Obviously, something resonates with viewers with Deadpool destroying the box office.  There's a certain tragedy to it.  Deadpool in the comics will tell everyone that he is the highest R rated hero and no one will believe him, thinking he wont' shut up and is annoying.  But you see that's actually why I like Deadpool, there's a certain level of moderation with his behavior.  It isn't extremes.  Like being a full blown sufferer or something that relishes in bringing pain to others to feel better about themselves.

Deadpool gives me hope for Kaneki.  He is on the right path.  Kaneki's  idea of opening a coffee shop like Yoshimura is the right track.  Like Deadpool, Kaneki's done some pretty bad stuff a long the way, but they can learn from it and for the most part have a pretty good relationship with other people (well maybe not with Deadpool in the comics).  Unless on Kaneki's part  something comes from the future and wants to fight.  Then we get a Cable scenario and a movie out of it, but this is TG.  

TL;DR

The clowns suffer because they enjoy it.  Kaneki needs to have a mindset similar to Deadpool.  Not try to work in extremes of shouldering the burden of the world or the clown's taking pleasure at other's failings or sufferings to feel powerful.  Deadpool's own success at the box office and his allowance of Peter leads me to believe that Kaneki is on the right track and if Deadpool can do it so can he."
8ftiw2,3,2018-04-29,[24/f] and my [36/m] ex-boyfriend...need honest feedback aka advice,whateverandok,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8ftiw2/24f_and_my_36m_exboyfriendneed_honest_feedback/,"This will be lengthy, but, please I am in desperate need of advice, support, or feedback. I am turning 25 this September, and he turned 36 in January. 

February 2017: we met on facebook &amp; we were living in the same State at the time. We went on  dates and became bf/gf. From the beginning I told him that I will be going overseas to do service work for two years... being aware of this, he still proceeded and ""committed"".

end of April 2017: I was offered internships in a different State and we maintained a healthy closed LDR, until August 2017.

August 2017: We met up and spent a week together. We met in his hometown and I met his mother, father, and uncle. We were able to spend a little over a wk together. 

September 2017 - present: I left for my volunteer service, we've had minor disagreements and navigated jealously, talked about openLDR (disagreed), and I tried convincing him of how fast the time would fly. 

Even though we disagreed to openLDR we never agreed to anything SOLID. however, I've always told him I'm committed, willing to return to the USA after this journey(not do another term or go overseas again - until we are more established),  plan for him to see me (offered to pay for his flight), point is - I tried making it work...

April 9th 2018: He told me that he went out to a bar, went home with a woman he just met, and had a heavy make-out session in her bed. The week after finding this out, I was in pain, going through it WITH him over video chat/phone. Week 2 - somehow was falling back into being together/friends...

But, i caught myself because he left his SDcard/chapstick at her house and I told him that it feels as if he's hanging this over my head, b/c eventually, he has to go get his stuff.  He then said he's interested in seeing where things go with her...multiple times that week, but towards the end of that week, changed his mind and wanted to try (For a split second.) 

2 days ago, I asked him: ""tell me what you want to do, explore things with this woman or figure out a way we can get through this LDR, because two years is a drop in the bucket compared to a possible lifetime together."" he said he wants to explore things with her........................He also said this isn't him choosing her over me, it is him not wanting to be monogamous.

Note: he is going through a ""career change"" and I supported him while he was down, feeling worthless/ like a failure, and now that things are turning around for him - it feels as if he's tossing me away. he always tells me how insecure he is and stuff, and I've always been there to help him out, even from a different country. 


Ugh, I don't even know what I am trying to ask...I love him, I really do. I feel so betrayed, used, and my self-esteem has plummeted. I'm unsure if I should contact him wanting to try OLDR, just for the sake of trying, or stick to what I want...a committed relationship?

Because in all honesty, time is flying and these first 7 months have flown by, and with visitations every (4-7 months, it would've flown), I want to believe that it is possible to have a monogamous LDR, as long as both parties T R Y. 

Side note: I'm volunteering with peace corps and I'm trying to improve myself and a few folks along the way. I'm trying to build myself, future, and foundation - I'm not out here lollygagging ""finding myself"". It hurts that I'm sacrificing and getting repaid this way. &lt;--hope this makes sense.  

We haven't spoken in two days and it feels like months, but this time, I refuse to cave...I'm sitting in the middle of a rural town and don't have anyone to bounce this off of, so fellow friends - please help me. 

**tl;dr** [24/f] and my [36/m] ex-partner of a year, majority LDR, he made-out with someone else and now doesn't want to be monogamous but I do. How to move forward?"
8fulwx,5,2018-04-29,Clinton Crime Syndicate,AhuwahZeus,conspiracyfact,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracyfact/comments/8fulwx/clinton_crime_syndicate/,"The Clintons are one of the most corrupt families in the United States and they are working with the British Crown, Clinton Peerage, German noble families, and the Vatican and the Colonna and Capponi families which are the primary owners of the Chicago Outfit. Hillary Clinton is the head of the Clinton crime family and she is ruthless and murderous. She runs the Democratic party like a mafia boss. Hillary Clinton not only supports abortion but promotes it. Both Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton were educated at Yale University which is a college established by the British Crown. Bill Clinton was also Jesuit educated at Georgetown University. Bill Clinton's step father's ancestry is from the Barons Clinton in England currently headed up by Gerard Neville Mark Fane-Trefusis the 22nd Baron Clinton and his son Charles Patrick Rolle Fane-Trefusis as well as Robert Edward Fiennes-Clinton the 19th Earl of Lincoln. The Baron Clintons own the Clinton Devon Estates which has 25,000 acres of land. Bill Clinton's birth name was Blythe. Geoffrey Blythe was an English bishop whose mother was named Rotherham similar to the name Rodham. The town of Rotherham had a child sexual exploitation scandal in the 1980's up into 2010. Hillary Rodham Clinton has English and Scottish ancestry.

The Rodham family established the names of Rotherham, England and also Rodheim, Germany a small town in Hesse under the authority of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mainz and later under the authority of the Eppstein noble family which served the German House of Hesse. Jeffrey Epstein is a wealthy financier and pedophile that was convicted of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. Jeffrey Epstein is friends with Bill Clinton who he flew to Africa in his private jet. It has been reported that Bill Clinton has flown on Jeffrey Epstein's jet numerous times. Bill Clinton also has been exposed for being a sexual predator by various women. There are a multitude of suspicious deaths connected to the Clinton family and many of them were about covering up Bill Clintons affairs and rapes. It is believed that the Clinton Foundation raised and misappropriated funds for disaster relief in Haiti after the Earthquake in 2010 which also affected the Dominican Republic. Frank Giustra is a board member for the Clinton Foundation and part owner of Wheaton River Minerals which absorbed into Goldcorp. Goldcorp purchased 40% of the Pueblo Viejo mine located in the Dominican Republic near the Haitian border in 2012. It is likely the Clinton Foundation used Haiti relief funds as pay offs to get the contracts for the gold mines.

Chelsea Clinton is on the board of directors for InterActiveCorp which is a internet media company with the billionaire Barry Diller as the Chairman. Barry Diller was married to Princess Diane von Furstenberg and her son Prince Alexander von Furstenberg is also on the board of directors of IAC with Chelsea Clinton. The Furstenberg family are a Roman Catholic German nobility closely connected with the Vatican and have many family branches all over the former Holy Roman Empire. Barry Diller is worth over 3 billion and co-founded Fox Broadcasting. The Georgetown Jesuit educated Princess Talita Natasha von Furstenberg worked as an intern for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The Clintons have a close alliance with the House of Furstenberg. The Clintons have many suspicious and untimely deaths surrounding them and some estimate they have ordered the assassination of dozens. Some suspicious deaths are of James McDougal, Vince Foster, Ron Brown, and Kathy Ferguson as well as many more. The Clinton family have connections to the Vatican through Bill Clinton's education at Georgetown and also ties to Chicago where Hillary Clinton was originally from.

I believe that many of the hits the Clinton family ordered were carried out by the Chicago Outfit and also their associates in the Dixie Mafia. Dixie mob boss Kirksey Nix was an associate of Chicago gangster Sam Giancana. Kirksey Nix was arrested for automatic weapons in Arkansas and the Dixie Mafia have a large operation there. Bill Clinton was a Governor of Arkansas. Al Capone was a co-founder of the Chicago Outfit and a relative of the Florentine House of Capponi which is headed up by Count Neri Capponi today. The Colonna family of Rome and Alban Hills are the primary owners of the Chicago Outfit. Barack Obama taught at the University of Chicago to make connections with Chicago Outfit. On top of their kill list Bill Clinton authorized the US involvement in NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia which killed at least hundreds of civilians and displaced many more which was really an attempt to assist the Albanian mafia in taking over there. The clans from Alban Hills in Rome like the Colonna family founded and oversee Albania. The Black Nobility of Rome, German nobility, and British Peers, are all working together. They prop up, protect, and enable criminal political families which do their bidding in the United States. The Clinton crime family are a highly destructive force on America and the world.

Through an aggressive takeover strategy and taking advantage of the exploding price of gold, Telfer turned an insignificant shell company into a billion dollar gold producer in just four years. In 2005, he helped engineer the $2.4-billion share swap that saw Goldcorp absorb Wheaton River.

And this also explains \(besides the factor that many are already wealthy\) why Asians tend to excel financially. Looking at you u/CommunismDoesntWork. Imo this adaptation of the system they have had the longest naturally gives them a leg up. “Gaming the system” is culturally ingrained. I know, I am half Asian myself. Gaming systems is taken as a point of pride among Asians. In school, the Chinese students in particular  were rampant cheaters and cheated off me constantly. Even in the middle of large exams in view of the professor who did nothing as they were rich as hell and paying boatloads to the college.

Key Points:

He also pointed me to a telling passage in Diary of a Very Bad Year, Keith Gessen's interviews with a hedge\-fund manager:

HFM: I’m sure today I would never get hired.

n\+1: Really?

HFM: Yeah, it would be impossible because I had no background, or I had a very exiguous background in finance. The guy who hired me always talked about hiring good intellectual athletes, people who were sort of mentally agile in an all\-around way, and that the specifics of finance you could learn, which I think is true. But at the time, I mean, no hedge fund was really flooded with applicants, and that allowed him to let his mind range a little bit and consider different kinds of candidates. Today we have a recruiting group, and what do they do? They throw résumés at you, and it’s, like, one business school guy, one finance major after another, kids who, from the time they were twelve years old, were watching Jim Cramer and dreaming of working in a hedge fund. And I think in reality that probably they’re less likely to make good investors than people with sort of more interesting backgrounds.

n\+1: Why?

HFM: Because I think that in the end the way that you make a ton of money is calling paradigm shifts, and people who are real finance types, maybe they can work really well within the paradigm of a particular kind of market or a particular set of rules of the game—and you can make money doing that—but the people who make huge money, the George Soroses and Julian Robertsons of the world, they’re the people who can step back and see when the paradigm is going to shift, and I think that comes from having a broader experience, a little bit of a different approach to how you think about things.l

I agree with both observations. Part of this, of course, is rising inequality and unemployment: people are desperate to get one of the seats on the lifeboat, and the lifeboat captain can be choosier and choosier.

But I think that we are looking at something even deeper than that: the Mandarinization of America.

The Chinese imperial bureaucracy was immensely powerful. Entrance was theoretically open to anyone, from any walk of society—as long as they could pass a very tough examination. The number of passes was tightly restricted to keep the bureaucracy at optimal size.

Passing the tests and becoming a “scholar official” was a ticket to a very good, very secure life. And there is something to like about a system like this ... especially if you happen to be good at exams. Of course, once you gave the imperial bureaucracy a lot of power, and made entrance into said bureaucracy conditional on passing a tough exam, what you have is ... a country run by people who think that being good at exams is the most important thing on earth. Sound familiar?

The people who pass these sorts of admissions tests are very clever. But they're also, as time goes on, increasingly narrow. The way to pass a series of highly competitive exams is to focus every fiber of your being on learning what the authorities want, and giving it to them. To the extent that the ""Tiger Mom"" phenomenon is actually real, it's arguably the cultural legacy of the Mandarin system.

All elites are good at rationalizing their eliteness, whether it's meritocracy or “the divine right of kings.” The problem is the mandarin elite has some good arguments. They really are very bright and hardworking. It’s just that they’re also prone to be conformist, risk averse, obedient, and good at echoing the opinions of authority, because that is what this sort of examination system selects for.

The even greater danger is that they become more and more removed from the people they are supposed to serve. Since I moved to Washington, I have had series of extraordinary conversations with Washington journalists and policy analysts, in which I remark upon some perfectly ordinary facet of working\-class, or even business\-class life, only to have this revelation met with amazement.

In fact, I think that to some extent, the current political wars are a culture war not between social liberals and social conservatives, but between the values of the mandarin system and the values of those who compete in the very different culture of ordinary businesses\-\-ones outside glamour industries like tech or design. 

My experience of working\-class life consists of some relatives, a few summer jobs, a stint in the secretarial pool at a nonprofit, three years with a firm that had a substantial cable\-installation practice, and one year in a construction trailer at Ground Zero. Most of my work experience is in writing stuff, and then talking about what I write. I'm hardly the Voice of the Proletariat. Or the Voice of Industry, for that matter.

And yet, this is apparently considerably more experience than many of my fellow journalists have, especially the younger ones. The road to a job as a public intellectual now increasingly runs through a few elite schools, often followed by a series of very\-low\-paid internships that have to be subsidized by well\-heeled parents, or at least a free bedroom in a major city. The fact that I have a somewhat meandering work and school history, and didn't become a journalist until I was 30, gives me some insight \(she said, modestly\) that is hard to get if you’re on a laser\-focused track that shoots you out of third grade and straight toward a career where you write and think for a living. Almost none of the kids I meet in Washington these days even had boring menial high\-school jobs working in a drugstore or waiting tables; they were doing “enriching” internships or academic programs. And thus the separation of the mandarin class grows ever more complete.

I’m hinting at the final problem, which is that this ostensibly meritocratic system increasingly selects from those with enough wealth and connections to first, understand the system, and second, prepare the right credentials to enter it—as I believe it also did in Imperial China. And like all elites, they believe that they not only rule because they can, but because they should.

As I say, the mandarins are in many senses deserving: they work very hard, and they are very smart. But there is one important thing they do not know, which is what it is like to be anyone except a mandarin. The first generation to come out of the postwar education revolution did; their parents frequently had quite banal jobs, possibly ones that left them with dirt under their fingernails after a day's work. \(I remember as a child watching my grandfather's hands with fascination: after decades in a service station, they were permanently darkened from oil and dirt. He would come home from work every day and go into the first\-floor powder room to wash his hands and shave before dinner ... but though I watched him scrub and scrub very thoroughly, the gray never entirely came off.\)

But the people entering journalism, or finance, or consulting, or any other ""elite"" profession, are increasingly the children of the children of those who rocketed to prosperity through the postwar education system. A window that opened is closing. The mandarins are pulling away from the rest of America.

My grandfather had maybe 10 books in his house \(that weren't written for children\), but he could take a failing service station and make it succeed, while I'm pretty sure that I would take a successful gas station and make it fail. He also, I might add, was very successful at actually running a small town \(as an alderman\) and a charitable institution \(the local Rotary\). I'm not sure we're better off cutting off the paths to success and power taken by people like him, so that we can funnel it all through a series of academic hoops. I'm not sure we haven't ended up with a class of people who know everything about gas stations except what it takes to make one succeed. 

Now I would invite this subreddit to consider these above words and then to read the bio of the inventor of the microwave, although he is not the only one.

[www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a19567/how\-the\-microwave\-was\-invented\-by\-accident/](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a19567/how-the-microwave-was-invented-by-accident/)

Now ask yourselves, does he succeed in the modern era like he did IRL in the past? The answer is likely no sadly.

And finally, check out this article regarding the relation of this mandarinization to the increasingly adverse career prospects for men in general:

htt ps://historynewsnetwork.org/blog/12496

Now some of you will say that ending federal subsidies for higher education is the key to ending this but imo that is wrong. Firstly, the government can use its aid money to force colleges to keep prices low much like is planned for healthcare costs. Secondly in this case private capital is using it as a way to lock people out of top societal positions, and educational outfits are hankering for maximum profit, guaranteeing this cycle continues."

Please advise",techknowfile,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/8fvehx/29_cavities_in_almost_every_tooth_need_8_root/,"After years of not going to a dentist, I finally got in to a local dental school as a patient. The first inspection revealed cavities in almost every tooth, and it has since been made clear to me that my front 6 teeth, plus at least 2 others, need root canals + crowns as soon as possible. 

They have done one root canal so far, which was botched (didn't fill the entire root) and had to be redone. That tooth, which after the first root canal had a large chunk chip off, now has a hole forming at the gum line, feels very weak, and becomes very sensitive when eating hot soup-type foods.

I start a summer internship soon, where I'm planning to save every dime in order to get my teeth taken care of. At the dental school, the root canal/crowns will cost about $700/tooth. I'm scared, given my experience with their first root canal, that maybe having the dental work completed there could be a mistake. Then again, the procedure is probably $2-3k per tooth at a normal dentists office.

I'm a poor grad student with too much in student loan debt, and want to make sure that I make the best financial and dental decisions possible. Any advice regarding what other dentists think I should do, or others who have been in a similar situation, would be very greatly appreciated.

Thank you!"

**Scenario:**

----

“Goddammit,” exclaimed Manny, “I thought you said you could drive!”

{if.passengers=true, then.destroycar}

Maks was currently integrated into the computer of a now wrecked Nissan Altima. Bikini Bottom wanted to test if Maks could become the autopilot of the robo-whale by seeing if it was capable of commandeering vehicles… At least, commandeering them without killing the passengers, like when they sicced it on Joe Armstrong. It appears the old AI was simply too fond of killing meatbags after that last outing.

“Now look what you’ve done. We’ve lost a car, and there’s no telling what’ll happen to this guy.” Manny said, pointing to a bleeding mess lying in the backseat of their car. “I can’t even just harvest his organs and dump the body because the dealership will *know* their best salesman went missing on a test drive!”

{extracting program.MAKS_13 from.altima}

MAKS willfully extracted from the car and returned into his miraculously undamaged mobile terminal. Manny then picked up the bleeding man. 

“You got a GPS on this thing?”

{GPS=true}

“Good,” he said. “It’s probably better we entrust this to people who haven’t had their license revoked.”

Not far off, however, something both similar and different had happened…


----

Jules had grown attached to his convertible, especially in recent days since he won a pretty hard fight in it. So, obviously, he was rather ticked when he got into an accident. He was a little bit shaken by it, even as calm as he usually was. “Ah, crap… Crap, crap… I’d just finished paying this thing off.”

In the meantime, Tsao Xu was just lying still as he usually did. He had no real thought about the loss of the car. Cars weren’t a factor unto his grand philosophy. However, he did find the yelling to be rather obnoxious. 

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a man in a condition that, minus the bleeding, could be superficially called similar to his own by mortals: he looked close to dead. *This man’s mortal coil shall not be severed by this error,* he thought to himself. His stand activated and he pushed a wheel in front of his partner, catching his attention. The wheel then rolled next to the bleeding man. 

“Oh…” Jules said. “We gotta help this guy. Alright… Deep breaths. Keep calm, be *zen,* like this guy.” He grabbed the man with his stand and propped Tsao onto a wheelchair. 

“Come on, let’s go.”

---

""Doctor Feelgood, report to the Floor 2 prep room, patient coming your way. I repeat, Doctor Tim, report to the Floor 2 prep room, patient coming---""

*The announcement on the floor is interrupted by a short burst of static, and a familiar voice speaks at the four Stand Users.*

""Hey there, folks! You heard the lady! Doctor Feelgood, Floor 2 Prep room! Why don't y'all be good Samaritans, and help out yer fellow man a little? This ain't exactly relevant to your searchin', I know, but... Maybe me an' T can throw in a little something for you gettin' that patient in safe, yeah? Poor Doc can only handle one at a time, though, so you best be quick! Stay safe! Save those folk's lives! And above all else -""

""Stand Proud!""

Hospital chatter returned as the four stand users, in different parts of the crowded hospital, understood what the Stand Proud broadcast coming on at all must mean. 

If they didn’t get there fast, another pair of users would.

*Oh?* An intern, waiting around on the ground floor, thinks to herself at the announcement, meanwhile. *First the grand canyon, and now this, huh? I just keep seeing so many interesting things since getting ‘that!’ Well, guess I should see who gets to that doc first!*

----

**Location:** The match starts with the team close to different entrances to the Dr Dre Clinic. Any elevators are currently under maintenance, which is going slow due to recent international superstition about elevator crashes.

[Starting/Ground Floor] (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/439910369318928395/440234997056667660/HospitalGF.png). Starting points are deliberately chosen to be a roughly equal distance away from the first flight of stairs. Treat them as such even if it’s a bit off.

[First Floor](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/439910369318928395/440233960186839061/Hospital1F.png).

[Second Floor](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/439910369318928395/440233944005476382/Hospital2F.png).


For a reference on distance, treat the size of the hospital rooms dotting the edges as roughly 6x5 meters. Rooms larger than the average are proportionately larger.

The area itself is a bit crowded, with dozens of people on every floor. For mobility purposes, Tsao Xu has been given a wheelchair. Weird Science and Mirror Ball start off carrying their respective patients on their backs.

You can expect to find, basically, what you would expect to find in any decent hospital in the sections shown on the maps.

**Goal:**  Carry your guy to Exam room 13 on the second floor ( before your opponent does. There, the only doctor currently available, Dr. Dick Feelgood, is simply waiting around for nothing in particular. However, he will be able to save your companion’s life with ease.

Killing your way into another free doctor in the attempt to create a tie will NOT be a viable strategy. It will get you forcefed hospital food, causing your internal organs to fatally rupture. MAKS, instead, will have Windows 10 installed, to similar effects. The only way to win the match is the goal described above.

**Additional Notes:**

Tsao Xu and Jules know how their opponents’ stands work due to a combination of Tsao’s infinite wisdom and the fact that they were a part of a huge news story.

Dr. Jekyll told his teammates about Tsao Xu and how he works, so his stand is known to them, and meanwhile MAKS googled Jules on the Even Darker Web at some point to learn about Mirror Ball.

The average person in the hospital just has average stats across the board (2s in all physical categories, special stats completely irrelevant), and vary from doctors and interns running around, patients walking or being wheeled around, and visitors wandering the halls.

Lounging in the hall on the ground floor, however, is an apparently disinterested yet oddly smiley ""hospital intern"" by the name of Yoko, idly sniffing a flower. She won’t interfere at all on behalf of either team, and generally be pretty good at avoiding collateral damage with off-the-charts acrobatic skills. She’s not even paying attention all *that* much, but she can see stands, and she’ll generally try to follow the action of whatever team is closest to her, as well as following them up the floors after they cross her by. *Her* stats are Agility 5, Durability 4, Strength 2, Clown 4, Attention Span 1.

Since Yoko is rather easily distracted, so long as she herself isn’t in any particular danger. This is good news for both teams, because she is a **very powerful stand user** who will very effectively and suddenly deliver a rather abrupt stand rush should she **personally witness** members from either team harming patients or hospital staff deliberately. She won’t do so if she doesn’t directly witness the attack, even if coming across its after-effects makes the perpetrators obvious, but she also cannot be fooled into thinking the other team responsible. Her eyesight is decent, but only human.

It is impossible to defeat her or figure out how her stand works, and trying to do anything more than distract or work around her will be a massive and pointless time sink for either team, but actively keep her in mind.

8fvo2j,365,2018-04-29,"If the main characters in Riverdale applied to college, they'd slay admissions.",beaux-restes,riverdale,https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/8fvo2j/if_the_main_characters_in_riverdale_applied_to/,"I started binging on Riverdale in the midst of my slight stress with college application season coming up next year. And from my experience and extensive research on reading college stats and results, I kind of built up a rough idea of what each person's college application would look like, and what they'd most likely get into. 


Before I lay them out, I'd just like to say that each of the characters each have a passion or a hobby that they invest a lot of their time in (especially Jughead), and I found it really really nice and cool to see how they spend their lives in high school solving murders and mysteries as well as doing their homework and pursuing things they liked all in a small quaint town. 

Without further ado...


**Archie**

* Extracurriculars: Football captain, singer-songwriter, was in a band, performed in the Carrie musical, campaigning in a mayoral election, and founder and leader of The Red Circle to combat a local serial killer 
* GPA: ~3.7 unweighted
* Volunteers at family construction company in the summer 
* Intern for a famous business leader/mobster 
* Takes a lot of initiative, courageous, cares for his family and friends, comes from low-income working class family
* Would likely get into Berklee College of Music, Boston University, community college (?.. lolol)
* Major would be music, or if he's still sticking around for his dad, construction engineering? 


**Betty**

* Extracurriculars: Cheerleading, involved in student council, writer and editor for The Blue and Gold newspaper, helped take down many evil bois, in the Carrie musical, and public speaker, gang by legacy 
* GPA: 4.0 unweighted
* Overcame challenges with mental health, kind with determination, takes initiative, advocate, middle-high income(?) 
* Likely to belong at Princeton, UCs, Harvard, Smith, Emory
* Major would be English, journalism, environmental studies, anthropology, philosophy, psychology


**Veronica**

* Extracurriculars: cheerleader, party organizer, involved in student council, school tour guide (?), business adviser in family business (dunno how else to label her role in Lodge Industries), campaigner in an election
* GPA: 3.8 unweighted
* URM, high income (very high), loyal, overcame challenge of being a bully, also an advocate, courageous
* Likely to go to NYU, Columbia, basically all the UCs, Stanford
* Major would definitely be business, law, perhaps psychology

**Jughead**

* Extracurriculars: Film maker, writer and editor for The Blue and Gold, helped start up the newspaper at Southside High after it died, reads books, advocate for the drive in and local diner, writer for a book/novel, loves all things crime/noir, in a gang by legacy (lol), loves to solve murders and conspiracy theories
* GPA: 3.3 unweighted
* Very well read and intellectually curious, loyal, does what needs to be done, sticks up for friends and family, passionate, observant, low income
* Likely to go to NYU (obviously), LACs (?)
* Major would be film studies, photography, English, literature, creative writing etc.

**Cheryl**

* Extracurriculars: Captain of the cheerleading team, party organizer, advocate, public speaking, involved in the school board, student council, chairperson for the formal, (supposed to be) lead in Carrie the musical
* GPA: 4.0 (I've actually read this confirmed somewhere)
* An all out Slytherin, fierce and loyal, superb advocate, par negotiation skills, high income, kind (somewhat), went through almost half her family dying, escaped from a gay conversion convent, LGBT
* Likely to go to Smith, Mount Holyoke, Wellesley, UCLA, Princeton, Vanderbilt, Rice, NYU, Fordham - Rose Hill (I think she'd definitely fit here)
* Major would be theater, political science, business

I thought of stuff for Kevin, but, it's not fully fleshed out yet. I can definitely see him at NYU though, perhaps in theater or something.

Feel free to provide thoughts or corrections if needed! I know I'm definitely missing some facts and such here and there. I just really truly saw a lot of potential in almost everyone in terms of college and such and I really wanted to lay this out. So yeah. 

Update: Tough crowd huh owo. Also changed Jughead’s GPA. Archie’s income due to his mom being a lawyer. Betty as a serpent. Veronica and Archie. Readjusted GPA. C h e r y l.

I've been doing really well, truly. I've been happy, but that doesn't mean the anxiety and stress have decreased. I'm constantly worrying about something, I'm always irresponsible when it comes to spending money and that makes me depressed because I hate disappointing my mom. I'm worried about calling the lady I'm doing an internship for in the morning to tell her I can't come in. I don't want her to be irritated with me. But then again I don't give a fuck because I want her to ""fire"" me even if I've only worked once. My stupid counselor basically said in a nutshell that it's no use doing this internship since it's at a law office and not a medical office, since my study is in the medical field. So I'm worried about that.

Constant. Fucking. Stress, worry, and mild depression. (Last summer I was diagnosed with major depression, have had a few major episodes since coming to school but they didn't last for long, now they are small and last a few days or more.)

I'm struggling with sexual orientation, and then I feel I'm too attached to my teacher but also it doesn't feel unhealthy but maybe that doesn't mean it isn't?

So yes. I gave in and cut. Not huge cuts, just a few on my leg and a slight one on my wrist. I'm fucked up because I'm hoping my instructor, whom I love so so so very much, might notice and inquire on what it is. I don't fucking know."

Good evening Reddit!

An Algerian pen pal is considering going to Belgium to finish her Medicine degree \(she's in her 4th year of med school\), but before doing so, would like to have a few questions answered about whether it's possible to do so.

A little background info on her:

\- in her 4th year of medicine \(meaning she already completed her ""bachelor"" and is now in her first year of masters\)

\- she can show her grades of previous exams/courses and get the university to prove their validity

\- native french speaker \(useful/required for internships if in Wallonia\)

The questions:

\- is it possible for someone with her background to study medicine here?

\- is there an admission procedure she needs to complete despite aforementioned background? \(admission exam for example\)

\- if she gets in, is she able to start where she left off \(so the 2nd masters year\) or does she need to study everything all over again?

We'd be very happy if we could find some light here! Have a great weekend /r/Belgium

8fwpjr,19,2018-04-29,Switching specialties for financial reasons,zeppelinpage4,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/8fwpjr/switching_specialties_for_financial_reasons/,"I'm in need of some serious advice. I hate writing this because I know I went into medicine to help people and for a passion for the job, but I've recently come to realities with my finances and I feel I need to change specialties or career tracks ASAP. Or at least figure out what I need to do to reach my end\-goal.

I'm near the end of my intern year in pediatrics at a very supportive and reputable program. I chose pediatrics because I loved working with children, and work/life balance is important to me and most pediatricians I knew seemed to have that. 

BUT, my intern year has been grueling and I've been finding I don't enjoy the specialty as much as I thought I would. I still like it, but I don't have a passion or love for it like the other residents around me. I've done ambulatory, NICU, inpatient and everything else, I didn't mind any of it and liked some, but I don't feel much excitement for it. I could honestly leave it now and I don't think I would miss it. 

Along with this, I've been contemplating my desire to have a family and raise kids in the next 5\-6 years. And I want to be able to make enough to support a wife and kids by that time, not just comfortably but to give them a good life. 

I'm \&gt;250K in debt with the interest, and with debt repayments, taxes, malpractice, and other family expenses, I'm realizing I won't have much left if my starting salary as an attending is 150K. I might have a comfortable middle class life, but it would never be more than that. I wouldn't be able to pay for my kid's college, or take my family on nice vacations regularly. Knowing how many years I've put in, and how much I've sacrificed already, and will need to sacrifice for this career, I want to have a better living that that. I don't think pediatrics will give me that life. If I had a passion for kids, I'd overlook the salary, but right now I don't have much of a passion for anything in medicine. So I just want to find a specialty, or non\-clinical career that will have practical tangible benefits, either in lifestyle or pay, and just focus on that. 

I'm a US MD, but I'm not a competitive applicant \(step 1 score 190, step 2 score 223\). I also have to delay my intern year by 3 months because I was slower to adapt and need more time to re\-mediate or get extra practice on rotations. 

Truthfully I don't even know if I could switch specialties this late in the year after most programs have filled up in the match. But I could really use some advice on what would be the best course of action at this point. 

1\) Do I suck it up and finish my peds residency and find a way to make a better salary after? Is there any way to comfortably break 220 or even make 250K in pediatrics? I'm willing to go into non\-clinical avenues, like consulting, health IT, or administration if that's more lucrative. 

2\) Try to find whatever open position I get in adult IM or any adult specialty that will take me and hope for the best? 

3\) Take the next year to build my application and figure out what I really want to do, and apply for another specialty to start next year?

I was looking at radiology, PM&amp;R, or IM sub\-specialties, all of which I had an interest in as a med student, and I think I would still find a career in those rewarding, but these are all very competitive and I'm not delusional. I could leave my residency, and then fail to get a position at any of the above and be \*\*\*\*ed. With the debt, I just feel incredibly trapped and depressed with my career. I don't enjoy what I do, nor do I see a future in it, but I feel like I have no realistic avenue to pursue.

I know it's stupid to go into medicine for the money, I didn't do it for the money back then, but I'm in a place in life now that I need to consider finances, lifestyle, and family. All stuff I never seriously thought about in my early 20s when I started this journey. 150K seemed like a lot back then, and my debt seemed like nothing, but looking how much more I could make in literally any other medical specialty except pediatrics, I'm re\-considering my salary and life goals.

Also, other than the touchy feely parts, are there objective tangible benefits to a career in pediatrics that other specialties don't have? "

I go to bars and dance(i love to dance) and interact but have no interest in talking to girls or most other new people in general.  Subliminally I think it's because I have weak social skills and I'm rationalizing to myself that I ""don't want to talk to girls"".

8fxiq2,20,2018-04-30,How to compose an appropriate thank you note to professor?,Rickrollon,Professors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/8fxiq2/how_to_compose_an_appropriate_thank_you_note_to/,"I want to send a thank you email to professor for a great class I had this semester. I had a tough situation, needed accommodation and they helped me out. I waited until grades were in so it wouldn't seem insincere or that I saw him just as a point keeper. I've never written a thank you note to a professor so I don't know where to begin or what's appropriate really. 

Long story, I had the situation long before I got to this class, but I'd never spoken to a professor about it before this one. I had a tough time even admitting it. Had I known how understanding and kind professors could be, I would've had this conversation years ago with different professors. That this happened this class, with this professor… 
I don't know. I can't thank him enough for the patience, time, understanding, he extended me. 

The beginning of the semester was really awkward, but I found I really looked forward to coming to class each week, and I participated a ton toward the end compared to the beginning. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a class so much perhaps I'm struggling with crafting a thank you note because this is one of those class/teachers that impacts your life type of situation. To that end, at our accommodation chat I had to talk, he had to listen; maybe he felt obligated to accommodate my request. For me to even open up about my situation with them or anyone was really hard for me whether that came across or not… who knows; it meant a lot that someone just listened. Maybe I came across more confident than I than thought, it's hard to distance the emotions of that talk/the semester out of this thank you note. How do I keep those parts to myself but express gratitude at the same time?

I want my note to say more than a generic ""thanks for a great semester"" but at the same time I want to keep it professional and don't want to be sappy. As a student, it's hard to assess my own writing. I don't want to get personal or overshare, he doesn't do that. It was hard to engage him. Another student mentioned to me after class ended they felt like he wasn't interested in what we had to say, maybe he was a little shy but he did tell off a couple students. Sometimes he'd stare and then look away but I just thought it was cuz I'm ugly but another student noticed the same thing with them and noted he had a problem with eye contact. After this student brought this to attention I really don't know even the tone to go for in the thank you note. I've sent emails after semesters ended before about grades to professors and included something nice about the class; one genuinely thanked for the small note about the class, the other used the same line to be so freaking rude to me. I'm wading through trying to compose this. I don't want a huge over the top note because maybe he couldn't stand me and wait for the semester to be done. I'm worried that the note will come across weird. There is no way to tell how our words as students will be received.

As I mentioned, I don't want to get too personal and I don't want to editorialize. A few sentences would probably express thanks but I really just don't know how to be concise in this situation without expressing how I feel. I even thought to ask him if he knew of any internship opportunities but I don't know that would be okay to ask in the same email, it might look like I'm just writing thanks or brown nosing to ask about internships. What should I say in this email?

EDIT: Thanks for all the input so far!.. I will not ask about internships in it. I prefer not to rehash the whole accommodation thing/my inabilty if I could, but that really is the driving force behind the thank you note. A professor wouldn't bring up an accommodation they made after the fact, and I really don't want to either but I'm finding that knowing what to include or leaving out details difficult. I'm way to specific when I write. 

tl;dr: how do I appropriately write a thank you note to professor, I don't think they know how they/their course impacted me nor do I think they care, but how do I say thanks while keeping it professional."

You know that feeling. When you're playing an online game, and some 12 year old goes into chat and threatens to DDOS you because you're clearly better than him. Or he says he has a friend who will do it for him, but he's full of shit either way? This is where you go to laugh and post about these children.

Some of my favorite all-time posts in /r/masterhacker are [I got messaged by a master hacker](https://i.redd.it/2xeomld9crj01.png), [Creepy PM from a “reddit admin”](https://i.imgur.com/KkJDTeL.jpg), and [I have a VPN](https://i.redd.it/roelpssm4xi01.jpg). They follow the appeal of subreddits like /r/insanepeoplefacebook, /r/iamverybadass, or /r/quityourbullshit. But instead of crazy people, our subreddit follows the topic of people who say they're really good at hacking when in reality they know very little.

/r/Masterhacker is a satire oriented subreddit. A lot like /r/insanepeoplefacebook, we usually ridicule people for being full of bullshit and plainly ignorant. This subreddit was made for posting people who threaten to Hack your PC or claim that they are a part of Anonymous or Lizard Squad. But that's not the only posts we approve of in this subreddit. We also love seeing posts where people claim to know about hacking or have intimate computer knowledge, when in reality, they're begging to appear on /r/iamverybadass. We also like to use a lot of hacker slang, so you better read up on it before you get your c++ ip backroot firewall hacked.

I left my home when I was 17 and moved to a different country because family drama was becoming too much. I am now 24 and I have lived in four different countries, going back to one and then back to another looking for new adventures. For seven years I have been trying to find a place to call home, somewhere I would feel I belonged to, and a few months ago I found it. 

Leaving it was the hardest thing I have done in my entire life. 

I am now back to a country I used to love, but I am forcing myself to do two jobs, work out every day, and do courses online just to keep myself busy and avoid thinking about it. I don't want to think about how good it felt to be there because unless I get a visa, I cannot go back. Getting a visa for the US is impossible for those who don't have a computer engineering degree, which is something I don't have. I have a degree and a master's that won't get me anywhere close to getting that visa.

Months ago I applied for a bunch of job opportunities that dismissed my candidacy due to my visa status, so I decided to apply for internships that would at least sponsor student visas. All but one decided to give the internships to Americans, and today I finally got the news that I have not been chosen.

I feel crushed. I don't think I've felt like this in a long, long time. 

I am so tired of trying. I don't want to give up, but I feel like I have no strength left in me to keep doing this. I'm tired of writing cover letters and résumés every week knowing I won't get a reply \(or at least, a positive one\).

As soon as I got the bad news, I slurped down an iced coffee, wrote yet another cover letter and another résumé and sent it to some other organization. Deep inside I know I'm just going to keep fighting because that's what I do, but I'm afraid it's going to take so long the 'home' I had found won't be there when I get back. 

I left someone back there that I am in love with. Someone who said he would wait for me until I was back for this internship. Someone I can't tell I am not going back.

I just feel I can't keep going. But I will keep going until I don't."

So i live away from home studying abroad on scholarship. My dad is not strict type muslim but cares alot about what people think. So when i told him that i wont wear hijab(muslim headscarf) anymore he of-course flipped and told me he couldnt care less if i live on the street, to not ever talk to him and just now sent a message through my sister threatening that if he sees me without it he will end my life... 


I havent been wearing hijab for years except in front of my parents

It broke my heart because i was telling him (through my sister) that i love him no matter what and i didnt choose hijab over him because its my personal choice he choose love for power over me. 

My mom and I dont talk because she is a psychopath who told my sister she should’ve attempted suicide at my grandma’s house not hers. My 12 year old fucking sister. So yea she’s out of the pic.

My brothers are in college and still dont know i took it off but if they did they’d want to kill me too
Luckily i live abroad but my issue is guys, right now my only income is from scholarship allowance which i split on dorms and left with only 270 usd for food and necessities. Which i’ve accepted since i need to save to find a place after college until i get a job.

And thats the issue, im so fucking scared and worried about not landing a job when im out of uni
So far i have been rejected from two front office internship!!!!! Who gets rejected from that :/!!! 
But will still search for internships experiences.....


I just need some supportive words i dont know what to do with myself anymore 

I dont have friends i feel like a failure because of that 
Even though my gpa is 3.00 no one cares to hire you,  its all about who you know and i dont know much

Theres no point for this post really, i just wanted to talk to someone tell someone about this i feel like shit,  lost and as if life is kicking me while im already on the ground lol 

Maybe my depression is making this seem bigger than it is.  But please leave supportive words or any advices it will mean the world 

UPDATE 
I hope this post reaches those who are in my shoes right now and confused about what to do. if you are, make sure you are able to physically be away from your family for your safety do NOT trust being around them, at least I wouldn't. But if your family is understanding talk to them about it. if you are in school still try to go abroad on scholarship or find a job abroad if not. SAVE MONEY I cannot say that enough I have saved enough to ensure I won't be homeless at least! Save money and it will save YOU. 
do what you can to ensure you are financially dependent and stay safe. Crazy world here :/

FINALLY, thanks for everyone who had supportive things to say. I was feeling down when I wrote this but much better now and my mental game is stronger than ever. Got two call backs about internship positions in one day so that great too. Just stay strong and remain positive if you are in the same position!

8g0ctf,0,2018-04-30,MCIT vs Northeastern's Align MS in CS,wolf_lake,UPenn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/8g0ctf/mcit_vs_northeasterns_align_ms_in_cs/,"Hello,
I was fortunate enough to just get accepted to the MCIT program at Penn and have also been accepted to Northeastern’s ALIGN MS in Computer Science program. In short, I’m looking to ideally get opinions from folks who are at least somewhat familiar with NU’s program but would obviously also welcome perspectives from anyone familiar with the MCIT program itself.

Specific questions I’m thinking about:

1. Is the MCIT/Penn program strong in Machine Learning / AI (the area I’m looking to focus in)?

2. It seems that within computer science Penn and Northeastern are both quite strong names… is that a fair assumption? (Obviously granting, however, that overall Penn is a stronger brand-name). And does that variable even matter?

3. How is living in Philadelphia (relative to Boston)?

4. Total tuition for the degrees are similar but NU effectively takes 5 semesters versus MCIT’s 3 semesters. In essence, NU is less expensive on a per-semester basis… but I’d be done faster through MCIT (although ostensibly will also have learned less since less time spent in school?).

5. How well do MCIT students do in seeking internships / jobs after graduation? NU makes this professional-help a big part of their sales pitch (e.g. NU has a ""co-op""... essentially an extended internship).

6. This May I'm graduating from a top five/ten MBA program, so the proximity to Wharton is somewhat appealing but I'm not sure if I should really factor that into my decision... do MCIT and Wharton students interact much?

7. Anything else I should consider?

Thanks in advance!

8g0et3,0,2018-04-30,Am I crazy for turning down Californian schools for Waterloo CS?,1100H19,softwaredevelopment,https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/comments/8g0et3/am_i_crazy_for_turning_down_californian_schools/,"Two weeks ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8c5eqz/if_my_goal_is_to_end_up_in_california_should_i_go/), asking if it was worth going to a California school instead of Waterloo. I was recently accepted to Waterloo's CS co-op program so I immediately accepted my offer and decided that it's the best path for me. However, now I'm having second thoughts. Anyway, here's an updated version of my previous post.

**Situation:** My family is moving to California after I graduate high school. My dad recently started the green card process, and I might turn 21 before it's completed (and if I do turn 21, I will have to apply on my own). In order to be close to my family, I plan to work in California.

I have offers from both Canadian and American schools—while I first ignored these US schools due to their outrageous price, my wealthy aunt is offering to pay a portion of my education if I go south. No matter where I attend, the price will be comparable.

**Offers:** I have an offer for Computer Science co-op at Waterloo. In the US, I have offers from UCLA Math of Computation, UCSD Data Science, and Cal Poly Software Engineering.

**My thoughts on US:** US schools definitely have the edge in terms of recruiting and networking. Most students who I would go to school with will likely end up in California. The weather and school environment will be nice too (though that would be secondary). 

On the other hand, despite how F1 Visa students have work authorization, employers still discriminate in hiring them (""why should I hire this kid who's gonna stay here for 4-5 years when I can just hire a citizen?""). In addition, having someone pay for a part of education can be risky. If my aunt, undergoes financial trouble or just doesn't want to fund me anymore, it's over for me.

Then, the majors I was accepted at UCLA and UCSD to might pose a problem. UCLA Math of Computation means a lot more math classes than CS classes. UCSD Data Science is really new and narrows my skillset to data science/machine learning (which often includes a master's which, at that point, I likely cannot afford).

**My thoughts on Waterloo:**  From what I've heard, Silicon Valley recruiters love Waterloo so going to the US and spending all that money isn't worth it. I'll have two years of work experience because of co-op and since I'm a Canadian citizen, I'll have access to various loans, scholarships, and internships that I would not have if I were to go to the US. 

One thing is though, I really have no evidence that Waterloo is a good CS school other than from a few news articles and anecdotal evidence from Reddit. Even on rankings, it's pretty low (I know it has to do with research but research seems to be correlated with school quality like how Berkeley, CMU, MIT, and Stanford are all ranked high). 

**Final Thoughts:** I know I'll always wonder *what if* no matter where I go, but I don't want to think back about how dumb I was in high school to have chosen **X school** when I had an offer from **Y school**. Any insights, opinions, facts, or anything about my choice? Am I crazy for turning down some California schools for Waterloo CS?"

I was fortunate enough to get accepted to NU's ALIGN MS in CS program and have also now been accepted to UPenn's MCIT program (both are CS masters programs aimed at students with no/little prior computer science experience). In short, I’m looking to ideally get opinions from folks who are at least somewhat familiar with UPenn’s program but would obviously also welcome perspectives from anyone just familiar with the ALIGN program itself.

Specific questions I’m thinking about:

1. Is NU's computer science program strong in Machine Learning / AI (the area I’m looking to focus in)?

2. It seems that within computer science Penn and Northeastern are both quite strong names… is that a fair assumption? And does that variable even matter?

5. How well do ALIGN students do in seeking internships / jobs after graduation? I know NU highlights their career services and the co-op programs... it seems that UPenn/MCIT does not have a similar offering.

6. This May I'm graduating from a top five/ten MBA program, so the proximity to a prominent business school is something I'm thinking about a little but I know NU also has an MBA program and I'm not sure if I would have a lot of time to interact with the business school anyway (since I've already done that for the past two years...).

7. Anything else I should consider?

Thanks in advance!

8g0opq,1,2018-04-30,Coming to Malta in 3 weeks and still no place to stay,Lory007,malta,https://www.reddit.com/r/malta/comments/8g0opq/coming_to_malta_in_3_weeks_and_still_no_place_to/,"Should I be worried ? (I am) 

I posted here to have some tips a few weeks before, and I had great advices and followed them but still no luck. 

 I'm going to malta for an internship in Zabbar from the end of May to the beginning of August but it seems impossible to find an apartment or a room to rent for 2 months in this area.. 

I made myself a facebook account so I could look at the facebook groups, and I restricted my research area to the south east. But most of the appartments on facebook are from agencies, and well it's only for long let (6 months and above) and the few others that are not posted by agents are all in swieqi, valetta etc. Agents don't seem to be interested in short lets..

I looked on airbnb too, but it seems impossible to rent one for 2months because they all have some reservations already.

What should I do now ? I'm starting to regret my choice of malta.. Tbh I didn't think it would be so hard to find an apartment. This is not holiday this is an internship so if I have to cancel this is really bad for me.. But I don't know where to look anymore

Anyway if anyone can help that would be great because this is really getting me nervous

**Context**

I've known my ex boyfriend for about 3 and a half years; we saw/ dated each other for 2 and a half of those and have been broken up for a year. The relationship was long distance, but last year I lived in the same city as him (NYC) for a few months for an internship. During that time, I found out that his close friends and mom didn't approve of me (I'm a shy person so I didn't really hit it off with them the few times we met) which made me really insecure and doubt whether I actually was the right match for him. It honestly also made me not the best girlfriend to him in the last few months of the relationship because I was hurt by this issue that neither of us could fix. We decided to break up once my internship was over because we couldn't fix this and other issues during the time I was living there and the long distance aspect would've made it even harder. However, we both knew that I would be moving back to NYC for good a year later (which is next week at this point).   
  
Because of this we had an unusual ex BF/ GF relationship. We've dated other people casually in the past year since we aren't together, but he has always told me that he's not looking for anything real with anyone else because he wants to be with me again one day. So I didn't either; I've dated guys casually but I haven't let it go past that because I've been hoping that we would work on our relationship again when I moved back. We've also seen each other a few times since the break up, and it has always been amazing and like we were together again. I've also had time in the past year to reflect on our relationship and think about how we could go about fixing our issues. We talked about it a lot and it seemed we were both excited give it a second shot.  
  
**Current situation**

So fast forwarding a little, in the past 2 months we stopped talking completely. The last conversation we had in February was a little sad and emotional, but I didn't think anything fundamentally changed about what we wanted. Anyway, I decided to message him last week since I would be moving back to NYC next week, so I wanted to see if he wanted to meet. Basically he said he thought after that last conversation that I wasn't interested in him anymore so he stopped trying (hence the 2 month gap). I asked him if he had changed his mind about wanting to be with me and he said he still loved me but he had been trying to force himself to get over me over the past 2 months so he felt really confused. He's also started to date someone else and he doesn't want to hurt her.  
  
But I'm also really hurt. I just don't understand why this new girl is a factor in his decision of whether he wants to work on our relationship again. I have also been seeing a guy since December that I liked but I was always very honest with the guy about not wanting to take it too far and it only being a short term thing. So the fact that my ex is seeing someone else isn't what bothers me, but if he actually sees a future with this girl that he's dating then that's too much for me.  
  
My ex and I talked on the phone last night. It lasted for hours and only made me miss him more. He told me that he misses me and wants to see me when I'm back next week. But he told me he's still feeling unsure about things and is not going to stop seeing this other girl yet. This really really hurt me. Like I said, I don't care about him seeing other girls since we're not together, but being emotionally invested in someone else is different. I think it's unfair for him to want to see me while still seeing another girl that's affecting his decision of whether or not he should be with me. He already knows me, inside and out. He doesn't need a first date to test the waters. And I guess it hurts that he is willing to put another girl that he isn't even officially dating yet and has only known for a few months over mending our relationship.    
  
So I guess I'm looking for advice on where I should go from here. I strongly feel that if my ex still loves me as much as I do him then he wouldn't be able to see himself with someone else and the choice should be easy. But he feels like I'm being unfair in giving him an ultimatum. Should I see him and try to mend things while he's still seeing this other girl? Should I see him one last time for closure? Should I just move on?  
  
  
**TL;DR: Ex boyfriend and I broke up but had the assumption that we would work on things when long distance was over. Now I am moving back to where he lives and things seemed to have changed recently and he's unsure whether we should try again because of the issues we had and because he's dating someone else.**

One of them says not selected. I also applied to the targeted inventory of Student Financial Analyst through FSWEP, but it has not been sent to any manager at all. 

 I was wondering, are managers still hiring for summer roles in 2018, and if so when would I start working seeing as its already Week 1 of summer. I saw something about a National Student Orientation Event for FSWEP students on May 31 in Ottawa. Or, is it too late to count on FSWEP now and should I look elsewhere for summer employment? 

I feel like I have what the government is looking for in a student. I've had non profit volunteer experience and have worked for the government in the past, most recently as an MP's Summer Intern in 2016 on Parliament Hill.

Have done other accounting related internships and been in several clubs and had a leadership position. I’ve begun studying for the cpa and will sit soon.  I’m guessing at this point I need to focus on mastering my interview skills. Do I have a good chance going into full time employment? I’m worried lots of spots will be taken by former interns.

I never had to work in my 22 years long life, ever. I'm studying computer science, which is also my father's profession, and as soon as I graduate at the end of this term my position in his company is ready. I never even bothered with internships. My only experience is some small projects I did for fun in my dad's company. I'm not saying I sit around doing nothing, I actually love my major a lot and am currently working on a research of one of my professors.

I'm about to graduate and when I thought about it I realized, this is fucked up. I don't want this. I want to gain some real world experience and independence, or I will never grow as a person. I decided to have a year off for this after graduation, and then apply for a masters degree and continue for an academic career. I want to keep my parents as only a temporary back up for when I fail hard. But I just don't know how or where to start and I'm embarrassed about it because people my age are living on their own money already. So what do I do?"
8g441t,3,2018-04-30,I [22F] can't bring myself to put myself out there because I'm too afraid of my ex [20F] who seems to be doing very well meeting new girls,lonerg0,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8g441t/i_22f_cant_bring_myself_to_put_myself_out_there/,"My ex is really social and has been spending all her time meeting other queer women. She used me to get confidence and experience and it's hard to face her success when, dating and queer networking wise, i'm in the exact same place I was when we broke up.

When we were still talking she was so active socially trying to meet girls, going to tons of gay parties, clubbing etc. If I ever look at her fb she's added a new LGBT girl every week. She's really sexy and cool, I'm really nerdy and ugly. I don't like partying, she does, giving her a huge advantage to meeting people. It's a small world. She probably knows all the queer girls in our city. 

I just can't stomach finally showing up to, say, something more tame lesbian event like a board games night, and she's there. I block this shit out, I kept myself busy, I worked on professional development, personal development, friendships, meeting new people, getting and internship blah blah blah but nothing that makes me more attractive, I keep losing weight, my hair's thinning out, my body is more achey, she's got 2 years of youth on me that I don't have. She's confident and gorgeous and was happy to point out my flaws when we were dating. I can't compete with her. I just keep working on a career and my hobbies hoping I will stop caring about dating but I still want to do it. 

It's not even that I'm not over her, I don't want to be with her, I just don't want to see how successful she is in queer circles which are already so small. I don't want to find out she's fucked every girl in town, I don't want to be near her. I don't want to give up my entire life here but I want to be able to have a chance at freedom, maybe I should move.

I don't know what to do, everyone says not to date until I no longer care or am afraid of her but it has been months, beginning to approach a year since we broke up. I've had a breakup before but my first gf wasn't that social and even though we didn't end on great terms she still treated me decently and did not leave me feeling like my future was so bleak. I feel like this girl has infiltrated the whole queer community and I don't know what to do. I miss the days before I knew her and meeting people was exciting.

**tl;dr** ex is way more social and attractive than me and knows all the lgbt people in my town, too scared to try to meet knew people cause the pool is small and she probably knows them
