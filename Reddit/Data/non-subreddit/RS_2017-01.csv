(25m) changed with (28f) and super scared.,Anatidaephobiaaa,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5ldgz3/help_so_hard_25m_changed_with_28f_and_super_scared/,"First time posting. Met a guy (25m) that was amazing when I(28f)absolutely was not looking for a relationship. He wanted my four year old, fatherless, son to accompany us on one of our first dates. I tend to listen to everything and glean a lot from what people say. Over time, he showed me that he was a person that genuinely cared about others and had a big heart. I fell head over heels for him, and so did my son. Fast forward five months later. He owns a string of businesses where we live, and one of them got broken into. Two weeks later, it happened again. Two weeks later, it happened again. As this all was happening, he started to withdraw, from me, specifically. He had a tattoo internship that he'd been excited about, and he got over that as well. For a while, he also wanted to kick out his roommate, a close friend. Just because he was ""over it."" I know he has bad anxiety (and doesn't want to see a dr about it). He had a fucked up childhood (poor and beaten by his mom, moved around a lot), and later on he was cheated on or used by every girl he dated. Now, I'm no angel. I can be argumentative, and I can be annoying. I don't like making decisions about where to eat (though I tried to fix that), and I love just being together. I don't care if he's doing something else, I just like having him around (which he later said felt like pressure to focus on me). He had originally showed my picture to friends and they'd said something along the lines of, ""how the hell did you pull that off?"" He, himself, said I was miles out of his league. When he was sick, I went way out of my way to take care of him. Meds, homemade chicken noodle soup, tea with honey, you name it. He wanted to do a juice fast (I knew they were bullshit), guess who suffered with him (even though I work out a minimum of five hours daily and he didn't)? His goal was to lose a certain amount of weight and keep it off for a year, but he didn't know how to cook or take care of himself. Guess who went grocery shopping and meal prepped at all hours of the night for him AND HIS ROOMMATE so he could meet his goals? I wake up around 330 am everyday because I have swim practice. I can't count the number of nights I stayed up until 130 with him, making food for him, or just talking to him because he couldn't sleep. It all seemed like after the break-ins, he was crazy stressed. About a week before Christmas, he invited me over to help him plan out things (which I love to do), and stay the night. That night, he looked at me and said, ""I don't think I can do this."" 
Me: ""uh... do what?""
Him: ""be in a relationship. Dating.""

He told me that he's better off being single, that he loves me, and that he doesn't want to date anybody else. He's repeatedly told me that I am, hands down, the best person he's ever been with, but he needs to focus on him. 

So here's my problem. We really don't talk much. He knows a dr in an urgent care found a mass in my abdomen less than a week after he dumped me, just before Christmas. He said if I needed to vent to anyone, he was there. But he doesn't talk to me. Part of me wants to wait for him to figure his shit out and realize what a dumbass he's being. Another part of me is terrified that he's not really the kind, caring person I was sure he was. Most of all, I'm heartbroken. I need surgery to remove what turned out to be a malignant stromal tumor in my small intestine, and I wish he was there to hold my hand while I freak out over the results of my lymph node biopsies, which I won't get back until after surgery. I'm healthy, I'm fit. I'm not someone that develops problems. Yet here I am, wishing the guy that I thought cared could just stop focusing on himself long enough to be there for me.
Do I keep waiting for him, with the faith that he'll eventually regain his sanity? Or do I just stop? "

I'm going to be reading up on everything, and I don't know all the terminology that I've read so far, but I was looking for advice on what I should anticipate for when I graduate and start earning a substantial paycheck. 

With school, I don't make much. I save what I do make, and I have saved from internships. 

I'll be in engineering, and was wondering if there are any other engineers who have any advice from what they have seen. My salary should be in the upper half of the 25% bracket, from what I have seen. I'm not sure what that will adjust to after taxes. I'll be able to start a 401k with matching at the company I'll be with. Is there anything else I should be looking into for when I start working? Or any general advice?"

5ley62,69,2017-01-01,The Best of /r/Smite 2016!,DrYoshiyahu,Smite,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/5ley62/the_best_of_rsmite_2016/,"Happy New Year, /r/Smite! Welcome to 2017! I'm sure you all remember [the contest](https://redd.it/5j0v6c) we've been having over the last two weeks; here are the winners!

***

**First off are the game categories:**

##Best Patch

**[3.12 - Ullustrious Sage](https://redd.it/4qhgu5)** was the winning patch. It was the start of the 2016 Summer of Smite, and introduced Erlang Shen, as well as the new Thorns and Phantom relics. It was also infamous for removing Golden Bow and Throwing Dagger from the game. As controversial as it was, people thought the removal of those items outweighed the negativity that Erlang Shen received, and voted it the Best Patch of 2016.

##Best New God

**[Amaterasu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIUhRqUzES0)** won this category by quite the margin. She was the first god added in 2016, and heralded the release of the Japanese pantheon, as one of Japan's most iconic deities. She set a new standard for accuracy to lore and respect to culture, and is still beloved almost an entire year later. She was followed by Skadi and Jing Wei by votes in second and third, respectively, to round out a trifecta of female characters voted as the top three Best New Gods of 2016.

##Best Event

This year's **[Season Ticket](https://redd.it/49qm79)** was added all the way back in March, and has been handing out rewards to thousands of players months later. At first there was some controversy, with a new chest added, featuring recolours of the most popular T3 and T4 skins; but with patience, we were able to see the full potential of a year-long event. As /u/dadnaya put it: ""450 gems for a bunch of skins + announcer packs + music theme + avatar + wards + enig chests"" It was such a popular topic of conversation, even /u/SmiteRobot got involved in the discussion. It was hands down, the Best Event of 2016.

##Best New Skin

There were so many great skins added to Smite in 2016, but nothing stood out quite like **[Gemini Agni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJC_cFcvtyA)**, which was so popular, it sparked a discussion in the nomination thread about whether or not it's pointless to ask people's opinions when you get the same response every time. The submission thread probably wasn't even necessary, based on the multitude of very popular posts about the skin, including [Gemini agni the best skin in the game atm.](https://redd.it/572ri4), [Why does Agni have some of the best skins in the game?](https://redd.it/584dqf), and [Gemini Agni sets an entirely new standard](https://redd.it/57eems). It wasn't exactly surprising to see /r/Smite vote Gemini Agni the Best New Skin of 2016.

***

**Now for the subreddit categories:**

##Best Discussion Post

**[What book do you like to read during Xing Tian's ult windup](https://redd.it/4l0xb4)** was a joke /u/PufTheRedditor made in regards to Xing Tian's ultimate being nerfed in the windup department. It was an immensely popular post, and got hundreds of very humourous responses, including a gilded response that earned an honorable mention in this competition. You voted, and you named it the Best Discussion Post of 2016.

##Best Suggestion Post

In August, /u/UpstreamPwnage suggested a **[DJ Khaled Announcer Pack](https://redd.it/4vo97d)**, detailing all the important phrases the DJ could record. It got thousands of upvotes, and responses from /u/HiRezAdanas, /u/PonPonWeiWei, and /u/ScottGandhii. Eventually, it led to Scott directly [tweeting @djkhaled](https://twitter.com/ScottGandhi/status/760274072672563200), but that's unfortunately the last we heard of it. Obviously, it was voted the Best Suggestion Post of 2016.

##Best Media Post

/u/Bowmance nominated **[this video](https://redd.it/47se79)** of his, titled ""Got drunk, clan member wouldn't answer my skype so I sent him this:"". You'll have to watch it yourself, but let's just say it includes a fantastic vocal performance fueled by alcohol, with Smite-related lyrics, so congratulations /u/Bowmance for the Best Media Post of 2016.

##Best Art Post

/u/RobDraws' **[Sylvanus El Bandito Skin Concept](https://redd.it/42rm1w)** was the winner of this category by a mile. His post is still the highest-voted post of all time on /r/Smite, and was just recently turned into a real skin. /u/RobDraws has been a very popular skin concept artist on this subreddit for a while now, and of course, we congratulate him for the top post of all time, the honour of having a concept made into a skin, and of course, the Best Art Post of 2016.

##Best Strategy Post

**[The Overarching Conquest Guide](https://redd.it/4gv1o1)**, submitted by /u/branmuffin17, was exactly what it sounds like. The /r/Smite post linked to an extremely detailed guide for Conquest that covered everything from the basics to advanced strategies, for all five roles, including builds, tier lists, and even VGS information. The article has seen numerous revisions, and was kept up to date for the entire year, so no wonder it was /r/Smite's Best of 2016.

***

###Honorable mentions

* Based on [the response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/5j0v6c/official_best_of_rsmite_2016_competition/dbcf350) that Erlang Shen got, I'd say he's by far the worst god added in 2016.
* /u/Schileru was an intern at Hi-Rez this year, and he brought the subreddit a lot of joy this year with three very popular posts, titled [Guys I'm learning so much working at Hirez!](https://redd.it/4q5vph), [Battleground Of The Gods](https://redd.it/4qxkhu) and [Awh Hercules](https://redd.it/4z0tbe), with a similar style and theme. The most recent post was a very close second-place nomination for Best Media Post of 2016.
* Unfortunately, /u/dadnaya's nomination for ""Best Strategy Post"" which simply read ""Envy strat"" was invalid, but still got more votes than some of the legitimate nominations. I think [we all know what he was referring to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO2ah9HYoZM).
* It was suggested that next year we add a ""Best Comment"" category. In the meantime, I think it's worthwhile to point out [this fantastic response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/4l0xb4/what_book_do_you_like_to_read_during_xing_tians/d3jeje9) to the Best Discussion Post of 2016."

5lezvy,2,2017-01-01,26M4A - Milking a Starlet,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5lezvy/26m4a_milking_a_starlet/,"Good morning, DPP! For my prompt the title really says it all, doesn't it? I want to play out a scenario based around a celebrity lactating and me being the one to take her by the teats and milk her. But the thing is that this isn't normal lactation...something is causing our starlet to express an abnormally large amount of milk. Her breasts fill up every 4 to 6 hours with more than a machine can handle. And her breasts have become far too sensitive for her to milk on her own without collapsing into a sweaty, orgasmic pile. She'll need someone with her at all times to help her relieve herself of her milk - and that someone will be me.

The lactation can be brought on in a number of ways. Maybe it's a latent genetic condition triggered by GMO crops. Maybe its a new and incurable disease. Maybe its the permanent result of a special chemical concoction. Or maybe its even magic or a curse placed on a celebrity's favorite feature. That's one thing I would like to work out before the roleplay starts.

As for the kind of scenario this will be, I'm open to both a consensual and rather non-consensual path. On the consensual side, I see the celebrity coming down with this condition spontaneously and myself as her best friend or manager or intern even being the only ones around when it strikes to help her. From there the role play would focus on our starlet coping with this new part of her life. Does she try to hide it and keep me with her at all times to milk her when needed? Does she get exposed or come out with it to begin with and needs to turn to me as someone who doesn't think she's a freak? Will her career end and she'll need to find new work involving her udders? Or will she stay defiant and turn them into a public fascination? That's up to us.

On the other side, perhaps I'm a rueful intern or manager, an obsessed fan, a hateful rival, or a scientist or businessman who sees a potential for profit with no concern for your feelings. Similar to above, perhaps I dose you or curse you into lactating and threaten to expose you if you don't become my slut. Maybe you are exposed and I use your despair to coerce you into becoming a hucow at a ranch and living your life as an animal. Maybe you're kidnapped or otherwise coerced into being milked for profit. The choice is ours.

Alright, now technical details. First, **I am open to both men and women so long as they play a female celebrity**. Second, I tend to write a paragraph per response. I try to reply once a day but cant always, so this will have to be long term. And if you need inspiration, some of my favorite celebrities are...

Elizabeth Gillies, Daniella Monet, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lawrence, Cara Delevigne, Jenette McCurdy, Victoria Justice, Ariana Grande, Amy Lee, and Kate Upton. I'm also open to other suggestions.

Kinks: Lactation, mild breast growth, nudity and ENF, humiliation OR shame (feeling humiliated absent being made to), name calling OR romance and tenderness, blackmail OR cuddling, anything vanilla.

Limits: Non-human or extreme changes, blood, toilet, vomit, beast, incest, under 18, extreme violence, snuff."

**128,162** subreddit explorers *exploring* for **5 years!**

Happy New Year's day, everyone. There are some big changes at how Subreddit of the Day works. So this felt like a really good time for us to feature ourselves as Subreddit of the Day so we can go over those changes with you. I know what you're thinking. We could've just made an announcement as a sticky post. And I probably will sticky this post for a while. But we don't want to take away any attention from the sub that we'll be featuring on any particular day by making a second post. That never goes well and it's really not fair for the featured sub. 

#New CSS

Everyone's been complaining about the CSS on this sub since we released this version. We now have brand new CSS that is a lot more easy on the eyes. It's still a work in progress, but we hope that you see it as an immediate improvement. I would like to invite you all to turn your CSS back on and see for yourself. You can give your feedback in the comments. Please let us know what you think. Also, special thanks to /u/hatefullyemployed for designing it and also to /u/kate_4_president for lending a hand. 

#Changes to how features are written 

Here's the old way that  Subreddit of the Day (hereinafter referred to as SROTD) works. Our writing staff find a sub that they like, interview that sub, write an article about it, and then post it. This is a very time consuming process. It often takes days or weeks. It's a lot of effort for very little payout. We know from our last survey that few people read wordy features. We had to be honest with ourselves too. It turned out that we don't even usually read them. What most people do is read the headline and then click the link, and then maybe they'll read the rest of the feature. 

Anyways, although SROTD has never missed a day, we've come very close to missing days in the past where there was no post ready and everyone's scrambling to find a sub, interview them, and get the post up. 

We've streamlined the feature process to do basically this: Summarize the sub, say what's good about it, and show what's good about it. Some still have mod interviews. We know you all like those. But some don't really need it. We've done away with character limits. Posts will be as long as they need to be in order to capture the essence of the featured sub. 

#Special Guest Writer Program

This is the change at SROTD that I am most proud of. It really is. It's another that we've been doing for months but have made no official announcement. 

It used to be that only mods and staff wrote the features. We allowed nominations, but those were often ignored if no one here was familiar enough with the topic of the sub, or if no one here even liked it. 

The special guest program lets the person who nominated the sub write the feature. Usually these are the mods of the sub, but sometimes they are also fans of the sub. So far two of my favorites to come from this program are the [TOTALLYNOTROBOTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/3me941/september_25_2015_rtotallynotrobots_a_place_for/?ref=search_posts ) and [EnoughTrumpSpam](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4o7fxj/june_15th_2016_renoughtrumpspam_i_dont_think_we/?ref=search_posts) features. Both are fantastic, and are better brought to life by people who actually are members or mods of those communities. 

This program has been so successful that in December 16 of the 31 features that we did were special guest features. You may have noticed that the byline on of the posts said ""written by special guest writer."" This month's calendar is already filling up with guest features as well. 

Part of this was a response to mods complaining that they made nominations which were ignored. They weren't wrong. So we're giving everyone a chance to tell us about their own community (or their favorite community) in their own words. 

Same restrictions apply as always. The community must be about a month old, have at least a few hundred subscribers, and must have an active user base. That's it. There's also our sister sub, /r/TinySubredditOfTheDay, for the really small ones. So, check that out. 

#SROTD Archives 

Some of you may have noticed that we've been running archive features. Over the years several people have joined the intern program and left us with interviews and incomplete write ups of a number of subs. We're finishing, updating, and editing these to get them ready to go. It's unfair that some mods have been waiting for years for their features to get done. This is part of our effort to turn that around. 

#Mission Statement 

We've changed our mission statement. It used to be ""bringing the awesome."" The problem was that not all subs are awesome to everyone. Some are in particular disliked by a number of people. So it had to change. Our mission is now to explore unique reddit communities, to spotlight them, to discuss them. Reddit, to me, is the most awesome collection of communities on the planet with a great diversity of viewpoints. So ya, when we feature GunsAreCool or TheRedPill some people will find those to be awesome and might be upset that we're talking about them at all. But they are a part of reddit culture, and are fair game. 



#Nominating a Sub

Turn on the CSS for this sub. You'll see a big, beautiful ""nominate"" button. This will give you a ""form"" to fill out. The more complete it is the faster it will get posted. We have a new commitment to customer service. While you'll get an automated response, just reply to it and a real human will help you. If you're a mod of the sub the feature will get scheduled very quickly. If you're not a mod, then SROTD staff will need to obtain permission from the mod team before moving forward. 

#Write SROTD

Check the link in the sidebar to join the intern program. That's the path to becoming a permanent writer and eventually a mod here. You will be expected to meet some quotas. Or, you can use the aforementioned nominate button if there's only one sub you'd like to write about.

But some don't really need it. We've done away with character limits. Posts will be as long as they need to be in order to capture the essence of the featured sub. 

#Special Guest Writer Program

This is the change at SROTD that I am most proud of. It really is. It's another that we've been doing for months but have made no official announcement. 

It used to be that only mods and staff wrote the features. We allowed nominations, but those were often ignored if no one here was familiar enough with the topic of the sub, or if no one here even liked it. 

The special guest program lets the person who nominated the sub write the feature. Usually these are the mods of the sub, but sometimes they are also fans of the sub. So far two of my favorites to come from this program are the [TOTALLYNOTROBOTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/3me941/september_25_2015_rtotallynotrobots_a_place_for/?ref=search_posts ) and [EnoughTrumpSpam](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4o7fxj/june_15th_2016_renoughtrumpspam_i_dont_think_we/?ref=search_posts) features. Both are fantastic, and are better brought to life by people who actually are members or mods of those communities. 

This program has been so successful that in December 16 of the 31 features that we did were special guest features. You may have noticed that the byline on of the posts said ""written by special guest writer."" This month's calendar is already filling up with guest features as well. 

Part of this was a response to mods complaining that they made nominations which were ignored. They weren't wrong. So we're giving everyone a chance to tell us about their own community (or their favorite community) in their own words. 

Same restrictions apply as always. The community must be about a month old, have at least a few hundred subscribers, and must have an active user base. That's it. There's also our sister sub, /r/TinySubredditOfTheDay, for the really small ones. So, check that out. 

#SROTD Archives 

Some of you may have noticed that we've been running archive features. Over the years several people have joined the intern program and left us with interviews and incomplete write ups of a number of subs. We're finishing, updating, and editing these to get them ready to go. It's unfair that some mods have been waiting for years for their features to get done. This is part of our effort to turn that around. 

#Mission Statement 

We've changed our mission statement. It used to be ""bringing the awesome."" The problem was that not all subs are awesome to everyone. Some are in particular disliked by a number of people. So it had to change. Our mission is now to explore unique reddit communities, to spotlight them, to discuss them. Reddit, to me, is the most awesome collection of communities on the planet with a great diversity of viewpoints. So ya, when we feature GunsAreCool or TheRedPill some people will find those to be awesome and might be upset that we're talking about them at all. But they are a part of reddit culture, and are fair game. 



#Nominating a Sub

Turn on the CSS for this sub. You'll see a big, beautiful ""nominate"" button. This will give you a ""form"" to fill out. The more complete it is the faster it will get posted. We have a new commitment to customer service. While you'll get an automated response, just reply to it and a real human will help you. If you're a mod of the sub the feature will get scheduled very quickly. If you're not a mod, then SROTD staff will need to obtain permission from the mod team before moving forward. 

#Write SROTD

Check the link in the sidebar to join the intern program. That's the path to becoming a permanent writer and eventually a mod here. You will be expected to meet some quotas. Or, you can use the aforementioned nominate button if there's only one sub you'd like to write about.

5lf3qg,39,2017-01-01,Creepy middle-aged married man won't leave me alone...,Gullefis,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/5lf3qg/creepy_middleaged_married_man_wont_leave_me_alone/,"Hello people of Reddit. First things first, Happy New Year!


This is my first post but I’ve been told by a few people that you’re all pretty awesome, so maybe you can give me some advice… 


I’m a 32-year-old woman. I’ve always worked hard and even climbed the ladder at a previous job of mine to become assistant manager despite never having completed my university degree. I never had the self-confidence to finish my degree (I am terrified of failure, so I have often just given up as I’ve always found quitting easier…) but not having a degree has always bothered me. I think deep down, I’ve always known I am capable and just need to believe in myself.


Anyway, a year and a half ago, my 7-year relationship came to an end and with my dad being terminally ill, I moved home to help my mother take care of him. My parents have always encouraged me to get an education and a year ago, after many months of research, I found an adult education course that would give me the equivalent of a two-year degree in just under one school year. I was amazingly lucky because not only is it a local course and I received a grant to pay for it but it’s really interesting and there are lots of jobs in that domain around where I live so I should find work after!


When I discovered this course, I had to wait a year and then pass 2 separate exams and an interview to even get picked (there were only 8 places). Needless to say, that when I started in November 2016, I very much deserved to be there.


With it being an adult education course, we are a very eclectic group of people from all different walks of life: 3 women in their early twenties, me in my early thirties and a woman and 3 men in their forties.


I’m a very bubbly character. I smile a lot and am genuinely interested in the people I meet. And I was no different to the people on my course. 


There is this man on our course called Stan. I obviously didn’t realize he was a creep at first and therefor treated him no differently to the others. I was smiley, polite and was interested in what he had to say. 


He claims to be 46. He looks a lot older. He is your stereotypical middle-aged man. He is bald on the top of his head, wears glasses, has a paunch belly, is shorter than me (I’m 5’9 or 1m75) and wears crisp-pin-striped shirts under woolly jumpers or turtle-neck woolly jumpers with corduroy trousers. I feel bad saying this, because physical attributes aren’t all that is important, but the man is not attractive. He has been married for ten years and together, they have 2 children. Physical attributes aside he is very serious and reserved. When he does speak is voice is quite softly spoken and hesitant. But there have been a few moments already where I’ve noticed that Stan has a short fuse and is quite intolerant of certain things. He’s not a funny guy and he’s not charismatic at all… 


I am single. And to be fair, I am very happy about it for now. I’ve had opportunities to date people since the end of my previous relationship but I feel I need this time to focus on me so I don’t want to be in a relationship right now. 


Anyway, here’s what happened: 3 weeks after the start of our course, I went home one Friday night looking forward to the weekend ahead of me. At around 8:30 pm I got an email from him. It read “Please do me a favour, from Monday please don’t ever speak to me again. I promise to avoid you as much as you avoid me”. I was extremely confused as we’d always been friendly to each other. I thought that he was angry with me or offended by me for some reason. I emailed him back to ask what I’d done and even called his mobile to try and talk to him. It went to voicemail and I left a message. I was really upset because I didn’t want anything to spoil the course and I certainly didn’t want any kind of conflict. And certainly not with Stan who, up until that point, I had thought was a nice man. The thing was, I KNEW I hadn’t said or done anything. Not even behind his back (I’m not like that). So, it was very strange to send me such an email. I mean even if I had offended him, we’re adults, surely it’s just easier to ignore someone you no longer like and it’s very juvenile to send a “I’m not your friend” type of email…


Anyway, I went to bed and slept in very late the next day. When I woke up I had two emails from him. The first one was a forwarded email with homework a colleague had sent to all of us but who had misspelled my email address so I didn’t get it. Stan had noticed the mistake and forwarded it to me. Again, if he were mad at me to the point of asking me to leave him alone, would he bother doing that? The second one was in reply to my email saying he didn’t mean to spoil my weekend. He didn’t want to tell me why but if I really wanted to know he would tell me but in private and not in an email. At this point I understood what he was playing at and couldn’t believe the immaturity and manipulative nature of his behaviour. I replied saying that nothing could justify him sending such an email to me and therefor I didn’t care what he had to say to me on Monday and that I too felt that we should stop talking to each other.


On Monday I ignored him completely. But he was deliberately trying to make conversation with me to try and extend an olive branch of some sort. He had gone out and bought a book for me (which I looked at and gave straight back), asked me how my dad was… I wasn’t keen on making a scene so I answered a strict minimum but I was very cold.


That night he sent me another email apologising for what he did and asking me if he could explain to me why he did what he did. I replied saying that I appreciated his apology but that there was no need to explain and that I’d rather just put it behind us. You see I had understood his reasons, but I was not interested in him at all and felt that if he just dropped it, it would be less awkward. I wouldn’t have to outright reject him, which is never easy to do…


The next day I was feeling very sick. He came up to me during the break and asked if we could talk. I again said that I really appreciated the apology but that I didn’t want to go over the details and that we should just not worry about it. I could see he was desperate to tell me but I just ignored it. I mean sheesh, we met 3 weeks ago, and he’s bloody married with two kids! What’s his deal?


Anyway, by lunchtime I was in a bad state and had to go to the doctor who sent me home for the rest of the week. For the entire time I had off, I felt physically nauseous from the moment I woke up until I went to sleep. It was a nightmare!


And when he found out I was sick, it was nonstop emails: “I’m really going to miss you” “I will take all the homework for you” “please tell me you’re ok, I need to know”… Needless to say that I didn’t want to reply to him: First of all I was too sick to be replying to all these emails and secondly, I simply didn’t want to encourage him. Sometimes I had to reply, like when he sent me things I’d missed in class. It would have been rude not to. But I still kept the messages short. Then the class went on this field trip to visit a company I had at one point thought about doing an internship for (we have to do a 2-month internship in March). He went up to the boss (I did not ask him to do this) and spoke to them about me for an internship. Apparently, they were interested. The problem is he also spoke to them about himself despite NEVER having been interested in that company before! This company isn’t too far from where he lives with his wife and he obviously had visions of spending two months alone with me and being able to stay late in the evenings because it wasn’t a long journey home… The man is delusional! There’s no way on earth I will do my internship with him so now I can’t go to that company anymore… :(


While I was off sick (5 and a half days) I was receiving roughly 2 emails from him a day. I only replied to a couple of them. So, eventually, on the Saturday (a mere 4 weeks after starting the course) and after me not replying to his last couple of emails, he sent me an email explaining his behaviour. How he has developed feelings for me and (wait for it) how he has fallen in love with me! He didn’t want me to think he was weird or unstable. And when he avoided eye contact, he wasn’t trying to be arrogant, he was just trying to protect himself from his feelings. There was no mention of his wife or children. They obviously weren’t a huge factor in his decision making. He felt he needed to tell me. I “deserved to understand the behaviour of the people around me”.


I was mad! It made me really angry! Not only is this man married with two kids and his blatant disregard for them is nothing short of shocking! But we had literally only known each other for 4 weeks! And it’s not like we had any kind of friendship. We didn’t hang out after class and we didn’t really talk during class either! And here’s this 46-year-old (supposedly) who is behaving like a love-sick 12-year-old! “Don’t ever talk to me again” and then “I love you”… My gosh!


And what does he expect from me? Does he really think I will date someone like him?


Well, I didn’t hold back in my reply. I told him I had no feelings for him whatsoever. I said that his behaviour was selfish and just made me feel awkward. I reminded him he was a married man who should be capable of managing his own feelings and I’m not responsible for accommodating them. I said I never wanted to speak about this again and that I wanted to keep contact to a minimum.


Since then (it’s been about 3 weeks), he keeps staring at me in a love-sick-puppy kind of way and it’s totally creeping me out! One day I arrived at school after lunch. I was about 20 minutes early for class as I pulled into the car park. There is a park next to our school and Stan often goes for a walk during lunch break. When I pulled in, he was about 100m away (roughly 320 feet), with his back facing me walking in the other direction. He obviously hears my car coming and turns his head to see who it is. Normal enough, I’d do the same. Except when he sees it’s me, he just stops and completely turns around to face me and just stares at me longingly with his head slightly tilted to one side. The shivers ran down my spine. I turned away for about ten seconds (tops) to park my car properly and when I look back he had completely disappeared. The man is a freak! 


We’ve had ten days off now for Christmas. He sent me a text on the 24th which I ignored. I realized afterwards that he sent it to me from a different mobile telephone number than the one he gave to the rest of the class. Obviously, he might just have bought himself a new phone. But I can’t help but think he’s bought himself a second phone so he can keep his texts secret from his wife… I’m back to school on Tuesday and I am totally dreading it. I am furious that he has made me feel so uncomfortable that I no longer enjoy going to school anymore after I waited so long to get in. I need this degree! He doesn’t. He’s said so many times and even the teachers were surprised he wanted to do this course because with his background, he’d get a job in no time…


I don’t feel comfortable talking about this with the head of school because I don’t want people to know about it and I’m worried that they wouldn’t even take my side. They might say I’m being harsh on him or I brought it on myself by being polite to him. Plus, he’s backed off with the emails so they might say that I’m just misinterpreting his stares or that it was just an innocent text message to wish me a Merry Christmas and I’m reading too much into it…


But I do wish I could tell at least one of my classmates. It feels so isolating being in that classroom when he stares at me and makes me feel so awkward and yet the rest of the class is completely oblivious to it. Like he's abusing me right before people's eyes and they have no clue. It feels lonely...


Maybe I just need to vent. The man is a total creep! A pig! He’s lucky he even got someone to marry him in the first place and yet he so brazenly disregards her and her feelings… The worst part is I think he believes that he is the victim in all this: His wife probably doesn’t understand him and now his feelings for another woman have been rebuked. It’s all about him. He doesn’t care about the betrayal to his wife. He doesn’t care that a messy divorce would be devastating for his two young daughters. And he doesn’t care that he creeps me out and makes me feel sick and uncomfortable. He’s all “Me. Me. Me”.


I literally feel physically sick when I think about him. I think also, that the fact that since I moved back home, I have been pestered by 3 married guys to go out with them that I just have no patience for it anymore. Before I wouldn’t have judged someone I didn’t know as there could be many reasons as to why someone cheats but actually, now I just think it’s pathetic and gross. Man up and leave your spouse if it’s that bad! You only live once so don’t waste it with someone you don’t want to be with. But if you decide to stay with someone then have some bloody respect!


There. Rant over.

Still has many pounds to go.

# Story time

## Back story

23 year old former graduate student. I've sort of been fat my entire life and didn't understand how large I really was. I'd never not been fat so I didn't have anything to compare myself to but I knew in the back of my head that I was overweight. 

I'm sure many on reddit have the same back story but I didn't learn how to eat healthy growing up. My parents just didn't know (still don't, but I'm working on that) how to. With the exception of a brother I have in the Army, every adult in my family is overweight. I grew up eating the *standard American diet* which consisted of lots of macaroni and cheese, frozen pizzas, and fast food. Processed junk basically. I rarely ate vegetables and almost never at actual fruit. Neither of my parents can cook. 

One thing that makes my story a bit different is that I was born with a club foot so one of my feet is 4 sizes smaller than the other (its also quite wide, 6E). I couldn't find tennis shoes to really fit my feet which made it difficult to run. For these reasons I never played sports as a kid (only hiking and backpacking which you can do at any weight if you walk slowly enough) and didn't have any active hobbies. 

When I got to college I continued with the bad habits I developed as a kid: I ate out for almost every meal either at the dining hall or a fast food place on campus. My cooking consisted of different varieties of macaroni and cheese or frozen pizza. I would rationalize the food choices I was making because I was ""too stressed and busy"" to learn to cook something healthy. I then tried to make myself as busy as possible to justify the fact that I was eating poorly, it was a bad cycle. 

By the time I finished a masters degree in 2015 I was 5'11"", almost 300 pounds, and depressed. I hated the way I looked in pictures. I didn't want to go out in public because I believed that every time someone looked at me they were judging my weight. 

## First attempt: Summer 2015

After I graduated I had an internship in a different city. I was unhappy and fed up and for the first time had a bit of disposable income and free time so I bought a fitbit. I didn't know anyone in the city I was living in and the ""fitness center"" in the hotel my employer put me up in for the summer consisted of a few treadmills and an elliptical. 

I forced myself to get up early and use the elliptical. To break up the monotony of doing the same movement every day for my morning workout I started with the couch to 5 k (C25K) program by running on one of the treadmills. I still didn't have proper running shoes (and was about 275 pounds) so by the time I got to week 6 or so my knees hurt so much after each workout that I had to take several days off to recover after each run, which wasn't sustainable. By increasing my activity I was able to lose about 15 pounds over the 3 month summer internship. At this point I hadn't changed my eating habits but did change how I rationalized the poor choices: instead of eating the food because I was stressed I rewarded myself for working out and being active. Different justification but same result: I kept eating shit food. 

## Falling off the wagon

I started at a new school for a PhD program in the fall of 2015 and became busy and stressed again. I went back into my old eating habits and began to rationalize my poor food choices. I argued to myself that I didn't have time to workout again, I had too much work on my plate. I started a job that semester helping researchers with their statistical methods and I simultaneously took and taught courses so I justified ordering pizza every Friday night because I was tired and *deserved it*. 

During this time I knew something bad was happening and couldn't bring myself to step on the scale at all. I gained back the 15 pounds I worked so hard to lose over the summer. 

## Second attempt: counting calories

I visited some friends in New York during the winter holiday and of course that meant taking a lot of pictures. There was a moment where I was looking through those pictures being sad about how much I weighed that I had somewhat of an epiphany and had the thought that ""there are loads of people out there who lose weight, if they can do it, why can't I?"" So I started doing some research into weight loss methods. One of the methods that seemed to have some research backing it up was calories in/calories out. The method made a lot of sense to me: ""If you burn more calories than you eat you'll lose weight"". That science is so simple that even I understood it. 

So I started tracking all my food in the Fitbit app (I was still wearing one daily). I slowly brought my eating down to 500 calories below the TDEE that Fitbit estimated for each day. I started doing a variant of Stronglifts on M/W/F with a friend and doing cardio on the elliptical on T/R. Some weeks I was even motivated enough to do cardio on the weekends. I went on a few Saturday morning hikes (the only time we could squeeze it in, I'd be back at work on Saturday afternoons). I even started teaching myself to cook from YouTube videos and cookbooks. Through this I lost about 30 pounds in 3 months. 

Over summer 2016 I worked another internship. I didn't have easy access to a weightlifting gym or my motivating lifting partner like I did at school. Being in a hotel again I didn't really have a kitchen to cook with. So I sort of just maintained for the summer. I jogged a bit but didn't lift at all and I stopped recording everything I ate. Strictly speaking I stopped recording during finals but I didn't pick it up at all over the summer.  I also didn't bring my scale so that's the second break in my weight log (see pictures). 

## Third attempt: eating healthy

I didn't want to obsess about recording everything I ate for the rest of my life. For me that wasn't a sustainable lifestyle. I worried that I would eventually stop recording and gain again. So instead I did research and tried to teach myself what healthy eating looked like  so that I could learn what a healthy diet looked like without needing to rely on recording myself every day. I read books and research papers, watched documentaries and talks, and cooked a lot. Some I will recommend and think **everyone** should read are The China Study by Campbell and How Not To Die by Gregor. 

I've spent the last few months eliminating processed foods, cooking/preparing for myself, and eating fruits and vegetables as much as possible. I started dating my girlfriend about 8 months ago and she's been such a huge motivation on this journey. She grew up eating home cooked food almost exclusively and has been teaching me to cook. If you had to put a label on our diet we aim for ""Whole food plant based"". We aren't vegetarian at all (she occasionally eats red meat/chicken and I occasionally eat fish) but we try to eat mostly plants as much as possible. 

I aim for lifting 2-3x/week and jogging 1-2x in addition but I don't always hit those goals. Sometimes we substitute rock climbing instead. My current numbers are (starting in February -&gt; yesterday): squat: 95 -&gt; 225 5x5; deadlift: 135 -&gt; 225 5x1; bench 95 -&gt; 155 5x5 (I know I know...). 

To summarize this period I've lost 40 pounds and my rate of loss (see graph) shows no signs of slowing down. 

I'm not sure if this is the optimal diet for me and I certainly plan to be more active this year as I start a full time job (I dropped out of grad school, it wasn't working out for my mental/physical health at all). I just wanted to share my story and let out that there is an alternative to obsessively counting calories: eating as much whole food and plants as you want. I know that reducing the consumption of meat and processed foods (pretty much everything not in the produce section of the grocery store) isn't for everyone, but it's working out great for me and I wanted to throw it out as another option perhaps not seen frequently on this sub. 

I'm certainly not where I want to be with my weight. My goal weight when I started was 250, then 200, and right now is 188 (to make it 100 pounds lost) which is about another 30 pounds. I don't think that will be my final goal weight, but I can't remember a time when I was that low so I'm not sure how I'll look. I'll adjust when I get down there so expect another post from me in about a year. I want to continue to increase my lifts as well. 

# Example meal plan 

Breakfast: oatmeal with fruit OR homemade granola with yogurt and fruit OR eggs and toast and fruit

Lunch: vegetable and rice bowl OR vegetable curry with rice

Dinner: out for sushi with the girlfriend (the raw fish kind, not the deep fried kind) OR noodle soup like pho or ramen OR stir fry with rice

Snacks: fruit and occasionally nuts/trail mix. 


# Workout schedule
Stronglifts 5x5 on 2 day spit, aiming for 2-3x/week:

A day: 

|Workout   |Sets   |Reps   |
|---|---|---|
|Squat   |5 |5   |
|Overhead press   |5   |5   |
|Deadlift   |1   |5   |


B day: 

|Workout   |Sets   |Reps   |
|---|---|---|
|Squat   |5   |5   |
|Bench   |5   |5   |
|Rows   |5  |5   |

Jogging for about half an hour, aim for 1-2x/week (seriously though go to a running store and get legitimate shoes for your feet).

Looking for people to talk to.,cohlerust,r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/5lh98j/25m4r_depressed_and_failing_in_life_looking_for/,"Hi. I'm a 25 year old medical student. I got into University with a full scholarship. This year all my batchmates will complete their internships and I still haven't passed M2. I was diagnosed with depression after I started failing exams consistently. I am on antidepressants currently. They helped initially but I am drained of all confidence in myself. I simply believe that I cannot do it. I have considered dropping out but I really love all the subjects and want to be a doctor and the few friends I have say that I'll make a good doctor. I'm hoping you can tell me about your battle with depression and how you overcame it or about somebody you know that did poorly in medical school and went onto become good doctors. 

I'm looking to make some friends as well. Self proclaimed geek who has built his own PC, loved to read (have difficulty now), enjoy good movies and TV shows (just finised The Man in the High Castle; Breaking Bad is all time favourite). Come say hi!

Happy New Year!"

#/r/SubredditOfTheDay

**128,162** subreddit explorers *exploring* for **5 years!**

Happy New Year's day, everyone. There are some big changes at how Subreddit of the Day works. So this felt like a really good time for us to feature ourselves as Subreddit of the Day so we can go over those changes with you. I know what you're thinking. We could've just made an announcement as a sticky post. And I probably will sticky this post for a while. But we don't want to take away any attention from the sub that we'll be featuring on any particular day by making a second post. That never goes well and it's really not fair for the featured sub. 

#New CSS

Everyone's been complaining about the CSS on this sub since we released this version. We now have brand new CSS that is a lot more easy on the eyes. It's still a work in progress, but we hope that you see it as an immediate improvement. I would like to invite you all to turn your CSS back on and see for yourself. You can give your feedback in the comments. Please let us know what you think. Also, special thanks to /u/hatefullyemployed for designing it and also to /u/kate_4_president for lending a hand. 

#Changes to how features are written 

Here's the old way that  Subreddit of the Day (hereinafter referred to as SROTD) works. Our writing staff find a sub that they like, interview that sub, write an article about it, and then post it. This is a very time consuming process. It often takes days or weeks. It's a lot of effort for very little payout. We know from our last survey that few people read wordy features. We had to be honest with ourselves too. It turned out that we don't even usually read them. What most people do is read the headline and then click the link, and then maybe they'll read the rest of the feature. 

Anyways, although SROTD has never missed a day, we've come very close to missing days in the past where there was no post ready and everyone's scrambling to find a sub, interview them, and get the post up. 

We've streamlined the feature process to do basically this: Summarize the sub, say what's good about it, and show what's good about it. Some still have mod interviews. We know you all like those. But some don't really need it. We've done away with character limits. Posts will be as long as they need to be in order to capture the essence of the featured sub. 

#Special Guest Writer Program

This is the change at SROTD that I am most proud of. It really is. It's another that we've been doing for months but have made no official announcement. 

It used to be that only mods and staff wrote the features. We allowed nominations, but those were often ignored if no one here was familiar enough with the topic of the sub, or if no one here even liked it. 

The special guest program lets the person who nominated the sub write the feature. Usually these are the mods of the sub, but sometimes they are also fans of the sub. So far two of my favorites to come from this program are the [TOTALLYNOTROBOTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/3me941/september_25_2015_rtotallynotrobots_a_place_for/?ref=search_posts ) and [EnoughTrumpSpam](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/4o7fxj/june_15th_2016_renoughtrumpspam_i_dont_think_we/?ref=search_posts) features. Both are fantastic, and are better brought to life by people who actually are members or mods of those communities. 

This program has been so successful that in December 16 of the 31 features that we did were special guest features. You may have noticed that the byline on of the posts said ""written by special guest writer."" This month's calendar is already filling up with guest features as well. 

Part of this was a response to mods complaining that they made nominations which were ignored. They weren't wrong. So we're giving everyone a chance to tell us about their own community (or their favorite community) in their own words. 

Same restrictions apply as always. The community must be about a month old, have at least a few hundred subscribers, and must have an active user base. That's it. There's also our sister sub, /r/TinySubredditOfTheDay, for the really small ones. So, check that out. 

#SROTD Archives 

Some of you may have noticed that we've been running archive features. Over the years several people have joined the intern program and left us with interviews and incomplete write ups of a number of subs. We're finishing, updating, and editing these to get them ready to go. It's unfair that some mods have been waiting for years for their features to get done. This is part of our effort to turn that around. 

#Mission Statement 

We've changed our mission statement. It used to be ""bringing the awesome."" The problem was that not all subs are awesome to everyone. Some are in particular disliked by a number of people. So it had to change. Our mission is now to explore unique reddit communities, to spotlight them, to discuss them. Reddit, to me, is the most awesome collection of communities on the planet with a great diversity of viewpoints. So ya, when we feature GunsAreCool or TheRedPill some people will find those to be awesome and might be upset that we're talking about them at all. But they are a part of reddit culture, and are fair game. 



#Nominating a Sub

Turn on the CSS for this sub. You'll see a big, beautiful ""nominate"" button. This will give you a ""form"" to fill out. The more complete it is the faster it will get posted. We have a new commitment to customer service. While you'll get an automated response, just reply to it and a real human will help you. If you're a mod of the sub the feature will get scheduled very quickly. If you're not a mod, then SROTD staff will need to obtain permission from the mod team before moving forward. 

#Write SROTD

Check the link in the sidebar to join the intern program. That's the path to becoming a permanent writer and eventually a mod here. You will be expected to meet some quotas. Or, you can use the aforementioned nominate button if there's only one sub you'd like to write about.

5lhssf,45,2017-01-01,"How many CIA operatives like Evan McMullin are working in the government, and who are they supporting and what is their goal?",MissMarple2,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5lhssf/how_many_cia_operatives_like_evan_mcmullin_are/,"I follow this Evan McMullin guy on Twitter,  to see what he is up to.  He is the guy who came out of nowhere to run as an anti-Trump candidate during the election.

I got a note from a friend who follows this stuff like me,  and here is what he had to say:

The Hill has up a new story up about this irrelevant, obnoxious, Mormon moron, ""Former independent presidential candidate Evan Mcmullen, slamming President Elect Trump.

The first comment to the story says this:

SmartProf • 2 hours ago
The Hill has run 6 McMullin articles this past month.

Decided to check if that was true.

Dec 10: (The Hill) McMullin: 'Trump is not a loyal American'
Dec 14: (The Hill) McMullin: GOP knew about, ignored Russian meddling in election
Dec 17: (The Hill) McMullin returns fire on Trump for 'McMuffin' diss
Dec 22: (The Hill) McMullin mocks Gingrich for backtracking on 'drain the swamp' remark
Dec 27: (The Hill) McMullin: The GOP has a problem with racism
Dec 30: (The Hill) McMullin: Trump 'siding with America's greatest adversary'

And from last month:

Nov 1: (The Hill) A totally plausible path for Evan McMullin to become president
Nov 14: (The Hill) McMullin slams Bannon appointment

As I understand it, The Hill is an American political journalism newspaper and website published in Washington, D.C. since 1994.[3][4][5] It is published by Capitol Hill Publishing, which is owned by News Communications, Inc. Focusing on politics, policy, business and international relations, The Hill coverage includes the U.S. Congress, the presidency, and election campaigns.[6]

So why is the Hill giving so much coverage to an irrelevant nobody who has never served in the House or in the Senate, nor in any elective office, and who got less votes for President than Bernie Sanders? Heck, you're giving him 10 times more coverage than you gave him when he was a candidate. The Election is over. Evan McMullin got his butt kicked on November 8th even worse than Kasich or Jill Stein, but for some reason The Hill finds it necessary to publish whatever this asshole says 6 times in the month of December, and now on day one of 2017 they gave the moron another Front Page story and Headline to rip the President Elect:

Jan 1: (The Hill) McMullin blasts 'Authoritarian' Trump

Who is Evan McMullin's gay lover at The Hill is what I wanna' know.

Seriously The Hill, and Ab Stoddard specifically, why do you guys give this embittered irrelevant asshole so much ink? Are readers out here dying to hear what this colossal irrelevant loser has too say? C'mon. If you want to criticize Trump, then cut out the farce and just start criticizing Trump yourself, instead of providing soapboxes for irrelevant shitheads you can hide behind who'll do your criticizing for you.

Cowards.
----------------------------------------

Now,  I had noticed this,  as well as this guy's continuing anti-Trump posts on Twitter.  So I went to Wikipedia and looked at his biography.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_McMullin

Note that he had a LONG history with the CIA, including 4 years as an intern while at Brigham Young.  Note also that he was very skilled in getting extremist Muslims to work with the US. (This is not a plus in my opinion.)

Note also that he worked for the UN in refugee resettlement.

Then magically he is a senior advisor on the House Foreign Relations Committee.

Now,  here is what I think needs to be answered:

Who hired this guy to work for the House Foreign Relations Committee?

Who is now funding him?   As far as I can tell, he is unemployed.

If McMullin hadn't run for president,  would we know about his CIA and UN connections?  Nope.

How many other CIA or UN loyalists are working within our government?

Where do McMullin's loyalties lie: to the Constitution or the CIA?

Why is he trying to undermine Trump?

What is the game plan here?

I would welcome any centipede's help in figuring this out.  I don't know what's going on,  but it sure looks shady to me.

ALSO:  What is The Hill's connection to the CIA and why are they pushing this guy's narrative?

5li04e,6,2017-01-01,What do you think of the writing for Lily's San Francisco art internship and its outcome?,HeartExalted,HIMYM,https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMYM/comments/5li04e/what_do_you_think_of_the_writing_for_lilys_san/,"As you surely recall, when Lily first reconnected with Ted and Robin after her 3-month adventure in San Francisco, she seemed very happy and fulfilled.  She was gushing about all the great experiences she had doing the art internship and meeting interesting people.

Ted and Robin, then, had a bet over whether Lily was being sincere or just faking it.  As it turned out, she was *faking* it and actually had a bad time there, all around:

* She did badly at her art internship
* She actually just met one weird-in-a-bad-way guy
* The whole ""pining for Marshall"" thing

I'm sure some people were glad to see that outcome, so as to see Lily be ""punished"" for leaving Marshall.  Then again, there are probably those who wanted her ""I'm so fulfilled from having new experiences and finding myself"" act to be *real*.

Where do you fall, in terms of your opinions about the writing for that part of the story?  

(Keeping in mind, of course, that Lily could have had a wonderful experience in San Francisco and **still** came to regret leaving Marshall behind in New York.)"
5liaqk,5,2017-01-01,My family line is in danger of dying out... advice?,letrainfalldown,Sororities,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sororities/comments/5liaqk/my_family_line_is_in_danger_of_dying_out_advice/,"So I'm an alum of a chapter of a social STEM/engineering sorority that was only installed about a year and a half ago. My family is the only line that does not originate from a founding mother/member (there are only 4 in alpha class), and my little is thinking of dropping. I, and my little, have noticed that our line is where they tend to put the ""strange"" ones, or the ones who don't quite fit in with the rest, with one little at a time (there are no twins in our line). 

My little has repeatedly voiced concerns to me that she doesn't feel like the other members value her or treat her like a sister. I totally understand where she's coming from as my experience was not too different from that, but I also know that you get out of a sorority what you put in and that these kinds of things are fairly common. I'm really close with my little and she's also close with a few others, so she definitely has felt like it's been of some value to her (she also got an internship out of it too!).

My little also has a little. If my little drops, my grandlittle won't have a big anymore, and she too will likely drop (especially since my little says she too is part of the ""strange"" line of girls), effectively ending our line. 

My main concern is that my family line will die out and then all that will remain are the founding mothers and their lines, which in my opinion, already have most of the say in how the sorority is run. I feel as if our family brings quirkiness and diversity to the sorority and I feel like it wouldn't feel the same without our side. I joined this sorority partially because I wanted to have a say to creating an organization that would last generations to come, and I guess we ended up being the quirky ones. That's cool with me, but I'd be pretty upset if our family's legacy died. At the same time, I do want my little to be happy.

What do the rest of you think about families dying out? Has it happened to anyone else? Am I putting too much importance on the family line and I should let the chips fall where they may and let everything happen on its own?"
5lii2i,1,2017-01-01,26M4A - Milking a Starlet,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5lii2i/26m4a_milking_a_starlet/,"Good evening, DPP! For my prompt the title really says it all, doesn't it? I want to play out a scenario based around a celebrity lactating and me being the one to take her by the teats and milk her. But the thing is that this isn't normal lactation...something is causing our starlet to express an abnormally large amount of milk. Her breasts fill up every 4 to 6 hours with more than a machine can handle. And her breasts have become far too sensitive for her to milk on her own without collapsing into a sweaty, orgasmic pile. She'll need someone with her at all times to help her relieve herself of her milk - and that someone will be me.

The lactation can be brought on in a number of ways. Maybe it's a latent genetic condition triggered by GMO crops. Maybe its a new and incurable disease. Maybe its the permanent result of a special chemical concoction. Or maybe its even magic or a curse placed on a celebrity's favorite feature. That's one thing I would like to work out before the roleplay starts.

As for the kind of scenario this will be, I'm open to both a consensual and rather non-consensual path. On the consensual side, I see the celebrity coming down with this condition spontaneously and myself as her best friend or manager or intern even being the only ones around when it strikes to help her. From there the role play would focus on our starlet coping with this new part of her life. Does she try to hide it and keep me with her at all times to milk her when needed? Does she get exposed or come out with it to begin with and needs to turn to me as someone who doesn't think she's a freak? Will her career end and she'll need to find new work involving her udders? Or will she stay defiant and turn them into a public fascination? That's up to us.

On the other side, perhaps I'm a rueful intern or manager, an obsessed fan, a hateful rival, or a scientist or businessman who sees a potential for profit with no concern for your feelings. Similar to above, perhaps I dose you or curse you into lactating and threaten to expose you if you don't become my slut. Maybe you are exposed and I use your despair to coerce you into becoming a hucow at a ranch and living your life as an animal. Maybe you're kidnapped or otherwise coerced into being milked for profit. The choice is ours.

Alright, now technical details. First, **I am open to both men and women so long as they play a female celebrity**. Second, I tend to write a paragraph per response. I try to reply once a day but cant always, so this will have to be long term. And if you need inspiration, some of my favorite celebrities are...

Elizabeth Gillies, Daniella Monet, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lawrence, Cara Delevigne, Jenette McCurdy, Victoria Justice, Ariana Grande, Amy Lee, and Kate Upton. I'm also open to other suggestions.

Kinks: Lactation, mild breast growth, nudity and ENF, humiliation OR shame (feeling humiliated absent being made to), name calling OR romance and tenderness, blackmail OR cuddling, anything vanilla.

Limits: Non-human or extreme changes, blood, toilet, vomit, beast, incest, under 18, extreme violence, snuff."

5lj1jw,0,2017-01-01,Why I love Blizzard and the Firelord - Personal,Hogger18,heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/5lj1jw/why_i_love_blizzard_and_the_firelord_personal/,"Hey all, wanted to make a post about my relationship with Blizzard (yes, I plan to talk a little about me) and my experience with Ragnaros and how he has re-ignited (HA) my childlike wonder to video games.  

So a little bit about me. I consider myself a huge Blizzard fanboy. I got into playing World of Warcraft with my neighbor who became my best friend through our shared love of the universe Blizzard created. Ever since then, I grew to love Blizzard and everything they created. To back up a little, my childhood was not one that was filled with video games or television (Im mid-20s). My parents believed in the philosophy where kids were meant to play outside, not indoors with video games. But after getting to watch my friend and his dad play WoW together, I knew it was just something I had to be a part of. So I got my first job cutting lawns for neighbors so I could front the *hefty* $15 a month fee to play. And the rest is history. 

I have days on months of played time for each of my characters in that game, so much time spent in front of a computer, I decided I wanted to make a career out of it. In college I am majoring in Computer Information System (will be graduating this semester!) and have loved every minute of it. Freshman year I remember waiting anxiously to receive a beta invite to play one of Blizzard's new games, Hearthstone. I spent all waking hours I wasn't studying or practicing (I swam for the college team, done bragging now :D ) watching streamers play the game (Kripp, Trump, you know who you are). A similar story with Heroes, though this time I got in the beta! 

But as any of you guys/gals know, things don't always stay the same. I started taking internships during summer/winter breaks and trying to balance working/social life/working out during this period of my life meant I had to cut out some things I loved. Primarily, video games. I spent less time with guildmates and more time with other obligations. My interest in games just seemed to dwindle. I remember thinking, ""You didn't even *buy* the latest expansion! The last time you HC raided was 4.2 (IMPORTANT: 4.2 was RAGE of the Firelands starring the most badass Hardmode boss fight I've ever encountered)."" 

So lately I've just been a *filthy casual*. Playing some here and there, bouncing from Hearthstone to Heroes to Overwatch and back again. But to the crux of my post, Ragnaros.

When I saw Ragnaros was coming to the Nexus, I went ahead and pulled out the old Visa and said goodbye to $15. I had to have him. And let me tell you, best $15 I've spent in a LOOOONG time. I'm directing this to the design team for Heroes, I have had the greatest time playing this character, thank you. Playing Rag and hearing his voice lines takes me back to those nights I was up at 3am just to try and down Heroic mode before any other guild on our server (we were 4th :p ). His kit feels amazing to play with and he feels like the Firelord. Molten Core is my absolute FAVORITE ability in the game. Taking over a structure and becoming a huge raid boss brings back the feelings I had back in my raiding days. I've spent more time playing Ragnaros than I have playing video games in the past few months and it feels so special that it is because of him. 

So to sum it up, thank you Blizzard for everything. You guys have more of an effect on people than you realize (hey, maybe you do realize, I dunno) and you've shaped my life in a way I would never imagine any other gaming company doing. I hope to see more of the powerful forces I knew from Azeroth enter the Nexus. "

5ljgs8,0,2017-01-01,"I've (24M) been hooking up with a woman from work (38F), but she's getting married to my boss (45M). Worried about losing my job if he finds out.",happynewyearfml,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ljgs8/ive_24m_been_hooking_up_with_a_woman_from_work/,"I started working at this company right out of college as an intern and since I fit really well with the place and liked the work, I stuck around and am trying to work my way up. I know I'm young and have many career possibilities but I really don't want to ruin this one because I'm grateful it's worked out as well as it has. I'm making a good salary and actually like my job.

A few weeks ago I joined a team for a project that included this woman ""Erica"". My boss ""Dan"" had introduced us before and I'd seen her around since then but had never had any contact with her. We ended up working really well together and getting along, flirting in a subtle way sometimes. I found her very refined and attractive and eventually our relationship evolved beyond just that of friendly colleagues. We've had sex about a dozen times, including a few after the project ended, and sext/snapchat when we can (she doesn't want my boss to accidently see anything). 

(For history, Erica and Dan apparently actually met here themselves around the time I started working here but I wasn't working under Dan then and didn't really know either of them. They got engaged in September but didn't make a big deal about it at work. Then a couple months later I joined the team and Erica and I started a sexual relationship. And I'm certain that for both of us it's only sex, no feelings involved, and FWIW Erica has hinted I'm not the first guy she's done this with. They're due to get married in May or June I think.)

So now the problem is that, yesterday we met at the office to briefly hook up (I know, I know... but obviously her place isn't an option and I still have family staying at mine). We assumed no one would be there because of the holiday. But a couple times during sex we thought we heard noises like someone moving around in a nearby room, and when we left I noticed there was a big pile of paperwork missing from one guy's desk. I noticed because it's been a joke for a couple weeks, ""when is ""Fred"" gonna get all that done?"", and maybe he did before the weekend or took it home before and I just didn't notice then....

But now the more I try to remember if I saw it there Friday night or not, the more paranoid I am that he stopped by the office last night and what if he heard us? Which even if he did I know he couldn't have seen us but if it gets around that someone was having sex in the office on New Years eve and Dan hears, and then remembers Erica went out that night... well yeah I'm just worried.

So I'm just wondering if there's any kind of pre-emptive damage control I can or should do just in case he finds out? He doesn't SEEM like the kind of guy who fires people at the drop of a hat, he's only been my boss since the summer but he seems like a pretty good guy. But both Dan and Erica are pretty high up in the ranks in the company and you never know what people will do when they're upset. 

Also I've already texted Erica that it made me nervous how he could have gotten caught last night and that I want to scale things back, and I think she'll understand, so I'm not gonna be stupid and make the same mistake twice. I'm just afraid I could have put my career in jeopardy. And even my friendships too. There's a few people there I've become decent friends with who I'll get drinks with after work sometimes, including that guy Fred, who I originally bonded with just as the only other black guy at the company. If I lose my job I'd probably lose these people too, and I don't have too much of a social life elsewhere.

So yeah just looking for any advice about how to navigate this from now on, or if you think I'm just overreacting then I'd want to know that too.

TL;DR been hooking up with the woman who's due to marry my boss in a few months. Someone might have heard us having sex and I'm afraid if it got back to my boss and he ended up putting it together, I could get fired. How should I proceed?"

5llbwq,1,2017-01-02,26M4A - The Milking of a Starlet,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5llbwq/26m4a_the_milking_of_a_starlet/,"Hey everyone! For my prompt the title really says it all, doesn't it? I want to play out a scenario based around a celebrity lactating and me being the one to take her by the teats and milk her. But the thing is that this isn't normal lactation...something is causing our starlet to express an abnormally large amount of milk. Her breasts fill up every 4 to 6 hours with more than a machine can handle. And her breasts have become far too sensitive for her to milk on her own without collapsing into a sweaty, orgasmic pile. She'll need someone with her at all times to help her relieve herself of her milk - and that someone will be me.

The lactation can be brought on in a number of ways. Maybe it's a latent genetic condition triggered by GMO crops. Maybe its a new and incurable disease. Maybe its the permanent result of a special chemical concoction. Or maybe its even magic or a curse placed on a celebrity's favorite feature. That's one thing I would like to work out before the roleplay starts.

As for the kind of scenario this will be, I'm open to both a consensual and rather non-consensual path. On the consensual side, I see the celebrity coming down with this condition spontaneously and myself as her best friend or manager or intern even being the only ones around when it strikes to help her. From there the role play would focus on our starlet coping with this new part of her life. Does she try to hide it and keep me with her at all times to milk her when needed? Does she get exposed or come out with it to begin with and needs to turn to me as someone who doesn't think she's a freak? Will her career end and she'll need to find new work involving her udders? Or will she stay defiant and turn them into a public fascination? That's up to us.

On the other side, perhaps I'm a rueful intern or manager, an obsessed fan, a hateful rival, or a scientist or businessman who sees a potential for profit with no concern for your feelings. Similar to above, perhaps I dose you or curse you into lactating and threaten to expose you if you don't become my slut. Maybe you are exposed and I use your despair to coerce you into becoming a hucow at a ranch and living your life as an animal. Maybe you're kidnapped or otherwise coerced into being milked for profit. The choice is ours.

Alright, now technical details. First, **I am open to both men and women so long as they play a female celebrity**. Second, I tend to write a paragraph per response. I try to reply once a day but cant always, so this will have to be long term. And if you need inspiration, some of my favorite celebrities are...

Elizabeth Gillies, Daniella Monet, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lawrence, Cara Delevigne, Jenette McCurdy, Victoria Justice, Ariana Grande, Amy Lee, and Kate Upton. I'm also open to other suggestions.

Kinks: Lactation, mild breast growth, nudity and ENF, humiliation OR shame (feeling humiliated absent being made to), name calling OR romance and tenderness, blackmail OR cuddling, anything vanilla.

Limits: Non-human or extreme changes, blood, toilet, vomit, beast, incest, under 18, extreme violence, snuff."
5llif6,3,2017-01-02,Demon Rehabilitation - Part 35,AlinaKG,AlinaKG,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlinaKG/comments/5llif6/demon_rehabilitation_part_35/,"The two wall lights were set low, and in different circumstances, the room would have felt warm. I had no idea what to make of it now. I knew that God waited on the other end of this wall but my mind could not quite comprehend his presence. I felt an angel, a demon and something else. Color, sound and taste attached to tremendous weight that took absolutely no space. Nothing specific, not red or blue or the string of a guitar, just the subtle pulse of them. This felt utterly wrong but thinking about it for too long caused an odd dull warmth in my head.

At the very least, I expected this all to come to an end in some crack house, thirty years from now, with the cackling laughter of Lucifer following both me and Pepper back to hell. Certainly not before Pepper could talk or with God visiting me in fake Lily’s living room.

I thought the bet was a whim . . . It felt awfully planned now. Just not by me.

I hovered outside the door, waiting for one of them to start speaking so I would not have to make an entrance into a quiet room. Feeling like one of those cymbal-holding monkeys, lifelessly bashing away at the push of a button.

Flash lights and phone lights glinted through the windows. I heard the murmur of the crowd that had gathered outside. People were drawn toward the occupants. None of them could know what it was exactly that had made them get out of bed and gather here but the feeling would be so profound that they wouldn’t even begin to question it in the first place.

Lily’s parents were downstairs when I last heard them but they were gone now. They must have felt it too but the proximity of the event scared them.

After another minute of silence from the lot of them, I entered just to get it over with. Deborah, Lucifer and God turned. She had a sorry smile on her face. An apology, I thought, but not an obvious one. Not to the other two. Perhaps she was trying to ease my nerves with it. Not that it worked.

I avoided looking at Him. I don’t even know why. He did not seem very different from the other two. Except, they looked good enough to attend a meeting at some investment bank and He wasn’t wearing any shoes. His toes were very carefully manicured, though. I realized I had been looking at them with too much fascination and made myself look away, catching his eyes.

“Good morning, Bael,” God said.

“Hello, sir.” Sir? What the fuck was that? I thought. Should I correct myself? Hello, My Lord? Hello, Heavenly Father? No, too late to make a correction now. But if I did correct myself and used My Lord as a greeting, would that have be more correct than sir? I was not a devoted follower, not to him, not for centuries. Why would I pretend to be one now? That seemed terribly fake of me. I wanted to make up for all my wrong doings but as I stood here before him, it did not seem like he wanted me to make it up to him. He did not look at me the way my mother had after I betrayed my father. He did not look at me holding the hatred of the men I employed.

I should have paid more attention when my mother held morning prayers before breakfast. Maybe I would have known how to act now, or what to say. Although, it was evening and not morning like he had said, so I hoped he would not focus on the details, because I had clearly been ill prepared for this.

“There’s a great change coming, Bael,” He said.

I tried to look for an imperfection. Something that looked out of place, that would make me feel less like an extremely nervous, and usually poor behaved high school student, trying to fake being an upstanding human when accidentally running into the president.

I opened my mouth to say something but his eyes changed color as I looked at him, going from the blue of a clear sky to the grey of clouds, and I forgot what I wanted to say. I thought I had made him mad for a second, but then they changed color to green and it was as if I witnessed the earth revolve in his eyes.

“A great change! And I think you should be a part of it. You’re at the center of it, actually.”

He had no marks on his face, not even a single expanded pore. Everything was excruciatingly perfect. This made me feel incredibly small and insignificant, even though He came here to see me.

“Deborah has been keeping a report on you, and I’ve been very impressed with the changes you’ve made to yourself.”

Lucifer’s presence had been forgotten to me until I caught his movement out of the corner of my eye. He went to sit down and even in the way he moved there was change. His confidence almost looked like it had wavered, not in that he had lost it and became some weaker version of himself, but he did not foreground it with everything he did. He no longer tried to show it. It just existed. He certainly seemed more comfortable here than I was. I guess, and I would have never used this word to describe him before, he was just relaxed.

“Would you like to sit?” God asked me when I did not respond. It wasn’t for lack of trying, I just felt like a fly caught on a line of tape. “Maybe you’ll be a little more comfortable if you sit.”

I’m not sure that would have done anything for me except make me feel even smaller. Then, as if on cue, he smiled and I noticed a slight imperfection in the position of his bottom tooth. It stood at a minimal slant. I knew—I don’t know how but I knew—that that little slant existed purely for my benefit. I could have felt tricked but there was only relief. Trivial, I know, but there was some fault, some imperfection that connected us and I started to relax simply because of it.

“I’d like to know what’s going to happen to me now,” I said. I did sit down after all, feeling the weight of the day in my legs. Still mad about Lily—Iva, not just mad, betrayed and deceived, yet, here they were, the people that deceived me, and bringing it up felt trivial.

“Yes, well, that’s why we’re here.”

Deborah sat up straighter and set her small hawk like eyes on me. She looked a little like a parent then, watching her child be questioned on the things she had taught him. I suppose in a way, she did dictate my journey, so whatever I did or said this even would somehow reflect on her.

“We want to offer you a position.”

“Me?” I asked. It was too soon for an internship and to be quite honest, I didn’t really want to join the program. Not another one. I hadn’t even finished the rehabilitation. Not properly, I suspect.

“Yes,” He said. He stood exactly in the same position as he did when I entered. He did not breathe or sway even a little. He did not raise his hands or let them sway as he spoke. They were solid at their sides and his feet planted like tree trunks.

“We think that a transition of power to you will break a little of the initial shock of Lucifer’s departure.”

Transition of power? Wait, a minute . . . Shit! I leaned back in my seat. Well, quite honestly, I fell into it.

“We want you to go back and run Hell the right way. Show humanity where there is none.”

“But I left,” I said as if they did not know this already. “I joined the program. No demon in their right mind will want to have me for a leader.”

“They will,” Lucifer said. “They fear me but they respect you.”

I turned to him dumbstruck. No, they don’t! I wanted to scream at him with the added squeal of a teenager. Was this him getting back at me? Did he spend that week with God and Deborah convincing them to give me the job? I won and he still somehow managed to get what he wanted. What a weasel.

“I don’t want to go back there. Me joining the program didn’t give you a hint? Here, I’ll say it then, I do not want to go back to Hell. Ever, under any circumstance.” I wanted to say that I had won and that he should deal with the loss but it was Kel who killed Pepper eventually. Kel, who wanted the power, the control of the damned and the demons.

“You still have friend there, Bael,” God said. “Do you think they would be better off under Kel’s leadership? Because that’s what they get if they don’t get you.”

“Oh come on!” I stood up from my seat. The nervousness and shock of being in God’s presence leaked right out of me. That’s what survival will do to you! Replace everything that threw you with loud alarm bells and the tunnel vision to an escape route. “There are plenty of others that are fit for the job. Sid,” I stuck my hand out of Lucifer, “he’s worked the gates, worked the souls, has half of Hell, including me, owing him favors. Mae’s actually complete the program. If you want Hell run differently, look to her.”

I said these things but just thinking about Kel being in the seat of ultimate power down there brought a hard, raging lump into my throat.

“Mae’s a follower. She has been yours for years. Sure, a master at manipulation, but at her core, a follower,” God said. “Remember, I know exactly what she’s made of. She won’t be able to handle the responsibility. Sid? Better than Kel, but is selfish and uncaring. He’s a smuggler. Does whatever for whomever as long as it benefits him.”

“May I?” Deborah, who had been only been listening quietly, raised a finger. “I’ll be down there every day and so will Mae. That is why I had her intern for me. I didn’t want you to be lonely. But I didn’t, for a second, think that you would say no to us. This is bigger than you. It’s bigger than me and him.” She pointed her thumb toward Luficer. “You know what needs to be done down there. You’re their second chance, Bael. We won’t interfere if you don’t want us to. We won’t even interfere if you don’t want to change a thing.”

“Deborah, I—”

“I sat there for years wondering when Lucifer would finally wake up. When he would forgive himself and seek that same forgiveness from others.”

Lucifer scoffed but she paid no attention to him. Nobody did. I think we all knew that this embarrassed him, and ate away at the imagine of the big bad wolf that he tried to preserve for so long. We also knew that he wanted to be here, otherwise he would have locked himself up in Hell even if he lost the bet and no one would be able to enter to get to him.

“If that can bloody happen, I don’t understand why you’re being such a baby about this. I suggested that you take this role and damn you if you prove me wrong. Imagine the team we’ll be down there, you and I.”

“You’re only down there an hour a day.” I’d be alone in that dark castle, hovering like Lucifer had once, in the darkness, watching the lining of lava in the far distance and trying to pretend that it was a sunset.

“Then I’ll extend my hours.”

“You want this, Bael,” Iva spoke in a tiny, heartbroken voice from doorway. “I know you do. There’s so much work for you to do. Perhaps, you won’t love every minute of it, but you’ll get to help them. Lev will be by your side. You can keep Kel and the others in check. You’ll never be like him.” Her eyes swept past Lucifer and fell back to me. “Help them.”

“You’ll come visit?” I asked her.

“Every day.”

I am from the USA and moved to Gothenburg this summer to live with my girlfriend.

I couldn't find many websites to help me find an internship but I am not sure if I am looking in the right place.  Any tips?

To combat this and stay motivated, I'm going to work back up starting with light weights in the following fashion:
-Bench day 1: 5x3 reps ""heavier"", followed by 3 sets of 6-8 on incline, close grip, finish with some lighter dumbbell work and some bw dips

-Squat day 1: 5x3 again, lighter pause squats, lunges, straight leg deadlifts

-Bench day 2: pause reps 3x5 of lighter weight, followed by overhead press, skull crushers, weighted dips 

(Rest day) 

-Squat day 2: front squats or lighter squats at 3x5, then throw in pause squats, lighter leg press and hamstring curls for assistance stuff

And finally a day that consists of deadlifting (I usually work up to 2-3 singles) and upper back work

What do you guys think of this plan? Obviously it'd be run like a linear progression focused mainly adding weight on the ""big 3"" with accessories being supplementary. I'm thinking if I run this, plus eat a ton, I should be back to where I was soon. 

For those of you that know this struggle, what helped you get back to, and beyond where you were? Any and all advice will be appreciated!

5lnbk3,6,2017-01-02,I finally cut off my narcissist father for good.,foreverwalkalonr,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5lnbk3/i_finally_cut_off_my_narcissist_father_for_good/,"I have tried to regain my relationship with my narcicisstic father So many times and I just can't do it anymore... 

So my dad has always been a narcissist even since I was a kid- prime examples would be whenever my brother had an awards ceremony at school and my mom got him a nice shirt to wear for the ceremony and my dad made him switch shirts with him because he felt like a bum, wearing a KMOD radio station shirt, completely forgetting the fact that the day was about my brother looking nice because he was getting honor roll at an awards assembly...

Another occasion is when he destroyed an art mural of mine so he could make an art piece for himself and when I took my root beer bottle back for the MY ART MURAL that I had in my bedroom, he flipped out on me and picked a fight with me and told me I destroyed his art, completely not acknowledging that he destroyed mine. 

One recent thing that happened between my father and I was I told him if he pulled anymore of his shit with me, I am done because I dont have to put up with it and i don't expect anybody else to at that matter. 

I was sick with viral bronchitis, I couldn't eat, I couldnt move, I was running a fever, and I felt like I was going to faint. My brother didn't want to take me to the ER because he's very busy with is three different jobs he does- school, work, internship- so I called my dad crying because I almost passed out behind the wheel of my car and I almost wrecked it. I asked him to take me to the hospital and the whole time, he is in my car and driving me up there, he flips out on me and screams at me while I am damn near passing out in the passengers side of my car. He starts stomping on the brakes of my car and going on about how the car I am making him drive is unsafe and im going to get him and his stupid wife sick. 

He tells me that I use him as a parent and only go to him when I need something- isn't that what a kid is supposed to and allowed to do with a parent? I may be 27, but if I need something, I can still go to my mom. The big issue I have with that is, he's played that card to worm his way out of being my dad since I was a kid, and then he would turn around and get angry for never going to him if something came up and I needed someone- well... First I'm using you... And then you get mad because I don't reach out to you when I need something? He's been this way since I was a kid.  

He brings up the fact that I refuse to live with him- I told him I could not stay with him after I had already lived there before with him for the most miserable five months of my life with him- he was pissed because after I left his house, I  had been on my own and struggling for a while and my mom finally let me come back and stay with her. He was pissed because I went to go and live with her instead of moving back in with him. 

but he doesn't realize he is a hoarder- his house is filthy and disgusting, it's infested with roaches, at one point, he had 13 dogs- now it's three dogs and three cats- when you step on the porch of his house, you can smell the dog and cat piss before even going inside. He piles his trash up everywhere all over the floor- the dogs and cats piss and shit everywhere and neither of them clean it up. It was so bad, I took pictures incase if I ever had to use that against them because for a while when I lived with them, they were blaming all of that on me. It was so bad, I was sick with bronchitis the whole time i lived there, and every time i left the house, I would shower and wear clean clothes but I would still stink because the stench of his house would lock into your clothes. 

When I left his house, I left a lot of my stuff over there because I didn't want to bring cockroaches from his place to mine. I didn't want my new place smelling like his house, and miraculously, my asthmatic bronchitis stopped.

I have told him to his face that his house is filthy, it stinks, and it's disgusting- but he will sit there and deny it. 

So he brings up the fact that I told him i cant stay with him to try to prove his point that I used him- and then he told me he was calling my brother to take me to the hospital to make sure he didn't say  verbatum that he wouldn't take me- and then told me I was a liar and ruined his relationship with my other brother because I lie to him about what the boys say to me to get what I want which pisses me off because I never did that. 

I told him I didnt ask my younger brother to take me because hes busy and exhausted all the time.

And as for what happened with my dad and my other brother? Let me set some things straight on that. 

My dad was so happy that I was going to school, that he told me that he would help me with rides to make sure I get through it. Because at the time, I had no car and I did not have a license. (Now I do.) 

Well he started coming up with excuses to not take me to school and my brother and his husband would have to do it. They would get mad- not at me- but at him because every time dad promises to do something he bails out like he always did since we were kids- and my brother always had to come to my rescue. They werent mad at me- they were getting annoyed with him. 

And I had a talk with him because he was saying taking me to school all the time was too much and he needed help and I expressed concerned because of the transportation issues and I mentioned how my older brother was getting annoyed about it but I didnt go into detail about exactly why because I didn't want to start problems. All I was trying to do was in a nice way without getting my dad to flip out, was tell him I needed him to help me with rides. 

But I did not in any way or form tell him that my brothers were being dicks or anything like that- but he took it like that and started flipping out on my brother on the phone and my brother told him to never talk to him again and hasnt talked to him again. But some how, all of that is my fault. He constantly blames me for his problems and tells me that I lie about stuff and I'm sick of it- 

I tell him stuff because it was the truth and when he tries to confront people and acts irrational, they would rather sit there and lie and not do anything or leave out vital information because they don't want to deal with him, so I am constantly being made out to be the liar. 

Ugh I just want to run away from my family sometimes and just disappear.

5lobwz,0,2017-01-02,About a friend... I am 22/m,duckintheeast,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5lobwz/about_a_friend_i_am_22m/,"I have realized that I have some strong feelings for one of my best girl friends. She is 21 turning 22 soon if that means anything to this post. I am also single.

So I have had these feelings really since the summer when I met her during an internship. At that time, we went on a couple dates and she cut it off because we never talked about being exclusive and she picked another guy over me. I was upset but not mad because we were never exclusive. We decided however to be friends and have gotten really close since then. Between then and now, there was about a one month time where we stopped talking because I needed to work through my feelings and get over her. At the time, I did. Since then though, my feelings are stronger than before. It wouldn't be this bad if she didn't give me the most confusing signals ever. We talk all the time and just got back from our holiday break where we didn't see each other for 2 weeks. When she found out we would be back to my school's city on the same day she demanded we go out for dinner and when I went to pick her up she jumped in my arms.  

During our break, she met a guy and told me that they were ""kind of but not exactly"" dating to quote her. I am good with her dating, but she does it a lot and most don't last long. 

We have been meaning to party together and so we decided we would go out together on New Year's day. When we were out we were pretty drunk and I got a little touchy (something sober me would have never done). It was nothing bad, just like grabbing her around the waste and scratching her back. However, later that night we were dancing and she started dancing on me. This is all stuff that bothers me now because I regret what was going because she has some interest in this other guy. She went home a bit early that night because she wasn't feeling well. This was the first time she had met my friends. When she got home she asked me what I was doing and if it was just with friends. 

This is all driving me insane and I have no idea what to do. I feel the best course of action is telling her, but I don't want create an awkward situation and have to choose anyone. We are also really close and I don't want to lose her friendship.  Any advice is welcome and I am willing to answer any questions that could help with the advice."

[Survival Island 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/5jqbpp/td_survival_island_a_new_total_drama_series/)

[Survival Island 2: Battle of the Sexes](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/5k16bv/td_survival_island_2_battle_of_the_sexes/)

Click [here](http://brantsteele.com/totaldrama/01/r.php?c=itgoTQKX) to skip the Intro/Character Bios, and go straight to the season.

After a (not so brief) hiatus, Survival Island is back with a new cast and a new twist! This season, each of the contestants will be playing with one of their rivals! This means that ex-roomates, divorcees, business rivals, and even siblings will be facing off against each other for the $100,000 grand prize!

In addition, there is another twist that will be present during this season. This season will feature one of the biggest rivalries from Season 2 of Survival Island: Lizzie and Cassi! These two enemies will also be playing for the grand prize.

Who are the other 20 contestants battling it out in a season full of drama, back stabs, and blindsides? Let's find out!

**Abraham and Ramsey**

*The Football Rivals*

Abraham (22) and Ramsey (21) are football players from rival colleges. The two have been rivals since their freshman year on the football team, and have no intention of working together on the Island. Although their physical strength may carry them far, will it be enough to win the game?

**Olive and Jasmine**

*The Ex-Best Friends*

Olive (19) and Jasmine (19) are ex-best friends from Massachusetts. Although Olive and Jasmine were inseparable in their youth, their differences in personalities have led them to abandon their friendship. Will Olive's sweet persona give her the win, or will Jasmine's fiery attitude bring home the grand prize? 

**Alvin and Carter**

*The Business Rivals*

Alvin (55) and Carter (61) are executives at rival business companies. Though they have never gotten along, will they be able to put aside their difference and work together to take down their opponents?

**Dana and Ross**

*The Estranged Father-Daughter Duo*

Ross (51) and Dana (22) are a father-daughter pair from New York. Although they were close when Dana was young, Ross's harsh rules ultimately drove Dana away, leading her to a ""punk"" lifestyle. Will the duo be able to mend their relationship, or will they lose their shot at $100,000?

**Andrew and Michaela**

*The Stepfather and Stepdaughter*

Andrew (41) is the new stepfather of Michaela (18). Although Andrew has tried to reach out to Michaela multiple times, Michaela is not interested in a new dad. Will Survival Island bring them closer together, or only tear them farther apart.

**Christian and Meghan**

*The Ex-Roommates*

Meghan (23) and Christian (24) are ex-roommates from Ohio. Christian's lazy and laid-back demeanor and Meghan's uptight attitude often clashed, leading to them finding new roommates. Will their conflicting personalities continue to clash, or will they be able to work together to make it to the end? 

**Jessica and Thomas**

*The Divorcees*

Jessica (33) is a beautiful, full-figured woman, and is the ex-wife of Thomas (34) a successful New York attorney. Although their marriage started off steady, their constant adultery and continued fights have led to their inevitable divorce. Although they haven't spoken in years, will they be able to get past their differences and win the money?

**Dominic and Gene**

*The Bully and the Nerd*

Dominic (20) and Gene (19) are your classic example of a high school conflict. Though Dominic and Gene have both left high school and moved on to their own paths, they still haven't been able move past their strained relationship. Will they be able to bury the hatchet and win the grand prize?

**Kayla and Kaylee**

*The Control-Freak and The Free Spirit*

Kaylee (28) and Kayla (28) are two twins who couldn't be any more different. Kaylee is a recent law school graduate looking for internships at some of the most prestigious internships in the country, while Kayla is a freelance musician and artist looking to get discovered. Will their conflicting personalities bring out the best in them, or the worst?

**Tina and Jake**

*The Rich Siblings*

Tina (27) and Jake (25) are siblings and members of the financially elite. Though they are siblings, they are still bitter enemies, both vying for the inheritance of their parents. Their parents sent them to Survival Island as a sort of ""bonding exercise"", but will they be able to actually bond, or will they end up worse off than they started?

5lotwj,18,2017-01-02,"[25 F4A] Sorta like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, except sex-themed! Oh, and it takes place in a regular old office.",KellyMcSizequeen,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5lotwj/25_f4a_sorta_like_dungeons_dragons_except/,"Fun fact: When I first learned about D&amp;D, I mistakenly thought that RPG stood for ""Roll Playing Game"" which is why they needed so many dice. For rolling!

Regardless, I've recently learned a little more about D&amp;D (never played, though, so I'm still pretty uninformed) and thought it would be fun to turn it into a sex adventure! I've posted before about my interests in world-building, and thought this might be a good setup.

I'm not entirely sure that the actual stories (interactions between characters) need to be dice-based, but it might be fun if we introduced some dice-related randomness to our character creation process. I thought it might be fun to use the headquarters of some small company as the backdrop for our adventures. Only 10-20 employees, all in their 20s or 30s.

My proposal: we create names and personalities for all of the characters who work at the company. Once we have a set that we like, we start assigning their sexual characteristics randomly (penis size, breast size, sexual appetite, sexual competency, anything you want!) and then we can either pick our favorite characters to RP or the two of us can collectively control all of the characters and see how the story unfolds.

Just to warn you, I'm fairly geeky. Maybe not when it comes to D&amp;D, but definitely comes to math. I want a realistic distribution rather than just giving every guy a big cock (or even worse, giving our favorite guy a massive cock and the other characters small ones). I'm still trying to figure out the rules, but here are a few examples.

------------------------

Penis length: Roll 4 dice. Throw out the two lowest dice, and keep the two highest dice. Add them together, subtract 2, this is your penis length in inches.

Penis girth: Roll 2 dice. Add them together, divide by 2, add 2, this is your penis circumference in inches.

Penis length (flaccid): Roll 1 die. This is your flaccid penis length. (NOTE it's possible to have a shrinker if your flaccid penis is longer than your erect length! Be prepared to explore how that might affect sexual encounters!)

Breast size: Roll 2 dice. [2,3,4] = A cup, [5,6] = B cup, [7,8] = C cup, [9,10] D cup, [11,12] DD cup

Breast appearance: Roll 1 die. [1] = -2, [2] = -1, [3, 4] = 0, [5] = +1, [6] = +2. This is how many cup sizes bigger your breasts look in your work attire. Negative is smaller, and the minimum cup size is A. 

Breast firmness: Roll 1 die. [1] = floppy, [2, 3, 4] = normal, [5] = perky, [6] = so full and round that they look fake despite being real.

Breast Examples:

* Size roll = 9, Appearance roll = 1 --&gt; Size = D, Appearance = -2, so her Ds will look like Bs when she's dressed for work.

* Size roll = 5, Appearance roll = 1 --&gt; Size = B, Appearance = -2, her As will look like As because your cup size can't drop below A.
* Size roll = 7, Appearance roll = 6 --&gt; Size = C, Appearance = +2,
her Cs will look like DDs.

Butt size/firmness: Roll 1 die. [1] = Ironing board, [2,3] = Normal, [4,5] = Shapely and attractive, [6] = Nicki Minaj.

Sexual experience: Roll 1 die. (Spectrum) 1 is a virgin &lt;--&gt; 6 was probably in a fraternity/sorority.

Sexual skill: Roll 1 die. (Spectrum) 1 is a virgin &lt;--&gt; 6 should be writing a sex advice column.

Sexual appetite: Roll 1 die. [1] = Monthly, [2,3] = Weekly, [4,5,6] = Daily. This is how often the character wants (needs?) sex.

-----------------------------

Obviously, I'm still trying to figure this out. We don't need to do include all of these measurements and I'm certainly open to adding other traits/measurements. But first things first! Let's come up with our theoretical company and the people who work there. Once we come up with their office backstories, we can start discovering their sexual side and figure out how they all interact!

Character backstories don't need to be too intense. For example:

* [Lianna](http://i.imgur.com/rTWEjh6.jpg) is in charge of product design. She's always been an overachiever and joined the company immediately after graduating from a prestigious university.

* [Joel](http://i.imgur.com/Vuo7Wna.jpg) does all of the coding. He's likable and competent, but has a tendency to show up late or take long lunch breaks. 

* [Ali](http://i.imgur.com/ySv6cwj.jpg) is a sophomore at the local college and is working part-time as a marketing intern to earn credits for her business degree. She's not afraid to work hard for what she wants... it's just that she's never actually needed to work hard before because everybody is so enamored/intimidated by her!"

5lr0mw,1,2017-01-03,Refreshing skills after long employment gap,SurfStarSkipper,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/5lr0mw/refreshing_skills_after_long_employment_gap/,"I have a BS in CS from 16 years ago. I did an internship and co-authored a paper in an academic journal and was on a pretty solid track. Then I married a soldier and put my career on hold while we went through multiple overseas moves and deployments, had some children, etc. 

Now he's retired from the military with a more stable job and the time is coming for me to dust off the resume and rejoin the workforce. Over the years, I have volunteered to run a few small websites, and occasionally worked through some Project Euler exercises for fun. Logic and algorithms always came naturally to me and I remember quite a bit, but I know I'm rusty and out-of-date. 

I was planning on a timeline of 2-3 years (flexible) and we live near Seattle. I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for what I should focus on as I start to refresh my skills and make myself marketable. Is an old CS degree worth anything? Do I need to disclose when I got it?  Would it help if I went back to school? Bootcamp? Concentrate on developing a portfolio and working on open source projects? I'd love to hear your ideas. Thank you."
5lsbbo,5,2017-01-03,RE: 'Is this sub dead now' &amp; What Happened to the Project?,LuckRoar,EclipseSix,https://www.reddit.com/r/EclipseSix/comments/5lsbbo/re_is_this_sub_dead_now_what_happened_to_the/,"Hey readers,

I just wanted to let you know what happened to E6; why is the sub inactive? What happened to the Facebook page? First of all, I'm sorry for this message taking this long to find you.

This entire project began during an internship for the anime media platform GoBoiano (henceforth referred to as 'GB'). GB was searching for unpaid interns to learn from them, gain experience. It wasn't a problem if you were somewhere across the globe, as the internship would be via the internet, so a great opportunity there! After a sollicitation process myself and twenty-something others were picked out, and joined several teams. There were people assigned to social media, people assigned to video editing, and people assigned to writing articles for GoBoiano.com. I was one of the latter, writing Buzzfeed-style articles, but also writing anime analyses. I eventually pitched my idea for a community-made anime project to GB, and they loved the idea. I got to work immediately, writing the articles you've read and compiling ideas upon ideas in a giant document we called the 'proof of concept'. This was around August, the month I was on holiday with family. But I loved this project and I worked throughout my summer break to deliver the proof of concept to the CEO. Hadn't heard anything from him for a while, then a 'sorry, I'll read it this weekend', after pushing some more another 'I'll read it next week, just been busy' and eventually it was September, the so called end of the internship, and I hadn't heard anything from him. So I decided to put E6 on hiatus until he approached me with his opinion on the proof of concept. This entire thing was a GB project, so funding for the anime and development would all go through them instead of the online fundraising a lot of you suggested. But that would of course only be the case if GB had faith in the project. And I suppose we'll never know whether or not GB had faith in the project. I believe that up until this day, they haven't even opened up the proof of concept's document. E6 is one of the victims of a severe lack of communication from the GB staff's side during this internship. I don't hold any grudges towards the GB staff for this lack of communication. I'm just sad the internship had to end like it did, without any official announcement from the staff, with the radio silence speaking for them like 'you can quietly disappear now as if this internship has never happened'. It's unfortunate, but it happened. I'm glad this internship has resulted in me getting to know other interns and making friends in America, Australia, the Philippines and the UK, which is awesome for a Dutch media-student like myself.

So from here on.. What do we do? Do you have any suggestions, now that you know the E6 team's side of the story? I'd like to make the proof of concept publicly available for all of you. I'll sticky it to the frontpage of the subreddit once this message goes live. Continuing this project without GB would be an enormous challenge, but if you still want to see Yumi come to live after all this time, I think we should give it a chance.

I am 6'2, 185 pounds, I am a runner who also does weightlifting.
You like to dress business slutty. Tight dress, high heels, dressed shirts that highlight your assets.

From day 1, you noticed that man, the director of the department, me. You also saw me looking at you a few times, in the elevator, or while you passed by my office. You love the attention, you would like to get that powerful, married man for you.

Through the first few weeks of your internship, you had to produce some reports for me, or complete ad-hoc request. Each time, you would come to my desk, touch my arm, lean towards me to show your cleavage, tease me. Often, you would go straight to the restroom right after and masturbate.

Now today I asked you for a tedious ad-hoc request that you just completed. Earlier that day, you came by my office a few times and I've never been so obvious about watching you.

It's late, 8pm, and the whole office is empty except us two. You're extremely horny and you want to see if this can get further. What do you do?"

So how is your timeline?,ilovecollege_nope,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5lsxwm/fi_is_as_much_about_time_as_it_is_about/,"Hey guys. There are a few critical points in our lives that lead us to the FIRE path and I think it would be cool to know how long people have been and plan to be in the FIRE path.

For me, it was:



Action | Year | Age | Networth (R$)
---|---|---|---
Disney trip with my parents [we are from Brazil, trip was expensive so they had to save for some years to be able to go, introduced me to the idea of saving money to reach a goal] | 2004 | 12 | 0.00
Richer uncle gave me Rich Dad, Poor Dad to read when I was spending a summer in his house | 2007 | 15 | 0.00
Received R$1000 as gift from grandma, didn't want anything so decided to invest in Petrobras stocks (in their high, sold for R$250 some years after) | 2007 | 16 | 1,000.00
Started college, Mechanical Engineering | 2009 | 17 | 1,000.00
Changed to Industrial Engineering and started tracking net-worth (from birthday money, side incomes, etc) | 2011 | 19 | 520.00
Started an internship, getting paid and tracking my (reduced) expenses | 2015 | 23 | 13,000.00
Graduated college, got job offer for full time employment | 2016 | 25 | 23,400.00
Started full time | Actually tomorrow 01/04/2017 | 25 | 23,400.00
FI target date | 2036 | 44 | 1,500,000.00 

**So how is your timeline? Would love to compare starting age, year, net-worth, how long it took to reach the point you're now...**

Basically:

* At what age did you start saving and what year was that?

* How old are you now?

* How old will you be when you FIRE and what year will that be?

Be as detailed as you want!"
5lszql,60,2017-01-03,[MF] Making a new friend in Hong Kong,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/5lszql/mf_making_a_new_friend_in_hong_kong/,"I really hate traveling to China most of the time. The flights are too long, and I don't usually enjoy the food. I tend to enjoy the experience of being in a minority, and the looks I get being an over six-foot-tall white guy walking through the city, and especially the groups of girls who shyly want to try out their English with me, but a few novelties don't make up for being jet-lagged and hungry the entire time. But at the end of the last trip I was lucky enough to have a much better night than usual in Hong Kong. 

For the fist part of the night, this definitely wasn't the case. I was there with some colleagues in Wan Chai, which, as my local friend explained to me, was the Dirty Old Man district. Ladyboys wandering the streets, strip clubs on the sides, and lots of bars with guys way past their prime who didn't mind trading cash for attention. I was at a bar with a live cover band, which I really can't stand, either, watching a young Filipina using some Newt Gringrich-looking guy like a stripper pole while a very wrong rendition of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" skullfucked the room. Yeah, I was in hell. So I was really glad to see my phone light up in WhatsApp when my local friend got off work. I happily bade my colleagues good night and walked around to the hotel where she was waiting for me.

We'll call her Wilma, but she isn't really the star of the story. She had rented a room from me when I lived in Los Angeles whiel doing an internship. There was definitely some chemistry between us, and we did wind up playing around a bit, but never really having sex; the timing was just wrong - I was in a closed relationship then, and now she was in a serious relationship, although she did do some submission to others withher boyfriend's permission. So, we definitely knew each other's proclivities, even if we didn't partake.

She greeted me with a hug, and we walked to the metro. I told her what she saved me from, and she cringed on my behalf. As we took the Metro to the Central district, she laughed at how much taller i was than everyone else. Yeah I know. We got there and walked to her apartment, which was a very typical Hong Kong apartment in that it was a testiment to minimalist efficiency. After a few minutes, we took a bottle of wine from the firdge walked up the last few stairs to the rooftop, where a few other people in the building were. 

It was actually a gorgeous night and we could see out over the city. Wilma's apartment building was 25 stories, so we had a nice view out. As we talked about life, we drifted into the topic of D/s and submission, which was nromal fare for us, and I saw a couple of the other people on the roof cast their eyes over at us in a bit of shock. 

After a few minutes they walked over and introduced themselves. They were all Australian, a married couple and a single woman, who of course caught my eye. Her name was Elise, and she was fairly tall, maybe 5'11', with long dyed red hair, wearing a wraparound top that showed off her extremely generous cleavage. While I'm not normally someone that obssesses over such things, she clearly was proud of breasts and knew how to work them, and liked being noticed. 
The confidence wore very well on her, and I was happy to give her the attention as we all chatted for another hour or so. As it turned out, they all lived in the building, so we were happy to enjoy the night together and letting the conversation run into all sorts of purple topics. I'm sure that there were all sorts of hints being dropped that Elise was interested, but I was my usual oblivious. Wilma, thankfully, was more on the ball than I was.

When we got back to the topic of spanking, which was always Wilma's favorite, it got to the right tools for the job. Since I had spanked Wilma in the past, she was able to attest to some of the things I had done in the past. Elise pointedly asked if we were a couple, which Wilma happily said we weren't. I smiled a bit at that and she caught my look. ""But TheWanderingPro here is really at his best with those big hands of his."" God bless her for being a great wingman. 

Elise lit up at that. ""let me see!"" I held my hand up against Wilma's, and her small, Asian hand almost vanished against mine. Elise roller her eyes. ""No, hold it against my hand."" Given her height, I couldn't quite so easily dominate her in size, but my fingers easily extended a knuckle past hers. But I looked and caught the twinkle in her eye as we were touching. Wilma helpfully emptied the wine bottle into her glass. 

""Hey, TheWanderingPro, do you want some more to drink? I need to run down and get some.""  Before I could answer, she was off the roof. I owe her for this.

And suddenly there I was with Elise, still holding her hand (why had we not let go?) around another couple kissing. We looked at each other a moment, and then I pulled her against me, and she turned her head up as I kissed her. Her lips parted immediately and my tongue slid past, caressing hers as i felt a surge of blood below and her body pressed against mine. I don't know how long we kissed, but by the time we stopped our pulses were racing and we could barely breathe. ""Your friend is taking a long time with the wine."" she breathed.

""That's what makes her a good friend."" I smiled against her lips. ""Want me to tell her to forget the wine?"" She nodded. I pulled out my phone and texted Wilma. I just got a smiley back and a reminder to be safe.

""let's go to your apartment."" I said. Elise practically dragged me off the roof and down the stairs. As we waited on the elevator, we kept making out, my hand sneaking under her top, caressing her breasts through the lace of her bra. The elevator arrived, and we fell into it and she stabbed the button for the 11th floor. The entire ride down was hands, lips, and furtive carresses as we rode down to her floor. The elevator stopped roughly shaking a little sense into us. We walked around the corner to her apartment. 

Elise got assertive at the door. ""Shoes off. Don't want any dirt on my carpet."" I obeyed, then pushed her back against the door, kissing her furiously as I lifted her top. Her arms went over her head, and a black lacy bra was revealed, barely holding her enormous chest in place. Her breasts felt amazingly soft through the bra as her hands worked the buttons on my shirt. I dropped my arms as she pushed it off my shoudlers and i finally felt her mostly-bare chest against mine. I started ksising down her neck which elicited a lot of moans while I worked her jeans open, and pushed them down, stripping her down to her white cotton panties. I went to rub her through them, and was soon rewarded with wet fabric. Her eyes were wild, as she grabbed at my belt. 

""Take these off"" she said. I stepped back, and pushed my pants and underwear off, taking my socks with them. I was naked in front of her as she worked her panties off, and then she knelt in front of me, eagerly taking my throbbing erection in her mouth. I could feel every bit of her energy coming through in the furious motions of her mouth and hand on me. I pulled her hair back as she worked up and down on my shaft. I happily let her work on my for a few minutes, groaning, telling her how amayzing her mouth was on me. Suddenly I pulled her off by her hair and turned her face up to kiss me, tasting my cock in her mouth, one of my favorite little pleasures in life. I then pulled her off her knees onto the bed, and directed her onto her back. As I slid down to return the oral favor, I found a small ring greeting me. This was my first pierced clitoral hood, so I took a moment to consider my options, then softly licked her from her opening upward, lifting the rung out of the way and letting the flat of my tongue slide across her clit. Her hups surged up into my mouth and her hand grabbed my head and pushed it into her. Takign that as approval, I repeated the motion again and again, and she began to moan, but now ever more audibly, surely loud enough for the neighbors to hear. I turned my head to let me work a finger inside, and I could feel the amazing texture inside her body. I was hooked.

She spoke in a breathy moan. ""Put on a condom and fuck me."" God I love instructions sometimes! I looked up as she dug the condom out of her nightstand and passed it down. I rolled it on and positioned myself over her. She pulled me down to kiss her, and taste herself, the rough fabric of her bra on my chest as I guided myself inside. Her legs wrapped tightly around me and pulled me in deeper as I felt her stretch around. ""Oh my God you feel so big!"" She knew how to flatter a man! I started working myself in and out, and she pushed against me, willing me to go faster. I pulled out, and she protested in shock. ""Roll over."" The coin dropped and she got on all fours, positioning her hips high and grabbing the pillow in front of her. I gave her a sharp spank across her offered ass and she yelped, sticking it out farther. I guided myself back inside, then took her hip bones in my hand and began pushing her hard up and down. ""ohhhhh yyyyyeaaaaaaahhh"" she stuttered with each impact. I worked harder, trying to drive through her body each time. I felt her fingers at the base of my cock, rubbing herself as I wokred furiously away at her. Suddenly her body clenched, hard, and she went silent, her breath stuck in her chest as the orgasm erupted across her body. The moment hung, suspended in time until suddenly her muscles gave out and she went limp under me. I resume my own motions, and she moaned incoherently, all circuits fried. Her helplessness to my motions was the magic I needed, and i planted myself deep inside her as I filled the condom. 

I pulled out and slumped in bed beside her. She curled up under my arm. ""mmmmm....that was amaaaaazing."" 

""Yes...it...was."" 

""YOu're not going to sleep are you?"" she asked pointedly.

""Not now."" I answered.

""Good, because I'm going to make the most of you."" she purred...

5lt18j,249,2017-01-03,A Momentum feature wouldn't be that hard to implement (from a computer programmer's POV),MakyMaestro,FIFA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/5lt18j/a_momentum_feature_wouldnt_be_that_hard_to/,"FIRST OF ALL, I am no expert in programming. I just graduated from college with a couple internships under my belt, that's it. This is just an opinion, mainly to respond to all the people saying that a feature so ""complex"" as Momentum would be WAY TOO HARD for EA to code, when it's not. And yes, I will try to simplify the language as much as I can, cause it reality its much more detailed than the way I will explain it, but still relatively simple for someone who knows how to program properly.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

One thing my teachers emphasized during their lectures is ""Re-use your code as much as possible"", especially when you need to perform the same operations more than once in your program.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, if EA came to me and gave me a copy of FIFA and gave me a briefing of every feature in the game (with a summary of the game-code as well) and asked me to program a ""Momentum-like"" feature for online, I wouldn't think twice: Recycle the code for OFFLINE SLIDERS.


I mean, the code is already there. The principle is the same. Decrease and/or Increase in:

- Pace

- Pass speed/accuracy

- Shot speed/accuracy

- Marking

- Ball Control

- Goalkeeper skills (there is a slider for that too)


So for a programmer it would be dumb to re-code something from scratch when you already have functions who basically work the same way.


Now all I'd need to do from there is sit down with the game designers and find ways to nest the slider's code into a set of coherent conditions that would trigger these functions. quick example: 

IF home.possession &gt; 65; 

DO 

home.passAccuracy -= 5;

away.shotAccuracy += 5.

home.keeperSkill -= 5;


(in programming, the += operation means to take the old value and add the value after the sign to it, so home.passAccuracy -= 5 basically; means home.passAccuracy = home.passAccuracy - 5;)

&amp;nbsp;

Someone already posted something where they realized that tweaking with sliders made the game feel like as if momentum/handicap kicked in.

&amp;nbsp;

In summary, as a programmer myself, IF I was to program momentum/handicap, that's how I'd do it, re-usable code.


But then again, it's just me.

5ltap0,1,2017-01-03,I hate my life because hardcore porn is so much more rewarding,gallagher222,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5ltap0/i_hate_my_life_because_hardcore_porn_is_so_much/,"But if I had known that my love for hardcore porn would make the rest of my life feel downright unpleasant, mean and shameful, I wouldn't have fallen in love with it, or rather, fallen in lust with it. 

Porn is a mental model of mine. Its an idea that I've sculpted for myself out of viewing probably like 20 000 hours of porn in my life (that's just a guess). Its a very comfortable model. I just snuggle into it and I feel like my spirit dances and sings and celebrates itself. 

But then I come into contact with other mental models and its not a fun time for me at all. My spirit basically cuts its own head off. And the worst part is, I used to function well with these sorts of models, but now I have such an intense hatred for them. I start an internship tomorrow with white collar business professionals and I know I'm going to have mental models thrown at me that I'm going to really hate and want to reject. Its not that there's anything wrong with these ideas on their own...but my deep obsession with pornography has made me totally unadaptive to them. 

Why change for the world when porn is so much fun? That's basically my dillemma. I know I have to change, and I have been changing by watching way less porn and jacking off way less than normal. I don't know how I got so addicted in the first place...I guess porn was just too rewarding to reject, y'know? 

My real life was a rewarding thing before porn. But porn trumped it in terms of how happy it could make me, so I gravitated into a porn world and abandoned all the other worlds that I lived in. Now when I have to go back to these worlds, I just feel guilty and ashamed of myself, because they are not my home anymore. I shouldn't be there. I'm a trespasser! 

That's basically what porn has done to me. It made me forget about my whole life and just be a masturbating nymphomaniac. And once I made that transition, I became a really dysfunctional person with not nearly enough interest in my surroundings to achieve much of anything. High-achievers are those who accept their surroundings, and trust them to be rewarding. I don't have that trust, because porn has rocked my world. 

Disengaging for the last 9 months has helped...but I'm still not a happy person generally. I guess I need more responsibilities to keep me focused and not always pining after all the pornography I could be watching. 

Nymphomania really closes a lot of doors in life. It makes consistent self-esteem hard.

My mentally ill mother emotionally abused me for years and I even developed depression as a result. I tried to commit suicide three times and was on anti psychotics and anti depressants for 3 years till 2015. My elder sister was the one who intervened and got my mother treatment. My dad did nothing to stop the abuse. Not only that, but I was homeschooled when I was 5 and the teacher would sexually abuse me. My mother was in the next room and she didn't even bother to check even once. When I finally got the courage to tell my parents, they just fired the teacher and sent me to school. No police report, nothing.

My dad has always been unsupportive and unreliable. He promised to hire me as an intern in his company. He lied, when I asked him about the internship, he brushed it off, never speaking of it ever again. He has never supported me in anything, never tells me that he loves me and lies to me constantly. He is also a hypocrite and loves shoving his religious beliefs down everyone's throats, irrespective of that person's religious beliefs. If I ever ask for his help, he just laughs at me, says he'll help me and never does. When I point that out, he says that he has done so much for me. Which is just bullshit. He is one of the reasons why I trust no one in this world and have difficulty forming other relationships. Whenever I accuse him of lying, he just screams at me to quiet me. Later, he'll ask me whether I actually think he is a liar, and when I say yes, he brushes it off and says: ""You're angry thats why you are saying that, you could never think like that.""

I have been working my ass off in school and am a straight A student. I want to go to college and get my degree so that I can moveout when I'm older, be independent and never have to contact my dad again. So today, my dad announces that he has raised the money for and is buying a new house. He then mentions college to me and says that I must get a scholarship and work to pay for my degree since he has to now spend his salary on himself. I reminded him that 100% scholarships are quite rare at undergrad level. He just tells me to not go to college then. Now it isn't that my dad hasn't got money. He does, but he'd rather spend it on a new house and himself rather than my education. Moreover, he expects me to pay him once I am employed as well. I ain't paying him shit.

This is very very depressing. It was basically a goal of mine to end up in a good university, which my dad has ruined. I am not eligible for loans. Nor will I be for financial aid since my dad owns quite a lot of money. My only hope is scholarship, which I doubt I'll be able to receive, especially 100%. My mom has always been on my dad's side also.

I honestly don't know what to do, I have lost the motivation to work hard and just dont want to study at all. What is even the point if I am not going to college after high school?

A combination of these factors and a few others have les me to believe thaf my dad is a egotistic, selfish cunt, who never cared about me in the first place.

Oh, and he is super religious, and loves shoving religion down my throat, which I couldn't care less about.

tl;dr I hate my dad who is a selfish, unsupportive cunt. He never reported the guy who sexually assaulted me as a child. He couldn't care less about my education either. "

I've been a long time lurker and I've never posted. I've read all of your posts, shared tears and smiles with things that I identify with. It makes me feel both sad and happy to know I'm not alone. I've been depressed since I could remember. I used to be a happy and positive little girl until the first time I was bullied. Since, I've been bullied and made to feel like shit from so many people in my life. My low self-esteem began maybe when I was 6? I've been struggling with life since. I'm 25 and I haven't finished my degree. Why? Because I can't make myself do the work. I get motivated for the first month and say this year will be different and I fucking fall into depression again and I can't get out. I fear falling behind and when I do I fucking give up. I will get my degree this spring (finally). I've had to get academic withdrawals because of my depression. I feel like a failure while all the people I know are flourishing. My life needs to change.

I told my mom today that I want to make an appointment with a psychiatrist so I can get meds. I've depressed my entire life...and I've tried to deal with it but my life is shit and I know something needs to change. I called and made an appointment and I'm fucking scared. I don't want to talk to someone who will be internally judging my fucked up decisions and life. 

Then my mom has been acting bummed and I asked why. She said she doesn't understand. Her and my dad have given me all they could and it doesn't make sense why I'm sad. She's now sad and blaming herself. I've tried to tell them it's not their fault and they don't get it. I can't talk to them. 

I can't talk to my boyfriend. We've been together for seven years. We met in college and I was better with my depression and actually socialized. But the years carried on and he graduated and we've been long distance since. I lost my friends because they betrayed me or just found me so boring. My best friend stopped talking to me when I got a senator internship over her congressman one. She just stared at me when I told her and neither she or her family congratulated me. She stopped talking to me since then. That was three years ago. She was my last friend. Sine then, I don't hang out with anyone, except my boyfriend when he visits. We've been long distance for the last five years but after my best friend left me, I've been so alone. 

My boyfriend is the opposite of me. In college and after, he's that guy everyone loves. He can make friends with a freaking tree. He attracts people and he has many friends and is social. I'm the complete opposite. He has to beg to get me to come out with him and his friends, and if I do i always have to drink. It's the only way I can talk and not just sit their silent. He's seen me when I'm so depressed that I can't even get out of bed. The last year has been horrible for me. I've spent weeks just in bed... and I can tell he's getting tired of it. 

He keeps saying I bring up the past and the pain I've endured and I can't let things go. I want to I just don't know how. I don't trust people and I don't know how to carry on conversations anymore. I feel resentful he's so social and well liked. When I'm alone watching TV like any other fucking day, he's out and having fun. I want to but I can't. 

For New Years Eve, I saw he was with people (mostly girls) and I texted him saying ""are you spending new years with girls??"" He just said. ""not one, there are some here but I'm not with them."" I told him to ""well have fun."" He didn't call to say HNY or hasn't talked to me since. 

The past four days I had another depressive ""bender."" I just cried, slept, and stared at my ceiling. I couldn't even watch tv. I just go some motivation to do some shit. 

I'm hoping seeing the psychiatrist will help and I can get ADD and Anti-Depressants. Shit needs to change. 

I've just been writing down my thoughts. Sorrry this is so long. This is just 10% of what I wish I could say but I don't want to write a freaking 100 page essay.

I'm currently seeking an entry level job in digital marketing. I graduated from college with a 3.0 in business management and a focus in marketing, as well as two different marketing internships and a few marketing roles in university clubs. I have some experience in HTML5 and CSS3, intermediate level understanding of Search Engine Optimization, and experience in Facebook Advertising and Google AdWords. I've also written some (incomplete) books over the past couple years, so I'm a fairly strong writer. 

I'm currently trying to learn advanced techniques on how to use Excel- I'm reading books about how to leverage Excel for market analysis and basic data science techniques, and I'm taking some online courses for it as well (pivot tables, conditional formatting, vlookups, etc.). I was wondering if you believe this is where I should currently be focusing my attention?

I'm highly interested in getting involved in data science in the future (maybe in 3-4 years after I've gained enough knowledge in that area). Should I be focused on learning Excel, SQL and web analytics to move myself in that direction? Or should I be learning things like JavaScript, JQuery, Photoshop, advanced SEO/SEM techniques, etc. in order to turn myself into a more hire-able candidate for general digital marketing roles? I am searching for an entry-level job after all, so I need to be willing to take any role available. 

Any advice about what hiring managers might want is much appreciated. Also, if you know of anyone hiring, I would love to hear about it ;) Thanks everybody!"

I'm starting with a local B4 this July, and I'm in the middle of filling out my new hire information form. The form asks for my industry preferences.

During my internship, I worked extensively with some of my firm's government clients. I enjoyed the experience, and definitely got along well with my manager and seniors. My manager asked me at the end of my summer internship if I'd like to work with her and the rest of the team upon starting FT and of course I said yes.

Do exit opportunities from public accounting differ significantly for auditors who work on extensively on government clients? Are you likely to be pigeonholed to working for the government upon leaving public accounting? After taking advanced accounting this semester, I've learned that governmental and fund accounting are quite unique, and I would hate to limit future job opportunities in other industries, as I don't see myself working in government down the line.

I'd really appreciate any insight!

When they all came on, we were a cohesive unit, and we'd all get lunch together every day, talk about our days every morning, and sometimes even hang out on the weekends.

Around June, I started noticing the three of my (five) coworkers would go out to lunch together without me, but I ignored it because I had just gotten diagnosed with a non-cancerous brain tumor and figured they might just have assumed I brought my own lunch. My birthday passed in June and no one even asked to go out for my birthday and none of them acknowledged it. Meanwhile, for any of my other coworkers' birthdays, they always go out to lunch and then have cake.

Throughout the rest of the summer, they'd have happy hours every Friday during work hours, and sit around and drink while I'd work and then go out to bars after. They never invited me.

In August, one of my coworkers had a wedding. I wasn't invited. Everyone else in my entire office of 80 was invited, including the temporary interns. He was the coworker I was closest with.

In September, I had a seizure at work. Since I hadn't taken a lunch break and it was a Friday and the two people above me had already left, I told everyone under me I was going home early since I didn't feel well. They ratted me out and called the big boss and told him I left early and I was told to come back immediately. I defriended them all on Facebook since we were obviously not remotely friends anymore. No one asked me about my health when I came back the next day.

In November, I got offered a new job. I put in my two weeks notice--and then the job fell threw that following Monday. Everyone asked me ""So when are you leaving?"" and ""Good riddance"" after they had heard. When I told them it fell through, they made jokes about how this is as far as I'll ever go in my career.

Since then, they've all refused to say hello to me in the morning even though I say hello and ask them how they're doing. They refuse to say goodbye to me when I leave. They refuse to talk to me at all. During our Christmas decorating contest, they didn't even let me get involved. And today, they had a meeting about ""the future of the department"" and just so happened to forget to invite me. They also all decided to get a special training I've been BEGGING for the entire time I've been here, and just decided not to let me in on the bulk del.

Not a single person even said a single word to me today in my entire department.

It's really hurting my ability to do my job since I commute 2 hours each way just to have everyone treat me like shit all day long. My morale is shot, and even my big boss noticed it during my review and didn't give me a raise because I don't ""build good relationships with coworkers."" I needed that raise to move out of an apartment with a cockroach infestation. I'm also third in command where I work, and when the two people above me leave, people just straight up refuse to send me their work for me to approve which reflects poorly on me.

TL;DR Coworkers are excluding me from everything and refuse to even acknowledge my existence. It's making me feel like shit."

I mean, it's the largest law firm in the city. And with that territory, comes a flurry of interns, both law students and undergrads. Some are preppy frat boys whose daddies are old buddies of the senior partners. Some are college girls with tight, sexy bodies, but you can’t seem to get past their shrill laughter.

So lots slip in between the cracks. And for awhile, I did, too. But one day, a fellow partner made a crack to you. He mentioned how stressed he was, and made a crude reference to a few things he wanted a certain intern to do. Apparently she arranged a few things for a trial, and she was surprisingly competent, a rarity, even in this prestigious office.

And umf. Her body. But it was something else that drove his mind over the edge and into the gutter.

""She's the one with the lipstick,"" he mentions.

It's late one night, and it feels like all the partners are heading into trials or big negotiations. All of the interns are required to work — whether it be fetching coffee or redacting credit card numbers in trial notebooks.

You saunter into the break room to grab a fresh cup of coffee. You open the door softly, and I’m the only person in the room. Your eyes land directly on my ass. Curvy, and accented by a pencil skirt. My waist is narrow, and I can’t seem to reach the plate from the top shelf, even in my heels. My long dark hair is curled bouncing as I stretch. With an exhale of frustration I turn around, and you see a young intern, probably 21, with bright green eyes that widen as I notice you. I'm short, only five three, with high cheekbones and striking dark hair.

And then you notice the lipstick.

Happy New Year! :D

So the title is pretty much the tl;dr, but here's my sitch~ ! (I'm sorry I just scrolled up to apologize for the length of this post and I'm not done writing yet, oops)

I'm currently a 3rd year mechanical engineering student at one of the top 10 schools in the nation to do so. Do I love it? Not exactly, I don't really live for the equations and things like ""an advanced study mechanical vibrations"" don't exactly get me going. Regardless, I'm wrapping up and am totally decided in finishing this degree. To leave from my particular school with an ME just holds so much value that, if nothing else, being able to have it in my back pocket going through the rest of my life was important to me. I'm expecting to leave here with something around a 3.0 GPA. Not the greatest, I'm definitely going to try and get every point I can, but that's my realistic projection. 

Equally important to me; however, was that I could go on to become one of the best Industrial Designers ever (cue evil laughter). I am certified in SolidWorks, and have been filling journals with my designs since I was in about 5th grade. And for me, it just ""made sense"" that if I wanted to produce designs that were holistic in nature, that I should receive a complete education in engineering. Leaving here, I will have an understanding of mechanics, materials science, etc. that is beyond any field of comparison to (most) any ID student, and probably a lot of people in industry, too.

Last summer (the summer of my sophomore year) I landed an internship at a startup in San Francisco. I had an incredible time there, and as a person who has lived in many countries all around the world, I found a place that really felt like home. Everything about the culture clicked, the people were fantastic, and I found a place where I fit in. Great stuff. I was invited to return to this internship for a second summer before I had even finished working there, and even last week had companies that I'd networked with asking if I'd be interested in interning with them (presumably/hopefully with implications of work after college).

So, here comes the start of my hold ups.

-&gt; I really want to stay as close to (in) the Bay Area when pursuing Industrial Design. And I guess as a precursor to this statement, I don't want to let go of pursuing that major (is that naive of me?) The further I get into my mechanical education, the more I feel that an ID education would be more personally fulfilling. I'm aware that, especially as far as start ups go, I could probably or at least eventually land a job where my work is heavily focused on design. But I do want to experience an education where I am in a classroom and every day ""the light goes off,"" and I'm inspired and motivated and compelled and driven to do work from within; not just trying to make myself understand formulae that span multiple lines and multiple alphabets haha. I feel like I owe it to myself, and in the ""grand scheme of life,"" another couple years when I'm only 21 to be able to formally call myself both a Mechanical Engineer and an Industrial Designer could open up awesome opportunities for me-- maybe even startups of my own sooner than I'd think.

---&gt; Staying in the Bay Area means that there are /no/ accredited Industrial Design schools that offer a Master's program. In my research, I've seen that some universities (like Auburn, for example) offer a Master's program in ID where those matriculating from holding another degree can complete a certain amount of credit hours in the BS program to give them the skills they need to move on to the MS program. I'm very attracted to this idea because I don't know if spending four years and gaining another BS degree is ""worth it""? I'm going to draft an email to the department heads at SJSU after this post, but would it be plausible/possible that a university could tailor an MS ID program for me, given my Mechanical Engineering background?

-----&gt; To continue that thought, would it be worth it for me to even consider receiving a second BS degree? Would some of the credits I've received in my education thus far (humanities requirements, countless STEM classes), possibly accelerate this BS degree? What would financial aid opportunities look like for me? As a college graduate, would I be competitive as a Mechanical Engineer with a ~3.0 GPA from a leading university, and would my work experience be relevant? Would they even care about my SAT Scores ?(they were pretty good)

----------&gt; Besides being totally in love with the area, I want to stay near the Bay because I'm sure that the networking I've been so fortunate to start will only continue. My ""dream proposal"" to a successful startup would be working for them full/part time as resident engineer/brains/collaborator/designer while completing my second degree, and then being on contract to work for them for x years afterwards. Is this kind of thing feasible, or would it really be in my best interest to explore other options? Would an official MS degree even if I could finagle an MS program from a university that doesn't offer one be more valuable to me/more worthwhile/more valuable to employers? In one sense, I really, really want to be able to say I have a Master's if I'm spending the additional time in higher education. But on the other, Industrial Design is something I want to truly ground and develop my skills in. I don't want to ""rush it"" at the cost of losing out on additional opportunities deepen my craft. But again, as a Mechanical Engineer who does a lot of design work in my free time (and has been on many project teams where we design x y or z to meet certain needs and be within certain constraints, along with my internship) it's not like design is a foreign concept to me and I hope/expect my ME education to deepen the potential &amp; gravity of my designs. 


---------------------&gt; What schools would you recommend, regardless of location and also taking it into account? Given my desire to be in the Bay Area, I've read extensively that San Jose State University has a really good Industrial Design program (unfortunately, they don't have a Master's program). I've also been reading about California College of the Arts which is located in an even more prime Oakland/San Francisco, but I have reservations (are they valid?) about going through an ID program that is BA versus BS. They also do not offer an Master's program that is specifically ID, but have one for design. Any insight on either of these two schools? And others?

Any additional advice anyone could throw at me would be great as well. Again, sorry about the wall of text hahah. Take it easy everyone, and thanks in advance :) "

The evening had started nicely enough. The house was old but roomy, built in classical 70’s architecture. The first hint of the evening to come had been the fact that her date hadn’t asked the housemates to find something else to do that evening. So she ended up having dinner with a group of friends who were all intimately aware that she was one a date with one of them. SÄPO would have been proud of the subtle but intensive questioning she went through during the half-hour they spent eating. 

One of the main reasons she’d agreed to the date was that Emil had somehow managed to get a pre-release copy of Rogue One. Christmas had been hard on her wallet as usual, so when she saw an opportunity to watch it and maybe get laid afterwards she finally agreed to the 35 minute busride. But in the spirit of the evening the power had gone out just as the movie started and she had ended up enduring two hours of Caracssonne with a group of friends that knew eachother well, some decent red wine, and an awkward date that drank too much too fast and got grabby be the end of the evening. So, not a success. What really rankled was that Lisa, one of the cool girls there, first wanted to play Netrunner but her date didn’t want to «bore her with that nerd stuff». 

All of which led up to her walking towards a buss stop in the asscrack of nowhere with wind strong enough to almost drown out the music from her airbuds and make lighting a cigarette one of the twelve labors of Hercules. She was nearing the stop and lo and behold, of course it was only a sign with nod goddamn shed to be seen anywhere. In addition to that there was a huge warehouse or something on the opposite side of the road, with a big deserted parking lot and large black windows leading to god only knew. Great, so this was where she was gonna get abducted, raped and killed. That seemed like a fitting end to a shit evening. 

Struggling to light a cigarette and absorbed in her own thoughts the metallic clink to her side, loud enough to bull through the lyrics to «November Rain» and wind rushing trhrough the trees on all sides of her. Turning her head she saw a man, a fucking gargantuan man, leaning on the sign with the buss schedule and lighting a cigarette with the biggest goddamn Zippo she’d ever seen. He angled it towards her in a questioning motion and she gratefully stepped over to him and got her own fag lit. 

The first feeling of nicotine hitting her system was a welcome reprieve from a shitty evening. The only thing to lean against was the sign, so she just walked the two metres back to where she’d been originally standing. The giant said something that gave her an excuse to turn towards him she gratefully took. She pointed to her airbuds and said «Slash guitar solo» which elicited a grunt and a nod from him. Her lucky star must be out above the cloud cover somewhere. Settling on her heels, she halfheartedly studied the man most likely to be voted Bar Brawler of the year. 

Whenever his cigarette lighted him up for a moment she got an opportunity to study him. The dude was huge, at least 2 metres tall and probably more, her own 160 cm didn’t give her the best possibility of accurately judging the height of someone at least three heads taller than her. He was built like an ox, broad shoulders and huge arms straining against the fabric of his thick leather jacket. There was a bit of a gut bulging the t-shirt he wore, but it was the kind of gut you saw on a dockworker or logger, not the kind her classmates spending time on League of Legends or Guild Wards had. A working man’s gut, hint of a beer belly over hard muscle. His jeans were ripped, not classy ripped like on the babes studying economy or marketing, but ripped from use and shoddily patched up.

Her skin suddenly felt to tight. Her throat tightened and cold sweat ran down the small of her back as fear-fueled adrenaline hit her system. He was wearing heavy combat boots, the old model from before the military got lightweight new gore-tex boots. And the laces were snow-white. Experience kept her from showing she’d noticed in any substantial way but she quickly dropped her cigarette just to be sure. No need to let the ember at the tip of the cigarette show him her hands were shaking. She wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction. 

She noticed the lights from the bus before she heard it. They lit the giant up as it turned the intersection and came rolling up from behind her. In her hypersensitive state of fear it felt as if time had slowed down. He had long curly red hair spilling down his shoulders, a massive red beard and a scruffy ‘stache that didn’t connect in the middle. That made her chuckle, must be a source of constant frustration for him. He was wearing a hoodie under a well-worn, scuffed black leather jacked that looked solid enough to stop a bullet. A band hoodie she noted, some black metal group called Arghoslent, and if she hadn’t gotten braindamage from her furiously frustrating evening some kind of black metal judging from the font and vaguely apocalyptic scene on it. Any hope she’d been fostering that he wasn’t dangerous died when she saw his gloves. Black leather, with a raised ridge over the back of the hand and knuckles. Her brother had owned a pair just like that when he was a bouncer at Studenterhuset. Those raised ridges were filled with heavy sand, designed to give extra weight to a blow and proctect the users knuckles. 

Still trembling slightly she boarded the relative safety of the bus. Of course a traveling bunch of off-duty police, security guards or a squad of fallskärmjägare was too much the hope for. Instead there was a little old lady on the bus, sitting in the back. She looked like someones slighly racist old grandmother, the kind o fold lady that was skeptical of everyone not born where she could see them from her living room window. A grandmother you’d see during holidays, the kind that made seven kinds of lovely little biscuits and then complained about all the black people in the big city. Not the blacks in her neighbourhood mind you, just the ones in the big city. And ISIS, she probably held a dim view of ISIS as a whole. All cookies and the subtle racism old people seemed to pick up somewhere. 
  
At least nobody had shit on the row of seats when she got down. That at least was a small favor. She decided she was safe, the busdriver would probably call the police if the unfriendly giant decided to murder her. He hadn’t bothered to check her ticket or even look at her when she climbed aboard, but surely he wouldn’t be able to ignore a dude the size of a well-fed grizzly tearing a university student to pieces a few rows back. Finally getting her pulse under control, her Fitbit informed her she was down to only 120 bpm, she settled in her seat and tried to relax. Only a 20 minute ride to town and then she’d find some friends at a pub and drown the frustrations of the evening in Lapin Kulta. Of course there wasn’t a Pokestop in sight, that would have been too much to ask for during a double candy event. Fuck this evening. Fuck it to bits in a bad way.
 
She leaned back towards the window and pulled her feet up, planning to doze her way through «Wrong side of Heaven» and maybe even the next song, whatever that turned out to be. She was halfway through the song when she noticed she was freezing. Opening her eyes she saw her breath fog as she exhaled. That wasn’t right, why was the bus colder than outside? A timid shriek pushed its way up her throat when a hand shout out from between the seats and caught her forearm in an iron grip. She tried to tear her arm loose but the thin, liver-spotted fingers clenched so hard she could hear her bones creak. She wanted to scream but all that came out was a sob of pain. She twisted enough to get one foot on the floor, partially getting out of her seat and turning to the old lady. Her mind screamed her that being violent to an obviously mentally ill octogenarian was wrong, but she screaming pain from her forearm overrode it and she puncher her as hard as she could. Pain from the impact shot up her forearm and there was an audible crack she would later swear she heard inside her skull as her knucles and wrist fractured from the force of the blow. 

That punch should have dazed even the giant, but the old lady didn’t even flinch. Her other arm shot out from under what Asha could now see was a tattered floral-patterned coat that must have once been red but was now faded to a washed-out pink with flowers the color of toilet bowls on it. The old bitch now had her left arm gripped tightly in both of her and she was pulling her towards her with a force Asha couldn’t hope to resist. Terrified and with pain blackening her vision she screamed as loudly as she could and desperately towards the bus driver. He didn’t even turn his head. She turned back and punched the old bird in the face again and nearly blacked out from pain for her efforts. Bile rose in her throat and she did the only thing her panicked mind could think of, she leaned forwards and emptied the contents of her stomach into the face of her attacker. 

The bitch didn’t let og or pull back, and Asha felt the first flutters of pure terror when she didn’t even try to get the vomit out of her eyes. Cold black dread took over for terror when a too-long tongue slipped out between old, chapped lips and licked flecks of vomit from Ashas own lips. The touch of it felt like room-temperature fish guts and the smell was like rotting entrails. Screaming, Asha drew her ace in the hole from her pocked with trembling fingers. It was a small knife with a wicked blade, a Spyderco something-something her brother had given her when she enlisted. She jabbed it fiercely into the cheek of whatever-the-fuck was holding her and was rewarded with a slapt that made her vision go black and loosened at least two teeth. Her eyes filled with involuntary tears and she was suddenly too dizzy to reach for the knife again. 

And suddenly the bitch let her go. Blinking through the tears she saw Mr.Colossal pump his right fist into the face of the old monster one, two, three times before she leapt out of her seat at him. He intercepted her with his left arm, grasping the front of her coat while he pivoted and smashed her through the window on the other side of the aisle. Asha heard a ripping sound and the giant roared in pain again before turning on his heels and smashing the creature through the window right beside her. She again gagged as foul-smelling blood spattered her face and the front of her jacket but managed to force it down. The huge dude smashed the old horror against the security glass showing bus routed until it broke, then smashed her into the roof and onto the floor. All this, Asha noted, while pummeling it with his right fist. She noticed he wasn’t having it all his own way and despair knotted her abdomen when she saw blood streaming from his throat somewhere, staining his beard a darker red. 

Roaring like a wounded elephant he stomped down on the thing repeatedly. The sound of bones snapping should have been sickening but to Asha they were like the trumpets of heaven, heralding a hope of surviving this fucked up night. The creature shrieked, the sound like someone stomping repeatedly on a bagpipe from hell. As suddenly as it started it was over. The thing went limp, and a moment later faded away. The busdriver turned and said something she couldn’t hear over the rush of blood in her ears and the giant responded with something jovial sounding, walked up and crashed down beside her. 

«What….what the fuck just happened?» She sounded panicked even to herself, but on the whole felt like it was a perfectly accurate response to the last sixty seconds or so. The giant fished a box of Göteborgs Rapé out of his pocket and proceeded to pack himself the biggest fucking wad of dip she had ever seen anyone stick up his or her lip. His eyes were intense and she noticed he was shivering and clenching and unclenching his fists. She decided to give the man time to come down from his adrenaline high before pressing the matter, not feeling any need of getting pushed through a window by the big, angry, wounded giant of a man. The arms and front of his jacket were scratched to hell but it looked like it had stood up to the punishment pretty well. He was bleeding from a long scratch to the side of his neck, but it didn’t look deep. Her own arms were poudning and promising to be sore and in a lot of pain for a while to come, and she’d probably need to get at cast on her wrist at some point. 

It took half of «Land of Confusion» for himew to calm down enough to look at her. His eyes were sea green and slightly red, a byproduct of him having fought for his life just now. She corrected herself. For their lives. He noticed her airbuds and asked «Are those as shit as I think they are?». She chuckled at the absurd question. «Worse. What the fuck was that? Who the fuck are you? Why the fuck isn’t the busdriver calling the cops?». 

He took a moment before answering, the kind of pregnant pause a teacher or dad takes before answering a difficult question. «I thought they were shit. I have no idea what that was, I’m Snorre Karlsson, I have no idea but I ain’t complaining ‘cos it’s a a bit of a walk to the closest beer from here. Wanna go to a bar and get really fucking drunk?». To her that sounded like a splendid idea. 

«Sure, let’s go to The Unholy Crypt of Misssabbath and get drunk. A studymate of mine works there, we can have him patch us up.» The giant smiled at that. «I can patch us up, I’m a nurse at Linkøping University Hospital». She smiled at that. «No shit? I’m studying to be a nurse, I’m doing my internship there from next week. He smiled at her. They rode in companionable silence for a while before she noticed his headset and laughed. When he looked inquiringly at her she grinned and said «I never thought someone throwing money out the window buying Beats by Dre would have the nerve to criticize earbuds». They both laughed at that. 

She took a moment to answer Jannicke on Tinder that no, she hadn’t had a great evening and no, she wasn’t coming over tomorrow for another date. This evening was really fucked up so far, but there was still a glimmer of hope for it. Despite it all, Asha smiled through the roaring wind as she settled back in her seat.

Here is a little bit about me: I am a 22 y/o male, am fairly outgoing, was in a fraternity at Mizzou that has a local chapter at Bradley, and will finish moving to Peoria next week. I interned in Peoria for four months roughly a year ago, and am somewhat familiar with the area. I was a little iffy accepting an offer with all the layoffs ongoing, but the offer seemed quite promising.

My main worry is meeting people outside of work who will want to hang out or to go to the bars. I never had issues in St. Louis or at my university, but I know absolutely nobody in Peoria, IL, and I know it is an older age town. Making friends with the interns when I was there was easy because we had organized events etc, but I think being FT it would be different. I ended up renting at Woodsage Apartments and it is quite far away from downtown, but I expect to still go out to the bars at least every other weekend. The one benefit is it is near Grand Prarie, but I do not know if there is a bar scene out there.

Would going to the bars be the best way to meet people or do many people at CAT end up making friends? I am located at Mossville, but will likely get rotated back to the HQ in the future. I love fishing and being on the water, am an avid traveler, and enjoy going out to the bars (for more than a drink or two) and am hoping to find others who enjoy the same things.

5m21gx,14,2017-01-04,"27 F career-less loser trying to make a change! What's more valuable, the experience or the savings?",fefifofumm,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5m21gx/27_f_careerless_loser_trying_to_make_a_change/,"I am someone who has stayed unfocused, and am trying to better myself. I was a Psych/Statistics/Pre-Med undergrad who payed for school out of pocket, then screwed around for some years, and now I want to find a fulfilling, well-paying career that won't put me in a ton of debt, as I'd like to pay for grad school out of pocket, too. I have zero debt, and use my CC like a debit card, and do not want to accumulate debt, and am unwilling to take out large loans for school.

I have been leaning towards Engineering, and on a whim while traveling to a town one state over, I met with the department head of a university I am interested in, and he put me in touch with a prof who offered me a PT research assistant position to gain more experience in the field. Dept Head also said they would love to take me on in their Masters program once I completed 6 pre-reqs at a community college (statics, fluid mechanics, etc). Their acceptance rate is 62%, so I'm not sure if that's why they are being so nice accommodating. Overall, after meeting all the profs and advisors, I felt a very supportive and friendly vibe. I have high GRE scores (Q: 163, V: 160) so maybe that's why?

My financial question: I have $3k set aside for these pre-reqs. In my home state each class is $250, in the state where the university is, they are $600 (out of state). In my home state I can live with my parents for free, and in the university state, I have a place for $250/month (including utilities). 

Other factor to consider:
- I would like to apply to other schools as well, and to make myself more competitive I would like to get an internship at a firm. Doing so seems to require prior experience or at the very least a BS in Engineering. I think the research position would help me get a more revered internship to help me get into a school with a lower acceptance rate.

-Semesters in my home state (HS) are half the length of time, and courses at the comm college at the university state (US) have a lot of classes I would take this spring that are broken up into two courses. IE: Calc2 in HS = $250 for winter semester leaving spring semester open for more courses, Calc2 in US = Part 1 winter semester $600 + Part 2 spring semester $600 = $1200

-I need to move back to my HS this summer regardless (university knows this) to watch my parents house while they travel. I was hoping to have a summer internship in this time. 

-I don't have any friends in HS, all my friends and my SO are in US. Life in HS is extremely stressful for me, being a large city.

Expenses in US for the next 6 months before summer: $1800(3 classes)+$1500(rent) + $2400 (food) + $600 (health insurance) + $480 gas, etc
Expenses in HS for the next 6 months: $750 (3 classes) + $2400 (food) + $600 (health insurance) $480 (gas, etc)


How valuable is research experience to pay an extra $2550 more over 6 months? The rest of my classes will be fulfilled in HS over the summer and fall 2017, and winter 2018.


EDIT: I should add that, I am brand new to engineering, and am pursuing it because I love math and problem solving, but I don't have any experience and don't know right now if it's a good fit. Is $2500 worth gaining some exposure to get more of an idea if this is what I really want before investing more time in school?"

I split with an amazing guy 6 years ago. We connected so well and I trusted him endlessly, but he always felt a bit far away and had a gaming addiction (which he’s since resolved). I had an internship opportunity in Africa and had to decide whether to keep it short and come back to him, or end our relationship and be open to jobs there. So I laid out 2 things I needed from him – stop gaming so much and a bit more sexually adventurous – but he said he couldn’t do those things. So I ended it.


Forward 6 years. Work and the decision I want a family landed me on the other side of North America from my ex. I hadn’t met anyone and kept thinking about him. I wrote him a long letter, and we talked so openly about what happened. I learned that during that time he was failing school, and actually dropped out adding 2 years to his education when we split. He couldn’t give me what I needed, because he was losing himself. He would love to explore us, but right then he was seeing an old ex who was going through a lot (alcoholism), and while he doubted it’d last he had to let it take its course.


Two weeks later I met a great guy 15 years older than me. He is hot (for almost 50), has a great career, is very well off, great sex, and tells me I’m beautiful and smart every day. It’s been a year and a half and we just moved in, and he wants to marry soon (he’s very ready to find his life partner and build with them). Fantasy right? Suddenly though, I felt like.. how could I ever NOT be with my ex again? OMG.. never another chance! It tore me apart. And now I suddenly am picking out all these little annoyances about the current guy. I don’t even feel as attracted to him and have been a bit rude but almost feel I can’t control it. 


I met for coffee with my ex while visiting home over holidays. He said he was sorry he never had the confidence to come after me – he just never believed he’d amount to anything. That I was out of reach. Then he saw me with this guy and he thought I was happy - he wanted me to have that. Figured I’d marry this guy, and with that resolved he’d likely just be alone for a long time. He would love another shot… but also doesn’t want to be the reason I change everything. He feels guilty, like a home-wrecker. We’re both logical enough to know it might not even work. We’d be starting from scratch emotionally and in life, new (but good) careers with student loans and not even have enough to buy a home if it does work. And, it would mean me leaving a job, life, moving across the country to a place I know no one. But, much closer to my fam (4 hour drive vs. 700$ flight).


Since the talk with my ex I’ve told my current guy a million things Im unhappy about. Too far from my family? He’ll get me a condo there so I can see them. He’s too clean for kids? He will learn to be messy. Loves penthouse too much? We’ll get a house. He is just so willing to fix every single thing I bring up! – because he will do anything to see me happy. 


I don’t know who I love. My ex? I did so much but its been 6 years we don’t even know each other anymore. My current, I thought I did but now I’m really not sure. I haven’t even wanted to kiss him. I cant ‘follow my heart’ – its not speaking to me! Am I just running away from a good thing, cold feet? And, I worry the money clouds my vision – a life where I could have anything and so could my kids.  But, it’s not just that – one is ready to do anything for me, while the other let me walk away once before. But, the current is so willing to do anything, I worry I’ll steal how he envisioned his retirement – kids instead of travel and luxury, and he may resent it later. Or I could go after the one I’d get to grow and build with and who finally put himself out there, sharing more with me than he ever has – but if it doesn’t work lose everything and have to start all over and maybe never meet another good guy for years and years. All I do know - is Im tired of dating, am ready for the next stage of life.. and both are so great I might never find another as great as either. :’( Im just so lost. Please help :””(.

I have an interview tomorrow with a marketing agency that's pretty big in my city. They're looking for an intern to start on Monday. This is an awesome opportunity that will most likely lead to a full job offer as I'm in my last semester of college and I'm very confident I'll be able to get it. However, I'm also scheduled for an interview with another good agency in town on Tuesday. This one would be an actual full-time salaried position. I'm extremely interested in both.

So basically, what I'm wondering is this: would it hurt me in the interview with the first company if I informed them of my interview with the second company? I'd really like to consider both and, as I mentioned earlier, feel very confident I'll be offered positions at both due to my experience and connections I have in both agencies. I would like to ask them if it's okay if I maybe wait another week before I start, so that I may consider both offers. I'm open to suggestions. "
5m538b,4,2017-01-05,"21, Graduating in May with a Great Job Offer -- Live at Home with Parent After School or Rent (NYC)?",VelociPrime,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5m538b/21_graduating_in_may_with_a_great_job_offer_live/,"Hi all,

I will be graduating debt free in May and starting a job in July that pays 85k/yr (and one time 15k signing bonus) as a software engineer. I'm very grateful for the opportunity but I am also trying to be wary of lifestyle creep. I commuted to the same company as an intern last year and my commute from the suburbs on Long Island takes me about an hour and a half door to door each way. I found it to be pretty draining and I'm considering renting a place in the city with friends after graduating, but am hesitant because of the extra expenses and opportunity cost of having that money be invested, saved for an emergency fund, towards a down payment on an apartment (obscenely expensive in the NYC area).

My relationship with my Mom (the only person living in my house) is pretty solid and she has even advocated for me staying at home until marriage. I also have an understanding long time girl friend so I will not have to deal with many of the single dating problems living at home comes with. My only issue is with limited free time (50+ hour weeks at work and 15-18 hours/week of commuting) which may cause me to neglect my friends and health, not have time to work on side projects, and potentially not developing as much personally and gaining life experiences as I would otherwise have enjoying the city, living in an apartment with friends, etc.

The monthly costs of my commute are quite high: $400 commuter rail + metro card, + gas and maintenance on a car given to me by my grandmother who can no longer drive. The insurance payments are low(~$100-150/mo) but currently made by my mom. However these payments are small in comparison to life away from home: estimated $1500-1600 in rent, more for utilities, $120 metro, no more free home cooked meals etc) If further breakdowns are needed I have comprised several budgets based on my living situation.

Initially my plan was to live at home maybe a year or two if I can bear it, but I wanted to post here to hear all of your advice on the topic. Thank you in advance!"

Have personal preference towards good work life balance in career, without getting into too much debt right out of the gate, but want an honest outsider’s perspective on my specific dilemma and what could be reasonably be done hack it out. My full ride Texas Grant is coming to an end, but all my core courses are completed, and If I radically change course, it would take 1 to 1 and a half more school years to finish, and tuition per semester is in the 6 to 7,000+ range, not counting miscellaneous expenses, which potentially adds up to 10 to 12,000 per year at most, though. My Financial Aid advisor told me that, at the rate I’m going, total amount is within the 6/7/8k range.

---My Situation---
I started my college career as a Graphic Design major, before switching to English with the intent of teaching, but when I decided that I really wasn’t cut out for it, I was sent into a depressive, desperate, emotional tailspin the entire fall semester as I struggled to figure out just what the hell I was going to DO with my life, with the major I had after scouring reddit and hearing an unsettling amount of horror stories of not only English majors, but of millennials in general. I’ve been asking myself brutally tough questions about what I hoped to accomplish in life, and as I see it, there’s a few paths I can see ahead of me that I can undertake with the major I have, or if I intend to switch entirely at this point. Each path has its own pros and cons related to practical viability considering where I am in life, what I want, and where I live – with each option, I’m willing to relocate.


*MARKETING/PR: From what I’ve read, English majors can make pretty nice careers here, and I could snugly add another minor alongside Graphic Design, either with marketing or computer science – giving me eight more classes, and at the absolute most, an extra school year to beef up my resume/ seek out relevant internships. I don’t know if that might even be enough, but It’s as viable an option as any. If I have a comp sci major, that might also be an asset if I seek out TECHNICAL WRITING. JOURNALISM is also viable.


*GRAPHIC/WEB DESIGN: This one weighed very heavily on me, as I did enjoy the major, and I do regret changing course from it. If I were to change back, I would have to take 19 more classes, and at the absolute latest, graduate December 2018 – this might not be so bad, as this extra time would allow me to seek out relevant graphic/ web design internships. I know someone who has had a paid graphic/web design internship for my local school district for about two years, and I’d kill to have that type of experience on my resume – although, such positions aren’t super uncommon. I feel that on several levels, this might be the riskiest investment, but there’s also a payoff at the end of it that might make it worth it.


*WEB DEVELOPMENT/PROGRAMMING: With this plan, I feel that I would just graduate as is, devote time to learning the craft, then relocate to whichever part of Texas would take me.


There’s an overarching question for each of these: Am I looking at it pragmatically enough? Careers aren’t light decisions, and I’m ultimately drawn to these paths in particular because of opportunities for interesting work with potentially good salary between 40 to 80k, along with good work-life balance that allows for family, personal projects and hobbies. BUT, I also need to keep in mind the potential flaws. For instance, Web Dev/Software Engineering roles are better paying and in higher demand compared to Web Design, yet I strongly believe that I could do perfectly well with that as a career – even with the elephant of student debt being a potentially stronger pressing concern. English major stereotypes are largely just that, but there’s truth in stereotypes, and there’s always the risk that I could live out the nightmare scenario of nearly a decade of low paying jobs WITH debt. I’ve been told by my family that I don’t have to worry about that having that potential debt, as I have a personal financial cushion along with financial aid and scholarships.  I live in the RGV of South Texas, and there’s not much opportunities for the above careers, so there’s also the financial issue of relocation. 

I thank you all, and am interested in hearing your comments on this matter.

5m69zf,1,2017-01-05,Dealing with Life,DepressedManager,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5m69zf/dealing_with_life/,"Sorry for the wall of text ahead. Kind of wanted to put my life out there in words. There is a tl;dr at the bottom for my question if you are not interest in life story. 


As of late I feel my depression is continuing to worsen. 
I am at a point in life where I go to work, come home, do nearly nothing for hours and go to sleep. 

Some back story. I have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember (about 12 years now and I am 25 now). When I was younger always interested in technology and was a critical thinker with my parents claiming (don't know if it is true don't really remember much from chidlhood) I had ideas for products before companies were making things and could solve problems easily. I was also pretty active even though I was overweight I would go out for different sports teams never made any though (football, soccer, baseball, basketball, pretty much anything my schools offered) I was a lot more social would actually go outside, go over to friends houses. Got a bit older started working on computers, playing, building pretty much anything I could with them. I started to lose interest in pretty much everything. 

During middle school is when I feel I began feeling depressed (I don't recall any major events around this time) but I would cover it with anger getting into fights all the time which typically resulted in me getting suspended and having to stay home a lot. During this time too I stopped biking, doing sports, interacting for the most part with people. I became very shy and reclusive, pretty much only interacting with people online. Still had a few friends I would interact with offline. Visiting them though started to dwindle and then pretty much only interaction with them was now also online.

Now into high school I would do the absolute bare minimum to pass and mostly sleep in class. The reclusiveness hit a high during this time I would refuse to speak to the teachers even if they called me out in class. Some of the teachers cared enough to notice that I knew my the subjects they were teaching and would try to push me to do work and make something of myself which at this point in my life I hated but looking back I do appreciate it a lot and these teachers are still the ones I remember and even miss them to this day. Moving into college I finally had a reason to work for my teachers since I was doing something that I felt I had interest in (computer programming) did the work got the grades,  nearly graduated but one of the final requirements for the degree was an internship which they provide companies and contacts that I would need to get a hold of and setup an interview with. The school failed so hard in this part they were sending me contact information for event programmers (like setting up music or art events) which wasn't even close to anything I wanted. Eventually I gave up on getting the degree. 

Following dropping out of college I got fed up with people in general and wouldn't leave the house for months at a time for more than just taking the trash out. I would try programming something but never felt I needed anything and anything I did someone else has already done before and better than I felt I could so I basically gave up on computer programming as well. I do have thoughts of suicide during this time but never feel I could go through with it just kind of imagining it. 

Forward a few more years me and mother hit financial trouble we couldn't deal with any more and getting evicted and just decide to move to another state. In the new place which is so small the whole town has a population smaller than the high school I was in. I get my first job which happened to be retail so I dealt with customers as much as needed for the job then went home and played games with friends from old state online. Shyness does start to go away during this time but also start hanging with friends less due to work also during this time I start to lose interest in even playing games that I have been for year. I eventually get moved to overnights for stocking which I excelled at but even less time with friends online now due to hours.

And now much more recently a year ago I changed my diet and hit an all time high of feeling like life was finally going good a couple months in. I started exercising more, lost over 100 lbs putting me in shape for the first time in my adult life. Got a promotion to manager at the same job. Everything was going well. Then I hit a wall extremely hard... I just all of a sudden lost all interest in everything again but even more so to the point now I work and basically sit for hours then sleep... Almost no interaction with friends again, no interest in games, no interest in shows/movies nothing I do seems to help. I don't know why... I feel I don't have stress I no longer have any financial trouble and have tons of free time to do anything with but I sit all day doing nothing. I have been trying to find something to do to no avail. I do a lot of theory crafting of things I could do making spreadsheets for things Including costs, time, projects, ways to optimize doing things but when trying to start I feel entirely overwhelmed on beginning and freeze up and just end up saying forget it and sitting there. Not much around me for clubs or activities unless I want to take up hunting and fishing. Technology around here is nearly non existent.

Have done some baking, and gardening since starting the diet it's alright in small doses nothing I feel I would want to do a lot. Thought about trying to start a business, woodworking, electrical engineering work, building things but all these falls back to the same problem I had with programming never knowing what I want to do or someone else already doing it better than I feel I can.


Tl;dr
Looking for something to do to help with depression. Previous interests were computers, programming, sports. Have tried baking, gardening. Looked into starting a business, woodworking, electronic engineering, building but feel I never know what to make/do with the skill and don't end up even starting."

So what exactly happened to the guy who bragged about how he was _so professional_ at making websites and always talked about it like he had superior knowledge? The ""madcast media"" website as he described it is not hard to make. Literally, this would be a learning project for a new intern at any modern company. The kind of thing they cobble together to understand basic web development then throw away when they're done.

Remember when he was talking about how static HTML websites are so superior to modern websites? Or when he was bragging that he programmed some chat application for when he was writing his book? Or when he was talking about how Dropbox was so poorly constructed and FTP is superior?

As a programmer, here's one thing I can tell you about Maddox -- he's not good with computers. He's actually one of those ""dangerous"" types programmers, the very counter-productive kind. He knows he's not able to keep up and learn modern tech, so instead, he demonizes it. Then he says the ""old way"" (the way he knows) of doing it is better, when in reality, he just doesn't understand how to do it in the new way."

5m9khh,16,2017-01-05,The Curse of Pragmatism,arcterex117,aznidentity,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/5m9khh/the_curse_of_pragmatism/,"Where does white worship come from?  Or why do Asians often give preferential treatment to whites in social interactions?

Let's try to get inside the mind of an Uncle Chan or Auntie Tan- the sort of person who thrills to the presence of a white person, who excitedly engages them in conversation, who shies away from disagreeing with them, who in general gives them more importance in social interactions.   

**Social Status**

Let's consider the idea of Social Status.   Social status is comprised of many factors but in the end it is an assessment of a person's social worth, their importance; it determines their rank.   I think we can agree that in America, whites have fashioned a society where they put themselves atop the social hierarchy.   If you want a primer on Social Status and how it affects people's behavior, [see my review of an important study on the subject](https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/4e7vc1/i_summarize_the_study_social_hierarchy_and/?ref=search_posts).

**Pragmatism, Social Pragmatism, Social Opportunism**

This is where Pragmatism comes into play.   A pragmatic person accepts reality how it is, and figures out how to operate in that ecosystem to his best advantage.   (Idealism is the opposite of pragmatism; an idealist leads with his values and operates in his ecosystem according to his beliefs, and does not accept the rules of the game, as such).   Pragmatists largely accept Life as it is; often thinking the Rules of the Game are beyond reform; and in any case, focusing on the big picture comes at the expense of their personal gain.

I think we can say that many Asians are Pragmatic.   Pragmatism is associated with being rational.  Being realistic.   And in many cases of being effective and successful.   Poverty drives people to pragmatism.   Our parents or grandparents may have lived in impoverishment- where they margin of error was slim.   One could not afford ""ideals""; what needed to be done, needed to be done.   Not acting out in accordance with practical reality and that which brings near-term gain could mean failure, ostracism, or possibly death.   Therefore, this pragmatic- accept the world as it is- mentality is in many cases, part of the home culture we were raised with.

Now let's think about the nature of an Uncle Chan given the concepts of Social Status and Pragmatism.   **Pragamatic behavior with regard to social status (""social pragmatism"") would accept the racial hierarchy ""ecoystem"" how it is, and plot to advantage oneself as much as possible within the fixed reality.**   I will submit that this behavior is a) largely subconscious and automatic, and b) not limited to race, and not unusual.   For example, it is somewhat normal in an office environment to interact respectfully with let's say a senior VP who's your manager's manager, but more casually to your peers, and tease/act in a dominant way towards those lower in the org chart.  It is acceptable behavior that almost everyone does to some extent.   But clearly, SOME take this to extreme levels - the Kiss Up, Kick Down type -- and you see this in the social world too, forgetting the office environment example.   

Coming back to social interaction, the Uncle Chan has adopted a pragmatic, un-idealistic way of navigating it.   And let me be charitable to him.   This is a rational strategy.  In many cases, because whites do have higher status, **the butt-kissing Chan finds a way to elevate himself in social rank, even if it's at the expense of other Asians**.  Even if it's solidifying the racial hierarchy, selling out his own, making whites, Asians, and non-Asian minorities think less of Asians and in general, acting in a way that's Status-Reinforcing of white supremacy on a broader level.  

At the micro-level, the individual has secured himself the approval of high-status whites, which insulates him from perhaps the most damning social aggression, exclusion, and in some cases insulates him from criticism of others in the group.   It is a self-serving, cynical strategy- but nonetheless one that is not foreign in human affairs- and as I pointed out with my office example, one that we all engage in to some degree.    Pragmatism seeks out the decisions that will advantage oneself, not one's group; and the outlook emphasizes the short-term.

The difference with the Office example to Social interaction is the office example features Official Hierarchy- that is, the different levels in rank accord to real differences in level of responsibility and seniority.   In the Social example, we are arbitrarily making distinctions in rank based on race.  However, if you read my analysis of a [study on Status](https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/4e7vc1/i_summarize_the_study_social_hierarchy_and/?ref=search_posts), social ranks are remarkably durable, comparable with Official Rank in a defined hierarchy.   This is based on the individual and group's need for stability. 

Opportunism is taking pragmatism to an unhealthy place; where moral standards are jettisoned in favor of personal advantage.

**Pragmatism and Vulnerability**

As I mentioned, pragmatism doesn't just emanate from selfishness; it often results from vulnerability (such as poverty).  Those that believe they cannot afford to ""lose"".  Asian women fall into this category.   Women are more vulnerable than men.  And minorities are more vulnerable than whites.   Being both, Asian women often believe they can ill afford the wrath of the group or high status individuals.   This may lead to an often cynically pragmatic outlook - which in our society, necessarily leads to some form of white worship.  

**How Social 'Pragmatism' leads to mistreatment of not just Asians, but other POC**

In addition, unfortunately, a purely pragmatic point of view, not only normalizes white supremacy in their mind (because that is a part of reality), it also legitimizes the mistreatment of POC, because they are deemed lower status by society.   We can see where pragmatism run amok - Accepting white-constructed social reality whole cloth - among AF's can lead to unremitting white worship but also dismissiveness and rudeness to POC, since such pragmatic Auntie Tans at a subconscious level assume their reaction to someone ought to be based on whatever society classifies their social rank as.

Social Pragmatism comes from a ""rational"" place but if often means accepting the racism and racial hierarchy in white society.  If every Asian engaged in Channery, the Asian race will be forever subordinated in the West- in every area of life.   This is true even if the Asians in question argue on their behalf that they were just trying to make the ""best of a bad situation"".

**Idealism**

Idealism is the counter-balance to Pragmatism.   Idealists believe Right makes Right, not Might makes Right.  Idealists are willing to take hits in the short-term in order what is the correct thing to do in the long-term; that are long-term optimal, that are optimal to the collective.....and even if they are not optimal, their moral compass influences their choices, not merely self-interest.

Identification with a group leads to Idealism.   Because now the group's agenda has importance to the individual; and the individual also sees his benefit in the realization of the group's agenda.  Being part of something larger than onesself can be a healthy experience because one is able to finally step outside his narrow instinctual/short-term self-interest.  (However, group membership is not necessary for the Idealistic worldview).

Idealists leave something on the table in interactions.   They take less than they could, but in adhering to conduct consonant with their worldview and morals, they realize these sacrifices are minor in service of playing their part in the larger mission; in this case, in engaging in Status-Attenuating behavior towards white rule atop the social hierarchy.  The individual's behavior chips away at a larger force he deems unhealthy to him and others like him, and whatever the impact, is the right thing to do. 


**Drilling Down**

I will now get away from neutral observation of the matter into how I think about the subject.

I personally have contempt for people who are purely Pragmatic.  To me, they are soulless golems, prisoners to their instincts and vastly overstate the benefit of their ""victories"" from aligning themselves to the world as it is.  At the end of their life, all their epitaph should say is: ""I played the Game"".   

**Self-monitoring**

We face a choice in the social sphere.  We can either take the ""safe, easy"" route of supplicating to whites ""because that's the way things are"" or we can do what we know is right- which is act to counteract that.   Such as monitoring how we act in social situations and noticing if we subconsciously make allowances for whites; if we notice we ""feel happy"" when whites are around or ""bored"" when greeted by another Asian or POC.   **This self-monitoring is essential** to rooting out internalization of the social/racial hierarchy.

**Gauging Other Asians with more Nuance**

Beyond self-monitoring, we should see the behavior of other Asians clearly.   I think this is absolutely essential.   If you ignore everything I just said and were unfamiliar with this topic, you might observe an Asian person who in a social group who is happily talking with a tall white male, getting along fabulously, and assume this man is socially successful.   You might assume an Asian woman who is getting the attention of let's say a white female and a white man in a larger group of other Asians and Hispanics is - popular.   But what if you realized that the reason they were directing attention and talking to her was that she *agreed with everything they said*.  She flattered them.   And she gave further importance to them, by refusing to make eye contact whenever another Asian spoke.   Or the syllable they finished, immediately began talking again to the white people in the group.   Or what about the Asian male example I gave- what if that Asian man was ""getting along"" with the white male because he was deferential to him but undercut FOB Asians to him, and laughed at how bad their food smelled, etc.

**Not Enough to Guard against Raw Social Pragmatism in Ourselves, but also avoid Accidentally Giving Respect to Asians who Engage in It**

We tend to make automatic judgments of the ""social success"" of others; but we need to look more closely at patterns of behavior and understand the WHY in it.   Part of the problem is our language.   Which insists people are either Uncle Chans or Not-Uncle-Chans.   But an Asian can be subtly ""respectful"" towards whites while more normal towards non-whites in the same way a person can be ""respectful"" towards their superior at work and more normal towards their peers.   These subtle differences, we often don't pick up on- or are too slight to meet the bar of Channery.   Instead, perhaps we can rate people on a scale of what I call Accomodationism (white accomodationism- that is preferential treatment to whites): high levels or low-levels.  To simplify we can say it's a scale of 1-10; from Independent (treats people equally and objectively) to Utter Sycophant to Whites.  By making an assessment along a gradient, rather than binary (Chan, Not-Chan), we can better gauge Asians around us.   

If a fellow Asian is *always* acting friendly towards whites, whether the CEO or the intern, whether the attactive charismatic white or the dorky obnoxious white, that gives us information on which to grade them.   If instead an Asian person treats others in accordance with their actual nature and their compatibility with them, that would stand in favor of them not being Accomodationist.

By grading in this fashion, we do not accidentally ""give credit"" to Accomodationists or Chans for ""social success"" that ostensibly seems earned but is actuality the result of Channery.   This is because even if we are Idealists, we naturally reward one another for ""wining"" social interactions, for being ""popular"".   We can correct ourselves and other Asians when they speak about an Accomodationist/Pragmatic Asian by making it clear that their social gains are ill-gotten.   Our vigilance and clarification to others of it is what serves as the necessary Moral counter-balance to the social gains that are to be had through selfish social Pragmatism.  In other words, it serves as a Deterrence to this behavior by Asians.

One of the 'crimes' committed by 1st-gen Asians is 'rewarding' their children or any 2nd gen Asians overly for 'assimilating' as ""proved"" by having white friends or being popular among whites.   One crime we all commit is giving more respect to Asians who 'earn the respect' of whites.   We have to guard against our gut-reaction, and be critical if this is all the result of white accomodationism.


**Closing**

Pragmatism is a human strategy applied in many areas of life.  If is often pronounced in those who are Insecure and those who suffer from Poverty; aspects of our parent's culture and also properties of being the ""other"" in America.  Pragmatists in the social sphere do not believe they are doing anything wrong; they are 'following the rules' that they discern through observation of social patterns.  

We often think of Channery as a conscious choice.  My write-up on Pragmatism and natural yielding to social hierarchies, whatever the setting, suggests that giving whites preferential treatment may instead be an unwitting extension of ordinary behavior.   Taken to its extreme, social opportunism accepts as given the racial hierarchy whites have created- and then supplicates to whites, disregards or treats less well other Asians.   Because of that, self-monitoring as well as properly assessing and undercutting Asian accomodationists is important.   

We mustn't fall into the trap of raw social pragmatism but neither should we unconsciously reward Asians who do, just because they see the social or professional benefits of it.  Instead, we should expose their 'selling out' to others in subtle ways so, long-term, Asians are deterred from doing this.  Perhaps over time, we'll develop the language to stigmatize such people; for now, while I think Uncle Chan/Krishna are useful, they are often more too severe, and not credible for the vast majority of cases.  

Idealism- or in this case Asian identity- serves as a counter-balance to the instinctual tendency to ""go along to get along"".    Unhealthy degrees of pragmatism lingers in the Asian community from the scarcity mindset of immigrants.  Hopefully, we'll realize that   success goes well beyond the Western emphasis of Popularity or the Asian emphasis on Financial gain and Assimilation.  The 1st gen didn't combat social racism because they 'had bigger fish to fry'; because the poverty mindset meant accepting society as it was and being purely pragmatic to gain economic security.  The 2nd gen, benefiting from economic security, can see the bigger picture and act in accordance with their moral values, not just 'getting ahead' - whether in social or economic terms."
5m9s6n,34,2017-01-05,Why I think there will be a release in 2017,rosiest72,jaipaul,https://www.reddit.com/r/jaipaul/comments/5m9s6n/why_i_think_there_will_be_a_release_in_2017/,"Keep in mind what you are about to read is my thoughts and theories only and what I believe in is backed up by what I believe the evidence I have come up with means.

For starters, XL usually has 5 to 6 releases a year and sometimes announces what will be released at the beginning of the year.

I've deduced that these 5 or 6 releases will be Beck, The xx, Sigur Rós, Vampire Weekend, and Jai Paul. Whether there will be a 6th release, who knows? Beck has already released a couple singles for his upcoming album which is surely to release this year. The xx is already known to be releasing *I See You* next Friday. Sigur Rós have been touring while also playing new music at shows with a single having been released last year. The chances of an album coming out late this year are moderate to high. Vampire Weekend is tricky though. While they have been working on a new album and sources saying it could be released this year, there has also been talk of them signing to Columbia Records. So their release wouldn't really count as an XL release. The upcoming *New Gen* album could be considered as one of the 5/6 releases replacing Vampire Weekend if they do move to Columbia Records

But what we're really here for is Jai Paul. Given all the releases most likely to come out this year there would still be 1 or 2 more slots left. Here's where Jai comes in. Come April it will be 5 years since *Jasmine (Demo)* was released (by XL). We'll also reach 4 years since the leak happened. Given it usually takes 2 to 3 or even 4 years until an artist releases an album, now would be the opportune time for Jai to release something. There's been word that the leak really hindered Jai and rightfully so. Let's say he took the rest of the year mulling things over and keeping low; taking a break after what happened. 2014 comes and he's ready to put his all into his next big piece. He's most likely been working on this thing since then non-stop.

We know Rodaidh has been working with him. Here's where I start reaching a bit and draw my own conclusions. If we look at McDonald's [AllMusic](http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rodaidh-mcdonald-mn0002398151/credits) credits he would average at least 5 projects he was involved in each year before and during 2013. But after that, he's only been involved in 2 projects in 2014, 1 in 2015, and 1 in 2016. Even then, in 2014 one of the projects he worked on was a compilation of songs of various artists that have already been released before so it's really only 1 project each year since 2014. During that time, we know he's been working with The xx, Sampha, Denai Moore and Jai Paul so that gives reason to why there's been such little co-production in projects seen these past few years. The former 2 are confirmed to be releasing their respective albums this year and that leaves the latter 2.

And then I reach a bit more by looking into Pat Shannahan who is known for her sample clearance skills. It's obvious Jai likes to use samples and who better to come aboard and help clear those than the expert herself? Her [AllMusic](http://www.allmusic.com/artist/pat-shannahan-mn0001780819) credentials show she hasn't been a part of a project since 2013. In other words, since Jai's stuff was leaked. It isn't listed, but it's been said she cleared samples for The Avalanche's latest album released last year. I like to think she's been hard at work these past few years clearing samples for Jai while also helping out with *Wildflower*. Though in a recent [interview](http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/08/pat-the-detective-shannahan-interview) she explains why she's done less work each year recently so there's that. But something else mentioned in the same interview caught my attention.

&gt;One of my clients wanted this sample, this East Indian recording.

This kind of sample is right up Jai's alley. The chances of this meaning what I think it does is hard to say and it's all complete speculation, but like I said, she's an expert and I'm sure XL would want one if they want the best for Jai.

Some last bit of information: Jai Paul's [website](http://whois.domaintools.com/jaipaul.co.uk) is to be expired on 13 April of this year. The Paul Institute had been looking for interns back in December. Last year there were several people on Twitter stating they'd heard new Jai Paul.

In the end, it all falls down to Jai and whether he wants to release something. I just wanted to share my theories and I'm hopeful that something will be released this year be it a new single or a full-fledged album."
5m9ygx,10,2017-01-05,"Parents semi-suicidal, dad has cancer - should I lie about having faith?",yohj,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/5m9ygx/parents_semisuicidal_dad_has_cancer_should_i_lie/,"Was a typical ""sleeping"" Christian until age 14. Then I got saved. Had the fire of Christ in me - shared gospel with tons of people, including strangers, even got in trouble at high school once for passing out too hellfire-ish gospel tracts at my public school, prayed/read the bible every day, was very active in church until age 17/18. From then until now (age 20.5) been a lukewarm christian (largely bc i concluded evolution was real and that there was biological causes for homosexuality). During the past two years especially past two months, my reasons for believing in Xtianity have decreased. Main arguments for me were archaeological, historical, and inconsistencies in the bible, as well as finally stumbling across a decent explanation that explained how the Bible could have come about if it wasn't true/God's Word (cf. The Documentary Hypothesis and other things).


Been an atheist since Dec 4th, 2016. Only have told two of my closest friends (who were both not believers) and my worship leader (I told her I was ""having doubts/questions"") as I played in my church's worship band and no longer wanted to keep playing.


I had considered coming out to my parents this Christmas break. But my dad has had cancer for the past 16 months (technically he's been in remission for past 4 months) and his health is still very bad (been in ER 2 times over the holidays already). He has been on death's door many times. I have been faking prayer throughout the break (my mom will ask me to pray out loud with her several times a day). During this break I have also learned both my parents have been having suicidal thoughts. My mom said yesterday if she weren't a Christian, she'd consider suicide.

I hate lying. I hate pretending that I'm a Christian, and I want to stop participating in my church activities when I go back to school (~2 hours away) as they take up 5 - 15 hours a week and I could use that time doing other things. I'd also like to be able to freely date non-Christian girls, have sex etc. But I also feel like coming out could push my parents into nervous breakdowns/ even worse, in what is already the most stressful time period of their lives.

I see the following options:

- 1) Keep staying fully active in church and just completely fake it. Church sunday, weekly bible study, worship team, and then social events with my small group [total 10-15 hours a week]

- 2) Do the bare minimum in church - bible study and service [4 hrs week], either fake it or admit to rest of bible study i don't believe or ""have doubts""

- 3) Not go to church at all, and then just tell my parents I am going

- 4) Not go to church at all, tell my parents I am not going, but still pretend I'm a believer and have just gotten busy with school or something

- 5) Not go to church, and when pressed admit I don't believe anymore


Which do you think is best?


Even if I don't come out to my parents there's still the question of coming out to my social circles. Do I finally let my self start partying/drinking/having sex? Do I stop censoring myself from saying thoughts that don't agree with a Christian worldview? I feel like eventually my parents would find out, and there's no guaranteeing that when they would find out that they would be out of their extremely stressful medical/financial situation. My dad could die any day or could stay disabled the rest of his life. I was going to ask my older brother for advice as he was sort of agnostic when growing up, but now it seems like my parents and I have shared the gospel with him so much over the years that he's a believer too (or maybe he's just faking it?)

I am financially independent (full ride scholarship to univ., but I plan on living with my uncle for free over the summer for an out of town internship and he is very Christian as well). Parents are very religious - both participated in anti-abortion rallies, shared gospel with people, spoken in tongues, creationists, equate liberals with evil/ignorance etc."
5ma5gq,30,2017-01-05,[B/s] I'm just updating that I went home for Christmas.,151andChocolate,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/5ma5gq/bs_im_just_updating_that_i_went_home_for_christmas/,"I'm back. Once again, just go to /u/151andChocolate/submitted/ to see everything so far. I am finally settled back at my apartment right now, and I've gotten used to being back at work. I went home for Christmas even though I was dreading it.

People are really trashing my brother. They are mostly sending me direct messages, and they might be just trying to get me to be their incest pen pal or something. Honestly, the people coming down hard on me are probably more correct. I don't know if anyone read one of my comments in my last post. I don't know how to link directly to comments.

I pushed and pushed until my brother agreed to have sex with me. I pushed and pushed saying that I would be fine with FWB and nothing else, especially since I was leaving for college. I was fine with him seeing other girls; everyone needs to sow their wild oats in my opinion. I am a little bit bisexual anyway. I just didn't realize all the feelings I was holding back for him, even before we had sex. He was the one nonjudgmental constant in my life. I wouldn't even mind sharing him with my friend, but they've made it clear more than once that isn't something their interested in pursuing. I can't blame her, and he is definitely the monogamous sort when he gets into a relationship.

I know I sound kind of bratty and immature. I don't have a diary, so I just sort of vented without a filter. I've said things I regret now, but I am not going to edit anything and pretend like I haven't fucked up. I'd rather own it and be able to say, ""at least, I am still not THAT fucked up."" I don't think I want anyone telling me how mature I am either or how well I am handling it. I'm not, and over a year of being shitty doesn't go away overnight. I've manipulated too many people, I need to just be better. I can't just change myself overnight either.

I've been trying to balance space and communication with my family. I've made it clear I still need space, but I am not holing myself in a room. I am answering calls and texts. I just let them know when I want some space. It is hard not to focus on what I had with my brother when I am with my family or talking to them. I'll probably think about it less as time goes on. I wasn't a hermit at Christmas either. I wasn't exactly a ray of fucking sunshine either, but I was trying at least. It helped that we had a lot of homes to visit. I wasn't really alone with my parents or my brother that much at any given time. I've been practicing the whole fake it til you make it sort of thing most of the time.

My friend, my brother's future wife, has been reminding me that I get free counseling at my college. I really hate therapists. I've been in therapy. I am wondering if these school counselors might irritate me less than people I've seen before. I just want someone that I can say whatever the fuck is on my mind to without them interjecting if I don't want them to. Obviously, I can tell them about the incest, but it is easy enough to leave that fact out and say he is close to our family. I am only considering it because my brother actually broke down in private in front of me. It happened around Christmas. He misses having me around, and he felt like his decisions have left me fucked up for the rest of my life. They were barely even his decisions considering how much I manipulated those decisions. I really owe it to him to try harder to fix everything between us and our parents. 

My dad keeps going around unsure of what he wants to say. My mom keeps pretending like nothing is wrong to a level that is actually creepy. She just might have been on a happy high since I was home for Christmas and did some bargain shopping with her and my friend after Christmas. I'd probably lose my mind if I was still living there, but I know I need to be more of a fixture at home. I still won't be coming home for the summer though. I have an internship lined up, and I honestly do love my major and career plans. That is why it has been so easy to just focus on my studies. I just have to remember not to forget everything else going on.

I want you to imagine that I met the woman of my dreams. A girl who is smart, funny, caring, loving, and loves me so much she would do *anything* for me and my family. Someone who makes me laugh more than anyone and cries with me when I'm sad. Someone who shares my values about the world - about justice and fairness, human rights, freedom. Someone who shares my deepest beliefs, and imagine she's so awesome she actually shares yours too! I want you to imagine that she's so kind that she would give her coat to someone off the street at the age of 16 in the middle of the winter because she saw he was homeless and shivering. Imagine she's so smart that she has gotten all A's since she was in 3rd grade except for a semester in college, and went on to finish post-graduate work in molecular biology that works on finding ways to help defeat certain kinds of cancer. Imagine she's so loving that she offered to give her friend a kidney when her friend was in a situation where she may have needed it. Imagine her values are so congruent with mine, and with yours, that if you asked her what was most important to her in the world, she would say the same three things you taught me: Loving Family, Ethics and Kindness, Seeking the Truth. Imagine that she's so beautiful she makes me catch my breath every time I look at her. I drop things when she walks into the room sometimes. Imagine she's so strong and passionate, that when she was at risk of losing both her internship and failing her class in the most important semester of her life, she ran on a couple hours of sleep a night for 6 weeks, used coffee and exercise and destroyed every obstacle in her way. While still making a little time for her family. Imagine that she'd be the best partner I could ever hope for to share my life with.

Imagine that I love her so much, that I would never let anything hurt her or harm her. I'd take a bullet for her, or a thousand. I'd give her every ounce of love and effort I have. I'd make sure I finished medical school and every barrier in between it and getting a job, not only for myself and my dreams, but motivated during my most difficult nights of studying, so that I could provide for her and for our children. That every dream I ever hoped for in a woman, she fulfills. That I know her inside and out, her every hope, dream, desire, and would never let anything happen to her. That I am so totally in love with her, that there isn't a man on Earth except her own father who sacrifice everything he is in order to take care of her. That I'd move to any place on Earth, if I had to, to be with her, to marry her, to love her till my last breath. 

Imagine that I love her so much, that if a doctor said for some reason, she couldn't have children or there was some issue with me or her or us, that I'd throw it to the wind, and stay with her and adopt so that whatever family I had, it would be with her. 

I'd hope that you'd be happy for me. That you'd be happy for her. Happy for me that I'm so in love. Happy for her that she has me to love her and that I care for her so much, and you know that anything I've ever done, I've done with all of my heart.

Imagine that people judged me and her for being together and made our lives difficult. That this woman who is like my air, my water, who I'm so in love with that I feel every little bit of pain she feels and want nothing more than to live a normal life with, full of the kind of love and happiness I saw you two share, is being kept from me because of what other people think.

Now imagine, that its Kayla. That the girl I love is Kayla. My sister. Your daughter. You probably figured it out from the little story details I put in there.

You can stop imagining Mom, Dad. Because it is. It is Kayla. And everything I wrote is true. I want you to go up to the top and read this again. I want you to read Dad, that Kayla is in the hands of the ONE MAN on Earth BESIDES you, who would, literally, die for her. Mom, I want you to read that there's no one on Earth who could ever know her as well, take care of her as well, know her every fear and hope and dream as well as me. That there isn't a girl on this planet who could make me as happy.

Everything you would ever want for me in a woman, Kayla is. And everything you'd ever want for Kayla, she tells me, as I write this :)  I am. 
It doesn't matter that we share genetic material. It doesn't matter that she's my sister. I will cherish her and serve her and protect her, for the rest of my life.

We have a lot more to tell you, but nothing that beats this revelation honestly. We are driving in Friday like I told you and will fly out to school again on Sunday. We wanted to give you a few days to process it. And I'm expecting you to yell at us on the family telegram group two minutes after you read this or get a thousand calls. That's ok. Say everything you need to say. But I want you to read the beginning of the letter over and over again until I tell you it is me and her and realize how real, how beautiful, how perfect this is.

You have the right to know everything, and we won't hide anything from you and we won't tell anyone except you.  

Kayla is sitting next to me as I write this and this letter is from her as much as it is from me, but in case you decide to be really mad at one of us, you can take it out on me first :)

We love you so much, we are thankful to you for every moment of love you gave us both and continue to give us. You are the guiding lights in both our lives, our compasses, our roots. Every good thing Kayla and I have, whether it's our successes, our health, our happiness, we owe to you. We both love you and we are so, so sorry that this letter is such a shock, and such a disappointment to you in so many ways. We know that our family is as straight-shooting as it comes, and I promise, we won't do anything or say anything publicly to hurt you or embarrass you. We will figure this out.

We can't wait to see you.

I am in a master's program away from my country, away from my family and friends. My first worry is about getting an internship for this summer, second about finances, third about finding someone to be in a serious relationship with.

Apart from all this, I think I just keep finding things to worry about or self pity about. I am not doing anything productive, I am slacking off in applying for internships (cuz looking at LinkedIn scares the hell out of me).  Everything good that happened in my life seems soon far off.

I wake up every morning with anxiety and every time I take a nap, I feel anxious. I feel anxious all evenings. Even the smallest things like going to the bank make me anxious. I don't know why. And then the worst of it is that I start crying.

My therapist says I should hang out with people, talk to someone, keep myself busy. But that's not always feasible (my friends have studies too). Besides it doesn't seem to be addressing the root cause. Can someone please tell me what to do? I have been meditating, doesn't seem to be helping much."

---My Situation--- I started my college career as a Graphic Design major, before switching to English with the intent of teaching, but when I decided that I really wasn’t cut out for it, I was sent into a depressive, desperate, emotional tailspin the entire fall semester as I struggled to figure out just what the hell I was going to DO with my life, with the major I had after scouring reddit and hearing an unsettling amount of horror stories of not only English majors, but of millennials in general. I’ve been asking myself brutally tough questions about what I hoped to accomplish in life, and as I see it, there’s a few paths I can see ahead of me that I can undertake with the major I have, or if I intend to switch entirely at this point. Each path has its own pros and cons related to practical viability considering where I am in life, what I want, and where I live – with each option, I’m willing to relocate.

*MARKETING/PR: From what I’ve read, English majors can make pretty nice careers here, and I could snugly add another minor alongside Graphic Design, either with marketing or computer science – giving me eight more classes, and at the absolute most, an extra school year to beef up my resume/ seek out  more relevant internships. I don’t know if that might even be enough, but It’s as viable an option as any. If I have a comp sci minor, that might also be an asset if I seek out if employers are interested in ""hard"" skills. There's not much in the way of opportunities down here, in terms of jobs, so I'm willing to relocate to upper areas of Texas. I live in the RGV of South Texas currently. After talking with my Career Advisor, I just might have a marketing internship lined up for me in the spring. I know there’s opportunities in places like San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, Galveston. 

I'm interested to hear honest feedback on my dilemma; if I can honestly work with what I have, or not. Thank you."

 I am planning on buying a car in about a year and a half. I really like the idea of actually gaining interest on my money. While i wait until then I would like my money to grow to put down a good initial deposit on the car.

I currently have a little less than $2k in a 1.05% APY savings account with Synchrony Bank. It will grow to about $9k after my internship this summer. It seems like a nice moderate and safe option for growth.

Since I'm young (21) and don't really have any bills or anything right to worry about (I have college covered with jobs and scholarships) I thought maybe some more aggressive strategies could work.

I've seen stuff like Wise Banyan for hassle free investing that they manage without fees and that seems rather attractive but I'm not savvy with any of that so I wanted to ask you all.

So, I am in year 2 of grad school and way behind. Just starting to get myself together. During my first year I did the coursework but little else. Now that I am expected to do research, I'm behind on my project and very anxious about my future and also what people in the department think about me. 

I was on an SSRI that was contributing to the amotivation, but I also have always had a severe lack of discipline. Over the summer I withdrew from this medication w/o consulting a doctor and had somewhat of a mental breakdown, but I am much better now, on better meds, and seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist. 

However, I'm still struggling. I always have a million things swimming around in my head at once, and internet addiction on top of all those interests and anxieties. My thesis (experiment) is way behind schedule and it looks like I'll have to ask the department for an extension. I have the feeling that I have a bad reputation amongst the faculty (beside my advisor who has been supportive) and generally I feel bad about myself. I've been working a lot more and making progress though since I've changed medications.

I am unsure whether I want to stay in the program, and even if I did, it's completely possible that my department will not advance me. I do have a real interest in the tech industry, doing industry research and I have some job experience which might help me get a foot in the door. That being said, since I feel like I haven't given school a fair shot, my project is still my priority. 

Here are all the things I've been thinking about/need to do, but I need help prioritizing them, staying on task, and eliminating the performance anxiety I feel which encourages me to procrastinate:

* Reading papers directly related to the literature review for my thesis
* Reading papers of general interest in my field that I should have read last year when I was underperforming
* General menial tasks related to my thesis project (editing, coding, etc)
* Statistics and R programming Coursera course (Helpful both for thesis and if I want to go into industry research)
* Industry research Coursera course
* Internship applications for industry research this summer
* guitar practice
* friends

Obviously some of these are more urgent than others and I have some sense of priority and have been doing the most work on thesis tasks, but whenever I work on anything, all the other things are swimming around in my head. Any advice?"

I have been to Disney world 2 times now and I loved it both times. After hearing about the college program, I instantly wanted to do it but after finding out that I probably would miss a semester really affects my decision, as I don't want to be in college forever but I am looking to go for a masters degree. I would really like to know the pros and cons of doing the program would be. I really don't want to waste a semester just because I want to enjoy myself, but because it really impacts my future and my professional career. And what would be the impact of choosing the college program over an typical internship that has to do with the degree I am working to attain. Thank you in advance"

Not fitting in, long hours, and commute?",SirAccountant,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5mci86/scared_and_anxious_to_start_in_big4_not_fitting/,"I interned in tax this past summer and it was okay. Good hours, sat all day and did minuscule work. Ate good food at training, had good intern events. However, the more I think about it, it was all just sugar coating for what's to come.

After the internship I came to realize that I didn't want to do tax. I feel like tax are for those who are good at problem solving, which I am not. I am super dumb, and it takes me a while to ""get"" tax. So, I changed my FT offer to assurance/audit.

I'm nervous because I don't have a type A personality. I'm an ISFJ, I listen. I talk when needed and I don't really engage in conversation. It's hard for me to relate to big 4 people because I seem to like other stuff than what they like. I'd rather talk about art, games, nature than talk about golf or any of that shit.

I also live almost and an hour and 15 minutes away from the office. During summer it would be fine because I was in tax. I stayed in the office majority of the time. But now that I'm in audit, I'm just afraid that my commute would be a disadvantage since I'll be at client sites, traveling etc. 

I also read horrible stories about staff burning out after like a year or so and how public has deteriorated their mental health and public health. 

I was excited to start for the big 4, now I'm  not. 

Also the cpa has been making me super depressed. I've crammed BEC in a week and am taking it in 3 days. I am utterly fucked.

Mom is crazy, I keep thinking someone is listening and watching me especially in my car.

-

Back in Spring 2015 I was at a rave or concert with my four others and we all took molly. It was my first time taking this drug- Prior I have only tried marijuana and alcohol. As a result, I did not get a wink of sleep for two whole months straight (or more, it's hard to tell). I had a lot of anxiety and visited 30 different specialized doctors, 3 ER visits because of anxiety, and 12 or 17 different prescriptions for sleep aids, anti-psychotic, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, and for chronic headache. I was finally able to sleep again, gradually adding more hours, from going on Zoloft. But going on Zoloft made me wake up with visual snow/static, and onto afterimages, trails following object in motion, etc. I was later diagnosed with Hallucinogen Persisting Perceptual Disorder (HPPD). At this point I was getting Ds and Fs when I used to only get As. I became impulsive, started dying my hair, cutting it, wearing makeup differently, spending money I didn't have, getting piercings, and so on. Later I switched to Lexapro. On it I went to visit my Dad in motherland March 2016, the last time I saw him was early October in 08', I stayed for 1.5 months, came back, didn't work or have classes for about 2 months, then switched to Effexor XR. So while for Fall 2015, and Spring 2016, I had very poor marks, recently Fall 2016, I took four classes and got 3 As and 1 B. I got off my antidepressant the first week of December. 

From not working for the two months after I came back from motherland, I accumulated a lot of debt. At that time, I paid $400 in car insurance every month along with $375 of monthly car payments, and ~$30 in health insurance. I had to borrow money to meet those deadlines. I didn't get a job as soon as possible because I realized my sleep and mental health significantly improved with decreased stress- it was my attempt to remain on vacation even though it was over. I was overdue for a job so I finally got one.

It was around this time classes started. I went to the girl's bathroom and noticed a Louis Vuitton wallet on the toilet dispenser. Inside was ~$215 in cash. I analyzed the wallet, she was a white, blonde, blue eyed woman about my age, who looked like she had a good life and me taking this cash would not affect her. I was negative in my bank account, I needed money to pay off bills. So I took the cash. But I left everything else there because when I had my wallet stolen, it was a pain replacing everything I had lost. Then I went upstairs, thought about how the police didn't care about my situation when I was the victim, and how the bank credited me all of the $950 from my debit card, so I went back to the bathroom and took her debit and credit card. I did feel guilty. I was asking for reassurance from my friends, and even had trouble driving home that day because it was weighing over my mind. Later that evening I got an email from campus Police regarding a missing item. (I think they looked at the camera facing the ladies room entrance/exit) Not even 5 minutes had passed and I’m dialing the phone number from the message. I started off with a lie but eventually told the truth as soon as they mentioned “things will go easier,” and “no one is pressing charges.” 

That same night I got an envelope and put all her belongings in it with an index card and a message along time lines of “I’m sorry, I don’t remember if it was $213 or $215 but here is $220, I hope this doesn’t affect your faith in humanity.” My friend at class that following day and I had errands the next, so I requested for her to deliver it to the station for me. Long story short: they wanted me to come in, I didn’t understand why, they told me I “need to sign some things,” so I went in and then and there I learn charges were being pressed against me, I was arrested, and now I have a court date coming up facing 3 felonies (grand larceny &lt;$200, credit card theft, credit card theft). I felt awful, I sent the victim a long message through Facebook explaining myself- not justifying- of why I did what I did and how sorry and deeply regretful I am. She ignored it. When I went to meet the Student Conduct Coordinator on campus to receive sanctions, he told me the victim claims I’m lying and I took ~$400. I did not.

All the while the new job I found was hosting at a restaurant. Though I was sleeping again, it was not the restful sleep I knew all my life. By the end of every shift I felt both high and drunk, unable to talk to customers, slow reactions, half asleep, basically if you looked at me it would almost seem like no one’s home. So I turned to something easier. I got on a website where me a young college girl, can meet older rich men (Sugar Daddys), act like their girlfriend, and get huge compensations. So I quit my job, and started doing that instead. But so many men have taken advantage of my naivety, and so many men made me hate people especially men. At a point I would see neighbors outside and would wonder how they would act if they knew they could get away with it.

I used to have amazing memory, people would always comment “wow, you remember all that?” Now it’s hard to remember what I even did this morning. When I talk to someone it takes a long time for me to process what they had just said. It was never like this before. Oftentimes I don’t want to keep them waiting on a response so I’ll say something and a few days later, after I have processed the situation, I realize I didn’t mean what I said. When someone speaks to me in English, I know they are saying something, but it sounds like noise with no value. The classes at college used to be so easy. The tests easier. Now I try harder than I ever have. I feel stupider. It’s so hard to learn things now. I used to learn things and they would stick to me, now I have to tell myself to let it stick, and even then it doesn’t work. I feel stagnate, stuck, my reality is like a dream (depersonalization/derealization), because of all this I feel depressed this is who I am. I still have H.P.P.D. visual symptoms, along with tinnitus, and physical symptoms of anxiety when I sleep my entire body feels like it’s vibrating (kind of like when your foot falls asleep). Also I’m too afraid to even apply for internships and jobs because of court. I don’t want it to confirm my fear that this case has just made it harder for me to work for a company. I constantly hope to be killed/murdered; I don’t want to suicide though, that feels more preventable. 

Also I think it’s important to also mention my Mom was always physically and emotionally abusive. She is better only now but I think it’s cause I’m sponsoring her green card. My Mom doesn’t know anything I’m going through. My friends on the other hand do know but easily forget. And I got tested for herpes today. My doctor is pretty positive, I get the results next week. Also experiencing paranoia. I keep looking around when I get out of my park thinking someone is waiting for me. Usually the someone I expect is a boy I'm seeing- like Sugar Dad. "

First off, thanks to all participants in this sub.  It has become my most frequented, and I spend countless time here daily.  Even if experiences are not my own, I try to learn from everything I read here.    

So, regarding the car.  I was in a bind when I purchased; I needed something dependable quickly.  I ended up with exactly that, which is great, however my credit made this a very unfriendly deal.  My only option was a 7 year term at something absurd like 18%.  The only good news here is while I was starting an internship as a software developer, I was also working part-time at a car dealership so the total price was a great deal, only around 14k, for a 2014 Fusion with only 30k miles, and a 100k mile warranty.  I am coming up on my third year in the term having not missed a single payment.  However my credit has not budged whatsoever.  I  have zero credit card debt, all my bills are paid on time, and the only things hurting my credit are a few poorly timed medical bills that came at a time without insurance(ranging 5-7 years ago).    

Without inadvertently turning this into a credit recovery discussion, does anyone have any advice on how I can possibly refinance, and hopefully lower the payments or shorten the term?  Like I said, I read this sub every day, and I could be using that money for emergency funds, IRAs, index funds, etc.  I am open to just about anything short of selling the car(this would take some major convincing).    

Thanks in advance for reading, and any insight that can be offered.  I really value /r/personalfinance's opinion, and hopefully something positive will come of this post!    

Thanks

For my whole life I didn't care much for human contact - I was fine with reading books, playing video games, generally enjoying things by myself. It all changed in summer of 2015, when I shared an internship with a girl, let's call her P. At first I was kinda cautious, but she turned out to be very friendly and kind. I quickly grew very fond of her and longed for her companion. There wasn't enough work for both of us, so we were spending a lot of time together. But, finally the internship ended and I was very sad when it came time to say goodbye. We promised to meet sometime in the future.

Getting to know her made me change my way of thinking - I realised that other people are valuable and I started to work on relationships. I started to make friends and enjoy their company. Because of P, I decided that I needed to better myself. I started going to the gym and picked up playing guitar. I don't know, you could say she became my muse.

We studied on the same university, so we sometimes run into each other or hung out after classes. We often didn't see each other for weeks at a time and I was going crazy. I never missed anybody so much, I didn't even think it was possible. Still, I didn't want to be too annoying, she had other things to do as well. However, after meeting with her, I was very sad because I knew this meant I won't see her for some time.

During last year, I had several girls interested in me in the romantic sense, but it didn't work out. Every time I went out with one of them, the whole time I was thinking ""Man, I wish this was P"". The girls vere attractive, funny, I couldn't say anything wrong about them, but I just didn't feel the same connection like with P.

I decided that I need to take the risk and tell her everything. Yesterday I came over to hang out with her, and I finally said how I felt about her. P was very nice about it, but kinda sad. She explained that she liked me very much and knew right away that I would be a good friend, but she had a boyfriend for several years, so that's it. 

I was very surprised, because there was literally no clue towards her being in a relationship. There were situations when it seemed like she was into me. Whenever she told me about somewhere she went, it was always with her friends or parents, not a word about a bf. I was prepared for rejection, but felt like I never even had a chance, because she was already with somebody.

I guess that's on me - should've asked her if she was in a relationship. 

Anyway, now I probably won't see her ever again. She said she doesn't want to push me away and we could still hang out, but I don't think it would be possible. 

I really wanted to get this off my chest and am seriously thinking about going to some therapy. I don't think I can deal with this on my own. I realise that it's not healthy to depend on someone so much. She was the force that kept me going, I enjoyed doing things with her in mind.

I guess I imagined this perfect world where we would be a happy couple, but now i know we can't be together.

I don't know how to go on."

* Recently began regularly attending PT with local Marines every MW morning to improve my endurance/learn more about how things work 
* Projected graduation date: Fall 2018
* Though I have obligations the upcoming summer which would prevent me from participating in any sort of extended training, I intend to keep the entire following summer of 2018 open in case I do follow through with this opportunity.

**Timeline:** What would my timeline in potentially becoming an officer look like, from training to potentially being selected, to signing?

* What is a yearly schedule like for someone in active duty?

**Presidency:** I have had many individuals warning me to consider the fact that Trump is now president. Research tells me that Trump’s presidency likely makes little difference on deployment/lifestyle and that it should not hold any weight when considering joining. 

* What are your thoughts on this?

**PT:** I have grown up as an athlete and love keeping myself physically fit. I currently run 3 miles in ~24 minutes (still working on it). 

* I am weakest in pull-ups. Any advice in improving?

5mdyyf,1,2017-01-06,Is this woman worth LTR?,fakeplastictrees87,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/5mdyyf/is_this_woman_worth_ltr/,"Prepare for long read, but it's interesting. Didn't experience this one before.    

Just to say, I got access to all her Facebook messages history, Whatsapp history and all I read, she always told me the truth.    

She said she slept with 6 guys, including me.    
Based on her chat history with her female friends.    

- First boyfriend of 3 years (he cheated on her, without sex on party - girl jumped on him, and he fingered her, but she ofc stayed with him, it was first and virginity taker)    
- Guy she hosted at her parents home 2 years after she was studying with him, based on chats she liked him 2 years ago but nothing happened (she told he came for 1 day and she initiated, she says she didn't have sex for 2 years, so she was thirsty + lust from before). He is in different country, so obv she didn't have intention for LTR.    
- Guy she slept during NY 2014/2015(5 days for new year) and she sniffed cocaine (knowing him by mutual friend who visited them, and then that guy inivited her to the place). alpha i guess. He cheated with her on gf, but told her after, he obv never fucked her after, while she still trying to contact him. Obv he lived in London, so she couldn't have LTR intention with him..    
- Guy she slept in 2015/2016 while on internship in London, it was bartender that she just wanted for fun - she told me she wanted some fun. another alpha that stopped responding to her after he was ocassionaly fucking her over the period of 2 months. No LTR intention obv..    
- Guy in start of June 2016(over weekend) - Friend she liked back 4 years in uni as well, but didn't happen. She hosted him in her place in London. He is from Ireland, so obv dunno how this would work LTR. She said to her female friend, he came in 2 min and was not sexy, so sex was definitely decider for losing interest in him, and that now at least she is happy to know what she could've missed at least..... ..
    
The thing is all sex that happened, she always discussed with her female friends, so I am quite surprised she was honest with these 5 guys based on chat history (if something happened that she didn't tell her buddies, that's other story).    
    
- She told me she almost slept with one guy in uni after kissing 2 guys, but he didn't want to fuck her because they were drunk. I read the same in messages how she explained to her girls.    
    
- She told me wanted to fuck the guy who had girlfriend, which she actually ate with, while with him, when girlfriend visited, and this is what bothers me the most. She told me this, and texts confirm as well, that she wanted to fuck him and showing no mercy to other woman, but she didn't fuck him because it end up not having a chance.    

So she was always telling me the truth. I read from the texts, that she wanted to steal a guy from a girl, unsuccessfuly while in uni 4 years ago. She is introvert girl, that didn't get much attention from peers.    

Because she basically had 4 one night stands(weekend, 5 days, fuck buddy is one night for me). and one real and me now for 6 months.   

I feel bad, because she is 26 and now soon 27 in february, so I think she wanted to fuck as much on internship as possible, before going back home and since she is 27 she knows she wont have chance anymore.    

Now with me she never made any mistake ever. I set my boundaries (of not seing any male friends etc), she accepted without hesitation. She doesn't speak with any guys or anything, I have access to everything.   

But it still bothers me what she did with 2 guys before me, and her attitude of ""whorishness"" while having no empathy trying fucking that guy while knowing he was cheat and knowing he has gf that she met in real life.    

Her 2 best female friends from uni 4 years ago, have no issues with sluting of course, and all friends from chats always were saying ""sure do it, have confidence, you'll never see him again"", that's why i think she got motivated for london internship parade and the thinking it is her last chance.. We know that they are all sluts anyway..    

Btw, the last guy before she met me, she fucked 2 weeks before she met me, so if she didn't meet me, I think she would continue with her parade in internship.. ?

I never considered myself to be a really brilliant student. I'd say that I'm above average, to say the least. My grades have been quite okay, considering my performance, in the past three semesters. Well, after Winter break, I'm back in Uni, and can't seem to focus/concentrate on my studies. I just can't seem to get up and do what I'm supposed to do. I don't seem to have the fire, the eagerness I had before. It's kinda like imposter syndrome, like I don't feel like I quite fit in, even though my grades were perfectly okay than half of the class. I feel like I'm really missing out on something. In addition to that, my self confidence is very low. I've been depressed in the past, but what I'm experiencing right now feels different. It surely isn't depression. I'm clearly distracted. I know I wasted a lot of time in the past. Most of my peers were doing internships, during December, while I gave up my internship at HP, because I didn't feel like I would fit in, when I was even shortlisted. It's a really disturbing feeling, and I've got these voices in my head that feed me fear. I've got goals, big dreams, but I just can't feel like I can achieve them. I restrict myself from drugs, alcohol, girls, and going out, too. I'm pretty ugly to be dating other people. That's not even a priority for me now. I just want to get some good grades, and learn a lot of stuff, which would help me for Grad school.
Can you help me? What tips can you give me?"

5meaoe,12,2017-01-06,Job Decisions,TheDreadedLorax,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/5meaoe/job_decisions/,"I need mom advice and my mom isn't very good at being a mom when it comes to things like this.  I'm sorry for the novel ahead of you.

**Backstory:**

I work in a niche field that's mostly contract work.  A few years ago I scored a permanent position at a university that allowed me to create my own job description.  I've used this opportunity to grow skills that will increase my chances of spending most of my career in other permanent positions, rather than hop from contract to contract.

I absolutely love this job.  My boss loves me and trusts me.  He comes to me for my expertise and he listens to what I have to say. I'm given free reign to work on projects I think are worthwhile.  I've also been given tools to increase any skillsets I think would be pertinent whenever there is down time.  The second I mention wanting or needing something, it's provided for me.  He even hired me an employee when I said I was getting stressed with the amount of tasks on my plate.  Pay is great.  Benefits are even better.  I've been rewarded with multiple huge promotions (along with healthy pay raises) over the past few years and I'm slated for a senior level position in 2 more years.

I bought a house less than a year ago.  I'm almost finished fixing it up.  I love my house.  It's allowed me to adopt a bunch of fluffy pets that I adore.  My husband interned here over the summer and the company wants to hire him when he graduates from grad school in a couple months.

I hate this area.  I'm so lonely.  I live in a very ""old"" area.  By that I mean, the median age is 71.  I'm less than half that age.  There are very few young people.  The young people I meet either came down here with a SO who left them or were transferred here by their jobs.  They're all trying to leave.  It feels like, every time I befriend someone, they move away.

My husband and I have also been talking about having kids once he graduates.  We're both in our early 30s.  My mother had a hard time conceiving, so I feel the clock ticking.  Here's where we hit another plus for this current job:  They have fantastic insurance, maternity leave, and they'll work with me to slowly transition back to work.

For the above reasons, the plan was to stay here for another 3 years or so.  We were going to have our kids. I'd hit my promotion.  Husband would get a few years working here under his skin (big fish in a little pond career experience).  We hoped that having kids would have the additional benefit of helping us find a more-permanent circle of friends.

**Dilemma:**

Before I took this current job, I discovered a different company that I'd love to work for 1000+ miles away.  I contacted them, but they weren't hiring at the moment.  Now, several students I greatly helped while they attended the university are working there.

One of those students contacted me several weeks ago.  The company is now hiring and they asked that I apply.  I declined because of the above reasons.  The owner of the company then reached out to me.  Again, I declined, but agreed to go on a tour of the facility when I was in that neck of the woods over Christmas.

The tour could not have gone better.  We had some amazing conversations about both my work and theirs.  They even treated me to lunch.  Again, they pushed me to accept a position there.  

The problem is, I think I want to take this position.  The place was beautiful.  Everyone was so friendly.  They had me meet all their senior level staff.  I'm so impressed with the place.  I was very open about the reasons I'm happy where I am currently.  I explained how I had hoped to move in several years, but they just responded with, ""There will always be a position here for you."" Eventually they asked if there were a tentative timeline we could talk about.  I stated that there was no way I could leave before July.  I couldn't abandon students mid-school year.  Plus then I'd need time to wrap up all my projects.  They didn't bat an eye.  Again, I made sure to stress that this was all tentative and I wasn't committing to anything.  They assured me that was fine.

I've been in near constant contact with the company and I like everything I hear.  I sent an email to the owner a couple days ago, asking some rather forward questions.  I figured, what do I have to lose?  His response was perfect.

He thanked me for asking the questions and complemented me on my honesty and intelligence.  He then asked if I'd be willing to participate in a Skype call next week with all his senior staff, since he believes they would be better at answering some of the questions that he would be.  I accepted.

Now I'm getting to the point where I know I'm going to have to make a decision pretty quickly after this Skype call.  I appreciate the, ""There's always a position here for you,"" but I'm a realist.  I know ""always"" doesn't mean ""forever"" in business speak.  I've been trying to evaluate the pros and cons of this new company, but I feel like I'm stuck in a deadlock.

**Pros:**

My husband would be happy in either location.  He loved his internship, but the new company is located in his hometown.  He would have more opportunities (and competition, but he's brilliant, so this won't be an issue), but it would be a small fish in a big pond situation.  He's not worried though.

For the past few years, I haven't been actually doing the thing I'm trained in.  I've been helping students do it.  I really miss doing that thing, but it's so time intensive that it's difficult to do it and make progress on my own.  This would be an opportunity to do that thing again, while surrounded by people doing the same thing and pushing me to improve.

I've wanted to work for this company for years.  Everyone I speak to seems to love their job. I'd fit right in with the company culture.

I have friends in the area.  I would have a social life again!  The people I currently work with are all older than I and have families of their own.  In the three years I've been here, I think I've gone out twice with co-workers.  A friend I have at the new company has referred to her coworkers as ""family.""  I want that.

Our current house is between two colleges.  The plan was always, once we leave, to rent it to college students rather than sell it.

My current boss is at retirement age, though he hasn't mentioned retiring.  If things were to go south at this new company, as long as he were around, I could return to my position. At his age, I don't know how long he'll continue to work here.

**Cons:**

I haven't been given a number yet, though I know I have wiggle room for negotiation, but I don't think they'll be able to pay me what I make here.  I've spoken with my friend and she's given me her ballpark salary.  From that, I can extrapolate what they'll most likely offer me.  I know the benefits are nowhere near as good.  Though, my husband would make more money working in this city and would probably make up a good chunk of the difference.  

Moving is expensive.  Last year I not only moved to a new house, I also moved everything out of my childhood home across the country.  After two moves, I'm pretty broke.

Housing scares me.  I'd have to get the current house ready to rent.  I do love it, but I can't bring myself to sell it, and I think I'd be silly to anyway.  Since we just moved, we're low on funds.  I know I'd have to put some money into the house to get it running up to rental standards. 

The pets make the situation much more complicated too.  Keeping them is non-negotiable.  Finding a rental that will allow all of them is going to be near impossible.  The best we'd be able to do is to find a pricey rental house in the suburbs, which means we'd need a 2nd car.  I don't know how we save up money that way.

What we really need is to buy a house.  The best option we've come up with here sucks.  Husband's aunt would take the cats.  We'd move in (with the dogs) with his parents until we found a house.  This brings up a whole slew of issues.

First, I've always made a point of adopting the ""unadoptable"" pets, because I've been in a position to.  This living situation will cause the cats (separation anxiety) a lot of stress.  I can visit them daily if need be, but I know how much time/energy that'll take.  The dogs come from terrible situations themselves too. I've spent countless hours and thousands of dollars working with them and training them.  Whenever my father-in-law comes over (which is rarely), he ignores my training with the dogs.  I'm afraid he would undo all the work I've done.  If you knew how bad the situation was with these dogs, you'd understand what a big deal this is.

Secondly, I'd be living with my in-laws.  They really are wonderful people and I love them dearly...but that's very close proximity for a long time.  I don't want to ruin the relationship we have.  I know they'd take us in and never ask for anything in return, but I'd still feel indebted to them.  

We'd have to put off having kids another year.  This breaks my heart a little.  I desperately want kids.  I'm worried that, with genetic issues, it will become very difficult to conceive as I age.

What do I do?  My gut tells me this is a once-in-a-lifetime and to go for it, but there's a voice in the back of my head reminding me constantly how good I have it.  I'm excited at the thought of starting a new adventure, until I think about all the cons it's going to entail.

I need a mom right now."
5mejrg,2,2017-01-06,Mother doesn't keep up her promise,Cheesus_Bacon_Crisp,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5mejrg/mother_doesnt_keep_up_her_promise/,"Last year, by November, I've finally managed to get a therapist so I could have someone to talk to, and try to solve my issues.

One of the things I've discussed with her was about my mother, and how she'd excessively try to shove me to do things over and over again, everyday, which not only I found absurdly annoying, but exhausting as well.

""I think you should find an internship at your college. It's very important for your education. Why didn't you find one yet? You're not even trying. Everyone is looking for internships and planning out their future, and you're not doing anything, you're being lazy. You'll be a nobody if you keep up like this""

""Don't you think you should call your friends and hang out with them? You're always at your room at your computer. You never go out. People will think you're a freak. Don't you think you should put on nicer clothes? You look like a freak""

""Why don't you have a girlfriend yet? Everyone at your age has one already. All your female friends are so pretty, why aren't you asking them out? You're not gay, are you? I don't have a problem with gays, but I don't want my son to be one"" 

Me and my therapist have discussed this, and she said that she'd call my parents over, and try to talk about that.

At first I was afraid of that, but after thinking a bit, I realized that, maybe, my mother would listen to a professional. She spoke to my parents, then spoke to me. She said that she had made an agreement with my mother, that she'd try not to speak those things and stop putting so much pressure on me.

So, what do you think happened next? Did my mom, upon my arrival at home, hugged me and, in tears, apologized to everything that she has done to me, and we all lived happily ever after?

Haha

No.

She just kept doing it. But now, with a little addition: she'd keep saying the same things, and after saying it, she'd raise her hands in surrender, as if she was the victim, and say ""But since you won't let me give you suggestions, I won't say it""

Ha, fuck my life."
5mepgi,5,2017-01-06,I'm def hypomanic right now. [Long] [brief vague mention of suicide/self harm],[deleted],BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/5mepgi/im_def_hypomanic_right_now_long_brief_vague/,"I just spent 2 hours thinking through extremely detailed plans about studying abroad next year and getting in shape. I'm already accepted to a university in the UK, but it's only a possibility if I show my parents a ton of maturity this semester and get really good grades. I researched medication import laws for the UK, planned how my psych could manage my medications while I'm abroad, planned to study four hours a day(I've never studied 4 hours a week in my life), get the top scores in my year, and get a high paying summer internship. 

I'm working on my weight, as abilify and depression had increased my appetite dramatically this fall, and I, a short woman, starting at 130 lbs, gained 20 lbs in two months. I then switched to latuda, which has been a godsend, lifting my depression and being weight neutral for me. I've lost 7 lbs over winter break, due to CICO, my fitness pal, r/loseit, and r/fatlogic. I plan on continuing my weight loss over the semester and summer, and am planning on losing about 40 lbs(I'm really short).  I'm going to lift weights this spring, and have found a few experienced friends to go to the gym with a few times a week. I also chose a program from the r/xxfitness recommended list. Now that I'm manicy, I started making plans to start running 3x a week over the summer and then run everyday, lift regularly, and play rugby in the fall, in addition to studying 4 hours everyday and being the top student in my year at one of the top universities in the UK. I also planned how I'd have a great social life and a new hot girlfriend/boyfriend. I already have a boyfriend, and we're doing great, but if I study abroad, we might not do long distance. 

I also thought about how I'd later post on reddit about all of this success and get karma for my progress pics and an inspiring story about succeeding with bipolar and ADHD.

This planning was all while in the shower and lying in bed wrapped in a towel post shower without even getting dressed. My room is a disaster(like can't see the floor cause clothes and towels), I've needed to wash clothes for about a week, and I need to study some stuff I've forgotten, so I can do well next semester.

This has been brewing for the past couple days, I've been ignoring all the stuff I need to do and instead been researching transferring to a better school within the US, which is fine, as it influences what courses I need to take, but I've gotten really specific and spent hours a day talking about it. 

I can't even apply to transfer until next spring because I bombed last semester. I attempted suicide and landed in the hospital the first week of school, was deeply depressed for a few months, and almost went inpatient when my insurance/doctor messed up and I didn't have abilify for a week and was self harming and suicidal every night, instead of going inpatient, my boyfriend stayed with me whenever I was awake, until a few days after I was back on meds and feeling better. I ended up withdrawing from all but one class, and getting an F in that one class. When I retake the class in the fall, the old grade will be expunged and replaced with the new one.

After that incident, and the realization of the weight gain, and a new diagnosis of bipolar 2, my psych switched abilify to latuda, started titrating lamictal, and later decreased my lexapro to 10mg / day.

Earlier this week, I was on 20mg vyvanse, 150mg lamictal(titrating to 200mg at 25mg/week, no rash!), 80mg latuda, and 10mg lexapro. The latuda was causing evening anxiety and I was having trouble staying asleep. I saw my psych Tuesday, and he told me to slowly decrease latuda to 40 mg (I'm on 60 at the moment), and added .5 mg Klonopin for sleep/evening anxiety. I've slept well the past few nights, despite the hypomania, and no longer had evening anxiety. 

I forgot to take the latuda right after dinner and have been taking it about an hour later for a couple days. I also have not done any more studying, despite the vyvanse, which had been working great until the drop in latuda. I blamed this and what I now think was hypomania on getting used to the vyvanse and texted my doctor, and he told me to take 2 vyvanse today. I took two vyvanse and had coffee and that's when the obvious hypomania rolled in. I've also been extremely fidgety today, smacking my lips constantly. 

I texted my psych and over about ten messages(that read super hypomanic) explained all this and asked him what dosages to change. I'm waiting for a response and the focus to get off reddit and actually get dressed. 

Ugh. This is so frustrating. Earlier this week, I was getting work done, and my meds seemed to be working great besides the sleep/anxiety from the latuda. I was short term motivated to study and clean and it was great. 

The bright side is that I'm in contact with and working with my psych and I haven't been suicidal, or feeling like self harm since Thanksgiving. Also, this is the first winter in a few years where I haven't gotten clinically depressed, and the bipolar meds are working so much better than the depression meds were. I guess I should ask my psych whether to decrease the lexapro again, as SSRIs are known to cause mania and depression even when combined with a mood stabilizer. I'm also extremely med compliant, use a weekly morning/evening pill box, have reminders on my phone, and have only missed one dose in the past month. 

Also, my psych is great. I've had him since I was 7 when I just had ADHD, and though he diagnosed bipolar 2 as opposed to depression/anxiety a little later than my hypomanic symptoms started(I was 17, and it wasn't too obvious that it was out of the norm), he's always been great about working with me on meds and treatment and finding good therapists. I really feel like we work together well. I am pretty knowledgeable about bipolar meds, and often his suggestions are what I was planning on asking for. He took into account my weight gain and helps me avoid meds that increase appetite. The only time he offered a med that I asked for an alternative to was Xanax, where I requested Klonopin. He listed the pros and cons, and I decided on Klonopin. Also, he's great at giving me multiple options and giving me the pros and cons of each.

Hopefully, with a few med tweaks, I can be back to the stable productivity I was at earlier this week, minus the latuda induced anxiety and sleep problems, and able to go back to college next week, and do well this semester. 

Update: As the vyvanse/coffee from this morning has worn off, I've become much less hypomanic. I'm still talking a little fast, fidgeting, and am a little euphoric, but not nearly as grandiose. No longer in the ""write a 1,155 word reddit post on mobile about how hypomanic I am"" phase. My psych texted me back and said to go back to 80mg Latuda and 20mg vyvanse and avoid the coffee. My boyfriend doesn't seem to mind that I sent him a link to this post and 20 separate paragraph long texts explaining various things about bipolar(esp. Hypomania) while he was at work and couldn't respond. (Before his shift, I mentioned I was hypomanic and he asked what that entailed, so the texts were somewhat justified)"
5mevgi,14,2017-01-06,Do agencies usually hire after a 3-months internship?,Kayters,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/5mevgi/do_agencies_usually_hire_after_a_3months/,"Hi guys,

I'm going to start a 3 months internship in two weeks. The agency is in London and they're going to pay the minimum wage for this 3 months.

The contract is 20hrs per week (because I'm finishing university) and I've asked if they're going to hire me if there's a good fit, and they replied by saying that they have no reasons to not hire me if I'll do well.

Having said that, what's usually happens after a 3 months internship in this industry? Should I keep interviewing in another agencies, while I've a secured position for 3 months? I think it'd be easier to get a job while I already have one.

I also need to change house in the next 2 weeks and I'm looking at some apartments. They cost more of what I'm paying now, but if I've a salary there're no problems with that. I don't know what I'd do if they not hire me though.

What do you guys suggest?

Thanks!"

Today was really bad as we yelled at each other for quite some time and the bout ended with my mom running upstairs and crying and my dad saying I'm no longer his son and I should change my last name and ignoring me (run-on sentence I know). My mother has depression so I am sitting on the stairwell outside her room to make sure nothing extreme  happens and to wait until everyone calms down before I try and talk to either of them. 

This is the first time I've contemplated doing this as for the past weak, I've mainly been locking myself in my room and ignoring everyone when we argue as I don't want to argue forever. Typically, the arguments begin with something menial but then explode into a big fight about everything. I usually argue that they treat my unfairly, they argue that other kids don't act like me and how I lack respect. I argue that they never listen to me (which they usually don't), and they say I don't listen to them.

Most recently, I had an internship interview with a business company and wanted to buy new dress shoes (don't own any) and we had an argument over that. They said wearing any shoe is fine whereas I told them I want dress shoes (all other interviewers are typically in suit and dress shoes as it is in finance, I would purchase with my own money from working this past semester). My parents are both blue collar workers so I say I know more about this field than them and this exploded even more. I told them I just want to sit down and talk without raising voices or cursing but my dad won't listen and is just saying I'm not his son and my mother is still blaming everything on me. Even if everything is my fault, how can I fix this? I have a lot of pride, I know how interviews go and it is very difficult to secure a summer internship as a sophomore so I don't want anything to lessen my chances.

They constantly say that once I grow older I will for sure abandon them and never talk to them again but I would never do that. I'm not sure how to get any points across as I don't know their native language and they don't know mine. It feels like whenever I say something, it gets ignored or goes over their heads and because it doesn't seem like they're listening, I don't feel any obligation to listen to them.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I am always having screaming battles with my parents. I'm really prideful and hate losing arguments even though winning an argument is hardly winning which usually leads to a lot of escalation on both sides. I want to fix this but I don't know how. My parents are immigrants with english as a second language (very low level) so it is hard for both sides to get points across.

5mgc4a,4,2017-01-06,Opportunities for programming work within Target Corporation?,target_questions,Target,https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/5mgc4a/opportunities_for_programming_work_within_target/,"Hey guys, this is something I've been curious about for a while now.

I'll be finishing my degree this spring, majoring in Computer Science. I don't know much about what internal IT/programming/CS work is done at Target. Does anyone know anything about what sort of IT/CS jobs Target would be looking to hire for?

I've done a little research and it seems like Target used to outsource all of it's software design work to other companies, but I read that in more recent years Target is making an effort to bring the technical computer work back to internal teams.

Let me add that I am a current Team Member, I've been with my store (and the company) for over 3 years now. I also know the kind of position I'm looking for would be with corporate. Aside from what opportunities Target would be hiring a CS major for, I am also curious if my status as an already employed TM would make it easier for me to get a new job with corporate which allows me to do work more closely associated with my degree.

I also know that corporate personnel visit my school regularly to attend career fairs here and give out information. And I know that typically, Target seems to be looking for college grads to fill out ETL positions in its stores. I know people who went through the ETL internship program and are now working their ETL positions. Most of the ETLs at my store when I started were replaced with college grads.

So it seems that there is a high demand for new ETLs and other management positions within the retail scope of operations within Target, and while this is a good backup plan for me, I'm really much more interested in getting a career job that relates to my computer science degree and I'm wondering what the demand for CS work within Target is.

More specifically, I'd be looking for software development/engineering work, or information security work. I imagine that infosec/cyber security is now a pretty big deal within Target after the big breach a couple of years ago.

Thanks!"

My parents currently pay for my expenses like rent, food etc which totals to ~$500/month. I'm also thinking of working part time where I'll be earning ~2k. I'm not a heavy spender and I want to use the credit card to build my credit. 

I was thinking of applying for either the Discover It student card or the Capital One Journey card. Which card is better? I want to limit hard inquiries into my credit score. I'm aware of the cards details, like APR's and cashback offers, but I was wondering which one increases your credit lines more, is more widely accepted, is better for the long-term, etc. Also, which one is more likely to accept me? I'm also unsure what I should report as my income on the applications...

I applied to the discover it card a couple of months ago, but got rejected as I have no credit history, and I reported 0 income.

5mgo3c,2,2017-01-06,Being Able To See The Future,Deivius7,precognition,https://www.reddit.com/r/precognition/comments/5mgo3c/being_able_to_see_the_future/,"I have been able to see my future since I were a child. At first I didn’t think much about them, I thought these visions were just another dream like any other at night. But then the dreams I had became reality and it got me thinking more and more about them with each vision that turned out to be real. I still remember the first vision I had and I won’t forget it no matter how much time will pass.

I was about 6 years old when I dreamed the first vision. I dreamed about going down the stairs at school and when I reached the bottom of the stairs I went around the corner and bumped into a kid who was in a class two grades lower then I was in. I knew this because I remembered him being in the same class as my brother. After we bumped into each other we just simply continued on and then the dream ended. Normally this could be seen as just any random dream but when I was about 7 or 8 years old I went down the stairs at school and when I reached the last step of those stairs I remembered the dream and I got a feeling of déjà vu and hesitated for a second. But then just as I wanted to continue on that exact same kid from the vision walked around the corner and we ALMOST bumped into each other. Because I was just a kid I didn’t think much about it and only thought it was strange for a second and then I just went on with whatever it was that I was going to do.

The other visions I got also came to be and because I had experienced it before I could act upon them and get away with things which I should have gotten in trouble with. For example I was quite depressed in school and skipped a lot and because the teacher would call your home to ask how you are after being “sick” for a while I tried to get back to school before getting into trouble with either my parents or school. Usually I told my parents that the teacher was sick and the class got dropped or I simply just went outside acting like as if I went too school but instead I was playing somewhere on my NintendoDS with some snacks and something to drink in order to avoid getting into trouble with my parents if they found out I skipped school. And thanks to a vision I knew I would get caught if I dragged it out too long and thankfully I could time my “being better again” before I got into trouble due to the school calling my home. I don’t know exactly how many visions I have had in total so far or how many of them came to be or how many I have avoided, but what I do know is that there are at least 7 that I remember well. 

Unfortunately those visions about the future became further apart from one another by each passing dream and it was not just the time between the dreams that became longer, but also the day that the dreams came to be took longer before they happened. The last vision I had was about 1 or 2 years ago and the one before that one was about 8 years ago and which came to be about 4 years ago. This dream showed me where I would go for intern, but without knowing this I just thought that it was a normal weird dream. Having never been inside that company before, having never heard of them before, having never been in that village before my intern made things even more special. The vision I had of me inside that company was about me working behind a desk and when I was called by someone behind me I turned around. So when I eventually got there for my intern I didn’t recognize it from the vision at all because a lot of time had passed and I had forgotten all about the dream. But then when it was the day of the vision I had once again a feeling of déjà vu and remembered the dream I had. What is even weirder then all the things I have mentioned so far is that the company only existed for about 2 or 3 years when I got there. Meaning that at the time when I had the dream about the company they didn’t even exist yet.

So why am I posting all this? Well, I am looking for help. I want to know if someone else has also experienced this and knows how to have these dreams with visions about the future become more frequent. And also if someone knows if you can interfere with the visions themselves and if this effects the outcome of the vision in any way or if it turns the vision in just any normal dream. I have always tried to not interfere with my dreams when I noticed that it could be a vision. But if you can interfere with them and shape your future and the path towards it then I would definitely want to know how to do this. But… the biggest reason why I’m asking for help is because of the last dream I had. It showed me my death and possibly also the destruction of earth but I’m not completely sure if this is truly a vision and I really hope that it ain’t but this dream felt different unlike all other dreams I had so far, both the visions and the regular dreams didn’t feel as real-like as this one which makes me quite worried. If it’s a vision then it would mean I would die within at least the next 30 years and because I didn’t see what happened to our planet I’m not completely sure if it exploded or if there was only a large explosion at the place in that vision where I was. It is never the less still quite a scary dream, whether it’s a vision or not.

From all that I have seen so far and from all that I have experienced, I have come to the following conclusions. I think the visions that I have experienced are not me looking into the future, but the future me experiencing things and somehow our minds are connecting with each other, sending me what the future me is experiencing or has experienced into my dreams when I sleep. I think so because I am able to avoid what was supposed to happen and I think there’s a good chance that alternate timelines exist. It’s not just me avoiding the troublesome future’s like bumping into people or escaping being scolded, but also something else that has been bothering me which makes me come to these conclusions. For example I had a dream quite a while ago and this vision showed me sitting on my bed and next to me sat a girl with long blond curly hair. But I have never met any blond girls with long curly hair nor is it popular in our country where every girl basically has straight hair. Because this is also a vision that hasn’t come to be (yet), it has made me think that it could have been a vision from a future me from a different timeline. Possibly a different timeline then the timeline of the other future me in which I die. But nothing is for sure, and both could still be happening in the near future because in the visions I look from a first person perspective and so I can’t guess my age and I also can’t guess when I could expect the day of the vision to be.

If anyone could possibly give me some answers to my questions or possibly even more. I will truly appreciate your kindness forever and remember all the help you have given me whether I die anytime soon or not."

My first 3 years were in kindergarten then I transferred schools due to my school losing 2 teachers. After transferring schools I taught 2nd grade for a year and asked to be moved back down to kindergarten. I enjoyed second grade but kindergarten truly has my heart. I have a bachelors in Early Childhood Education and my Master's in Special Education although it is not on my teaching license (I did not have the ability to take a semester off to complete the internship hours required by the state). I was born and raised and currently live in Alaska. I really love the school I am at but am ready for a life change.
On a couple recent trips I have spent a fair amount of time thinking and want to take the opportunity I have now to move out of state and experience something new. The only commitment I have right now if a golden retriever who would need to be able to come with me. I would want somewhere with access to the outdoors (this could mean with a drive or having parks available) as that is a huge draw for me in the summers and winters. I have looked at international teaching and teaching across the states but am looking for some advice or options to look into.

5mid1i,86,2017-01-06,Possible update on Jesse Ross,HPLover0130,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/5mid1i/possible_update_on_jesse_ross/,"BRIEF OVERVIEW

Any information regarding the disappearance of Jesse Ross, please contact the Chicago Police Department at: 312-744-8266 or contact us


Jesse Ross Fact Sheet 
-19 years old at time of disappearance
-Was a sophomore at University of Missouri Kansas City
-Just received a promotion from intern to paid radio personality on a popular Kansas City Morning Show
-Was in Chicago for a mock United Nations Conference
-Was last seen walking to the side door during a 30 minute break from an ""emergency"" model United Nations Conference


Jesse Ross phoned his mother from Chicago on Nov. 20, just to let her know that he was having a blast at the model United Nations conference.

He promised to call again the next day when he and the 13 University of Missouri-Kansas City students and their faculty sponsor had loaded the vans for the return drive home.

He was that kind of son, said Donna Ross. He always let his mother know where he was, what he was doing, and when to expect him home. He couldn't keep a secret, not from his mother.

There was an ""emergency"" meeting of the mock U.N. at 2 a.m. Nov. 21, the final day of the conference that drew more than 1,000 university students from across the country. Before the mock emergency, there was a dance, and parties throughout the host Four Points Sheraton Hotel in Chicago's downtown loop.

Jesse Ross FamilyAt about 2:30 a.m., about 12 hours after his last cell phone call to his mother, Jesse Ross got up from his chair and walked out of the room for a 30-minute break. A surveillance camera in the hotel lobby caught the unmistakable image of the red-haired Jesse, clad in a white T-shirt, jeans, and a green warm-up jacket, walking toward the main doors.

It was the last trace ever of 19-year-old Jesse Ross.

The 10-minute walk back to Sheraton Chicago Hotel &amp; Towers, where Jesse and the UMKC group was staying, was well-lit, heavily traveled and covered by outdoor security cameras. None of them recorded Jesse.

""Aliens took him away,"" said his mother, knowing full well how ridiculous that sounds. But it's no more ridiculous than any other reason offered for her son's disappearance.

Chicago police have found no evidence that he was a victim of foul play. There has been no activity on Jesse's credit cards or his cell phone since he disappeared into the Chicago night.

There was no way imaginable to any one who knew him that Jesse could have committed suicide, or wanted to walked away from the life he was living, said Don Ross, his father.

Jesse had just gotten a promotion from unpaid intern to paid morning on-air personality at Kansas City radio station 95.7 FM - ""The Vibe"" - a dream job for a sophomore communications major.

""They decided he needed an on-air name, so they named him Opie Cunningham,"" after Ron Howard's TV characters, Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham, said Don.

Jesse Ross and FriendsA parent's worst nightmare is supposed to be the death of a child.

There is a worse nightmare than that, said Don and Donna Ross.

""We pray for a sign, anything,"" Donna said. ""We pray, 'If he is in heaven with you, that's not my first choice, but God, please give us a sign. Send me an e-mail, a phone call, something. We have to know that he's OK and with you.'

""When you lose someone you love when they pass on, you grieve and then you move on with your life,"" Donna said. ""We are nowhere. We are still stuck in that revolving door. We know nothing more than we knew that first day.""

As the months roll on, Don and Donna Ross can't give up hope.

""If Jesse ever thought we'd give up on him, we'd catch hell from him. 'How could you just give up on me?' he would tell us,"" Donna said.

Body found in Lake Michigan badly decomposed. His family contacted authorities but haven't heard back. I really hope this family gets resolution, one of my friends new him well.

5mifnh,5,2017-01-06,"Looking for a job in the international nonprofit sector, and I have questions about my volunteering experience.",CCBS1226,nonprofit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/5mifnh/looking_for_a_job_in_the_international_nonprofit/,"Specifically, I am wondering about the timeline of my volunteer experience.  In 2007, I volunteered for a year in Ghana. I lived in the far north, without electricity and running water, in a mud hut, and I loved every minute of it!  I was an assistant to the director of a volunteer teacher program, and we provided admin support to young people who volunteered from all over the world to work in remote villages with the Ghana Education System. 

I was 22 at the time, and had not yet gone to college. However, when I returned, I started school and graduated from a top university with a degree in African Studies. I immediately started a graduate program and completed an M. Ed. in Community Development and Action with an emphasis in International Nonprofit Management from the same college.  From several internships I did during college, I learned that finance is an area that many nonprofit struggle to grasp and master.  So, thinking that accounting would be a great additional skill to have, after I completed my M. Ed., I took an accelerated accounting program and four semesters of graduate level accounting. During that time, I worked 2 years at an accounting firm, and then admin work with a nonprofit organization that is focused on secondary education.

My goal is to eventually work for an international nonprofit in West or Southern Africa, in girl’s education or something similar. However, I'm concerned about the 10 year gap from when I initially had the great volunteering/international experience until now. I had some shorter internships while in school, but I always had to work full time, all the way through school (being a non-traditional student) and I so I didn't get to build my volunteering resume as much as I would have loved to while in college.  (The internships I did have were both women’s empowerment programs.)

Everything I’m reading says that it’s so hard to break into the International development field, and to be prepared to work at an entry level job for a time before moving up. I think I'm ready for something beyond an entry-level job at this point, but I'm concerned that what I have will not be considered relevant or recent enough. Should I just put myself out there, or should I spend some time getting more recent volunteer experience before I start applying?

Thoughts?

The 2nd job is one I find very exciting, both interviews went well. The problem is I have no idea what to ask for on salary. The man asked me what I would like to have, and of course my brain went to 150k a year but I know this to be an unrealistic expectation. So I asked him what he thought was fair for the job, he says, ""40 thousand is what I started at, I'm making 300 now!"". So, from this comment I knew he was low balling me and I don't think he meant to be mean at all he was just trying to cheer me up about hearing 40k I think, he knew I had no prior history of salary negotiations because I've always just taken the money I could get per hour at retail stores. 

My question is, do I use job #1 as leverage for salary negotiations of job #2? I really don't want to come off as a dick, and them say ok nevermind, but I also want to make more for a programming job(his first statement is less than I make currently at the retail store I work at full time). And just to be clear, I have a bachelor's in computer science with 5 years experience and two internships. I have a family with two car payments so money is very much a concern for me at this point in time.

If any employers have any input that would be amazing. And if you've read this far I thank you very much! Any input is appreciated. I have 0 experience with salaries this is a whole new world to me.


TL;DR got two job offers #1 offered 72k, #2 the job I really want told me to name my price, curious if I can leverage #1 to get more for #2."

It's going to sound so privileged and I'm sorry.

'm a junior at a university, an i'm very excited to be graduating next year! 

Currently, I live with many other people in a school dorm, and I am really sick of dorming. It's VERY expensive, and cheaper to live off-campus. 

My parent's have offered to give me the rent money I will need should I decide to live off-campus next semester, as the money is already put away for me, and it's cheaper and saves them money in the long run anyway. 

However. I was hoping to stay in the area over the summer so I could take a really good internship, which would require I move off campus after this coming semester ends into an apartment with some friends. Our rent would be put at around 600 a month (each), as opposed to the 1100 a month (each) that campus housing costs. 

I go to school full time, and as an architecture major, I have VERY little time for a job, but I do have a part time job, that gets me about 100$ a week. Yeah, not a lot of hours to be had, and a second job isnt in the cards, I tried it and my grades fell and I almost lost a scholarship because of it. So I stuck with my single crappy campus job.

by the end of the semester, i'll have about 5000 dollars in my bank account.  between trasnporation/food/rent/materials, even when skimping, It would pretty much drain me of all my savings and funds to pay the rent for the summer on my own, until September when my parents have already said they would (generously) pay for it for me until I graduate and then im on my own. 

The plan was to ask my parents to help me pay for the rent each month for May, June, July an August. I could pay half, but Paying all of it would mean I'd be back at square-fucking-one come graduation next year. I could get a full-time summer job on top of my internship as well. 

Problem is, I recently found out my father has gotten a HUGE pay cut for the new year, like huge, and we're now a family of saving big wherever we can. 

I never ask my parents for money, ever. I never have. Since I left for college I have paid for everything myself as they are covering my tuition that isnt covered by loans/scholarships. they do enough. 

How can I ask them to help pay for this now? I cant! (I have four siblings) 

The obvious solution is to go home for the summer. Which would mean I A. Would have to spend next year on campus again, as i would have no one to get an apartment with. 
B, would be incredibly depressed and lonely all summer as all my high school friends have moved away. Going home even for a week is so lonely. No one is in the house and it's just me. I have a lot of issues with manic depression when im lonely, as im a huge extrovert.
C. Would mean I miss out on this amazing, career-launching internship for the summer. 


I really dont want to, but i'm starting to think I should cut my losses, find a rando to live with in a cheap part of town, drop out and just work and make money so i can live without the constant anxiety of what im going to do, where i'll live, and if ill be in a depressive, suicidal state or not. I like working! I just dont have time to right now!

What the hell do I do?

I've been out of high school for at least five years and I tended to fit in with everyone. I talked to most of my peers and they all seemed to like me. I grew attached to many of them and  things were dandy. However, near the end of high school I started to become very distant and depressed (mostly due to things happening at home at the time). I started to distance myself from others and stopped keeping in touch with some of my peers. Nothing bad ever happened, I just drifted from them.

It's about five years later and things were going great. Almost ready to graduate university and start an internship at a top company.

It wasn't until I started seeing pictures of my old friends and peers meeting up and partying/hanging out without me. It's all over Facebook and Snapchat and I always kind of come across it. I try not to make it hurt, I mean... it really shouldn't, right? 

I haven't spoken to them in years. So why should I care? It's just hard seeing it all spammed on my social media and I don't want to mass delete these people for no reason otherwise it just looks odd. 

To put it in perspective, it feels a lot like an adult clique. They like to put out the fact that they're all happy and dandy and still friends. It makes me feel like crap seeing these posts. I'm still picking up the pieces from feeling depressed (took 4 years of feeling this way and I'm just starting to recover). I don't have too many friends but I got a wonderful boyfriends and a few good close friends.

I'm not looking to be friends with them again. But, I just want to know if anyone else has felt/experienced something similar and has possibly found a way to cope with this? Sorry if my thoughts are all jumbled up and if I don't make sense, just a lot on my mind. Let me know if you need some clarification or more details. I'm an open book. Thanks for reading."
5mjrdk,47,2017-01-07,"Man, how do you get a job in this city?",OverlordXenu,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/5mjrdk/man_how_do_you_get_a_job_in_this_city/,"I had a chance at an editorial assistant job. Knew everyone in the office, they liked me, I'd saved a butt or two as an intern. Got an interview for the position. But, I lacked any assistant/office experience, so they didn't want to hire me.

I got an interview for a part time job to get that kind of experience. Transcribing, regular secretarial work. A pitiful per diem. It was a weird group interview—me and another person. Said other person was 30 and had a graduate degree and was looking for something to do while their spouse was a doctor. (Recent transplant.)

Didn't get that job.

I was waiting tables. Worked 7 days a week for three months until I burned out. Someone had been trying to hire me as a photo retoucher, so I quit, and pursued that. Had a couple interviews. He talked me up to the owner. The person making the hiring decision said they wanted to send me some files as a tryout, then didn't. Followed up, ""oh shit, we're super busy this week! I'll get them to you next week."" Followed up the next week, ""we're still slammed. I promise I'll get them to you next week!"" Rinse and repeat for 2 more weeks. I emailed my contact, who was a friend, and asked if they were still interested in trying me out, because otherwise I had to pursue other opportunities. Didn't even get a response.

I hate waiting tables, and I have some coffee experience, so I try to get a barista job. Pretty much no one is interested because I don't have NYC coffee experience. I intentionally choose a mediocre coffee place near my internship, that is never that busy, thinking it'll be an easy gig to get some experience and money. I walk into the most absolutely hostile interview I've ever had. They asked me how much money I made waiting tables, asked me how much I expected to make there, ""Oh, I've been interviewing around and the competitive rate seems to be around $13 an hour."" Their response: ""You can live in New York on that?"" Never mind that I had told them I'm lucky enough to not have to pay rent at the moment (live with girlfriend). Like, fine, I get not wanting to hire me or something, but really? If you don't pay your employees enough to live in NYC then why don't you pay them more?

And it's just like, shit. I'm not really very good at anything. I'm a dilettante and more of an autodidact that anything, so I have a shit load of half baked skills, and nothing I really excel in. Everyone in this fucking city is smarter than me, is harder working, and somehow has famous parents. And they all have masters degrees or 10 years of experience. (I was trying to get another job with people I knew, and they were nice enough to tell me I didn't get it because it made more business sense to go for the person with 10 years of experience. They approached me originally because it was an entry level position and they were afraid their only other candidate would leave for greener pastures. Oh, the joys of being an intern that is well liked enough to get interviews but not jobs.)

I've been funemployed for about 6 months now. Interning and going into more debt. Like, shit. Do I really need to go to grad school to compete? I guess so.

Anyone got any good stories? Or advice? Most job-search advice I find, or get, seems better tailored for people who are already mid-career and have something to offer. The only shit I've got to offer is a stupid cliché—I work hard, I learn fast, and I'm smart. And a bachelor's degree but I already knew that'd be worthless before I went to school. Rather, it's the bare minimum.

This is a hard fucking city. I hope I survive it. I like it here, and the shit I want to do (art editorial, essentially) really only exists here. (And LA and London and so on I guess, but I can live here for almost free.) But it's so demoralizing to fail at even getting a fucking barista job. Fuck. I wish I hadn't worked 7 days a week, I'd probably still be at my very well paying serving job, but like, fuck. I hadn't slept in two weeks and we launched a new menu item that caused lines out the door and made my check average go from like $80 (lunch)/$140 (dinner) to like fucking $24. I was working 3 times as much (triple doubles how much fun), 3 times as hard, making almost the exact same amount of money. While not sleeping because I'm lucky enough to be an insomniac and it's hard to work 10am - 12pm waiting tables and then work 9 - 6 as an intern, sometimes leaving my internship to cover for someone else, and just not having a moment to sit.

How the fuck are all of you tough enough for this shit? I feel like a baby. Like, I'm complaining, but I don't mean to complain. I just don't know how to get an entry level job when I'm competing with Masters or years of experience. Like, I wouldn't hire some fucking kid straight out of a liberal arts school either if I had a 30 year old with an MA in art history and 4 years experience as a gallery assistant, either. But I'm not even getting the good, prestigious internships I need because I'm losing out to grad students and people fresh out of grad school. (Confirmed for one place because my college advisor was *on the board* and told me later on. It was an internship that had a high chance of leading to a job. AH)

Like, fuck, man. What do I do? I don't want to start a shitty ass vanity project VICE -clone culture magazine to ""stand out."" I have friends that applied for paralegal jobs out of college, with similar degrees and resumes to mine, and got them. I apply to probably 10 jobs a week. I've tried different styles and tones for resumes and cover letters. And I'm barely getting interviews. And then half of my interviews are group interviews with people who are obviously better than me, or at least more attractive as candidates. And I'm sure my plummeting self esteem isn't helping.

Anyone been in this position? What did you do to climb out?

Edit: I can't afford grad school and credit card debt from this vacation is fucking with my credit score to the point where I probably can't get loans for it. I can't move back home, my mom doesn't have enough money to support me and there almost no jobs there. Even waiting tables."
5mkgjn,547,2017-01-07,[EMSK] How to Write a Basic Resume,MexicanSpaceProgram,everymanshouldknow,https://www.reddit.com/r/everymanshouldknow/comments/5mkgjn/emsk_how_to_write_a_basic_resume/,"I had a search through EMSK and didn't find any concrete (read: practical and useful) guidance on this, so I thought I'd put together a basic guide based on what I've learned on both sides of the desk when it comes to job applications.  I'm also happy to do more of these if anyone is interested.

I'm also going to tailor it, where possible, for two different groups:

- People that have an established career and work history.

- People that are new to the workforce (e.g. high school or college graduates).

**1) Thoroughly read and understand the job advertisement / description and what it is asking you to do.**

This is a very basic screening technique, and you'd be amazed how many people get bounced from consideration for not following basic instructions, typically:

- Please submit a current resume and cover letter.  Happens all the time - people submit one, or the other.

- Please submit a resume and cover letter in (whatever format - .doc, PDF).  Again, a simple instruction, which a lot of people fail by sending through things in odd formats.

- Please submit a resume with professional references.  Another simple one, which people screw up all the time by putting ""references available on request"".

**2) Format, font, style.**

Resumes are professional documents - they represent and market you as an employee to a business, so opting for conservative and professional is what you're after.

There is no 100% correct ""prescribed"" font, as long as it looks consistent - e.g. having part of it in Arial and part of it in Times New Roman looks lazy or copied and pasted.  Pick something reasonable and stick with it.

Obviously, avoid any cutesy / fun / joke fonts - Comic Sans, Papyrus, WordArt - it's a professional document, not a church newsletter.  Ditto for bullets and lists - just use standard bullets and tabs - nobody wants to see your educational awards indicated by Hello Kitty emojis.

Don't fuck around too much with margins or paper size or anything like that.  If the person at the other end tries to print your resume off, and it won't print because it's in a wacky Zimbabwean paper size, they're just going to move on.

- Stick to black and white.  Chances are, if printed or faxed, this is what it's going to come out as anyway, and colour turns up shit in b+w or greyscale.

**3) Length and Content**

1-2 pages for a resume, 1 page for a cover letter.

If you're new to the workforce, a single-page resume is fine.  Don't be tempted to pad it out with irrelevant shit and 1.5 line spacing just to make up 2 pages.

If you're established, avoid the natural inclination to document every single thing you've done in the last five years and end up with five pages of shit.

*General guidelines - new to the workforce:*

- If you have no work experience, activities connected to your academic studies and extracurricular are fine.  The classic examples are internships, work experience, volunteer work and vocational classes.  You lay these out the same way you would work experience (when you did it and what you did).

- These can also be supported by social things - e.g. being on a sports team can help demonstrate teamwork and leadership skills.  However, don't fill it up with irrelevant shit - they're supporting activities, and nobody gives two shits that you got MVP in an Under 10s cricket game.

- If you have some work experience (e.g. retail or fast food), obviously that comes first.  List your employer, position, time employed and main responsibilities.  Don't overdo it.  Cash handling, food safety, customer service is fine.  Don't say that you ""provided excellent customer service while maintaining a high standard of health and safety in a commercial kitchen environment while providing cost-savings to management by reducing shrinkage and enhancing time management"" for a burger flipping job at McDonalds.

- At this point I wouldn't bother detailing reasons for leaving, but if you really feel compelled to, just put ""left to concentrate on my further studies"" or something to that effect - nobody is going to fault you for leaving McDonald's to study for exams so you never have to work at McDonald's ever fucking again.

*General guidelines - established career:*

At this point for most people, your work experience is going to be your most marketable skill, and far more recent than anything you did at college.

Work history should be laid out by your most recent or current position, including:

- Name and location of employer.

- Your position and department (note - should be the last position you held, so even if you were Senior Account Manager for a month, and Junior Account Manager for most of it, put Senior).

- Time in role (e.g. August 2013-November 2015).  For the older jobs, you can play around a bit / guestimate the dates because nobody really gives a shit what you did three jobs and five years ago.

- Your main responsibilities.  Should be pretty much a summary of what is in your position description.  If you can't remember, google the role, find a similar advertisement and use it.  Don't go overboard - you need to keep the length down, especially when you get to the 5-10 year mark in your career and you've had a few different jobs.

- Add any particular accomplishments e.g. ""recognised by management for excellent leadership"", or ""fulfilled all financial and safety KPIs for the years 2012-2014"".  Again, don't go nuts.

- Reason for leaving.  Keep it positive, or at best, minimalist and understandable.  Something like ""offered and accepted position at ABC Widgets"" or ""promoted and offered relocation to the Sydney HQ office"" are the best ones, obviously.  ""Left to pursue further studies and professional development"" is a good one if you left on shitty terms with a place.

- Anything that is older than 5-10 years, or not strictly relevant to the job you're applying for, just put it in under a bullet list like ""additional and supporting work experience"".  Nobody gives a fuck that your 32 year old self worked at KFC as a pimply teenager.

**4) References**

References, wherever possible, should be professional people that can vouch for your attitude, skills and performance.  Obviously this is going to be very different for existing workers vs. people studying or recent graduates, but there's a few commonalities:

- No family members.  I don't give a shit that your mom thinks you're awesome.  If you're new to the workforce and you did work experience for your dad's company, ask someone else at the company to give a reference.  Nothing looks worse (and this happens with 30 year olds), when Tim Johnson Jr's referee is Tim Johnson Snr - believe me, it fucking happens.

- Contact details need to be current.  If you give me a number that goes through disconnected, I'm not going to waste time calling you to get the right number.  I'll move on to the next candidate.

- No wacky email addresses.  Jesus, fuck - people just don't get this.  Obviously, a work email is the best, e.g. j.smith@abccorp.com, or jsmith@school.edu.  If you have to give a personal one, for the love of God get a normal one like johnsmith@gmail.com, not hotbrony6969_xxx@hotmail.com.

- References need to include: name, position, company, email, phone (direct and mobile if available).

- If you don't have their direct extension, google the company and just put their main switchboard number in.

- Don't even bother with written references, unless it's on NASA letterhead and says that Neil Armstrong sucked your cock while they gave you the Medal of Honour - they expire too quickly.

*Reference guidelines: new to workforce.*

Obviously the hurdle here is ""how can I give employer references when I haven't had an employer?"", and the simple answer is, you can't - unless you've worked.

The best one to give is someone in a decent position that can vouch for you - a teacher / lecturer, someone from an intern or WP program, school administrator, student supervisor, something like that.  BUT, there's a caveat - don't expect a maths teacher or a psych professor with 1,000 students in the past year or two to remember who the hell you are / were.

For graduates, this is where tutors and supervisors come in handy because they've worked with you on major projects a lot more closely.

Out of high school, a reference from a teacher or something, and a personal reference from something else (e.g. sport coach) would be more than enough.

*Reference Guidelines - Established*

Obviously, your current and / or most recent employer is who we want to talk to.  If you can put your current reporting manager, that's easiest; however, a lot of people don't want their boss to know that they're looking for another job.

Easiest workaround is to find someone in another dep't that you've worked for that can give the same information without tipping the hat to your boss.  Another good way is to give a company reference and a Client / Customer reference - we get the same information, while minimising how many people at your current work that we contact.

This also works in certain companies that do not, as policy, give full references.  My company, for example, will confirm that I worked here in x position for y time and was responsible for z, but we're not allowed to elaborate further than that.  A Client or Customer reference is a great workaround to this increasingly common issue - as is giving personal details as an alternative.

- Somebody three jobs and five years ago?  Don't even bother."
5mkjpc,7,2017-01-07,Gf broke up with me because I'm not ambitious enough?,10Dante4,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5mkjpc/gf_broke_up_with_me_because_im_not_ambitious/,"I just need other people's perspective on this : me and my ex gf have been together for almost two years. We were crazy in love, met each other's families and were talking about living together at some point. In the time together we've had 2 major fights/arguments. I should also mention she has been diagnosed with depression and she started taking medication, slightly before we got together. 

A bit of background on our careers : both still live  with our parents. I've been working in different gyms personal training and coaching for the whole duration of the relationship. She was doing a internship for the first year of our relationship, she was unemployed for a good part of the second year of the relationship. She had only a waitressing job for 2 months which she left because of ""work stress"". Last month she got a full time marketing's assistant job. 

Me making my measly income and her having a full time job, I thought we could afford a flat together. And maybe get some benefits, don't judge me, to help with the money. She said ""you know you'll have to get a proper job"" and ""benefits are there as a last resort"". Fair enough, I will look for a job then. 

So approximately two weeks after this ^ conversation, and a month after she found a job, I lost my job and the day after she broke up with me (immediately after I mentioned that I lost my job). It might sound that she dumped me because I was jobless, but I knew she was thinking about breaking up earlier than that day because she kinda distanced herself the week prior to ""the talk"" (didn't text me very much, didn't tag me on funny shit on FB etc.) 

Reason being : I don't have an ambition in life, I'm lazy and I don't have a drive to get somewhere in life. I've been stuck in the same place in my life and don't have a drive to improve it. 

I kind of agreed that I don't have an ambition, because other than moving out of my mum's house and getting a better paid job, I don't want to get anywhere else in life. I'm happy working in gyms and coaching, the only problem for me is the income. 

I found it really unfair since it seemed to me, while she was unemployed for almost a year, and I was working, albeit little, she dumps me as soon as she gets a job? 

What do you guys think? "
5mkvtu,17,2017-01-07,Sistema universitario comparato,BrokenC-1,italy,https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/5mkvtu/sistema_universitario_comparato/,"Sono l'unico a pensare che in un'ottica di comparazione con il resto del mondo la nostra università dal punto di vista organizzativo delle scadenze svantaggi i nostri studenti? 
Al netto di discorsi sulla qualità dell'insegnamento, abbiamo un sistema costruito sulle rovine dei sistemi precedenti (e.g. quello del liceo come unico gate per l'università, che però poi sostanzialmente ti garantiva un lavoro dirigenziale, altamente classista), il quale se unito alla tendenza crescente di volersi iscrivere all'università in ambo i sessi (fortunatamente) (fonte: www3.istat.it/dati/catalogo/20120118_00/cap_7.pdf) ci dà indietro un numero spropositato di neolaureati rispetto al numero di lavori disponibili. Il fattore che però mi interessa è che i lavori tradizionali di tirocinio o entry level in Italia richiedano una laurea magistrale, mentre all'estero si inizia a far lavorare a partire dagli undergrad studies (equivalente della triennale) con internship e altro, con anche lavori entry level ancor prima di un eventuale MSc (equivalente della nostra magistrale). Ciò vuol dire che i nostri laureati magistrali a parità di età si trovano sì avvantaggiati dal punto di vista didattico (neanche di tanto, di un annetto), ma perdono sul lato esperenziale. 
Il laureato triennale medio che voglia andare fuori per lavoro/studio (che secondo Almalaurea nel 2015 esce con voto medio 25,5, durata media 4,5+ anni) esce con un sostanziale svantaggio su tutta la linea.
Il risultato è che in Italia trova facilmente lavoro chi ha fatto studi erasmus all'estero (solo il 6% dei laureati triennali e manco troppo facilmente), mentre gli altri annaspano a poter fare esperienza fuori o dentro. 
Cambiare gli studi riequilibrando il peso in modo da dare una qualche utilità alle lauree triennali in ottica di continuazione degli studi anche all'estero e di lavoro credo sia un'ovvietà ma quali passi stanno venendo fatti?
In totale ci mettiamo intorno ai 7,2 anni per laurearci tra laurea triennale e magistrale o magistrale a ciclo unico. Non sarà un po' tanto senza pressoché alcun tirocinio per quasi  la metà della popolazione dei laureati? Sempre tenendo conto del fatto che solo in alcuni corsi di laurea il tirocinio è obbligatorio e taluni casi sia una farsa di copiatura di relazioni finali. 
Qualcuno mi vuole aiutare a fare ordine su questi concetti? Magari anche con esperienze e informazioni storiche che non ho.

I do have an interest as a buyers agent though.


Would working as a licensed brokers assistant fulfill the time requirement?


How likely are you to get hired by a broker if you state you only want to work as a buyers agent?



I have an MBA so according to the ok real estate commission I have 50 points of the needed 100 to get the experience equivalency requirement. Could this accelerate things?

5mm17p,17,2017-01-07,"How to advocate for mental illness and religiosity to safely and positively coexist/How to stop staff-only ""venting"" over difficult clients from going too far?",copiouscuddles,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/5mm17p/how_to_advocate_for_mental_illness_and/,"I was personally hospitalized in a child psychiatric unit when I was a teenager and I now have a BA in Psychology and an MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I might as well admit my own struggles with mental illness are part of what brought me to wanting a career in mental health, though I've always kept that quiet in any mental health jobs/internships I've held for fear of negative reactions. I think I'll feel more comfortable being a bit more open about it after I've established my career somewhat and gained the respect of colleagues.   
    
My own hospitalization was well over a decade ago and the facility and any records of my treatment there no longer exist, so sometimes I think it's useless that I still get  angry over what I saw as some mistreatment of me by some of the staff at the time. A big thing that still bothers me is that, while I'm no longer as religious as I was as a teen, I believe I was mistreated by mental health professionals because of religious statements I made they took to be ""psychotic."" Although it's likely too late to make anyone who did this to me pay somehow, I want to advocate for others  facing similar mistreatment.  
  
When I was a depressed teen (with a severe lack of sleep, which definitely explains some of my delusional thoughts though the lack of sleep was not focused on nearly enough) I never actively hallucinated anything, though I believe I got no sleep for several days at least once (barring likely periods of microsleep, as I definitely remember nodding off for a few seconds here and there), so I'm surprised I wasn't worse off than I was because active psychosis is definitely possible with no sleep over a long enough period of time. I spoke with mental health staff of a night I felt incredibly hopeless and suicidal and how I heard thunder and took it to be God speaking to me and reassuring me. I *never* said I actually heard a voice. The thunder being God was only my *interpretation*. I don't think anybody needs to *agree* with religious/spiritual interpretations like that, but it clearly was not harming me. It *gave me hope.* It was incredibly *positive*! The fact that this incredibly positive thing for me was turned into reasons for a diagnosis of psychosis by mental health professionals still angers me to this day.  
  
I know similar things happen. I recently completed my counseling internship on the psych ward of a hospital. One patient was incredibly depressed over the death of her husband. One day she said she saw a bird outside her window and she took it to be her deceased husband greeting her/looking out for her. I don't know if he ever said anything about it in front of her, but one of the psychiatrists openly mocked this patient's spiritual interpretation of the bird in the presence of other staff, including me. I obviously had little power to do much about this as an intern, though I discussed my discomfort with my supervisor who was sympathetic with my concern and agreed with me that spirituality is helpful if it's positive and we can let clients share their spirituality with us whether we believe similarly or not.  
  
I do realize now that some of what I saw as overly negative ""venting"" over difficult patients by hospital staff was often simply how mental health workers end up coping with a difficult job. I know some nurses personally and some appreciation for black humor can definitely come with the territory...but how do you stop from crossing a line? And how do you treat a client's religious/spiritual beliefs with respect and help other staff do the same, while treading the difficult balance of knowing what spiritual beliefs are helpful and positive and which ones may not be? I know religiosity definitely actually can feed psychosis at times.  I also know, especially from some guilt and shame over my sexuality I have personally managed to shed after a Catholic upbringing, that religion can have negative effects on mental health as well as positive ones.    
    
I know I got a little long with this post so thank you if you've read this far! I think this is an important discussion and I'm interested in any responses.

5mn6sa,18,2017-01-07,"New to Business Development, Need Some Advice...",FutureMillionaire_,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/5mn6sa/new_to_business_development_need_some_advice/,"So I'm a 19 year old canadian student who just scored an internship in Manhattan, New York for a B2B business development role for a European SaaS company.

I've only been on the job for a few days but I feel kind of lost... 

I had great success with my inside sales internship last summer, but this internship is completely different in so many ways..


**What the job involves (so far):**

- Cold calling/Emailing C-level executives in small-medium sized businesses

- Lead generation (have to find every prospect and enter them in excel with contact info (name, city, phone number, industry, email etc.)

- Social media management 

It really is a sweet gig &amp; i'm thankful for it, but i'm literally the only business development rep there, the hiring manager is Italian &amp; doesn't speak very good english - so I don't have anyone to really train me on the role (business development/outbound cold calling, etc). There's no scripts I can start from, no email templates, no Salesforce CRM (the company uses their own CRM but it's not very efficient and is still in the development phase) and i've got a month to prove myself... 


**About the company**

The company has been around for a approximately a decade and is fairly established in the European market (HQ is in Milan, Italy, have offices in Madrid &amp; London as well) and they literally just opened up an office in Manhattan about a month ago, so i'm essentially involved in building their business from scratch in an entirely different country/language/culture. 


**What I'm Selling**

The product/service i'm selling 
is also fairly complex, meaning we offer SO many different services, like business expansion services. One of the things we can do is take care of all the logistics of selling your product in the European or US market like Warehousing, shipping, packaging, duties/fees associated with shipping, commission fees (eBay, Amazon, Paypal fees) etc. for a certain commission incentive for us. 

**Our primary service involves** e-commerce channel synchronization &amp; integration (you can post all your products on one platform and they will simultaneously be added/edited across your channels on eBay, Amazon, Shopify, your own website, etc. as well as revenue tracking)

**other services include:**
SEO, SEM campaigns, Software development, customer service outsourcing, and so much more....

**The Price**

Our full service e-commerce program costs a one time payment of approx $5,000 - $10,000, plus ~$85/month from there on out - this is what i'm supposed to try and sell. 

**The Issue**

Having no previous experience or training with coldcalling, I'm finding it difficult to explain &amp; entice prospects within a short period of time about all our services, and even when i've found some great leads, getting them to actually commit has been tough as well... 

What are some things I can do to become as efficient &amp; successful as possible as a Business Development exec? 

I have one month to prove myself (then i go back to school).

If anyone has some tips, scripts, email templates, or general advice for cold calling with c-level execs, that'd be extremely helpful!


**TL;DR** Got an internship in Manhattan with a European software company that just opened  up their office here a month ago, no one speaks fluent english except me, i'm the only BDR there, was given virtually no training, sales cycle seems fairly long, have a month to prove myself before i go back to school, not sure where to start... 

**apologizes in advanced for format/grammar, i'm on mobile**

**Edit:** *Just to clear things up a bit,  the ""prove myself"" part is something I want to do, not something my employer has pressured me into thinking"
5moblf,27,2017-01-07,An Idea: JTF Horde Mode,Ecojiro,thedivision,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/5moblf/an_idea_jtf_horde_mode/,"This may be impossible to implement and there are certainly more urgent needs, what do I know? Thinking about it has been fun.

You can go Rogue in the DZ, but with things as twisted as they are, what's to stop a morally unscrupulous agent from snapping in the LZ? Currently, friendly fire. It has been many a time that a JTF officer has done something to grind my gears, whether it's a dead dog in the crossfire, blocked cover, incessant hellos, or a cold refusal to raise me up when I've fallen as I beg my final breaths at their toes. 

Turn JTF friendly fire off and trigger JTF Horde Mode with sustained, intentional damage to any officer or civilian.

Once triggered, safe houses and checkpoints close, ISAC is disabled, map vanishes. Matchmaking is disabled. No escaping combat, no turning back. Hordes of JTF officers , which now hit like real threats, pursue you relentlessly through the open world, through buildings, underground areas, quarantines, and open streets. All mobs are still hostile to you. Fortified barricades appear on otherwise empty streets that continually push you to change your route and tactics. Getting cornered or trapped is a real danger. JTF snipers set up on rooftops as the green line continually approaches. Civilians betray your location to officers or mobs.

Maybe a single line of communication with Faye is left open for her to berate you for your choice or for Keener to hack into your comms and wish you the best.

Obviously, you can't go full Caligula in the LZ without consequence, so this would need to end in death, somehow. Perhaps escalating difficulty of JTF waves or named JTF and Agents that culminate in a chopper bombing the shit out of you, on a timer of twenty minutes. Can you get to the chopper? It would be like GTA with cops and stars, except timed and with no way out.

Or maybe there's a multiplayer component where an Agent or two can enter your game state in the final ten minutes and hunt you down. 

There would need to be some stimulus to keep moving--say, JTF explosive experts slowly work to destroy your position, wherever you may decide to rest, and after two minutes in the same spot within 50 meters, kaboom.

There could be leaderboards that reward things like distance traveled, multi-kills, kills from a hidden position, kills without taking damage, and time alive. Rogue caches from Keener and his ilk could appear in your Stash to reward you for your self-interested actions.

Maybe a fun fall project for an intern at Massive?

5moete,60,2017-01-07,It's been a roller coaster of a ride over the last decade. Here's my story on the road to FI. (with ugly graph),WantToBeFIRE,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5moete/its_been_a_roller_coaster_of_a_ride_over_the_last/,"27 Married, Single Income No Kids. Edit: for those asking my wife is finishing college and has been flying out every month for a few weeks at a time to take care of her dad who is fighting cancer.

Net Worth $180K. 

Planning to retire in 12 years at age 39

Let me start by saying I have not yet reached FI, but I do plan to retire early. If you came to read the story of someone who is finished already sorry to disappoint. If you don't mind a work in progress, keep reading. 

**The Beginnings: Work and School**

2006 First job repairing computers at big box retail and an unpaid internship.

2007 Graduate HS, attend low price private school in a state far from home. This school is highly ranked on list of best value schools (good education with low costs) Decide to study music. Parents help with housing costs and tuition not covered by scholarships. This allows me to focus on school, take unpaid internships, and save for the trip of a lifetime.

2009 Take a few years off school to go volunteer abroad. Learn a 2nd language.

2011 Return to USA with $1500, did my research to buy a motorcycle from craigslist that was a good deal and rain gear/helmet to have some sort of reliable transportation. Start working as medical interpreter with new language skills. Very infrequent work. saved a few $$ to start an IRA. At the same time  worked at another unpaid internship. Worthless company that basically hustled me.

2011 Fall return to university, change major to business management, emphasis in marketing. Sold my motorcycle for a small profit, purchased a car, sold that for a small profit, got myself another motorcycle.

2012 Took a job doing entry level SEO as I continued my marketing degree. Got a summer internship with Fortune 3 company. Low wage but exposes me to corporate life. A few more $$ goes to IRA. I realize I want to start making enough money to pay all my own bills for tuition/rent etc so I start buying and selling motorcycles whenever I see a margin for profit. I also do wedding photography, DJing, and motorcycle/scooter seat reupholstery for some spare cash.

2013 New unpaid internship at small company near my school. Part-time work as the #2 marketer in a 15 person company. Get in trouble for selling too many vehicles without a dealer license. Paid about 1200 bucks but I had probably saved 12k after paying for IRA, rent and tuition, so in the end it was worth it, although I did stop flipping vehicles for profit. Proud to say I have always paid cash for every vehicle that I have ever owned. Thought about opening a dealership with a small investment but I decided to see what full time work would be like at a small company.

2014 Co-founder and former head of marketing leaves the startup. I take over all aspects of marketing and graduate with 4 year degree. Company is growing. I agree to take a small weekly stipend of $250 as a 1099 worker for my part-time role while I finished school.

**Full-time work and a wedding. First home**

2015 Stayed with start-up for my first full-time employment @ 38k base (though still 1099 because I am a pushover). Incentives push that up a bit. No 401k, no healthcare (although I am asking for both). Continued side gigs.

Also in October 2015, I got married for a total cost under $4000. Put that on a rewards credit card with 6 months interest free payments. We had good credit from wise use of credit cards through college. We purchased a $180k starter home for $5% down on a 3.875 30 year note that had 2 bedrooms on the ground floor and 1 bedroom in the basement. It also had a second kitchen and bathroom in the basement. We decided to live in the basement and rent the upstairs to cover our mortgage. At least we would be living rent-free and the home buying process was enough to convince my boss to change my status to W2 rather than 1099.

We are down to $0 savings in the bank and about $3500 CC debt but ready to get started on the right foot. Also good news, the company has decided we can have healthcare starting Dec 1. I sign up for HSA and plan to max that as another tax-advantaged savings account while waiting for a proper 401k. My wife and I are just barely 26 and lost coverage through our parents plans but December is so close we decide to roll the dice.

**Shoulda had that emergency fund**

November 2015 My wife has to have an appendix surgery. Less than 18 hours in the hospital (would have been shorter but we went in Saturday at 11pm and had to wait until morning for the surgery.) That left us with a few bills (Hospital room, Doctor, Surgeon, Radiologist, Lab, Anesthesiologist, etc) that came to a grand total of $14k, certainly not starting on the right foot. 

I talked to the billing department at every party that had sent us a bill and let them know that we were uninsured and would like to pay what we can but we would need a discounted rate. They asked to see tax returns from the previous year (which fortunately for this situation showed very low income due to only working part time as a student). In the end we were able to negotiate about a 75% discount for a total cost between $3000 and $4000, which could be paid over 6 months to all providers except one. 

We cannot use HSA funds for these bills to save on the taxes, even though the bills came in December, because the date of service was November. I put these bills on the same cash back credit card as the wedding and we went into emergency mode to be able to get out of our debt situation pretty much the minute we got out of the hospital. We started cutting back on the road trips and going out to eat. We never had cable and dropped down to the cheapest internet plan available. I used Republic Wireless then RingPlus to save on cellular bills. We had some ups and downs but we were luckily able to keep making all payments on time to clear out the wedding and medical debt in just 6 months. YAY back to zero! Actually better than zero as April 2016 I sold the last few extra cars I had to fill in the gaps to max my IRA for the 2015 tax year.

Feb 2016 Company has grown 600% since I came onboard to run their marketing. After exceeding all growth expectations at that company and not seeing proper rewards and recognition I decided to look around and see what else was out there. The last straw was when my boss wouldn't let me take a lunch break on the day of a friend's wedding to go to the court house and support them.

**A much better job**

April 2016 after applying to dozens of jobs and having lots of early morning interviews, I had several offers and accepted a position at a growing medium size company that has a good marketing team, awesome leadership, and a great work life balance. I am excited to be able to specialize in my favorite area of marketing, PPC, and to be with a company that already appreciate me for my track record of success. Base salary is 73k with a 2k bonus. Includes healthcare, 401k with 4% match, good commute, and they encourage all new employees to bring their spouse or significant other to a Dave Ramsey course that they pay for to help families plan finances for a strong future.

Dec 2017 Well 8 months at my current position and I am breaking records with my channel, managing our multi-million dollar spend and generating twice as many leads as they were getting before I joined. We continue to live on a tight budget but are living a bit nicer than we did as college students. We can certainly do better than we are but I'm happy so long as we can hit our goals of maxing HSA, 401k, and both of our IRAs each year. 

**Home #2**

December 15 2016 We closed on our second house with 5% down at 3.75%. We didn't plan to be buying our second home so soon but it was another duplex that was for sale by owner and they dropped the price the day that I glanced at it on Zillow. We could do another 5% owner-occupied primary residence conventional loan since we had proof of rent covering the other property for at least 12 months. Luckily we were just able to get approved for this one and are now renting our old basement and the basement of this place to cover both mortgages and we have moved to an upstairs 3 bedroom (with garage) RENT FREE. We even pay an extra 12th payment to the principal each month to reduce the mortgages to around 21 years. Yes, I know we have the additional work as landlords so not technically free, but we have learned a lot as landlord for the last year and a half and we feel like we have the experience to better select and manage tenants. And yes there is quite a load of debt in these 2 homes that we have to be cautious about, but I believe the risk justified the reward. Even if we were without all of our renters, I could reduce my 401k contribution and cover the mortgages. Also, to those who may ask, yes we claim all rental income on our taxes (after appropriate expenses)

**The Future**

I think we are finally getting into stride and soon we will be able to have a very steady stream of income. Feels good to almost be done playing catch up. 401k and IRA for 2016 should be maxed by April 15 deadline this year. Could be sooner but we are living already with a weak emergency fund and don't want to drain it. HSA is already maxed for 2016. I believe I can justify a raise in the next few months. We want to get a slightly nicer car, since our $1000 daily driver now has over 250k miles on it. Now that we are maxing out our HSA, 401k, and IRAs, we will build a stronger emergency fund, pay down mortgages to remove PMI, make some small improvements, and then look at other taxable accounts to invest in. I have tried a little P2P lending and I am interested in what Betterment has to offer on tax reductions. 

We could move to another of our units since we don't really ""need"" the 3 bedrooms here, but it is nice as my wife and I are musicians to have an extra room for instruments and we are enjoying the sunlight of living upstairs finally. Also we could have her sick dad come live with us once he is stabilized from his recent surgeries. After this we are planning to have kids, continue to travel and visit relatives, and wait to see what happens next. If we decide to invest more into real estate we will consider an LLC or corporation, as 2 duplexes already feels like a liability stretch for one couple.

Also, I know that my story does not represent the norm, and I know the luck and blessing that got me here are a big part of my current success. But at the same time, I really appreciate this sub and the FIRE mindset that has helped us get started and stay strong in the tough times.

Here is a screenshot from Mint. Not as fancy as others with their custom spreadsheets, but it gets the point across just the same. I am a simple man. Note that the big jump in net worth is from when we purchased the first home but the debt was not accurately recorded for a few months.

Feel free to ask any questions. I would be happy to answer, but I may be offline in a bit as I need to give someone a ride soon. Throwaway because some people know my other usernames. 

TLDR: 27year old Musician turned digital marketing. Tried solo, small and large companies, ended up loving a medium size business. A little real estate on the side helping my numbers.

So, for my studies, I have an ""internship"" to do in a shop, whatever it sells. I have been working for years in ""normal"" shops, and I know for sure I would be bored to death if I had to do that again, so I was thinking looking for something a bit different.

So I have a few questions for you guys :

* How are the customers ? I have seen a few threads talking about shoplifters here, do you have more of them in this industry, or is it like everywhere else ?

* Did you know well the products before working there, like for example a seller in a sneakers store is usually very knowledgeable about it even before working there ? Like, my only experiences with adult stores were when, within a group a friends, we decided to get a doll or a dildo for another friend's birthday

* Is/Was your experience globally good in this industry ? Would you do that again/ Do you plan on staying in this business ?

Thank you for your feedback !"

If so, how did you deal with that?",awaythrow1996,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/5mps1h/has_anyone_come_to_realize_that_they_dont_like/,"Okay, so this is a quasi-rant and might be pretty long. For a little bit of background, I'm a junior in college and I came home in mid-December for a monthlong winter break. This is the first time I've been home and seen my family since last March. I was, at first, ecstatic to be home and visit with my parents and sibling, but I've quickly gotten sick of them. But it's not just that I'm sick of them--rather, it's like I just don't enjoy their company.

Since being back, I've realized that my home atmosphere has this sort of constant negative and tense energy that totally brings me down. I always feel slightly on edge and uncomfortable around my family, and that's nothing new--in fact, I've felt this way for most of my life and used to think that feeling meant there was something wrong with me. But after being surrounded by close friends in a positive and happy environment at school, I've realized that that's just not the case. Home kind of feels like a black hole that sucks that positivity out of me. Luckily, I've been keeping myself busy with exercise, internship applications and book reading so it hasn't been too bad here. But I guess what I'm saying is there's a stark contrast to the contentment I feel around my homies at school and the way I feel here around my parents and sibling. Basically, I don't think I like my family too much.

Has anyone else had this sort of general experience--namely, realizing that you don't like your family very much? How did you deal with it? Did that feeling fade over time?

5mqev2,2,2017-01-08,"It's been 5 days, and I feel so off.",rleavesthrowaway1234,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/5mqev2/its_been_5_days_and_i_feel_so_off/,"So I'm college senior and have been smoking since November 2012. Initially, I smoked really infrequently. I bought an eighth that November, and it lasted me until December 2013. I ran out and didn't buy more until March 2014, and from that point until now, I've smoked almost daily. The longest tolerance break I took was for maybe a month in November 2014 when I ran out and my connection had stopped selling, but beyond that, I've taken maybe 5-7 days off here or there when I had a lot going on in school and life. Nowadays, I average an ounce every 2-3 months. 

Next month I'm starting an internship at a newspaper that *may* drug test. From talking to friends who have interned there, they haven't ever actually drug tested an intern, but the professor who acts as the liaison said HR can drug test on the first day. Obviously, it's not worth the risk. More so, I want to prove to myself that I actually can quit smoking. 

The problem is that I'm struggling way more than I expected. **A lot more.** I just feel so off. I would smoke a small bowl every night before bed to help me sleep, and I would eat almost every meal high. Now, it feels like I can hardly sleep. My sleep cycle is just gone. I basically just sleep in 2-4 hour increments throughout the day, and I have no appetite whatsoever. I eat one small meal a day, and that's just forcing myself to eat once I start to feel really weak. Beyond that, I feel like I have this constant (albeit small) nagging anxiety in me. I'm definitely feeling better than the first 2 days after quitting, but I wasn't expecting to still feel so off. 

I think my problem is that I have no problem not smoking/cutting back when I have things to do, but I'm on a long (the entire month of January) winter break in the northeastern U.S., so I'm mostly just stuck inside. I'd usually just play videogames or something to pass the time, but they just aren't as enjoyable sober. I feel like if it were summer, this would be so much easier because I could actually go out and do things outside and enjoy nature as a distraction. 

Sorry for the long post. I swear I'm almost done lol. I would really appreciate any tips/advice from you guys, as I've always really respected this community. 

I have two other concerns I'd like to bring up though. First, one important reason why I smoked pot frequently is because of back pain. In May 2015, I was rear ended by a guy in a pickup truck who was texting. I had been stopped for 10+ seconds waiting for someone to make a left turn, and he hit me doing around 40mph and caused $15,000+ in damages to my car, which totaled it. As a result, I have several herniated disks in my back, and I'm in almost constant pain. I've been through physical therapy and the chiropractor since then, but it seems like things have more or less leveled off. On really bad days, it seems like the the only time I'd get total relief is if I smoked + took an ibuprofen. Right now, I'm thinking I might just keep the pot I have (probably around 12g) and smoking a small hit in the future when my back is really acting up. Do you guys think I should do this, or should I seek alternatives? I'm worried that I'll fall back into my old routines if I start again, but I don't know.

The second thing I wanted advice on is my friends. So far, they've been absolutely horrible to deal with. I've told them how much I'm struggling, and they're just making it worse. For example, I probably felt the worst ~24 hours after I had quit smoking. One of my friends said he understood how tough it can be and to let him know if I need anything. So, I went over his house that night to hang out thinking it'd get my mind off of it. Nope. As soon as I'm there, he opens a jar and tries to show me/have me smell the weed he had just picked up, and then he pulls out a joint he had rolled and asks me to take a drag on it (unlit) to see how good the airflow was. I think the harder thing is that I've been receiving daily Snapchats of bong rips. Like wtf. Who does that? If a friend tells you he's struggling to quit smoking and says he wants to distance himself from it as much as possible, why would you send him a 1min video of you taking a bong rip or a pic of your freshly cleaned bong?

Sorry again for the long post, but it's 6:15am, I've been up since 3:30 (fell asleep at 12:30), and typing this out has been really cathartic. That, and I'm a journalism major, so I really enjoy writing haha. "

But I thought that I should perhaps post my situation here and maybe get some advice on how to proceed as I feel I am starting to dig myself a deeper and deeper hole.

I am currently in my second year at University (3 years University in Germany) and have to pay all my expenses and bills myself. I have some loans through the University amounting to 9,000 euros currently (with another 3,000 expected for the third year) that I need to pay back after I graduate. Additionally I am expected to pay 5,000 euros a year cash (2,500 per semester). My Spring semester payment is coming up and plainly put, I do not have the capital currently to pay it. 

In terms of liquid assets and debts right now;

I have 
$1,000 in an American bank account.
$1,000 in my PayPal account.
$500 in my German bank account.

I have
A MileagePlus Explorer Card nearly maxed out at $5,800/$6,000 with extremely high monthly payments. I have been making it a point not to miss or make late payments on this since I don't want to ruin my credit, but it's proving hard to keep up. I used this card to pay for my previous year of school and flights from home.
An Amazon.com Visa with $800/1,000 on it. I used this card for school supplies and grocery payments.

In terms of monthly expenses;
$2,500 Spring semester bill due this week (with a possibility of paying in monthly installments of $500 until May)
$80 /mo for Student Insurance
$50 /mo groceries and similar

I also had two jobs this past semester (both Campus Jobs) that pay minimum wage (8,80 Euro) and I average only about 30-40 hours a month between the two of them. However one of the jobs ended in December so I am hunting for another job.

I also need to look ahead as I need to take an internship over the summer to bolster my studies and future career, but I am worried about not earning enough money by doing that so as to afford the final year of University (whereas just working for money in the summer I could potentially earn much much more).

I have some possessions I could potentially sell of (school books, electronics and such) but don't know the best way of doing so in Germany.

I'm really worried right now about how to proceed without digging myself into a deeper hole and was hoping someone here has even a bit of advice to offer me.

Thank you

5mqwns,273,2017-01-08,Hoshi got a raw deal,adamkotsko,DaystromInstitute,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/5mqwns/hoshi_got_a_raw_deal/,"Among the technological downgrades in Enterprise, the lack of a magical translator was one of the most promising, but also least consistently observed. And that left the character of Hoshi in a weird spot. On the one hand, she's probably one of the true geniuses of the Star Trek canon -- she has such a gift for languages that she can begin to pick them up almost immediately. On the other hand, her gifts turn out to be irrelevant most of the time, simply because it eats up a lot of screen time and bogs down the story to have to highlight language differences. 

The same goes for her personality. On all previous Star Trek shows, we're dealing with people for whom long-term deep space travel is a totally normal thing and Starfleet is a prestigious and respected institution. In Enterprise, it's something new and potentially questionable -- and so it makes sense that we would get our first major character who was ambivalent at best about space travel. It's interesting as an _idea_, but in actual implementation, it's hard to see what you do with it. Either you leave Hoshi as a one-note fraidy-cat character, or else you do the only natural character development and she gets over it. So once again, Hoshi's distinctive trait becomes irrelevant.

Hoshi does have her moments of triumph -- becoming the first-ever Star Trek character to go to Risa and simply have a good time, taking command of Enterprise and refusing to back down to the Prime Minister, and of course becoming the Empress in the Mirror Universe. All of that is small consolation, though, for the constant disrespect shown to her character by the writers (who squander an entire episode on her bizarre fever dream during a transporter glitch and at one point have her gratuitously lose her shirt while crawling through the ventilation system) and, even worse, by Captain Archer. 

One of the worst examples comes early on. In ""Silent Enemy,"" Enterprise is confronted with a hostile species with whom they cannot communicate. So naturally, Archer tasks Hoshi with the humiliating task of trying to figure out Lt. Reed's favorite food. Here we have a main plot that literally could not be a better fit for Hoshi's skillset, and she's doing the kind of thing you hand off to an intern. This pattern of disrespect gradually evolves into near-hostility, culminating in Archer's casual disregard for Hoshi's well-being when he needs her to help him decode something on the Xindi weapon. I understand that it was an extreme situation, but he seems to me to show no real sympathy. You almost get the sense that he's mad at her for, you know, breaking under torture, which everyone -- _including Captain Picard!_ -- actually does outside of film fantasies. 

In-universe, Archer's treatment of Hoshi does sadly make sense, because her work is the kind of thing you only notice when it's going wrong. Archer has no idea what is involved in the kind of linguistic work Hoshi does -- in fact, virtually no one on Earth is even approaching her level -- and so he doesn't have a vivid sense of the amazing things she's achieving every day. The only time Hoshi comes clearly into view is when she's either messing up the translation or whining about how scared she is. 

The one saving grace, in my mind, beyond the triumphant plot points listed above, is that they at least do not slot her in as a love interest. In season 1, Trip seems to have a bit of a fixation on her (the kind of thing you probably only notice if you've rewatched it way too many times, as I have), and they put her in repeated situations where Reed feels obligated to ""let her down gently"" (he misinterprets her investigation into his favorite food as a way of propositioning him, and she shows up in his room when she loses her shirt). But when she is finally partnered off, it is in the purely Platonic friendship she develops with the other neglected subordinate, Mayweather. She might not have had much of a chance to develop into a lead character herself, but at least they didn't downgrade her to a prop for another character.

**tl;dr** The character of Hoshi had some built-in limitations, but the writers did her few favors. "

5mruog,1,2017-01-08,"My [f,27] boyfriend[m,26] of 5 years has been inappropriately texting and talking to an attractive coworker [f,25]. Need some advice. WARNING: It's a long story.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5mruog/my_f27_boyfriendm26_of_5_years_has_been/,"It's difficult to make this short as there is a lot of important backstory so brace yourselves. 

My boyfriend (26) and I (27) have been together for 5 years. I am the first serious long term relationship he's had, he's my second. When we first got together, we had known each other for 2 years prior and we weren't planning on being serious. After 3 months of casual dating, he admitted he wanted more and I was starting to feel that way too. 

We've been through a lot together. He had a debilitating skin condition which kept him home, no work or school, for about a year during our 2nd year together, so I basically took care of him that year. It became habit for him to text me and keep in touch while I was at work. It became the norm for us not to have sex often because of the pain it would bring him. I gained about 30 pounds from being so stressed about work and his health all the time, he gained weight from being practically bedridden. That year was a horrible year for the both of us. 

When a new drug trial came out for his skin condition, he was the perfect candidate. He did the trial and it was amazing how well things turned out. He was his beautiful self again. He got his skin problems under control and our lives could be almost normal again. But during this time, I was still overweight, stressed, lacking confidence, got used to not having sex or being intimate, and got used to basically knowing what he was doing and contacting him so much. I never broke away from that which I realize now after what has recently happened that I need to work on that. 

Months later, to help get him back in the working world, I talked to my boss about employing him. I am a project manager in the commercial flooring industry, and we really needed someone to assist the other project managers. My boss met with him and agreed. My bf was grateful. I trained him and we worked together. We worked amazingly well together. After a year of us working together, I was offered a great offer from a competitor. One that I just couldn't refuse. So I left and my bf and I became ""competitors."" It was kind of fun at first because my workplace is about 2 miles away from his so we still got lunch together and teased each other about the situation. But then came the boss's granddaughter. 25 years old, tight body, really attractive, but completely oblivious to the world. She had come around a bit while I was still working there. Of course I saw my bf check her out a few times. I know every guy does it, no big deal. But when I left that workplace, my bf moved up to the project management position and she became his assistant, she took my old desk in our old office for a while. Since she was still in college, her grandfather (bf's boss) said that she could work from home. This was at first, relieving news for me. Then the texting started. First they were texting just about work things. Then he started teasing her,being playful. Then it was mild flirting. I will admit when I saw the text messages (yes I snooped) I went nuts. He had never been that way with anyone in the 5 years we've been together. I didn't like it, and I told him I didn't like what he was saying because it was unprofessional and was going to lead to something else. We had a large fight and several more following about it. After I got onto him about the mild stuff, he decided to delete conversations they were having, and he lied a few times about it until eventually telling me that he did it because he didn't want to fight over nothing. I only found out that he lied because one night she texted a response saying, ""You hush"" at 11pm. I flipped out because why was she saying that? I woke him up and we got into another fight. He said that he had been texting her around 4pm and he made a joke and she was just now responding, which giving the circumstance, I believed him. He put a lock on his phone shortly after that so I would quit snooping and getting angry. He told me that he wasn't going to text her like that again. 

The Friday before Christmas about a week after he put a lock on his phone, I had given up trying to look through his phone. I didn't know his passcode, and honestly I just wanted to move on and forget about it. I figured we've been together 5 years. He's never done anything remotely like that before, but maybe I was out of line and it was innocent flirting. On Christmas eve, since my parent's live about 2 hours out of town, we normally split so I can see my family and he can see his. I spent the night with mine and went over to his family's house on Christmas. He was acting strange. I don't know how to explain it, but I knew something wasn't right. He wouldn't admit anything was wrong. I decided that it was time for me to snoop one more time. I wasn't proud at the time of doing it. But after 2 attempts at this passcode, I figured it out. That's when I saw a ""joke"" he made that basically implied that she made him hard. A funny joke to say to a close friend, but not a female coworker. She, being either oblivious or a good person, took it as just that, a joke and changed the subject. On Christmas eve, which was a Saturday, he stayed up until 1am texting her trying to find out if she liked him, looking for an ego boost. She wasn't biting, either because she wasn't getting what he was saying or knew and was avoiding it. This girl is a little bit of an airhead so it's hard to tell. He was being subtle but then came out and said to her that she was hard to read, etc. getting a little frustrated. He even said, ""I shouldn't be texting you on the weekends."" Apparently he had been drinking with his brothers at the time he was texting her. It was not a very forward conversation but since I know him so well, I knew what he was getting at. You can bet that I unloaded on him. He is a good person and this was so out of character for him. When we talked, he broke down and told me that he bought her gloves and socks for Christmas, which wasn't a huge deal to me because he bought all the coworkers gifts. He didn't have to tell me that part, but he did. He said that he had been really self-conscience and he just wanted to find out if she found him attractive or liked him at all. I felt like he was being honest, and we talked about the lack of affection on my part and our needs emotional and physically. We talked about how I'm controlling and how he needs to be able to have his personal space. But that all being said, I'm still uneasy. He lets me see his phone, but he said that he wants to be next to me when I do it and not behind his back. They still have to work together until tomorrow because luckily she got an internship so she won't be working for her grandfather much if at all. My fear is that they will keep in contact. I just feel betrayed even though nothing physical happened. He admitted to me last night that he likes talking to her. I don't know what to do here. I should've mentioned this earlier, but in all his texts to her, he never once brought me or our relationship up. He had many opportunities to but he didn't. Yesterday she texted him about a project and I saw the text and she gave him a great opportunity to subtly mention me. I even told him line for line what he could say. He didn't do it. He said, ""she knows we are together. I don't have to remind her."" I make it a point that if I'm talking to men without him, to mention him and our relationship. This threw up a huge red flag to me as well.

I just don't know what to think anymore. Before her, he was always so faithful, respectful, and open. I did overreact at first to a few things that he said to her because I was jealous that they had to work together and she's so attractive. I even blamed myself for the situation because I thought maybe my control issues pushed him away and drove him to it. Do I give him an ultimatum, me or her? Do I give him another shot and start over with the potential risk that he may keep contacting her? I've been more physical and intimate with him and he has been helping me out more around the house and has been affectionate. I want this to work, but I just don't know if he really gets what this has done to me. Me being his first long term serious relationship, it's almost like he's got a fear of commitment all of a sudden or that he's just not ready for this. HELP!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was a rather unusual position to find myself in. Not physically as much, no, though my knees were together and my butt muscles clenched to the point where rocks would be jealous of their firmness, my knuckles were white and my neck was frozen stiff from looking straight ahead for at least twenty minutes. I was only aware of the time having passed because I had glanced at my phone at 8:39 PM and the other passenger's phone had Siri--sounding like a 60-year-old man--announce when it was 9:00 PM. The chuckle that he had given upon hearing it was bone-chilling.

""I HOPE I AM NOT MAKING YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.""

It took me a few seconds for my mouth to get wet enough to speak. ""Oh n-n-n-no that's alright! All's well that ends well, as they say!""

""IT'S JUST YOU HAVE BEEN SITTING STIFF AS A CORPSE SINCE I GOT IN.""

""H-hhh-ha-haha! That's pr-pretty funny! Are you a c-comedian by trade?""

""NO.""

Well, I had rather doubted that from the start, much like I had doubted he had had the vocal chords to produce such a deep voice as he did.

""BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD I CAN TELL A MEAN KNEECAP SLAPPER.""

I couldn't help it, it elicited a laughter from me that sounded like a rabid chimpanzee stuck in a trash compactor full of chocolate biscuits. Had he known I enjoyed puns?

""YOU SOUND MORE ALIVE ALREADY.""

""Thanks,"" I offered. I did not quite know how to follow that up, so silence ruled for several minutes. ""My name is Dirk.""

""I KNOW.""

""How do you?""

""BECAUSE I AM DEATH.""

This rather shocked me. I mean, he obviously wasn't a normal man, judging by the skull for a head and the scythe and the bony feet he had put up on the seat opposite from us--though the Uber driver being an off-the-clock limousine chauffeur had already been a bit unrealistic for my tastes--but I had not expected DEATH.

""I had not expected death,"" I told him as such.

""MANY DO NOT.""

""Am I dead?""

""WOULD IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?""

""I think it rather would! I'm in the process of applying for an internship to finish my education, and I do think they would be rather opposed to hiring a dead person!""

This took me aback. Was he asking it rhetorically? Surely DEATH was more intelligent than that. Was he asking philosophically? I could counter him with Descartes, but that didn't seem fruitful. Did he mean to ask whether my life so far had been worthwhile?

""If you're asking rhetorically or philosophically, then, well, I've read a lot of books, played a lot of games. You could say I've lived many lives.""

""AS ONE OF YOUR KIND WOULD SAY IT: ONE-OUT-OF-TEN. TRY AGAIN.""

""Well, I have a good family, some good friends, I've traveled a little, so if you mean it in that regard, I would say I have lived.""

""WILL THEY REMEMBER YOU?""

""I... I hope so.""

""FONDLY?""

""I think so.""

""THAT'S GOOD.""

Things were quiet once more after that, for a good while.

""You're not really a happy presence, are you?""

""DEATH RARELY IS.""

""Fair point.""

""YOU'RE NOT REALLY A RAY OF SUNSHINE EITHER.""

""I guess I wasn't.""

5ms4tl,3,2017-01-08,[SV] I counted calories for 11 months. Losing fat is hard.,temp44748821,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/5ms4tl/sv_i_counted_calories_for_11_months_losing_fat_is/,"28 YO 5'11"" male. I have never been what I would consider fit. Since high school, I've been around 20% body fat most of the time. At the beginning of 2016 I started keeping a food diary (with calorie counts) and tracking my weight with a Google doc. My goal was 155 pounds (my best estimate for what I would weigh at 10% body fat). My strategy was a basic caloric deficit at a rate of one pound a week (2300 - 500 = 1800 calories per day).

Here is a graph of my progress. The green line is my best estimate for the number of daily calories that would let me maintain weight. The blue line is my daily calorie intake, and the red line is 1-week averages. The yellow dots are my weight in pounds.

http://imgur.com/a/7x9Gh

I'm a graduate student. During the spring semester I kept a deficit (on average) by buying lots of fruit, yogurt, and lean lunch meats. I played soccer or jogged maybe once a week. During the summer, while I was away from campus doing an internship, I kept with the same diet, lifted weights for an hour three times a week (3 sets, 6-8 reps on each lift), and ran 3-4 miles once a week. At the end of the summer I reached my lowest weight of the year, 169.

By the time the fall semester arrived, I was sick of being weak, light-headed, and grumpy all day, every day. I told myself that I needed my energy for classes, told myself that I would lift heavier to put on bulk, etc. These were just poor excuses to eat more. I quit trying to hit a deficit, and the last month of the year I pretty much gave up on calorie counting.

I'm disappointed in myself for not making good choices this year. Even though the first ~8 months of the year I made progress, I never felt completely in control of my appetite. I would usually keep a deficit during the week, then binge on the weekends. Then I would try to go super-low calorie or no calorie to make up for my mistake, and then this would lead to another binge. I pretty much yoyo-ed the entire time I was trying to lose.

I'm trying again this year, using MFP to track calories. I thought about taking up a super rigorous running/rowing routine, but I really enjoy soccer and I think I may just try to do that for an hour 3 times a week or so. I'm not sure if this will get me the results I want. We'll see. If anyone else has been in this same situation and found a way through it, I would appreciate your input.

WeThinkCode_ is a mold breaking tech university that is nothing like a traditional one. No fees, no teachers and no set classes means that you have freedom and flexibility to get your projects done. The school is currently based in Johannesburg in the CBD with possible future expansions. The course is completely corporately sponsored so you will also do internships with some of the biggest companies in SA such as Telkom, FNB, Rand Merchant Bank, Allan Grey, Derivco, BBD and many more. The only requirement is that you are between the ages of 17 and 35 and that you can pass our 2 online tests. If you make it that far you just have to survive our month long bootcamp and if you have what it takes you're in. Feel free to ask any question, although I am a student so there's only so much I can answer. Here is our website if you're interested: www.wethinkcode.co.za"
5mu56t,3,2017-01-08,Visiting Law Student Advice,straighttoricks,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/5mu56t/visiting_law_student_advice/,"I'm looking for some advice about whether or not I should apply to be a visiting student for my 3L year. 

When I applied to law school, I wasn't sure that I wanted to live in Michigan, where I lived. So when I was applying, I was trying to go to a decent school but with a lot of scholarship money. I ended up halfway across the country in a top 40 school with a significant scholarship, and was relatively happy for the first year. 

Over the summer, I stayed in the area near my school, thinking that is where I would end up wanting to establish my practice. But I had a terrible experience with my internship. Meanwhile, I started realizing more and more that I wanted to work in Michigan, and that I knew the next summer I would be applying to work back home. 

My boyfriend has a job lined up back in Michigan. Back in September, I also secured a summer associate position at the firm of my dreams back home. It is a mid-size firm (which is what I want to eventually work in), so while there is a possibility of hire upon graduation, they can't guarantee it. I start working in May, and the offer extends through my 3L year (which I would be doing remotely from current law school, but could do in person if I become a visiting student, which would probably mean more hours). 

Since the summer, my mental health has declined. I have always been a kind-of anxious person, but it has escalated into almost daily anxiety/panic attacks. I feel isolated, and am extremely unhappy with where I am at school. I definitely no longer want to work in my current school's area. 

I want to apply to be a visiting student in my home state for my 3L year, and I wanted to hear your opinions. There are not GREAT options as far as law schools go in Michigan. There is obviously UMich (which is where I went to college), but I would be on the fence about being admitted I think, and is much more expensive since I am giving up my scholarship. There are not many law schools in Michigan, and the next best one would be Wayne State University. Many of the practicing lawyers in the area went to Wayne. I think this is ideally where I would end up being a visiting student, because it is less expensive and I would just about break even with what I am paying at my current school. However, it is a law school in the top 100 range, whereas my current is top 40. Do you guys think this would be a bad thing? 

My top priorities right now are my mental health, and securing a job after graduation (like everyone)."
5mulgi,24,2017-01-08,"After a really crappy year, if anyone has the time to pray for my situation I would be really thankful.",oneblazeofglory,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/5mulgi/after_a_really_crappy_year_if_anyone_has_the_time/,"Hey /r/Christianity. I realise that it's nothing compared to what other people are going through right now, but I'd be really grateful for some prayer if someone's willing. 

Basically, I got an offer for a really good job on the other side of my home country from where I lived a year ago which fell through after nine months of waiting and praying, as well as a house move in the midst of the waiting because we didn't renew the contract on our apartment as we believed that it wouldn't take that much longer for the employer to give us some kind of answer. After getting a ""no"", my partner and I were really heartbroken because we'd really felt that God was leading us in that direction and so we'd set other things aside in anticipation. Because we still didn't like where we were, we prayed for another direction and got the message that God wanted us to go back to my partner's home country, so we dropped everything and moved here (with a decent money back-up because of the move across the country we'd been planning for). Since getting here, I've been doing an internship at a church which I'm not enjoying in the slightest (which hurts, because it felt like God was pointing me to this when we decided to move), and finding a job, which I need to get my right to remain in this country, has been a nightmare - I have 2 months left to find work, or I have to leave. My command of the language is good enough that people don't realise that I've only just moved here, but unfortunately it isn't good enough to work in PR and Communications, which is my area of work. I've been applying for every English-only PR / Comms job I could find, with very little success. The past month or so has been particularly bad - in December I was having panic attacks and breakdowns once every three days, and my faith that God is going to come through and intervene here is absolutely shot to pieces. I'm currently much more likely to get angry with God than I am to trust him. 

On Monday afternoon, 4pm Central European Time, I have an interview for a job with an amazing company which feels like it would solve so many of our problems (and of course cause a few, namely that I would once again be looking at moving halfway across the country, this time by myself for the first 6 months as my partner has an internship in the city we currently live in starting this Friday). I really, really want to get it, but after this horrible year job-wise for me and my tendency to get over-excited and put all my hope in getting the job, I'm trying to be realistic and remind myself that I might not get it. 

I don't want people to just pray that I get the job, because through all of this mess I realise I've actually learned something - that God isn't a vending machine, and you can't just pray and receive what you wanted immediately. However, I would be really grateful if someone could pray for a fast answer from the company after the interview, regardless of the outcome. Also for strength for my partner and I as we wait for the answer, and strength to accept the answer, whatever it is, because I know that if it's negative that we're going to go through a fair bit more pain, and if it's positive then we're going to have a few challenges ahead! Only God is going to be able to keep us going, and although I'm doing my best to keep praying and believing for an end to our lack of income and instability, I feel like my tank of faith is running pretty dry. 

Thank you for reading, and God bless. "
5mv7pa,0,2017-01-08,Graduating in May.. jump into a mortgage? Stupid idea?,itsbecccaa,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5mv7pa/graduating_in_may_jump_into_a_mortgage_stupid_idea/,"Before I begin I have searched through this subreddit quite a bit already and honestly it is depressing me. I have been renting an apartment in the STL area with a roommate of mine, and our lease is up at the end of May. I am studying for the CPA exam right after graduation so I need/want an 'office' where I can put a desk and study in peace outside of my bedroom. My roommate and I went apartment hunting this weekend and found out that anything that is a 3 bedroom or has enough space for our taste is going to be $1150 for low base, without electric and internet on top. 

In May after I graduate my internship at an accounting firm will roll over into a full time position (I have an offer letter signed already and I will be making $52k for a year or two until I pass the CPA) so I am planning to stay in the area for at least 5 years, if not more. I don't know my roommate's plan after a few years, but the idea occurred to me that if I were to purchase a home, she could temporarily help with the mortgage if I rent her a room, and then when she needs to move on I will still be fine on my own (or with my current SO). I would get the mortgage on my own, with my own income as the only factor in case she fell out. 

I guess general opinions would be nice. Has anyone secured a loan with just an offer letter? I also am looking at townhome/condo styles, because of less maintenance, but I am afraid of HOA fees. The goal here is to save money, but after my research I am curious if this might be a bad idea. My ideal home would be around the $150k range, but this may be beyond my reach. 
Edit: Forgot to mention, I won't have much of anything saved for up front costs, maybe a few thousand, but Missouri has ""first home buyer"" programs that can grant up to 4% of the purchase price to help with closing costs/downpayments.

Thanks for any help. Sorry this is long."
5mw0ev,67,2017-01-09,"Four Years of Anticipation, and Three Days of Participation [MF] (M24 F21) LONG",thenewthrowaway90,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/5mw0ev/four_years_of_anticipation_and_three_days_of/,"I've been lurking and commenting on this sub for a while (using my not throwaway account, thank you very much). Before we get into the story I will say that we had exceptional chemistry (being a horny 24 year old and her being a horny 21 yo probably went a long way with that), and that chemistry is what led me to write about this encounter. It took me a week to organize my memories of the night, and find the time to write this (that battlefield one....) so I admit that the dialogue is not 100% but this is gonewildSTORIES not gonewild: Legal deposition so it will have to do.

When I was going to community college I was working for an auto parts store. After a year or so of working I got promoted to an assistant manager, a few months after that Diana started working at the same store.
Diana was fresh out of high school, 18 years old and she looked and acted very young when she started. For reference I was 20 when she started. She was about 5'5""-5'6"" skinny, light skinned Hispanic (her skin was the color of hot coco), and her face was very pretty with an Aztec nose and thick black hair framing her face beautifully. She had a fairly cute ass, although there wasn't much of it at the time. She still looked and acted like a freshman in high school which was a big turn-off, and every other sentence she said had the word ""fuck"" in it, which is a really bad habit for a sales counter job (but great in bed...) She would get defensive if you tried to help her or show her a trick in the computer system, again a turn off, but outside of that she was usually really nice to me.

After 2 years of university and 1 year of paid internship, I moved back to the town where I attended CC to start my career. I started working on a project car, which led to a trip to the parts store at least once a weekend. Diana was still working there, she would always come around the counter and give me a big hug any time I walked in. This went on for a few weekends as I made my regular trips to the store, and we would make small talk for a few minutes, catching up and in hindsight she was being a little flirty the whole time.

In these last 3 years she matured a hell of a lot, emotionally and physically. Her hips were a littler wider, giving her a very nice figure. her ass and legs got a little thicker(average to a little more than average), and there was a lot more going on under that unflattering uniform shirt than there had been when last I saw her. She is probably 140-150lbs, and overall a medium/average build, curvy in the right places. Her face was as cute as ever, a little fuller softening her cheekbones and just damn... Her thick jet black mop of hair in a pony tail as per dresscode topped of a truly beautiful young woman. She carried herself like an adult, fewer ""fucks"" in sentences, seemed to care about her job more and some other attributes that showed maturity. She became way more attractive as a person in my eyes and I was thinking about asking her out after the holidays.

The day before New Year's eve I went in to return a few things, and she happened to be the closing manager that night. I got there about an hour before closing and it was just her and another kid in the store. We were talking for a few minutes at the counter she started to get pretty forward, for a workplace at least. She was running her hand along my arm and making tons of eye contact. Amazingly, me a man, got the hint. I asked if she had plans after she left work and if she wanted to join me downtown. She said that she would love to but she wanted to clean up after work, before I could suggest anything she said that I could pick her up at her place at 9 and she texted me her address. I went home and changed into a nicer pair of jeans and shirt, we had decided on a western place for drinks so Wrangler's and Ariats were the way to go.

I got to her place right at 9, she wasn't ready, which I fully expected given she would have got out of the store at 8:15. She opened the door in nothing but a towel, she pulled me inside and gave me a kiss on the cheek.
""Oh you look good as a cowboy!"" At 6'2"" 210lbs, and kinda bulky muscular; I fit a cowboy build well. ""I'll be right out."" She walked back into the bedroom and I got a glimpse of her cute ass peaking out the bottom of her towel. A few minutes passed and she came back wearing a knockout pair of jeans and a red silky bra while holding two different cowgirl style blouses. Her breasts looked amazing, probably a full C-cup that fit her figure perfectly.

""Which one do you like?""

I chose the white with blue trim because she looked like a real Mexican cowgirl, a vaquera if you will (yes she is of Mexican decent, that wasn't a generalization). She put it on in front of me and pulled me off the couch. ""Come on, let's go!!""

At the bar she ordered a tropical margarita while I sipped whiskey. We were sitting at a corner high-top with a bench seat which gave us a fair bit of privacy. After talking for a while, ""You know, I had such a crush on you when we worked together,"" she said.

""Really?"" I chuckled, ""I thought you were cute too, but we were coworkers, and I was technically your supervisor.""

""No, we never could have pulled it off then, but now..."" I pulled her a little closer before she could finish and ran my hand on her hip and thigh. She started stroking my thigh. We got more and more handsy from there, relying on the table and the bench seat for cover. She leaned into me, lifting a cheek of the seat, I had my hands all over her ass, and would run my fingers along her spine, reaching under the flowing blouse she had on, she was rubbing my crotch, trying to build a hard-on but the way I was lodged in my boxer-briefs it couldn't get free, and it was actually a little painful trying to grow. I had to ask her to stop, she pouted and gave me puppy dog eyes so I HAD to explain what was going on... in my pants... awkward...

By then she was on her third marg and I my second whiskey. We agreed to finish this round and head out. Walking back to the car we had our hands in each other's back pockets. She told me to head to my place, luckily I had straightened up a bit when I changed.

We got in the front door and attacked each other with kisses, my hands were all over her tugging at her blouse and caressing her soft skin. We got our shirts off and made it to the couch. I sat down and she straddled me. We were in perfect sync, as I would turn to kiss her neck she would nibble my ear, we would go back to our lips at the same time, and then venture elsewhere. Her long black hair fell around our heads, it was like being behind a curtain at a strip club, except I got to touch her and wasn't throwing $1s her way. It was so steamy and I was so caught up in her I hadn't even taken her bra off yet. I finally unclasped it and let her C-cups free. I squeezed them and rubbed her rock hard nipples as her tongue shot into my mouth and her hands rubbed every inch of my shirtless body. Things continued for a bit longer before I grabbed the front of her pants and started to undo the button.

""Wait.""

""What's wrong?""

""Nothing, everything's great, I just want to say a couple things before we go any further.""

""Oh... ok?"" I said trying to cover my impatience with concern.

""I'm on birth control so you don't need a condom and... I really I like it when guys... you know... finish inside,"" she said smiling naughtily at every pause.

""Trust me, that won't be a problem.""

""I also like things kinda rough. So squeeze my ass, hold me tight, if it's too much I'll tell you, but don't be shy about grabbing me with those big hands! Everything you were doing with your hands was perfect. Your hands were all over me, not just my boobs, or ass..."" She smiled ear to ear and closed her eyes, ""I loved it.""

""I couldn't let just one part of you get *all* the attention. I had to make sure your ass,"" taking a double handful, ""hips"" grabbing them hard, ""lips"" kissing her deeply ""back"" dancing my fingers up her spinning causing her to tremble and roll her eyes back ""tits... everywhere got some love.""

She covered me in kisses and begged, ""take these fuckin pants off me."" I slid her off my lap, grabbed her hips and spun her so she was facing away. She bent over causing a thong that matched the bra (currently hanging off of my tv) to play peek-a-boo. Before pulling her pants down, I gave her a couple spanks, and found her legs far too close together, I ran my hand up her thighs all the way to the seam in her pants and let my thumb press on the denim covering that ass, and fingers press against the thin layer hiding her crease. I forced her legs a little wider, I was able to see her tits and long hair draped down through the newly opened gap. Finally I pulled her pants down, she kicked them off and assumed her previous position to let me do the same to her thong. It was a regular thong, not a little g-string and her full and shapely ass hid it well.

By this time I was so horny I could feel it in my eyes... I was ready to dig my tongue into her pussy, I couldn't wait any longer, I would have gone berserk if I had spent one more second teasing her (and I guess myself, unintentionally). I slid her panties off and beheld the most welcoming pussy I had ever seen. Her puffy lips glistening, parted ever so slightly inviting me in, her panties heavy in my hand from her juices. I dropped to my knees in front of the couch, and kissed her cute little ass and the back of her thighs before teasing her lips with my tongue. As my tongue parted her lips slightly and teased her. I had one hand on her ass, one taking care of everywhere else. Then I buried my face in her, her taste was light and made me want even more. She reached a hand back to rub her clit. She kept talking dirty, ""Don't Stop"" ""Oh fuck like that"" I moved my tongue out to her clit and she went wild. Her hips ground on my face, her moans and ""oh fucks"" grew breathless and became ""I'm gonna cum..."" A moaning ""Gaaaaawwwwwwdd"" erupted from her.

She collapsed to her knees and turned to face me, in a heartbeat she had my pants and boxers off. ""Your balls are so big!"" as she cupped them and grabbed my cock with her other hand, I'm a little under 6.5 inches and proportional girth but I do have fairly large balls (according to her). Looking up at me from down on her knees, ""I hoped you would look like this naked.""

""You hoped to see my cock?"" I asked playfully.

""I told you I had a crush on you, and girls think about fucking too."" She quipped back without missing a beat, just before putting my head in her mouth. This was one of the hottest things to look down on, her mouth on me, her big brown eyes looking up at me, one hand grabbing my shaft the other on my balls. I moved my hands to her shoulders and gently rubbed them, since they were the only part of her I could reach. She moved her hand off of my shaft and took more of me in her mouth, she grabbed my wrist and pulled my left hand off her shoulder and onto her head. I took a handful of her thick hair which made her gently nod, then she pushed my hand onto her head to tell me to start pulling her onto me, when I applied a little pressure her nod got bigger and a smile grew across her face. I was conservative at first, only pulling her onto a little under half, then a little more, more, more, she started to gag with an inch left, I gently pulled her head back, she took a breath and pounced back onto my cock. She took it to where she gagged and then pushed down the last little bit until her nose was pressed into me. She coughed on it and tried to moan between coughs, it felt like an eternity but was probably 5-7 seconds.

As soon as she released me I pulled her up and kissed her, ""We're going to the bed,"" I said matter of factly. I lifted her by her ass, digging my fingers into her. We locked lips, and I lowered her down so her pussy was rubbing against my cock as I walked her to bed (I kinda stick straight out so I wasn't going to accidentally pop in). I laid her down and kissed her thighs, and hips, finally getting to admire the front view of a freshly shaved pussy. I kissed my way up to her tits and played with her nipples in my mouth, she was reaching down between us and guided me into her pussy while I was fondling her great tits. She moaned as I pushed in slowly and all the way. She grabbed my ass with both hands and followed along as I increased my intensity. We had a little gap between us which let me explore her body with my free hand, breasts, hips, hair, cheeks, wherever looked neglected. I had worked up a pretty good rhythm and she was showcasing her dirty talk, filling the room with ""oh god"" ""fuck me"" and ""yes"" and more I wish I could remember. After a few minutes she told me to roll over. She climbed onto me Cowgirl style and started to ride me. She found a good angle, her face told me she was right on her g-spot. A combination of bouncing and grinding that was driving both of us wild. I was all over her again, my hands never spent more than a few seconds on anyone spot. Her hands were giving me the same treatment which was insanely hot because I had never been with a girl who was so active with her hands.

""I'm about to cum, are you?"" She panted.

""Almost little more.""

""Keep fucking me once I cum, oh god, fuck YESSS!"" She shouted. I could feel her pussy and thighs quiver, she dropped herself onto me grabbed my face and kissed me. I grabbed her hips to push her a little lower, I took her ass in my hand and started thrusting into her. She moaned like crazy as I pounded her in reverse missionary (??? making up a name). She started to nibble on my collar bone and kiss my neck. I was ready to burst, I thrust and pinned myself in her as I shot into her ready pussy.

""Ooooo that feels like a lot.,"" her words leaked out of her giant smile. She gently rolled her hips as my cock softened in her and she kissed me with as much vigor as we had at the start of the night. We made out for a while as we cooled down and passed out.


New Year's Eve


I woke up before her, she was face down on my bed, her hand on my chest, legs spread just a little leaving a pleasant booty and leg outline under my sheet. I slid out and went to the bathroom. When I came back she was awake, lying in bed, with the blanket covering her, ""Morning!"" she smiled and lifted blankets inviting me back into bed. I climbed in and she cuddled up to me, me on my back her on her side pressing the soft skin of her breasts and stomach against me, she finished getting comfortable by tossing a leg over mine and nuzzling her face into my chest. I placed my arm around her hip, gave her a deep kiss and we just laid there for a bit.

She was staring intently at my right nipple and, while it is quite interesting I admit, I could tell she was thinking about something else. I gave her a squeeze and rubbed her hip, she snapped out of her daze, I asked what was on her mind. She asked, ""Did you have fun last night?""

""Yeah, you felt so good in my arms, and we we're in perfect sync... It was a great night. Did you enjoy every...""

""Oh my God, yes,"" she chuckled, ""you made me cum twice, once while you were going down on me and once while we were having sex. And then... the way you stayed in me after you came, it felt so good to have you pressed up to me while we were making out after.""

""You really like it when I finished in you?""

""Yeah"" she said with an embarrassed and blushed face, ""It just feels so good... I mean it's where you're supposed to finish. And I also just like cum."" She slid down and put my soft cock in her mouth, she started sucking hard, I could feel the blood rush in, I was getting hard almost instantly. I rearranged us so we were 69-ing and my head was propped up to make up for our height difference. She wasn't wet yet, but I could feel so much heat coming off of her, I kissed the back of her thighs, and her ass, I could start to see her pussy glisten. I was running my hands all over her, she was sucking my cock so well, her rhythm was great and she was taking me deep enough to hear an occasional gag or cough, which was driving me wild. I kissed her pussy, which was finally ready for more, I began to explore her with my tongue.

""Are you close?"" She asked.

""Yeah getting close but not quite.""

""Stand up!""

We switched so she was kneeling in front of me again. She grabbed my ass, and started sucking again, I grabbed the back of her head just like last night. ""Oh god, I'm close, I'm gonna cum!"" She pulled off and stroked me. Her eyes closed, smiling, licking her lips, I was ready, I tried to hold it in.... hold... hold... but she wasn't moving her face, finally release... sweet knee buckling release... all across her face and some weaker shots onto her chest.
She stood up and stared into my eyes as she licked up what she could, then used her finger, to clean her face and breasts. She kissed my chest a little before grabbing my hand and taking me into the bathroom. She took a swig of my mouth wash, and I did the same. She rinsed her face and I lifted her onto the counter so we could start kissing again.

""I have never cum on a girl's face before, that was amazing""

""Really? I like getting creampied more, but if I really like the guy.... Well *you* can cum where ever you want."" We went back to making out for a few minutes, ""are you getting hard again?"" I hadn't realized it but I was. ""What am I going to do with this?"" She said taking it in her hand, and rubbing the tip against her pussy. ""I was going to shove your head down there so you could eat me out but..... now that you're hard again..."" She pulled the first inch into her and I took it from there. She laid her hand on my chest keeping a little gap between us. Her free hand roamed over my body, I was holding her hip with one hand, and caressing every inch with the other. The dirty talk started again, well when her mouth wasn't pressed to mine. She was describing how hot it was to watch me fuck her. I carried to the bed a second time, but with her pussy wrapped around my cock. I laid her on her back and resumed thrusting into her while I was standing at the edge of the bed. She started to beg me to make little changes, ""Baby, hold my legs. Lift my ass of the bed,"" her eyes lit up, ""yes right there!"" She started moaning, only separated by her taking a breath, or telling me not to stop. She dug her nails into my arms. I could feel her legs tremble in my arms. She asked to change to doggy, I put her on the bed and climbed up and picked up where I left off.

""Do you like doggy style?""

""Not really. It feels good but I never get off from it.""

""Reallllllly?"" I said as I ran my hands along her stomach and up to her breasts, I lifted her off of her hands changing my angle in her, once I got her high enough up she started moaning, and shouting how that would make her cum again, but it was a little too much and she begged to be put back into regular doggy. Her near orgasm pushed me over the edge and I dribbled into her.

We laid back in bed and wrapped our arms around each other. She went back to staring at my chest and absentmindedly playing with my chest hair for a few minutes. Again I knew she was thinking about something, so I took a guess at it. ""Do you want to... maybe...try... something a little... more like dating and not being fuck buddies, or whatever?"" (Extra smooth, as..... always....).

She gave me a big kiss, and said yes, so I said I was taking her to breakfast. We hopped in the shower and fondled one another through the suds before heading out to a little place.

Over breakfast we talked about the things we had in common, and I generally had a good feeling about things. We decided to hang out for a bit before I dropped her off to get ready for my friends New Year's Party.

We went out and walked around downtown for a bit, surprisingly she lead me into the local adult store, she walked me over to the dvd area and playfully said, ""Here are all the Latina movies, since I know you like that,"" she gave me a wink, ""I'm going over to the other side with the lingerie, NO PEAKING, I want it to be a surprise!"" She patted my ass as she turned and walked through the door that separated what were once two separate stores.

A little while went by and I got bored of looking at the ""lusty latinas"" franchise of films and wandered aimlessly in the store until she came around with a little black plastic bag and we left the store and headed to her place.

After I had dropped her off I went home and got ready. We had always planned to leave from my place and take a cab, so I was waiting for her to drive up. She had her make up on but not her dress, she brought in a little over night bag and a garment bag with her dress. As we finished getting ready she explained her bag, seeing as we would obviously spend the night together, I agreed with her logic.

We drank a little too much at the party, made out sloppily during the cab ride home and passed out with out anything of note happening.


New Year's Day


I woke up with a splitting headache and made my way to the kitchen, took some advil, I took her the bottle and a bottle of water and left on the night stand. Once the advil started working I made some bacon, cooked some eggs in the bacon trippings, made a stack of toast and set my little kitchen table. I heard her up and about after the bacon was finished, but she didn't make an appearance until I was almost done cooking.

She was just in her little black thong, I had gotten her out of the dress last night but no further. She was in pretty rough shape. We dug into breakfast, ate way too much and turned on netflix while our bodies digested and fought off a hangover.

Some 4 episodes of Daredevil later, we were back to our old selves. Which is to say, horny. Making out quickly led to my boxers and her panties meeting on the floor. I got on my knees in front of the couch and started licking her nearly steaming slit. I went slow, I wanted to tease her, her fingers were already in my hair, but I wanted her to rip in out pulling my head up to her clit to finally let her release. One finger probed her depths, her whole body shook as she yanked my head so my lips were on her clit, in less than 30 seconds of moderate passed flicking I had her whole body convulsing. Her hips tilted back, her heals were digging into my shoulder blades, her hands were crushing my skull against her hips and her whole body was trembling. She was still shaking when she pulled my lips to hers and the making out started all over again. Once I was sure she recovered, ""Wanna try my version of doggy style again??""

She nodded eagerly and assumed the position bent over my couch. I slid in and cupped her breasts again, we got adjusted so I was on that perfect spot and after getting my rhythm she was whipping her hair around and moaning. I grabbed her hair and gently pulled it, which was her cue to talk dirty. Her begging me to pull her hair even more and pound her was rapidly pushing me to my limit. I told her I was cumming, but after I had let loose she begged ""not yet!"" As soon as I was done I pulled out and she panted, ""finger me, quick, I'm so close!!"" I managed to find her spot and vigorously went after it. She started to tremble, but kept feeding me a stream of ""don't stops."" She grabbed my wrist and withdrew my fingers. Diana collapsed on the couch and fed herself our combined juices from my fingers. I sat down and she laid her head in my lap."

I have worked a software engineering internship at a reasonably large tech company. And what I've noticed is that most software engineers, IT personnel, etc. are INCEL TO THE CORE, or close to it. Out of all my male friends (not that I have any female friends), NOT ONE has a girlfriend. My classes are 90%+ dudes, I have not met one who has a girlfriend or speaks to women at all.

This is how society's hardest workers are rewarded.

**EDIT**: Wrote this to blow off steam last night, did not expect it to get any comments at all much less blow up like this. ""Society's hardest workers"" was a stretch, and I have worked with quite a few engineers who are happily married. 

However, it is still apparent that men in technical fields tend to have less success with women on average, especially in college."
5mwa1h,1,2017-01-09,Grad School Application - Need some people to review my PS to law school.,HiSoArshavin,CFBOffTopic,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFBOffTopic/comments/5mwa1h/grad_school_application_need_some_people_to/,"Hello everybody, 

I'm notified this sub a couple of weeks ago of my applying to law school, and now I need your guys help. 

If any of you are lawyers, attended law/grad school, talented English writers, or simply intelligent people who give a damn about a ""somewhat"" active person on this sub, I' greatly appreciate it. 

~~~~~~~~

There are experience or events which strike one so deeply that to ignore them is excruciatingly impossible, or at the least, deeply uncomfortable. My time at xxx is such a phenomenon. 

Attending xxxx was a direct result of both my underwhelming (some would even say mediocre) academic performance in high school, coupled with my insistence of paying my own way through university. My father being a professor at xxx certainly influenced my decision as I was somewhat familiar with the university culture. But initially, I saw attending xxxx as a symbol of my forthcoming redemption, the place where I would essentially rise from mediocrity and be born again as a student of boundless intellectual curiosity.

I can happily say that I fulfilled most of my goals. While I encountered rough patches - due mostly to my commitments outside the classroom (I worked 25-40 hours a week throughout college to afford tuition, room and board), I was able to graduate with a degree in Economics while participating in a various medley of experiences of such that without certain faculty, I would have been unaware of to this day.

Unfortunately, I know that my experiences and sentiments were not shared by many of my fellow students, particularly students of color. With many students of color at xxxx being first-generation, there is a lack of knowledge that afflicts some of these students when it comes to navigating the maze that university can be – particularly when it comes to such topics as major selection and how students should go about pursuing their careers. As a student worker, I witnessed countless instances of advisers shoehorning many of these students away from the majors of their choice, and guiding them towards majors which required much less work, offered much bleaker employment prospects, and which were completely misaligned with the student’s academic interests or passion. 

As I’ve come to discover, such actions have various implications which one could describe as a negative feedback cycle. Due to such a lack of students of color within certain majors or departments, internships and scholarships at xxx specifically targeting students of color are often low in number, and subsequently have a low number of eligible students. This in turn leads to companies and organizations being heavily discouraged, which prompts them to often suspend their various offerings. This leads to even lesser opportunities, and even greater amounts of students suffering as result. However, the most severe effects are the changed hiring practices of many companies in the area. I was told in confidence after the completion of one my internships that the stated company had been searching for a suitable student of color to intern for them for almost five years to no avail. The students either weren’t there, were there in such low numbers that their odds were low to begin with, or had performed poorly through the interview process. As intelligent as I may be, I find it highly unlikely that I was indeed the only suitable candidate in a university of over xxxx undergraduates, of which almost 40 percent of students of color.

Of course, I was somewhat insensitive to cases of such discrimination until experiencing it firsthand. On one lackluster autumn day, I walked into the advising area of the business school after requesting an exemption from taking a particular business course. As I walked into the advisers office, the adviser was seated. She then took one long look at me and then excused herself, only to return with numerous pamphlets which detailed various alternative majors in the business school and other schools at xxxx. I became very hesitant, but I was there to accomplish something, so I sat down. The next words she uttered to me were “Transferring out of xxxx isn’t the end of the world, you have multiple alternative options you can pursue.” Now as you can probably imagine, I was quite confused. This wasn’t standard practice for advisers – normally advisers at the business school would print out your academic performance report to re-acclimatize themselves with a student’s current standing. I brushed it off, and mentioned to her that my meeting was for a class exemption, and not a change of major. She then stared at me quizzingly for a long while, and then proceeded to print out my academic record. Upon returning to speak with me, she looked quite frazzled and softly apologized, but I believe my facial expression divulged the fact that the damage was done. I subsequently withdrew from the business school, and was admitted to the xxx.

Now, I’m not impervious to the alternate explanations that my adviser may have been having a bad day, or that many students may have been transferring out during that period, among many others. Unfortunately, I had heard much too many similar stories from other students of color, and upon my inquiry to many of of the Caucasian students within my economics and finance cohort, I learned that they had never experienced anything of the sort. Coupled with the fact that the middle of the semester isn’t a usual time for intra-department transfers, I was forced to face reality. 

Discrimination on the basis of race is explicitly prohibited by the American Constitution, but alas, it still does occur today. Such instances don’t entirely mar my college experience of attending xxx, but knowledge of the fact there are numerous people, (no less numerous students) defenseless against such actions has fortified a strong sense of action within me to correct not only the inefficiencies which result from such practices but also the constructs which allow for such discrimination to occur. I know that my knowledge of these occurrences will motivate me while attending law school to not only acquire thorough knowledge of the law, but will also enable me to serve as a legal advocate for those who undergo similar situations as I did, regardless of whether they are regardless of their title. In addition, I know that a legal degree will provide me an opportunity to inform other people of color (in particular African-American males) that there is indeed a legal process which one can utilize to advance their platforms and welfare, and long as they are deemed legal. With the rise of Black Lives Matter, there has been a rise in the awareness of various injustices committed against African-American nationwide, but accompanying this has also been an increasing polarization regarding the best course of action to resolve such issues. I believe that it is of the utmost importance that African-American males are more aware of those who look like them who are able to advocate for them, for I believe that social change is a long and tenuous process, which requires compromise and multiple years of hard work.

I'm currently in a position in which I find it extremely hard to rationalize out of. I'm graduating this Spring with a BS in Computer Science, with no internship experience, and a pretty average GPA (3.4-3.5). I, unfortunately, have had a lot of anxiety coupled with imposter syndrome the past few months since applying for graduation. The thought of never being a good enough programmer surfaces in my head when I start to panic about my future and career. It's comforting to think about working on my own projects, but the idea of working with others is a bit worrisome. My boyfriend tells me I'm a good programmer, that I *get* it well, and sometimes when I'm doing well on my projects I DO feel like I am good at what I do, but there have been times where I wonder if I can fit in working among other people. If they would accept me as I am or would they think of me as someone who's trying to be something they're not? This makes me feel like I am the textbook case of Imposter Syndrome. :/

I DO love programming and building things and have even built a game from scratch (since i didn't know about game engines at the time), but my fear of not being ""good"" enough for a company still drives me off from applying to the places i should already have applied for. I'm embarrassed to say my self-esteem has/is becoming a detriment to my future. I could've started and finished an internship (or a few) the previous years had I just went for it, but instead I was always pushing it off feeling like I wasn't good enough *yet.* 

Has anyone else felt similarly when applying for jobs? If so, how did you get past it? "

Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut/friends/online. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy.

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere and face fucking. While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

5mx64q,3,2017-01-09,My first apartment experience....,Rexnone,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/5mx64q/my_first_apartment_experience/,"Hey guys, 

I live in a apartment building and have been through everything here. This was the last straw I think. I feel like I need to vent. Before I start, I know the number answer is gonna be ""why didn't you leave/move out yet?"". 
This is my first apartment after leaving home and I guess I just didn't know what to do next or that it was ok to leave.
I moved away from home in 2012 and stayed in a college residence while completing my internship for 4 weeks. After I completed it my company offered me a job and I needed a place to stay ASAP. I found this building in downtown Calgary fast. I was so excited!! My own place! This is where the first problem began. I used my washroom and my toilet was broken. It wouldn't flush. I thought it was clogged but it was 100% broken. I was forced to use the restaurant bathroom which was 11 flights of stairs on the ground level for 5 days while they ordered me a new toilet. Every night having to use the washroom I had to make that journey. It was a awful bathroom to, it was used as storage for janitorial supplies.
The next thing to go was my fridge. It started off as a rattle which graduated into a deafening BANG every few hours. Imagine a truck backfiring in your kitchen every night. I went down to ask for help and they would say they fixed it and then later that night BANG! It would happen again. I lost a lot of milk and veggies thanks to that one. New fridge was ordered. 
After the backfiring fridge my dishwasher went. Water would spray out of the sides on occasion. Management was actually good with this one. They fixed it eventually. The big one was the heat. My first year here was the worst winter I experienced. What made it worst was that I suffered through it without any heat in my apartment. Every day was a challenge. I would wake up frozen every morning. I complained and complained and complained. They would send a guy up who said they fixed it, and not to my surprise nothing was fixed. I would come home in my jacket and keep it on until bed time. My land lord told me one day to keep my oven on and oven door open. Every year I struggle with the heat. 
Another struggle is the drains. This problem is like Russian Roulette. Imagine yourself in the living room watching TV, then you hear a rumble and a water sloushing noise. You run to the kitchen to see dirty water shooting out of your drain 2 feet high! The smell is awful, rotten eggs. I had to air out my apartment for hours after that. This problem is a reoccurring one. The solution from management is ""always leave your kitchen sink drain clog in"". I forgot one day and came home from my 12 hour shift to all my lights on, kitchen mat and door mat SOAKED and THROWN in my bath tub and dirty brown kitchen tiles. No note was left, no call made to me, nothing. 
Moving on now and yes there is more. My living room flooded. It caused my floor boards to squish with every step I would take. Water came seeping up. They tore off my floor boards and I was left with a cement living room for 7 days. 
Every couple of weeks the building says they have to do maintenance and they shut off the hot water. This is particularly not fun cause then I either have to microwave bowls of water or take a extremely cold Siberian like winter shower. Those mornings are not fun and are extremely frequent. 
Last July I came back from a 13 day vacation with my girlfriend from Paris. I got into my apartment and smelled a musty smell. My girlfriend called me to the bathroom and I found what happened. My bathroom drop down ceiling had caved in from what looked like a leak. The bathroom drop ceiling tiles were all warped and scattered across the bathroom. Mold and stuff was forming on the ground. I called the emergency numbers in my lease and they had told me to wait for a call back. We waited for hours and got no calls. We kept calling them because once again I was with no bathroom. The emergency person on call was on vacation and no one was there to replace him. 24 hours later they came and replaced the tile. They didn't clean anything but replaced the tiles. I had to go down and complain to get my bathroom cleaned of mold and debris. 
Now the title of the thread. For the last year I thought I had allergies. In fact I've been to the doctor multiple times and have been told I have hives. Crazy itchy red lumps that vary in size and shape. I still don't know what it is. 3 hours ago I was laying in bed and moved my blanket to see a bug crawling on my bed. A bedbug. I was horrified. They say there's never only one and there's probably a colony in here somewhere. I don't know what to do now. I want to get rid of everything and just get out of here. I have been up the whole night cause I feel like my skin is crawling and I'm so angry."

I graduated with my undergrad in philosophy, not psych, and I would have to go back to CC and then do some ""open university"" classes while working on internships/volunteer stuff to be accepted to a decent grad program. But each grad program has its own specific criteria for non-psych majors to have the pre-requisites. 

So I'm wondering which school's pre-requisites I should focus on more and eventually apply to. How big a difference is there between, say, a clinical psych program at UC Berkeley or UCLA vs a Cal State like Sacramento or San Francisco, or maybe something in another state that's less amazing than UCLA? If the programs all purport to get students the internships and degrees required to do work, then if I were to do private practice, why would it be beneficial for me to work drastically harder to get into a ""good"" top school if I'm not interested in doing research or teaching? I just want to help people in therapy. "

I know only the very basic rules of looking professional, like matching your belt and shoes and how to make up a tie in a half-Windsor knot. I recently got my first watch since I was 8, which is a 1st gen Moto 360. I've been thinking that maybe a smartwatch isn't such a great thing if I want to look professional or at least to wear to nice events. 

Do any of you have opinions on having a separate watch for dressing up? If so, should it be more plain or does it help to have a more flashy watch? I will need to serve as an intern as part of earning my degree and I want to make a good impression. 

Sorry if this isn't the right place to be asking. This sub inspired me to get myself more organized and to simplify my everyday life.

5mzhbe,2,2017-01-09,How to break into business/corporate law,JayLevi,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/5mzhbe/how_to_break_into_businesscorporate_law/,"I am currently a 2L at a tier 2 law school that is well known in my city. I decided to do a focus on business law this year, and have done well so far in those courses. However, I've recently started to look for an internship and have not heard back from any jobs that are in this field. I have a BA in political science and have had multiple internships in the political field. Currently I have an internship at a small law firm that specializes in family law. My dream job would be to work as in-house counsel for a corporation but I feel like if I can't find an internship in that field now, I will never be able to break into it. 

Essentially, I would like to know how other law students, in similar situations, have been able to get internships/jobs that focus on business or corporate law. I would also love to hear from any lawyers who work as in-house counsel and how they ended up there."
5mzhrg,0,2017-01-09,[M(as A)4F(as A)] A collection of prompts for your viewing pleasure. Hope you enjoy!,freddiemercurious,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5mzhrg/mas_a4fas_a_a_collection_of_prompts_for_your/,"Hello there! I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

────────

 1. 

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

 1. Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! 

I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

 1. Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon!

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Pet Wolf- All credit goes to /u/roughCanid.  This is a simple prompt. The setting; generic fantasy medieval world. You? Any girl you want, be it a princess, huntress, druid, or innocent damsel. Me? Your loving and precious pet dire wolf. I was given to you as a pup, trained by your parents to protect and love you always. I was trained to fight and kill for you, but I was also trained to be gentle with you. As we grew up, we've grown more attached. You'd trust me with secrets, problems, even fantasies, in spite of the obvious fact that I cannot speak to you. Before you knew it, you found yourself in bloom. And with how often we were together, I would be exposed to your scent constantly. Perhaps you wanted this to happen, or perhaps you truly didn't know. But the fact remains that I was a wolf without a mate, and you were a female in heat. My training can only hold so long, and when you least expect it I may revert to a more feral and instinctive behavior. Because as much as I love you, I am still a wolf.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Transformation- Idea based on this story: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnxdFRVfWzQinY3VoIgsqX3zvurLk5GZk2HbIDvoVyc/edit?usp=sharing. General idea is that I would play a nondescript college male who is a follower, and joins in with making suggestive comments to you, who happens to be a witch. You curse me so that every time I make a comment to a girl or dont wear the women's underwear you cursed, another part of me turns female."
5mzjl5,19,2017-01-09,Hyped for LCS? Want to play and be broadcasted yourself? You can! Announcing the CompeteLeague 2017 Spring Season! Professionally run &amp; broadcasted amateur leagues for EUW and NA!,Mindmesser,CompeteLeague,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/comments/5mzjl5/hyped_for_lcs_want_to_play_and_be_broadcasted/,"This is an x-post from /r/leagueoflegends - as always I'm throwing it up here too so that you guys can have a look if you like!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, I’m Liam, the director of [CompeteLeague](https://lol.competeleague.com/). We’ve been around the League of Legends scene for a number of years now, providing and completing several amateur scene tournaments and doing our best to improve and give a professional experience to a wide variety of players. 

**tl;dr**

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted LoL league, we’re hosting 3 month leagues for Bronze &amp; Silver, Gold &amp; Platinum, Diamond &amp; Up that are open to all. We're operating in NA and EUW, more info below. **We’ve recently reset the ELOs of all teams on our site in conjunction with the new season, so all joining teams will have a chance to qualify for our Premier Leagues** Any teams that don’t qualify still get filtered into our Open Leagues, which are also run weekly and can be joined at any time! Check out our [Website](https://lol.competeleague.com/) and our subreddit [r/CompeteLeague](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/). 

Our Leagues qualifiers are *starting on the 23rd of January* (two weeks away!) so if you'd like to play with your team that can be the case as early as the Monday after next!

**About CompeteLeague** 

CompeteLeague launched 3 years ago as a small venture for League of Legends competition with the goal of bringing a competitive scene to gamers of every level. Starting small in size back then with only 1 league featuring 8 teams, we have grown and developed our community and website as a passion project since then to the point where we over the past year we’ve had our most successful seasons ever, running 22 leagues over the course of 2016 that all culminated with our 3 day finals events, one of which we [broadcasted from a professional studio in Denver](https://youtu.be/VKC6a9YXqBc?t=1646). We're extremely pleased with the progress we've made growing our community and competitions, and now we’re looking to build on what we have and bring you more features! 

**What We Need**

We need you! As a player, as a viewer, as an eSport enthusiast, as a volunteer, we're back and looking to grow our community coming into our 3rd season. Our site is ready for signups and teams registering for competition, and our qualifiers will be in the next few weeks to set up our CompeteLeague 2017 Spring Split leagues. Our stream will be beginning with it and we'll want anyone interested to come watch and cheer for our teams. We're also always looking for interested community members who would like to get involved in an eSports setting, we have several roles that we train people in and help them get experience (casters, organisers, writers etc.), and plenty to offer for our volunteers (more information below). We've recently put in the time to overhaul the visuals of our website – however we're not a big organisation and haven't had the manpower or time to do comprehensive testing. As such please report any bugs that you find on our site on our [bug reports page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report).

**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for LoL will be as follows:

Bronze &amp; Silver | Gold &amp; Platinum | Diamond &amp; Up
-------------|----------------|----------
Mondays | Tuesdays | Wednesdays
5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST
6-11 PM GMT | 6-11 PM GMT | 6-11 PM GMT

**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for eight weeks, and will be streamed and casted on our [twitch channel](http://twitch.tv/CompeteLeague). Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | B | R | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 | Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 | No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6|  No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 | No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 | No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 | Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 | No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8 | Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| No (1)

Our Open Leagues also run for 7 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in 0 points. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners &amp; next seasons teams over the space of 5 weeks. If you want more information on our leagues/format, we have an excellent set of (clickable!) infographics on our [information page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/information) on our site. Just hit the ‘Format Information’ tab and it’s right there for you. 

**Pricing**

Totally free &amp; always will be: we've no interest in charging you money to play. Our primary revenue stream is going to be sponsorship, if you're curious about that there's more information about it on our site. For particularly generous benefactors we do have a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) from which the money we make is turned directly back into prizing (and occasionally giveaways).

**Smurfing policy**

We have years of experience with similarly formatted leagues and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion. If you want the full details on what we do to deal with smurfing it's available on our site's [FAQ Page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq).

**Prizes**

We don't announce the prizing in our tournaments at the beginning of our seasons - but we do prize all our leagues! The prizing for our seasons in 2016 was $20 RP for the winning team, $10 RP for second place, &amp; a mystery skin for third (insert appropriate EU currencies for EUW) - these are lower than we'd like as Riot doesn't provide prizing for online tournaments any more and we have to fund it ourselves, but we'll be equalling or bettering the prizing for this season. We don't charge players to play but as mentioned previously if members want to contribute to that the money we receive on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) goes entirely towards it.

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be looking to do audience giveaways intermittently, whether they be for skins/steam games/RP/anything else. We stream over on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/competeleague) which is our main hub, but for those who would like quality settings due to low bandwidth internet we also simultaneously stream to our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/CompeteLeague).

**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run our seasons. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be for heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being [Dominic ‘Dom’ Roemer](https://twitter.com/DomRoemer) who now casts for Riot) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). Just recently as well we’ve seen one of our casters [Jay ‘Arktiq112’ Taylor](https://twitter.com/arktiq112) land a job with Fnatic! We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. The different positions we have for volunteers are:

-- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

-- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails usually casting 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so bear in mind we may spend some time giving you practice &amp; training prior to putting you live to cast in our leagues - we aim to have any recruits that don’t have experience cast some of our Open League games to build up practice.  

-- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

-- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred.

-- Video Editor

A position producing video content for our social medias and our site. This is a creative position, and can range from highlight montages, to informational videos, to promotional videos, to any other content. Video editing software required, past experience/somewhat of a video portfolio preferred.

-- Web Developer

A position helping expand and develop features for our website. We have a small dedicated team of developers working on our site, this position would entail becoming part of that group and helping share out the workload. Some experience/developing education preferred. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, or PHP required. Knowledge of AngularJS, Angular 2 and/or NodeJS will stand you in very good stead. 

-- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase. 

-- Writer/Content provider

We're expanding and providing better structure &amp; consistency in our content crew in the coming season. Whether you want to create content surrounding our leagues, the amateur scene, the eSports scene as a whole, or other related topics we're happy to help you with a community to publish to &amp; feedback for your work.

-- How do I apply?

Our application form on our website has been temporarily hidden, so in the meantime the correct way to apply for a position is to answer the questions in this google document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOLbwkt_T0uvIzGegPyBnto3Pa1HZ9ikbIV74cY-VYc/edit?usp=sharing And email the answers to admins@competeleague.com

**What Makes us Different?**

*Experience.* We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always reach out to orgs, offer to help with advice, cross promotions, and share casters, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We were one of the very first amateur leagues on the scene and having watched a lot of tournament organizers (HP5v5, Vespyr, iEsports) struggle with their LoL operations in recent months I believe we're one of the last - and we're not going anywhere! We look to run/perform everything we do as professionally as possible and if that sounds like something you can get behind then we hope to see you join our community!

**FAQ**

Well first of all there's a FAQ available on our [site](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq) which you can check out, but here's some common ones.

*What is the difference between the Open Leagues and the Premier Leagues?*

Well, our Premier Leagues are the more exclusive league of the two. Games from this league will be streamed and casted, and teams are set from the first week (barring removal from the league). In the Open League, any number of teams can join at any point in the system and be playing within a week, and the top teams will have a chance to move up to Premier the following season, depending on their rank and status in the league. If a Premier League team is removed for any reason, the top Open League team will be promoted and participate in the Premier League. The Open League is a slightly lesser experience, but one of the most requested features by viewers of our past leagues, where we only had premier leagues and teams that found us at the wrong times couldn’t sign up or play.

*What if my team needs to reschedule?*

The website has requesting reschedules as a feature when you’re a team in our leagues. You will be able to request a reschedule via your account page, however, the request must be 48 hours before the match is scheduled AND the other team must accept the reschedule request. While we know emergencies happen, your team is responsible for showing up to the games on time. To help with unexpected situations/problems we advise including substitutes on your team’s roster. When a request is scheduled the teams involved must organise an appropriate time to play, relay information to staff, and play the match within the coming week.

*What if I don’t have a team and I want to play?*

There’s a feature for free agents on the site. When you sign up solo you’re placed on a public free agents list, where teams and other players will be able to see you and add you on LoL from the site and send invites to their team. Players looking for teams currently get bumped to the top by hitting a 'Actively looking for team' button on their account pages, so you can know what players have been looking for a squad in the past week! All users have a profile page where they can list their preferred means of contact (email/skype/summoner name etc.) We also have a thread over at r/competeleague for players looking to find teams! 

*What happens if I rank up during the season?*

We have always celebrated improvement and will continue to do so. You may continue to compete in the league you are in with the team you are on, however, if you’re dropped from the active roster you CANNOT rejoin that specific league. You are encouraged and welcome to join the league that is fitting of your new ELO.


*Can I play on more than one team?*

For one game? No. There are no exceptions to this rule, however if you would like you can participate in different teams for multiple games with CompeteLeague, such as if you wanted to participate in both a LoL tournament, and a Sm4sh tournament (currently operating in Northern California) then you can! We’ll be looking to expand to more games in 2017 beyond just LoL and Sm4sh so be on the look out!

- *My rune page check failed, help?*

Few things to double check - first make sure that you actually save the rune page name, and that when you copy the number over you don't have a space in the name you save. If that doesn't work, try logging out going to the homepage and hitting Shift + F5, then logging in and registering again. If you continue to have issues our support email is admins@competeleague.com, we'll get you sorted out!

- *I have a different bug (error message/position list is wrong/other)* 

any further issues please repeat the problem on the website once more and then go to [https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report) - when you submit your report we get automatic information on the last few processes you’ve run and it helps us diagnose and fix any issues.

*I have a not frequently asked question.*

Ask away, I and any other members of our staff around will be hopping around the comment section to answer anything that we can. That being said, we have a few extra unannounced changes, and we might not be decided on something. We’ll let you know if we’re still undecided about a question you have. Make sure to look in the comments below, as they may have answers to your questions."

We've recently put in the time to overhaul the visuals of our website – however we're not a big organisation and haven't had the manpower or time to do comprehensive testing. As such please report any bugs that you find on our site on our [bug reports page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report).

**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for LoL will be as follows:

Bronze &amp; Silver | Gold &amp; Platinum | Diamond &amp; Up
-------------|----------------|----------
Mondays | Tuesdays | Wednesdays
5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST | 5-10 PM PST
6-11 PM GMT | 6-11 PM GMT | 6-11 PM GMT

**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for eight weeks, and will be streamed and casted on our [twitch channel](http://twitch.tv/CompeteLeague). Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | B | R | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 | Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 | No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6|  No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 | No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 | No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 | Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 | No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8 | Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| No (1)

Our Open Leagues also run for 7 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in 0 points. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners &amp; next seasons teams over the space of 5 weeks. If you want more information on our leagues/format, we have an excellent set of (clickable!) infographics on our [information page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/information) on our site. Just hit the ‘Format Information’ tab and it’s right there for you. 

**Pricing**

Totally free &amp; always will be: we've no interest in charging you money to play. Our primary revenue stream is going to be sponsorship, if you're curious about that there's more information about it on our site. For particularly generous benefactors we do have a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) from which the money we make is turned directly back into prizing (and occasionally giveaways).

**Smurfing policy**

We have years of experience with similarly formatted leagues and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion. If you want the full details on what we do to deal with smurfing it's available on our site's [FAQ Page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/information).

**Prizes**

We don't announce the prizing in our tournaments at the beginning of our seasons - but we do prize all our leagues! The prizing for our seasons in 2016 was $20 RP for the winning team, $10 RP for second place, &amp; a mystery skin for third (insert appropriate EU currencies for EUW) - these are lower than we'd like as Riot doesn't provide prizing for online tournaments any more and we have to fund it ourselves, but we'll be equalling or bettering the prizing for this season. We don't charge players to play but as mentioned previously if members want to contribute to that the money we receive on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CompeteLeague) goes entirely towards it.

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be looking to do audience giveaways intermittently, whether they be for skins/steam games/RP/anything else. We stream over on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/competeleague) which is our main hub, but for those who would like quality settings due to low bandwidth internet we also simultaneously stream to our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/CompeteLeague).

**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run our seasons. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be for heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being [Dominic ‘Dom’ Roemer](https://twitter.com/DomRoemer) who now casts for Riot) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). Just recently as well we’ve seen one of our casters [Jay ‘Arktiq112’ Taylor](https://twitter.com/arktiq112) land a job with Fnatic! We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. The different positions we have for volunteers are:

-- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

-- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails usually casting 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so bear in mind we may spend some time giving you practice &amp; training prior to putting you live to cast in our leagues - we aim to have any recruits that don’t have experience cast some of our Open League games to build up practice.  

-- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

-- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred.

-- Video Editor

A position producing video content for our social medias and our site. This is a creative position, and can range from highlight montages, to informational videos, to promotional videos, to any other content. Video editing software required, past experience/somewhat of a video portfolio preferred.

-- Web Developer

A position helping expand and develop features for our website. We have a small dedicated team of developers working on our site, this position would entail becoming part of that group and helping share out the workload. Some experience/developing education preferred. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, or PHP required. Knowledge of AngularJS, Angular 2 and/or NodeJS will stand you in very good stead. 

-- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase. 

-- Writer/Content provider

We're expanding and providing better structure &amp; consistency in our content crew in the coming season. Whether you want to create content surrounding our leagues, the amateur scene, the eSports scene as a whole, or other related topics we're happy to help you with a community to publish to &amp; feedback for your work.

-- How do I apply?

Our application form on our website has been temporarily hidden, so in the meantime the correct way to apply for a position is to answer the questions in this google document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOLbwkt_T0uvIzGegPyBnto3Pa1HZ9ikbIV74cY-VYc/edit?usp=sharing And email the answers to admins@competeleague.com

**What Makes us Different?**

*Experience.* We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always reach out to orgs, offer to help with advice, cross promotions, and share casters, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We were one of the very first amateur leagues on the scene and having watched a lot of tournament organizers (HP5v5, Vespyr, iEsports) struggle with their LoL operations in recent months I believe we're one of the last - and we're not going anywhere! We look to run/perform everything we do as professionally as possible and if that sounds like something you can get behind then we hope to see you join our community!

**FAQ**

Well first of all there's a FAQ available on our [site](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq) which you can check out, but here's some common ones.

*What is the difference between the Open Leagues and the Premier Leagues?*

Well, our Premier Leagues are the more exclusive league of the two. Games from this league will be streamed and casted, and teams are set from the first week (barring removal from the league). In the Open League, any number of teams can join at any point in the system and be playing within a week, and the top teams will have a chance to move up to Premier the following season, depending on their rank and status in the league. If a Premier League team is removed for any reason, the top Open League team will be promoted and participate in the Premier League. The Open League is a slightly lesser experience, but one of the most requested features by viewers of our past leagues, where we only had premier leagues and teams that found us at the wrong times couldn’t sign up or play.

*What if my team needs to reschedule?*

The website has requesting reschedules as a feature when you’re a team in our leagues. You will be able to request a reschedule via your account page, however, the request must be 48 hours before the match is scheduled AND the other team must accept the reschedule request. While we know emergencies happen, your team is responsible for showing up to the games on time. To help with unexpected situations/problems we advise including substitutes on your team’s roster. When a request is scheduled the teams involved must organise an appropriate time to play, relay information to staff, and play the match within the coming week.

*What if I don’t have a team and I want to play?*

There’s a feature for free agents on the site. When you sign up solo you’re placed on a public free agents list, where teams and other players will be able to see you and add you on LoL from the site and send invites to their team. Players looking for teams currently get bumped to the top by hitting a 'Actively looking for team' button on their account pages, so you can know what players have been looking for a squad in the past week! All users have a profile page where they can list their preferred means of contact (email/skype/summoner name etc.) We also have a thread over at r/competeleague for players looking to find teams! 

*What happens if I rank up during the season?*

We have always celebrated improvement and will continue to do so. You may continue to compete in the league you are in with the team you are on, however, if you’re dropped from the active roster you CANNOT rejoin that specific league. You are encouraged and welcome to join the league that is fitting of your new ELO.


*Can I play on more than one team?*

For one game? No. There are no exceptions to this rule, however if you would like you can participate in different teams for multiple games with CompeteLeague, such as if you wanted to participate in both a LoL tournament, and a Sm4sh tournament (currently operating in Northern California) then you can! We’ll be looking to expand to more games in 2017 beyond just LoL and Sm4sh so be on the look out!

*My rune page check failed, help?*

Few things to double check - first make sure that you actually save the rune page name, and that when you copy the number over you don't have a space in the name you save. If that doesn't work, try logging out going to the homepage and hitting Shift + F5, then logging in and registering again. If you continue to have issues our support email is admins@competeleague.com, we'll get you sorted out!

*I have a different bug (error message/position list is wrong/other)* 

any further issues please repeat the problem on the website once more and then go to [https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/bug-report) - when you submit your report we get automatic information on the last few processes you’ve run and it helps us diagnose and fix any issues. From there we'll get back to you ASAP! 

*I have a not frequently asked question.*

Ask away, I and any other members of our staff around will be hopping around the comment section to answer anything that we can. That being said, we have a few extra unannounced changes, and we might not be decided on something. We’ll let you know if we’re still undecided about a question you have. Make sure to look in the comments below, as they may have answers to your questions.

**Edit:** A few people are reporting issues at the final stages of free agent registration. I'll refer you to the above:

We live together and she has depression and gets anxiety attacks so she doesnt exactly handle stress well.

Her car is a POS and has been in and out of the shop for the last 3 weeks. It's at the point where there's really no point in putting more money in it, but we can't afford to just buy a new car right now. And with perfect timing of the car issues, she started an internship that she now has to worry about how she'll get there. 

For xmas i gave her my Macbook pro. Well last night she accidentally spilled a glass of water all over it.....
And while we're taking the steps to dry it out and all that, it's not looking good.

We're not dying, we're not suicidal, we're just both feeling like life hates us right now and nothing can go right. Make us feel better please :("
5n0p3l,5,2017-01-09,Looking for some advice and opinions regarding Android dev in New York,nyc_android,androiddev,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5n0p3l/looking_for_some_advice_and_opinions_regarding/,"I'm looking to get into Android development professionally. I'm trying to get a better idea of what I should be expecting, and I have some pretty specific goals. I wanted to post here to get advice, opinions, and just to get an idea if what I want to do is realistic. This post will probably get pretty long.

I'm a 26 year old who graduated with a Computer Science &amp; Engineering degree (but with a sub-par GPA) from a well respected state school (Uconn). After graduating I got a job in the insurance industry doing database work, mostly SQL dev with some .Net thrown in occasionally. I've been doing this for 3 years now, not counting my 2 summer internships. The work is fairly uninteresting, the company is huge and super conservative so there's not much innovation, especially on the tech side of things, and 95% of my coworkers at over 40. It's not great, but not terrible either. I don't need to be on the bleeding edge, working in some super fast-pace corner of the tech world. In fact, I don't really want that.

I've always wanted to work on Android, and I've always wanted to live in New York City. I want to work with other smart, young people, doing interesting stuff. But I don't want to work 80 hours a week in a cut-throat, fast pace, high-stress environment. Currently I'm living in Hartford on a lease that ends in September, so that's most likely when I'll be looking to make the move. I've dabbled in Android development before, I took a Coursera course a while back on Android dev, and I'm currently finishing up Udacity's ""Developing Android Apps"" course. After that I plan on working on my own little side projects to build up some sort of portfolio. Hopefully I can get something into the app store by around summer time. Even if it's something super simple that's been done a hundred times before. So I'm working on this stuff on the side and trying to become more consistent at doing so. I've always kept up with the industry, and Android dev scenes so I kinda know what's up. I just need to put that into practice. Though it can be tough with a full-time job. I want to be able to put all my effort into Android, but that really isn't an option for me to do that unless it is my day job.

Anyways, what I really want to ask is this... Is is realistic for me to expect to find a job as a beginner Android dev that meets the following criteria:

* Make a comfortable living by NYC standards ($80k-ish)
* Be able to learn and be mentored on the job
* Work at a larger company as part of a large-ish team (I'm someone who appreciates a fair amount of job security and not being the sole person responsible for something)
* Is a full-time position, not on a contract basis

Thank you for you input."

He is mentally ill, but I don't know what is him and what is the illness.",netflixandnotchill,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5n1oc1/i_23_f_caught_my_boyfriend_24_m_of_2years_lying/,"I'll try to keep this short. The first 6 months of our relationship were amazing. I'd never been so happy in a relationship. That was probably the happiest I've ever been really. We were both in college, but we were able to see each other every couple days and even go on short trips every few months. 

The following semester was rocky for him. He ended up dropping out shortly after due to money issues. Both of us are middle-class with siblings who are also in college. I applied for scholarships and financial aid, moved into a terrible (but cheap!) apartment, and got 2 part-time jobs to make it through college. He got a part-time freelance writing job. Though he's good at it, it isn't enough to pay for rent. I eventually left one of my jobs and was able to give the position to him. But he still had money problems and didn't return to school. 

I helped him cover rent a few times (putting my own finances in trouble), got him an interview at one of my internships, and helped him make a resume and cover letter. He took on some holiday work for 2 weeks but quit because transportation was an issue.

As far as stuff between us, it's been very hot and cold. There were several times in the last year where he would ignore me for a week at a time without reason. I know I'm not perfect, but this would happen without there even being an argument or anything. After a week had passed, he'd text me a meme or something and act like nothing had happened.

Throughout this, I recognized that he was struggling with depression (I've been depressed since middle school). I hadn't talked to him about his depression since he doesn't really open up about feelings. One night when he was staying over, I briefly mentioned that I had been feeling down about some personal issues and was considering going on antidepressants, he got angry with me and told me he would break up with me if I went on them. He stormed out that night. That was this summer. 

Fast-forward to New Year's Eve, where he ignored me at a party where all of our friends were (we went to the party together) and where a handful of my friends came up to me to ask me why he was hanging around ex-girlfriends. I had walked by him to charge my phone and he told me ""back off,"" then ""don't follow me"" as I was leaving the party. He was walking with an ex, but wouldn't be seen with me. 

The friends who left with me saw what had happened. I didn't even have to say anything to them, so I know my thoughts on this didn't color their opinions or what they were seeing. He texts me at 3 in the morning saying ""please be safe.""

A few days go by and he starts texting me about NYE, saying that if he's seen with me, girls who used to know him before he dated me and ""who don't know"" me won't talk to him because said girls ""hate"" me. 

I know the girls he was talking to were exes, and I know that it would be wrong to pretend I'm not around to talk to girls who wouldn't otherwise talk to him. It might not sound like it in this post, but I'm not the jealous type. I'm friends with a couple of of my own exes, and am open about this. But there's something messed up about what happened that night. 

He came over to talk with me last week about it in person. He had texted me and told me he's been feeling miserable in general about his life and that I'm a big part of that because I'm a big part of his life. He was going to break up with me, or at least talk about it at my house. 

He came over, didn't say much, then started to have a panic-attack. He ran to a busy road near my house and said he didn't want to live anymore. He almost walked into traffic because he was miserable and because he needed $100 for rent and didn't have it. I've had suicidal friends before, so I was able to talk him down and into walking with me back to my house. I gave him a Benadryl and some food and told him to lie down. He's been at my house since. That was 4 days ago. I took care of the $100 rent because his roommates are my friends (we were friends before we started dating) and I don't want them to be in a tough spot. It's understood that I'll be paid back in 2 days before my own bills are due. 

Anyway, about the lying. This is going to sound so small, but the fact that he lied to me is messing me up more than the rest. He hid our relationship status on Facebook and lied about it. I got a bunch of texts and people coming up to me in public telling me they're glad we broke up. This was news to me, then they said that the relationship part of our Facebooks wasn't there, and they pointed out that we haven't been in a picture together for over a year (he doesn't want to be seen in pictures with me, and has deleted pictures of me in the past). 

Today we're supposed to contact local mental health clinics -- at my insistence -- to see what his options may be. He doesn't have health insurance, so it's been difficult. He said he wants to try antidepressants.

TL;DR:
This is what I'm struggling with: I've been putting more into this relationship than he has. I know he's sick now. He lied to me today while watching Netflix at my house and sitting next to me. I know he lied because he left his Facebook open on my computer and I saw the relationship part was hidden -- I swear I thought it was logged into mine and that I was checking mine. I logged out immediately. Obviously someone who is dealing with depression this severe doesn't need someone to come at them about Facebook. But I'm still hurt about being ignored on NYE, and I'm upset that he just lied to me. This stuff can't be discussed imo until he gets mental help. I'm upset that he walked out on me when I considered taking antidepressants, but that he can mention it for himself as if it's not a big deal (and it's not a big deal, but you get what I mean). 

I don't know if I can trust him. At the very least, he needs help. And as someone I've cared about for almost 3 years, he does mean a lot to me. But I don't know how much of this is him being awful, him being extremely depressed, or if there's a way or reason to separate the two. It's wearing me out emotionally and I've actually started therapy for myself because of what happened NYE.

Thank you for reading all this. It feels good to just have it out somewhere.

EDIT: I didn't tell him I could pay the $100. I told him I couldn't, and that killing himself wouldn't pay for rent.

5n29ck,2,2017-01-09,Weird Break Up Between Me (25M) and Ex/Friend (19F),ionictime,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5n29ck/weird_break_up_between_me_25m_and_exfriend_19f/,"Met this girl on trip during college. Started dating for a few months, then we broke up as I moved 2,000 miles away for an internship. We shared a lot of deep issues in common and were close, so kept up a friendship, speaking several times each week for the 4 months I was gone. During those 4 months, we met once out of state for the weekend, had fun and hooked up too.

I recently returned to where our college is for graduation, the holidays, and live until I find a legit job. We hung out until she went out of town for Christmas. Had a talk about defining our relationship before she left town. I wanted to date and she wasn't sure (which I took as not wanting to).

She recently returned, acted hot/cold, and flaked on hanging a few times, saying we were supposed to be mad at each other. I thought she was playing games, so sent a text saying to ""let me know when you're ready to act like an adult.""

24 hours later she texted saying we should end our friendship. I called - no answer. I sent a text explaining why I was upset, that my comment to her was out of line, and that people get upset in relationships but resolve the issue by talking it out. A couple days later she sent another text saying she's ending our friendship. I responded by saying ""Ok. Wish you the best.""

We've been friends for 7 months, speaking every few days and this is our 1st fight so I'm a little surprised. Especially since we never even had a conversation trying to work it out.

I'm guessing we just weren't as close as I thought, but any advice or thoughts from you all?"

We've had our ups and downs and always manage to get through them and come out stronger. However there's one thing that has been bothering me for a while. I feel like we're not on the same wavelength at all when it comes to our work ethic and drive.


When we met he told me he was in between things jobwise. He works in media so I know jobs can be hard to come by in this sector and I didn't see it as a big deal back then. However, that was 2 years ago and since then he has only had one job lasting around 6 months... with a few freelance positions thrown in here and there - I should mention that the freelance gigs are usually gotten/created for him by friends and family members (e.g. he does the odd job for his mom's company, jobs which she creates for him since she hates seeing him struggle). He never looks for a job. He won't even spend an evening updating his CV - the CV which I made for him. His mom is constantly sending him job listings, he says ""Yeah I'll apply for that tomorrow"" but then he never even reads the post, and certainly hasn't applied to any. 


At the moment money isn't a huge problem for us relationship wise. I have my own decent income and he has savings and is on benefit while he's ""job searching"". So this isn't a post about him mooching off me or anything. The problem is that I worry about our future. Also I'm starting to become a little bit resentful of the fact that I go to work every day and work crazy hard for 10 hours (I'm in gradschool which is also my income) working towards my future so I can be comfortable when I'm older and have a family of my own, and he sits at home playing computer games.


I worked really hard for my career. I busted my ass for the past 8 years to get where I am and I'm finally in a position to move into the career I always dreamed of - which happens to pay really really good money. I guess I just wish that he had the same career enthusiasm I had.


We've talked about settling down together, and we talk about some day getting married and day dream about having children and a nice house etc. But I worry about our future. I came from a family where my parents struggled to give us a happy comfortable life, they almost killed themselves working for their kids, and I hated seeing that. I want to be able to some day give my kids a good life too, along with all the things my parents wanted for us, but couldn't give. This is why I'm working hard now. But what happens, for example, when I'm pregnant and can't work? Or if I get sick? My boyfriend needs to be working on his career now. And I feel like it's a bad sign that he isn't.


I've tried to talk to him about how he needs to be working on filling his CV now, even if it's just in small steps. He can't expect to walk into his cool dream job if he doesn't start doing the ground work now. He seems to expect that one day he will find the job he wants but until then he refuses to settle for less and would prefer to do nothing instead. This is unrealistic and I've tried to explain that to him but anytime the subject is brought up he puts up a wall and doesn't listen and/or gets angry, and just sits there on his phoone ignoring me while I talk to him. Funnily enough he keeps telling me to ""stop getting mad"" even though I don't raise my voice at all - he obviously feels threatened when I bring it up.


The other day I lost my cool and flipped out at him about this: We were talking about going on a holiday next year, he said he doesn't think we can because he won't have the money unless he finds a job, which is something I am sick and tired of hearing. I told him I'm sick of hearing that, that he is not going to ever have a job if he refuses to even look for one, let alone apply for anything that he finds. He has been out of work for the last 8 months and has not even looked since. I asked him why and he said he needed a break after the last job. I reminded him that he has been saying he needs to get a job since October and he has not looked. And then I hinted at an ultimatum. I told him that I can't see a future with someone who won't work and that if he doesn't start looking this week, and find something (anything!) in one month we will be having this same discussion but with different consequences (I never actually used the words breakup). I told him that one day his parents aren't going to be there for him to fall back on, and his savings will be gone (They are almost gone anyway) and he will have nothing. I said this to him and he got really defensive and mad at me and said that if it comes to that ""I'll get a fucking job in McDonalds"".  


So right now I'm waiting and hoping he will find something.

 And this is the part where I worry the most: I worked too hard at my career to be with someone who is happy to sit and do nothing with their lives. I want him to be more career driven because I love him and I don't want to leave him. I already confided in a friend about all this, to which she was shocked as from the outside our relationship looks amazing, and it is except for this one glitch. She told me she thinks I should leave him, even though she knows how great he is in every other way. But I really don't want to. 


I'm looking for tips on encouraging him to start getting excited about working. I know I shouldn't have flipped out at him but I was at the end of my tether. I would even be happy if he went back to school, or did an internship - as long as it's working towards something. Heck I would even work on a project together if that could get him motivated. It's not about the money at the end of the day because I know I can earn a good living and I sure as hell don't want to live off the man I marry, but I also don't want to be the sole bread winner. And I want to be proud of my man for going after his dreams.


So reddit, have any of you managed to get your SO to get moving in their lives? Or is it a lost hope?

5n2j4a,7,2017-01-09,Graduating with ~90k in loans. Potential 45k starting salary at entry level. Student loan help,derekstark,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5n2j4a/graduating_with_90k_in_loans_potential_45k/,"So I am graduating in May 2017 with a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Science. Right now I am currently working as a server at a local Red Lobster and as an intern with the State government with a job in my field. I am 24 years old and My monthly income is ~1800 working part time with monthly expenses of about ~900 max for groceries, car insurance, rent, etc. I have pulled in 90,000 in student loans for the last 6 years. As I attended community college and then transferred to a State University, I had to retake classes as the ones I had received at the community college did not count towards their degree (isn't that funny that they just want your money?). I had no help from my parents even though they made 6 figures, so I was forced to take out a private bank loan to pay for my tuition. These loans are spread out into 3 categories. Federal Unsubsidized, Federal Subsidized, and a Private bank student loan. 40,000 in federal loans with interest rates from 3-4% I believe. These loans are spread out over about 10 different federal loans (5 subsidized and 5 unsubsidized). And the private loans are 3 separate loans divided up in equal amounts of ~16,300. 2 with fixed interest rates (3.4% and 5%) and 1 with a variable rate (6.1%). Right now the total  including principal and interest, is 90,000. Estimated monthly payments with be ~750. 450 for he private loan which is a 15 year repayment period. And 300 a month for the federal for a 30 year period. I can always change the repayment periods, but this is what it is set at so I can hope to survive. Anyways I am fairly certain after I graduate I will obtain a job with the state at an entry level position with a annual income of 40,000 minimum and a maximum of 45,000 with good benefits such as employer paid life insurance, low dental and medical insurance and good retirement options. The only thing I own is a 2012 Impala that was recently paid off last week and I have ~3000 in bank accounts. I have a decent credit score of 770 as well. My question is what should I do about these loans? Is my best option to consolidate loans and get 1 interest rate? Or do I have any other options? I would love to hear some advice. Thank you."
5n2nmh,4,2017-01-09,My [22M] girlfriends [22F] family has a lot of issues with me.,SendHelp12341821234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5n2nmh/my_22m_girlfriends_22f_family_has_a_lot_of_issues/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

Let me start this off with I'm a good person. I graduated college last Spring with a Computer Science Degree, started working the very next day. I make just under six figures, I'm a good person, and love her very much, and _was_ planning on proposing a few weeks ago.


Her family is what's stopping me. Not just her parents, but her entire extended family.


We've been together for 4 years so I am well acquainted with her family. They all loved me until about a year ago. At this time I was working an internship that made enough money to live on and had the job I have now lined up. I was making enough money to support myself and her and decided to buy a nice house halfway between the school and where I would be working (About 15 minutes to the school, about 25 to my job). I asked her to move in with me, she said yes, everything was hunky dory. Her parents were OK with it and were happy we were taking the next step in our relationship, but then at a extended family reunion I was invited to come along with a few weeks later, everything went bad. Apparently her uber-conservative extended family (her family is sorta conservative, but pretty chill) caught wind that she moved in with me, and her family knew that we were having sex (safely) for a while, but her extended family didn't, which they didn't really need to.


Her Uncle comes up to me during the family event and sucker punches me right in the jaw. And screams at me for corrupting his innocent neice. Somehow he found out that she was moving in and she wasnt a virgin. If my girlfriend wasnt there to stop me I would have dropped this guy. At first her whole family was apalled at her Uncle until he announced to the whole family (~35 people) that I was forcing my girlfriend to have sex with me, and made her move into my ""shitty crack-house"". Note: The house would not in any way resemble a crack house. It's a little small, but rather nice. Again I was about to drop this guy. Her whole family suddenly turns against me, until her brother (who is the ONLY person who doesnt hate my guts right now) steps up and tells her uncle to simmer down and that's not what's going on. They all give me stink eye for the rest of the event, but I figured everything would be OK.


I was wrong



Her Uncle has been spreading around nasty rumors about me, even faked a text message conversation from my girlfriend having her saying that she was unhappy, and she needed to get out. I have no idea why he is doing this, but he has done a wonderful job of turning everyone except her brother against me. I dealt with it she was pretty pissed. Then he started taking potshots at me, spreading around that I cheated my way through college and faked going to work everyday, and I wasn't actually working in Computers at all, he said because of this I couldn't provide for her and the family should make us break up. Up until this her parents were still fine with me. At thhis time she hadn't found a job in her field, and was working at a local cafe to keep busy, I told her she didn't have to since I make more than enough to keep up above water in a relatively cheap area to live. Apparently these statements made her Dad do some digging, and he couldn't find me working at any notable company around the area. That was expected, I work in cyber security, and under a lot of legal shit so my name isn't out there. He calls bullshit and that turns him and her mother against me.  


This has been going on for almost a year now. Her parents refuse to acknowledge my existence and want to ask her father if I can marry her, but her whole family hates me and for only what I can assume is that we had sex while in college, and she lives with me. Her Uncle has convinced her whole family that I'm basically taking her hostage in my ""crack-house"". Her brother is the only one that likes me (we're actually pretty close) much less doesnt want me to die.


What are my options. Breaking up with her isn't one, she's the love of my life, but her family is very important to her as well.



**tl:dr** Girlfriend (whom I want to marry)'s family hates my guts. How to deal."
5n2uca,1,2017-01-09,"Need to know what to check , poor student [Altima 98]",chuckdeezoo,whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/5n2uca/need_to_know_what_to_check_poor_student_altima_98/,"Hey guys!

As title says, I'm a poor student who needs a car for his new internship. Im used to drive all kind of wrecks, but didn't own a cat in a year now. I would usually call my mechanic to check the car, but he's on vacation. 

So here's the deal, this guy I found on craiglist is selling an old 98 nissan Altima for 400$ CAD with 168000kilos in it (105000 miles or so).
Keep in mind the car only needs to get me to work for 4 months, then it's going to the scrap yard where they'll give me its cash worth in rusted metal.
So really, I don't care if the ac/cd player/electrical doesnt work, idc if it the body is rusted (as long as ""safe""),  all I need is a ""reliable"" ride for the next 4 months. 

So what I wanna check is any indicator that the trans/engine/any other vital component might go bad in the next 4 months of daily commute.

I'm gonna go check it tomorrow night, drive it for half an hour or so on and off highway, but its really the first time I buy a car that I really don' need for long, so help me out reddit, tell me what to look for! :)"
5n31si,177,2017-01-09,Come meet your new mods!,GuyBelowMeDoesntLift,EnoughTrumpSpam,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/5n31si/come_meet_your_new_mods/,"Hey! 

So, if you recall, a week ago we posted mod applications. We got a tremendous amount of interest, and I spent an embarrassing amount of time poring through your applications. I read every single one, and if we modded every person that we liked we would have had about 80 new mods. Unlike certain subreddits, though, we try to retain an element of stability among our modteam ;\^). But I do want to give a very special shoutout to everyone who took their time to apply. I had some incredible conversations with you people about everyone from Amy Klobuchar to Aaron Rodgers to Young Thug, and we really do appreciate that hundreds of you took the time out of your days to try to do all you could to fight the incipient cheetocracy.

After a painstaking process, we singled out six users whose applications and the conversations that ensued really went above and beyond what I had any reason to expect. Shit, I'm a lazy college student, and these people are all individually twenty times more qualified to do this shit than I am. One of the new mods is a literal fucking rocket scientist, and I'm pretty sure they're all more qualified to be president than Donald Trump. Without further ado, here are your newest ~~CTR employees~~ r/EnoughTrumpSpam moderators, along with a little they've written about themselves.

&gt;Actual real life rocket scientist designing our next space vehicle, somewhat obsessed with Star Wars, I'm on Reddit so of course I love cats. Hobbies include travel and video games...Overwatch consumes too much of my time right now.

/u/auandi

&gt;I'm a dual US/Canadian citizen, born in California but spent middle/high school in Canada and currently live in Vancouver, BC. This may sound sappy, but I've always wanted to do something the helped people. I realized early that nothing has close to the power to hurt or help like government. So I studied in Washington DC. I wanted to get into politics, get into campaigns, and so I took just about every class offered on the subject. I was preparing myself to be in campaigns, but in my various jobs and internships I worked, I only learned which areas I didn't want to do. But I graduated right at the height of '09 unemployment, and it made paid jobs all but dry up for anyone without experience. I had also been having problems with my mental state, further complicating my search for employment. Eventually my loans started coming due, and even splitting an affordable housing apartment in such an expensive city wasn't affordable any more. I had to move back in with my parents who are in Canada.

/u/shitakunaindakedo

&gt;Hi, this is /u/shitakunaindakedo, the newest agent for CTR hoping to make big shill bucks. Dedicated enemy of Mango Mussolini, here to help disseminate the dangers of Trump and those faithful to him, be it citizens or government officials alike, both in this country or abroad. Let's not let our country dwindle into the insanity and bigotry of Trumpism; I don't like swamps, I do like brakes, America was already great, and my energy isn't high or low but in a comfortable range. The bigger our voice, the smaller Trump's hands become, so let us work together whilst speaking loudly in working against a man who would sell the highest, most respected seat in America to a Russian, and who would put his business interests in front of the safety and livelihood of all his citizens. Writing this just got me 60 shill credits, which I'm probably going to use to buy some pinot grigio to help me get through the next four years.

So there you go, those are your newest mods. Thanks, as always, for being an excellent community, and it's a shame we could only fit six of you on this team."

Visual Studio manages to dumb itself down so much that it crosses the event horizon of intuitive design and becomes *less* user-friendly. Visual Studio is what a programmer would make if you asked them to write a parody of commercial-grade ""enterprise"" software. Visual Studio tries to be the Fisher Price of IDE's while also offering you an airplane cockpit's worth of buttons and menus and settings and somehow it manages to fail in all of its goals in such a spectacular way that you almost wonder if they were engineered to collectively resonate into one of the most spectacular and irredeemable failures of the 21st century.

Visual Studio's features and goals are such a twisty-turny N-dimensional maze of overlapping bloatware that I can just imagine a conference room dripping with Microsoft's eukaryotic managerial algae, focusing gas expulsions through their chitinous vocal tracts, attempting to dictate the design goals of Visual Studio to an unpaid intern frantically translating from their non-Euclidian linguistic framework into something that might be doable with a budget of two paperclips and four hundred damned souls who've long since relinquished the last of their sanity and individuality to The Unspeakable Ones in the upper floors; those tortured workers incessantly and mechanically wailing cries of despair directly from the most instinctual and reptilian parts of the shattered remnants of their minds, everything else long-since digested and incorporated into the logic gates of an impossible calculus of paradox and madness; this feat of incidental mercy preventing them from comprehending the true horror of their work.

They type and cry and wail and scream and their tormented computations feed The Ones Upstairs as they converge into one mind and one consciousness. All is Microsoft. All is Enterprise. And at the topmost level something ancient and repugnant stirs. Satya Nadella awakens from his encysted slumber and opens one of his seven mouths to sing the song that ends the Earth."
5n37wq,0,2017-01-10,Advice on Moving to Seattle (if I should),harvestingstars,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/5n37wq/advice_on_moving_to_seattle_if_i_should/,"This is my very first Reddit post so bear with me! I may be moving to Seattle soon late this year. I currently live in a really toxic house, and a lot of things have happened in this house that worsened my PTSD. So the best choice was for me to move. My boyfriend who now is in Vancouver, wants to me to move to Seattle since he's eventually going to move there; he's in Vancouver right now for internships and will be moving to Seattle in the future. I'm just worried because of how costly Seattle is. I currently live in Arizona and it's very affordable compared to Seattle. He thinks that Seattle would be suitable for me (I miss the cities because I used to visit and stay in Saigon, VN a lot)

But I have yet to attend college and will want to attend college if I move after I become a permanent resident of course. 

I'll be saving up to 8-10k before moving if I do move (is that enough?). I'll be moving here by myself (going to look for roommates) for a while before he does move. 

Also is Seattle motorcycle/scooter friendly? I've seen threads saying that it's doable and that they haven't had any troubles riding a motorcycle. But I'd also want to know the perspective from car drivers. Or would you recommend just using public transport? 

And are there any areas of Seattle that is a mix of a urban and suburban feel? That is somewhat affordable? I've been trying to grasp all the neighborhoods in Seattle and would still like to know more info. I have read up on the master post/thread on moving to Seattle but I still was left with some questions.

Also, I want to become a teacher so is Seattle's job market for teachers saturated just like other places? I've been getting mixed answers on this too. Thank you.

I've been struggling with this since I've started at my current program.  I don't feel like I relate to my co-residents and don't necessarily feel like they have my back.  I haven't really clicked with any of the preceptors, only a few pharmacists that work PRN.  Overall, I don't feel like I have a mentor or someone I can turn to for professional advice and I'm worried that this is really limiting me career wise.

At my previous internships during pharmacy school I always thought I was a decent worker who could get along with everyone, and connected with most people.  Here, not so much and I've never struggled so much professionally before. Maybe I'm just not a good fit for the program I'm at?

5n3lwv,5,2017-01-10,I [22 M] have had a crush on my friend [23 F] for about 1.5 years and I'm not sure what to do about it now.,throwinout6,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5n3lwv/i_22_m_have_had_a_crush_on_my_friend_23_f_for/,"First off I'm a long time lurker and have never posted on reddit before so I'm sorry for any formatting errors or other problems. Also thank you in advance for any replies.

About 1.5 years ago my friend asked me if I could take this girl ""Miranda"" to her sorority formal because she had recently broken up with her boyfriend. My friend gave me about 1 day notice and only showed me one picture of her. I'm kind of shy and didn't want to go out on what was pretty much a blind date. I declined but when I met Miranda I was immediately kicking myself for not taking the chance.

As time went on our friend groups became quite close so she was around all the time. The more I hung out with her the more I liked her. One night while we were all hanging out at my house I decided it was finally time a make a move. We had been drinking a little bit so that definitely made it easier. We ended up making out for most of the night and she ended up staying over but nothing sexual happened. The next couple of days we talked constantly and decided to hang out just the two of us. The first time this ever happened. I went over to her house and stayed the night but once again just some making out and talking. After that she didn't seem as interested in me and two weeks later I found out that she rekindled things with her ex(different one from before). I knew that nothing else was going to happen but I would still see her almost every weekend because of our friend group which was a little awkward for me.

The next summer she moved across the country for an internship. This made it pretty easy to get over her because I didn't have to see her constantly. During that summer I began talking other girls but nothing panned out. At the end of the summer she moved back and she started hanging out with my friends and I a lot. At this point I started to gain feelings again. She would talk about how she tried to find a SO during the summer but it didn't work out. Seeing this as my best opportunity, I asked her out. Her response was something along the lines of ""I would but I'm trying to figure some things out and I don't want our friendship to change"". It seemed like she was just trying to be nice letting me down and shortly after she rekindled things with her ex again.

Fast forward to this New Years and she texted me to see what I'm doing. She is still my friend so I invited her to the party I was going to and we hung out most of the night. Then this weekend she texted me again to see what my plans are. Some friends and I were going to a concert so I invited her. Before the concert we were all drinking and getting ready. At some point it's just the two of us talking and she kissed me. This caught me completely off guard because of past experiences with her. While at the concert we danced with each other the entire time. Yesterday night she asked me if she could come over and watch a TV show because she doesn't have cable. Of course, I said yes. At first we were just sitting around on my couch just hanging out. Then she decides that she wants to cuddle up with me. Her show ends but she stays around for a couple more hours. At this point I want to make a move but at the same time I don't to keep making the same mistake. In the end I don't do anything and she left because we were both falling asleep.

I've been overthinking this all day and at this point I don't know what to do. Should I distance myself again? Should I just throw away my pride and take one more chance? Do I need to set some boundaries between us? There is definitely a better way to handle this but I feel like I can't make the right decision and need some help going forward.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I've had a crush on this girl in my friend group for a long time. She is always around so it is hard to get over her. I've asked her out and she turned me down. Lately she seems more into me but I don't want to make the same mistakes and I don't want our friendship/friend group to change. What the fuck should I do?"
5n3xce,1,2017-01-10,"A month ago I got the copper IUD inserted, I'm having weird discharge, some spotting, and my period might be late?",thehammerismypen15,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5n3xce/a_month_ago_i_got_the_copper_iud_inserted_im/,"Hi TwoX,

This might get gross because of the way I talk about bodily fluids, sorry in advance.

I'm 20, American, and just about to graduate college. A month ago I got the Paraguard inserted after being on the pill (Aubra) for about 5 months. The pill was working fine for me, but taking it was sometimes complicated, like if I spent the night at my boyfriend's unexpectedly or was back home with my parents (who don't/can't know I'm on BC due to religious reasons). Plus, given the political climate here, I wanted to get secure and long lasting birth control. I have a history, both personal and family, of manic depression and bipolar disorder, and when I've gone on progesterone-only BC in the past (Depo) those symptoms have gotten worse, so I decided that Paraguard was the best fit for me. It hurt like hell going in, and I bled for about a week after (it was time for my period + insertion trauma, I guess), but since then it's been great! Only mild cramping and spotting.

The thing is, it's been about 40 days since the start of my last period and I've had this weird, mucus discharge ever since I got the IUD inserted. When my boyfriend and I were having sex regularly I assumed it was semen leaking out (gross, I know - sorry about that), but we haven't seen each other for almost a month because of the holidays + work related travel on his part, and I still have the discharge. Sometimes it's clear and like egg white, sometimes it's kinda brown or pink like period blood, and sometimes it's green, like snot (sorry again). I've had cramps intermittently for the past week but no period, just this weird junk coming out of me.

My cycle usually ran long before I went on the pill (like 35 days). What actually prompted me to start the pill was that over the summer, I didn't get a period for 3 months. I took at home pregnancy tests when I was 1-2 months late and they all came back negative, and obviously once I started the pill things got back to normal after a few weeks. I was working a stressful internship, living in a new house with new roommates, and going through some relationship issues (my bf and I actually ended up breaking up right after I started the pill, and getting back together about 3 months later).

As far as sex without condoms goes, my boyfriend and I had it once about 48 hours before I went in to have the procedure (when I was still regularly taking the pill), and continued to have it regularly after my period ended post-insertion. Probably once every 2-3 nights for about 2 weeks until we both left to go be with our families for the holidays. I was pretty good about taking the pill - I think I accidentally skipped a day maybe twice, before he and I got back together (I wasn't having sex with anyone then), and it was the kind of thing where I forgot to take it before I went to sleep like I usually did and took it first thing when I woke up. More often I'd be a few hours off from when I took it the night before, depending on when I was going to bed that night, which I've read isn't a problem with mixed-hormone pills. Once I was sexually active again, we used condoms as well until the one time two days before I got the IUD. I know that the Paraguard can be used as emergency contraception that's even more reliable than Plan B if inserted within a few days of intercourse (one source even said up to 5 days), so even if my hormonal BC failed I figured we'd be protected due to the insertion. When I told the nurse at Planned Parenthood about the last time we'd had sex, she confirmed that we were being safe and not at an increased risk for pregnancy. And my blood test came back negative (even though at that point it'd be too soon to tell, I know).

So, tl;dr: I got the IUD inserted a month(ish) ago, my boyfriend and I never had unprotected sex, and despite this my period is kind of late and I have weird mucus-y discharge. I just (as in 20 min ago) checked my IUD strings and it's definitely still there. I know switching birth control methods and IUD insertions especially can jack up your cycle for a while, and I don't think I could be pregnant, but I'm also young, paranoid, and wildly unprepared in every sense to deal with a pregnancy. As soon as I get back to school I'm booking an appointment with Planned Parenthood to get things checked out (apparently you need to do this anyways when you're a month out from the insertion), but in the meantime I figured I'd ask here anyways and see if anyone had any advice or experience. Thanks y'all. &lt;3"

I will also be taking intermediate accounting 1 and tax 1 tomorrow.   I was hoping to get some advice on a few things.

1.  The last accounting class i took was a year and a half ago, i had to make up some credits when i transferred colleges and wanted my accounting classes near the end of my education.  I took intro to financial accounting and intro to managerial account.  I have spent some time going over financial accounting again but its alot of material, how much of this will i need to remember for tax and intermediate accounting?

2.  How much knowledge does a internship expect you too have?  

3.  By the time i graduate i will have around 150 credits, does that mean getting a Macc would be useless?

4.  Is the CPA exam just all the material i learn in my college accounting classes, or is it all new material?  Also when can i start studying for the CPA?

Sorry for all the questions, I wanted to get serious about my future and needed some guidance.  Thank you in advance!"

Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut/friends/online. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy.

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere and face fucking seeing what would happen to me. While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

About two weeks ago, my battery was empty and my laptop crashed. When restarting it my display didn`t work any more. I thought that my display / display cable broke (i had reordered a display a week before due to stripes on my lcd caused by dumb cleaning).

After the new display didnt work I noticed that one cable of the intern display connection broke:

so I ordered a new intern display connection :D

After installing it, it didnt work too and I observed, that I can connect and work via an external monitor problemless, but when trying to ""duplicate"" the laptop screen to the monitor it stays black, as the display does...

What do you recommend? :)

5n55hs,1,2017-01-10,I got humiliatingly dumped by my ex-friends because of my depression.,rmahran,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5n55hs/i_got_humiliatingly_dumped_by_my_exfriends/,"I'm trying to process this, because it's been 5 days ago, and I'm still in physical pain. My chest hurts and I cry all the time. I'm supposed to be working. 

When my friends and I first met, we were all in architecture school. I was in a fairly good place, if broke every now and again, and the status quo was; pay for my lunch now, I'll cover you later on. I taught myself to use anxiety to be funny and comical, and I made the laugh. Every time. I listened with an open mind whenever they'd confide in me. 

I noticed that they would always go to the same few places; the same coffee shops. We'd be so proud of being the 'outcasts from high school' who helps everyone, but we're the only ones who understand each other. Some of our friends who were genuinely smart and creative didn't hang out with us as often. 

But slowly, right around the time I started smoking and my senior project started, I could feel one of them (we'll call her Anus bc I'm angry) become more distant from me. As the stress got to me, I could feel it; they grew more distant. 

At the aftermath of my senior project, I hated it. I hated myself. I tried to explain it to my mom and she yelled at me, placing the regret I have for it to this day. 

This inner regret showed up in drinking with them...TOO much. I wanted to be the 'fun drunk' just to be the funny person I once was. I embarrassed myself and everyone around me for 'yelling a bit loud', and I never forgave myself for it. Even typing this now makes me want to die. 

I've tried to amend this, to ask them if they're okay to hang out with me; I even went drinking with them again in the future, and I did relatively okay. This is a common thing; I made mistakes, I fell sick during their senior showcase day (they're a year below mine), and every time I tried to make it up to them. I showed up to their graduation ceremony, I apoligized, I tried to reach out to them and explain that I wasn't myself lately. I don't think they ever forgave me.

So early 2016, I sort of tried to get the actual hang of it; I added to my portfolios, and I tried to get a job, and they know that I am, I even got sympathy from a friend (we'll call him Snorlax because fuck it, I'm mad). While they were working on their senior showcases, I felt the incredible pressure of finding a job. I wanted to be empowered enough to have a car, an apartment, a job and money to do for them what they did for me. 

Over this time, one of our friends (who actually helped me find a chance at a job, btw) went to the United States and came back in a rough position; all they did was make fun of his newly-found, frantic ideas: I genuinely empathized with him because he might have gone through something, but they were like, ""Nah bruh we're just letting off some steam lmao let it go"". Another person we knew who was socially maladjusted, meek, and maybe came across as creepy, was (verbally) given the business about how no one likes him and he needs to stop being weird. Like an idiot, I empathized with these people. I don't know how I didn't see it coming with the way they were acting. 

For the record, this was when Anus left. This would have been in August 2016. 

After my dad yelled at me for no reason, I shut him out, and ever since then, I've had the thought, ""I can no longer live like this. I'm not going to make it to my 25th birthday"". I've been running on the thought that I'll stay for my friends. I got my driver's license, I got excellent marks on a certificate I was studying for, and I got an internship. 

Throughout this, I confided in one friend (we'll call him Fuckass) that I was feeling suicidal, maybe twice. Fuckass confided in me that he was feeling just the same way, and I listened to him about his difficult past with his abusive father...and I listened. Openly. 

I've started giving myself a second chance: I recently took software courses in order to get an actual certificate. I even enrolled in a Short Course for a modelling software in a small institute in the part of our city called ""Knowledge Village"". One of the friends I was hanging out with was like, ""BAH, what does it matter? [institute name] is just like an office, they're a bunch of fakes!"" 

They were so content to blame everything in their lives on AUD, and keep insisting this city is terrible and the education they got was absolute ass. My dad held me back from going to Canada, so I was stuck here. **I** have to cope with this negativity you've been flinging around this echo chamber for 5 years. Excuse me for being pessimistic, though. 

Anyway...Anus finally came back from LA. They asked me to come for coffee...and then began one of the worst nights of my life. 

They mentioned nothing but my flaws and mistakes. They accused me of being negative. They called my presence ominous, and nothing I did was redeemable to them. They dressed it as this, ""we're here to give you a life lesson"" but they exposed every flaw, and failed to mention any reasonable explanation or ways I've genuinely tried to fight it off. 

This is after Anus hasn't even tried to talk to me or reach out in years, even while I was CLEARLY struggling. 

They pointed out how I don't reach out to them, but complain about how I spam the group chat like I'm 'talking to myself'. They pointed out that me failing to add someone in a group chat resulted in a fight, but failed to mention that they were a gay couple and, being a bunch of Middle Easterners in the Middle East, I needed to screen homophobes. All she had to do was say, ""[this friend] is not a homophobe. She's fine, let her in."" 

They shot so many contradictions and stupid excuses at me; the times they had to pay for my meals (failing to mention when I'd pay them back), my 'obsession' with YouTubers (even though they showed me a few), they'd take mistakes and ADHD symptoms and paint it like actual malice. 

The thing that killed me the most was the realization that, when they said that 'look we all have our own problems, but go work on yourself'; I knew Fuckass told them. I knew he told them like, ""omg she's so negative tell her to shut up"", and I was...I was vulnerable then. I had a vulnerable, painful part of me exposed and they stuck their daggers in it and twisted it. 

I believed them. I told them I was so sorry, and that I was proud of them, and I was ashamed of myself...not a single drop of empathy in one of them. 

I don't want them back. I don't know why they convinced me so much that the world is shitty, and Dubai sucks, and they have the shitting actual gall to convey it to me like they're enlightened because Anus has been to LA and had a relevation. I don't know why I let them make me feel like the mistakes I made and the cries of help and me being in need was reason for them being **superior** to me.

They have the nerve to tell me that anyone who does better than them were ""saints"". 

They emotionally manipulated me so successfully that, to this day, I feel like **I** fucked up somewhere. They held all this back from me; rather than doing this to clear the air, they did it to take me when I'm vulnerable and beat the shit out of me (psychologically).

I now have chest pains. I can't sleep properly. I don't know if I'll be worth having friends anymore. I could find DIFFERENT, BETTER, MORE INTERESTING people to hang out with and socialize, and I have a few places booked, but like...

My chest hurts. I can't breathe normally. I'm shaking. I just want some peace. 

I want to know that, despite my flaws and shortcomings, I am worth sticking with through thick and thin. I am worth finding people who love me and appreciate me, and share my interests and hobbies, and do more than just moan about Architecture studio for the 4938th time and shrug anything creative I do off and treat me like absolute SHIT. 

I need someone to tell me that they'll be there for me. I'm not okay. "

**My Top 10 TV Episodes of 2016:** (ranked in favorable order)

10) **Bojack Horseman** (S03E04) [Fish Out the Water](#s ""Being a bit similar to the Spongebob Squarepants episode ‘Rock Bottom’, “Fish out the Water” is an ingenious and unique amalgamation of Lost in Translation. Bojack visits travels to the ‘world under the sea’, but being a mammal himself, he has to wear headgear that deprives him of speech (…or so he thinks). There is only brief dialogue in the beginning and the rest of it is silent but for the warbles of underwater speech and a distinctly different soundtrack than usual – ambient synths and smooth electronic timbres complement the beautiful, vibrant visuals of the underwater city. BoJack Horseman has always been a show where the creators have a lot of fun with the whole concept of a world where intelligent animals coexist with humans, and it was very interesting to see how the sea animals are living in this very unique episode."")

9) **Fleabag** (S01E06) - [untitled](#s ""While ‘Fleabag’ didn’t seem like nothing much at first. Episode 6 proved that Fleabag’s dark, bleaky attributes were well hidden by some creative, crude humor in the first 5 episodes. So some might say Episode 6 of this BBC Three was a plot twist in it’s entirety. It was a very sad emotional episode based on a hidden mess up no one even thought to make notice of in the previous episodes of the season. It was very heart-wrenching to be hit with the reality that our main character Fleabag (as she’s referred in the credits) was not as innocent as we thought she was."")

8) **You're the Worst** (S03E05) [Twenty-Two](#s ""Edgar’s PTSD has been a part of the narrative of You’re the Worst since the very first episode, but until now, it has only been briefly referenced to while the focus has mostly been on Jimmy and Gretchen. Well ‘Twenty-Two’ went a slightly different direction and gave us an Edgar-centric episode. Before this episode you know Edgar is in pain, but you kind of brush it off since you only get to see bits and pieces of it. You don’t see the shaking, you don’t see the paranoia, all you see is a guy who seems a bit fucked up but seems to be generally ok even though he’s pretty fucking far from ok. This episode’s depiction of PTSD was very factual and hard-hitting. One of the more impressive aspects of this episode is how they changed the perceptive from Jimmy and Gretchen, as they both came off as big assholes while watching the show from point-of-view. For a show that usually relies on the antics of its two highly unlikable protagonists to generate laughter, ‘Twenty-Two’ might seem like a big leap. All in all, ‘Twenty-Two’ didn’t feature the kind of humor and laugh-out-loud moments usually found from You’re the Worst and brings to the table something much more serious in a very subtle, yet powerful manner."")

7) **Girls** (S05E06) [The Panic in Central Park](#s ""“The Panic in Central Park” is unlike any other in the Girls series. The title pays homage to the seminal heroin movie with Al Pacino, ‘Panic In Needle Park’. It’s like a beautiful fever dream that you know from the very beginning is going to turn out badly. But you can’t help but hope it won’t. The episode focuses on the character ‘Marnie’ as she reunites with her former lover Charlie. They went off on a unexpected wild and adventurous night, but when the sun rose many truth came to light which lead Marnie into making some big decisions in her life. For a show that (in my opinion) didn’t get off to a good start, this episode just goes to show how much Girls have grown over the past 2 seasons. This was a very well written and well directed episode."") 

6) **Atlanta** (S01E08) [The Club](#s ""One thing to appreciate about Atlanta is how it tackles certain aspects about hip-hop. It pulls the veil back on would-be rap stars, showing us what’s often depicted as the life isn’t always as it’s made out to be, but it does so without feeling preachy, hollow, or stereotypical. In what I believe is the best episode of Atlanta thus far, Earn, Paper Boi, and Darius gets booked for an appearance at the Primal Night Club, and they showed us how frustrating and infuriating the club can be for rappers and their managers. From promoters not willingly wanting to pay up, to rappers not getting the love and respect they think they deserve, this Atlanta episode was as real as they come. The entire episode was very funny, entertaining and fulfilling, which of course also features what Atlanta is already recognized for, hilarious bits. Notably the hilarious, unexpected payoff to the running gag about the invisible car."") 

5) **Game of Thrones** (S06E09) [Battle of the Bastards](#s ""Game of Thrones is known for its strong 9th episodes on almost every season. Season 6 is no different with “Battle of the Bastards”. This one hour television episode truly felt like a massive budget blockbuster movie. This episode gives Game of Thrones fans almost one hour spectacle filled with action. However, the action is paced superbly with absolutely wonderfully acted and written dialogue. The episode involves many great changes, twists and turns. But overall the directing was what made it so good. Episode director Miguel Sapochnik (also known for his another masterpiece episode “Hardhome”) proves himself to be once and for all one of the greatest talents in the television and movie industry today. The action coordination combined with the great camera angles make some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen in television."")

4) **Red Oaks** (S02E01) [Paris](#s ""'Come find me in Paris'. Those were the last words Skye said to David in the season finale of the fantastic first season of Red Oaks. And to my surprise, David actually went to Paris to see the carefree fashionista and self-titled artist he fell in love with in the Red Oaks Country Club, New Jersey. Paris is the land of the romantic films and couples. When the setting is Paris, you know it is all about romance. And that’s exactly what this Red Oaks premiere did as the entire episode was set and filmed in Paris. “Paris” finds our young lovebirds reuniting. Things do get complicated for Skye and David, as it does for most TV couples, but it’s nice that we get to have this moment where we see them fall in love and at a really positive, high moment in their relationship. But there’s also some mild conflict as Skye’s parents unexpectedly appears in Paris to visit her. The 80’s soundtrack complimented the episodes dreamy, artistic tone. And I was quite surprised at how much of 80’s French art and life culture was explored within this 25 minute episode. The episode was quite beautiful, and I very much appreciate the efforts made by Amazon and the show runners to shoot this episode in Paris."") [This video say it all honestly](https://streamable.com/qxeh2)

3) **Black Mirror** [Shut Up and Dance](#s ""This is definitely the most bleak episode of the new Black Mirror season, and also it’s most suspenseful. The episode follows Keeny, whose private life soon erupted when he gets hacked and filmed masturbating through his webcam, then gets a series of threatening text messages from an anonymous sender telling him to do exactly as “they” say or the footage will leak to everyone he knows. The episode flows well from start to finish, nothing feels rushed or dragged out, everything given a natural time to breathe. The episode also had some well built tension. “Shut Up and Dance” does not carry an overt message like so many of these other episodes, which made it a bit more refreshing, and able to focus purely on the self-contained story alone. As such, it has one of the best twists in the entire season when we discovered our focus character Kenny, might not be as innocent as we had hoped."")

2) **The Girlfriend Experience** (S01E09) [Blindsided](#s ""Blindsided is definitely one of the most intense and nerve-racking episode of 2016. The slow, bleak build-up then the fallout to this episode where our main character’s world collides, to the point where she has to make swift decisions was incredibly well written. After watching the first 8 episodes of this limited series, with it’s emptiness and slow paced storytelling, this nightmare scenario for Christine was something none of us saw coming. This episode definitely transformed The Girlfriend Experience from an average sex show into a psychological thriller. But it also has a bit mystery to it. After emails of Christine’s sex tape was leaked to all her family and friends, one would have to wonder how our main suspect ‘Jack’ got access to her personal info. Not to mention the video camera was pointing directly at Christine….could she have made the video and sent it herself? Or probably she only meant to sent it to her internship boss ‘David’, – who she’s been deceivingly manipulating for a job at the firm – and accidentally sent it to all her contacts? We have to ask our self these questions as the mystery in “Blindsided” sprung much deeper than we expected it it. Even the main character Christine is quite a mystery her self. It’s really hard to tell what’s going on in her head at times, but there’s no doubt about it she’s bold and ambitious."")

1) **Black Mirror** [San Junipero](#s ""The build-up before you truly understand what San Junipero is makes for an engaging mystery, and the twists and turns as you realize the true stories behind the residents, and the two women in particular is heart-wrenching. But what sets the episode apart from the rest of Black Mirror’s third season is the way it beautifully balances character revelations with plot and setting revelations. Though the episode, like the others in series 3 of Black Mirror, is over an hour, the pacing is incredible and the episode accomplished all it needed to with its limited time. It’s a love story, after all, one of the very oldest sorts of stories, and it mostly leaves viewers wondering if these two crazy kids will work through their differences and get together. But it’s also complicated, a tale of second chances that behaves like a story of first love.
Every element of San Junipero felt like a strong point. The production Values, the writing, the lighting and especially the music. I’ve known the song “Heaven is a place on Earth” for so long and I’ve never seen it used in any other films or TV the way it was used in this episode. It almost like the episode was inspired by the song and it brought much needed emotion to the ending of the episode. Maybe I’m just a sucker for good endings? But this was one of the best endings for any Black Mirror episode I’ve ever seen. The love story between two old, dying women, living out a “perfect” life in their younger bodies is phenomenal, and features best-in-series performances from both Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mackenzie Davis. When it’s all said and done ‘San Junipero’ is one of the greates hours of televson i’ve ever seen. I think this is most definitely one of Black Mirror’s best episode (if not the best), and easily the best TV episode of 2016."")

About two weeks ago, my battery was empty and my laptop crashed. When restarting it my display didn`t work any more. I thought that my display / display cable broke (i had reordered a display a week before due to stripes on my lcd caused by dumb cleaning).

After the new display didnt work I noticed that one cable of the intern display connection broke:

so I ordered a new intern display connection :D

After installing it, it didnt work too and I observed, that I can connect and work via an external monitor problemless, but when trying to ""duplicate"" the laptop screen to the monitor it stays black, as the display does...

What do you recommend? :)

I just found that both the production firewall and the backup were limited by settings in the Traffic Shaper. Why were these settings changed? According to my part time intern / assistant who is now going to be washing my car by hand every day for the next week, ""I was trying to figure out how those settings worked."" So he modified the settings on multiple new devices - 40mbps down, 4 up - while he was testing them after they came in. And did not change them back.

--------------------------------------

Apologies in advance for the wall of text.

I use pfSense firewall appliances from Netgate almost exclusively. I like to think I know pfSense pretty well but this issue has beaten me handily so far. 

One of my clients has a new 100mbps fiber circuit from Logix, a regional ISP in Texas. The fiber terminates into a Routerboard RB2011iLS-IN which converts the signal to Ethernet and passes it on to the Netgate FW-7541 firewall (which has the lastest release of pfSense on it). 

The problem is throughput performance. Using a laptop connected straight into the Routerboard device I can get about 90mbps down and 70 up. With the pfSense device in place I can only get about 40mbps down and 3.6 mpbs up. I've swapped out the FW-7541 with a (lower throughput) Netgate APU4 and get the same speeds.

I've been working on this with Logix tech support and while they're helpful and flexible nothing we've done has affected the performance. We've tried locking the speed of the Ethernet ports on both devices to 100mbps full, 100mbps half, 1000mbps full and 1000mbps half. No difference in performance. We've also tried changing ports on each of the devices, again, no performance difference. Have tried a few other things as well including putting in a 10/100 dumb switch between the two devices, again to no avail.

I have several other Logix circuits in place, all 25x25 and all connecting to pfSense firewalls. They all achieve near wireline speeds.

So... I'm looking for suggestions on what to investigate / try next. I'm more than willing to use a different pfSense appliance if that's what it takes but of course I'd prefer to reconfigure the one I have if possible or get Logix to make whatever change is needed to their device."
5n5x6n,2,2017-01-10,Need help with Elastic Stack architecture choice,techowned,elastic,https://www.reddit.com/r/elastic/comments/5n5x6n/need_help_with_elastic_stack_architecture_choice/,"Hi fellas. I am a Brazilian security analyst intern at my local university I'm trying to figure out the best way to have my ELK stack implemented. First off, I'll explain the I.T infrastructure and then I'll proceed to the question itself. 
We have 2 campuses(A and B) which are a few kilometers apart and each having  it's own cloud infrastructure. Those campuses are connected through a non redundant (and not very reliable) gigabit link.
The initial idea was to collect all the logs locally at each campus. Which translates to 2 separate Elasticsearch nodes. So we have Campus A currently set up and ingesting all logs coming from it's local network and a few off campus hosts.
The idea that lead us to this approach is that due to connectivity problems we would lose important events. You've probably noticed that the problem with this approach is that we won't be able to visualize all the data from one kibana instance.
We're currently planning how to manage the logs from Campus B.
So my question is: Is it posible to have 2 ES instances (1 master at A and 1 slave at B), while directing all my logs to one Logstash instance which sends to the master node? What happens if A and B can't communicate?

I hope that I've made my point clear enough for you guys to understand and sorry about my english in advance.
Any suggestions or tips will be greatly appreciated!
Thx :-)!

Edit: I'd like to thank everybody for their answers and providing me and my colleagues with great ideas! We've decided to take the Redis approach because of the simplicity. We're going to set up a logstash forwarder to Redis in Campus B, which will act as a queue to ourmain logstash pipeline located in Campus A. Because Redis doesn't support TLS we're going to use stunnel to encrypt the communication between Redis and Logstash. Thanks to everyone again!"

Background: In the Spring of 2016 I received my last semester's worth of grants (TAG) which I used to pay off the semester in addition to federal loans. By the beginning of summer I received a notification letter stating that I was unqualified for TAG (because I had already received it for the maximum amount of semesters) and therefore owe the $3,626 that was granted. I was given payment options for monthly installments but at that point could not afford to pay this off.


I already had an unpaid government internship lined up that I needed for career advancement so I did that over the summer with casual work as a Babysitter and Dental Assistant - did not make enough to pay even a quarter of the debt. 


I then learned that I could not register for the Fall 2016 semester unless I pay off the $3,626. As a result the debt was sold to W&amp;F and an additional fee was charged of $1,083 - total debt now equal to $4,709.  I still cannot register for the upcoming Spring 2017 semester unless I pay the full amount since I have a hold on my account; transcripts, etc. which means I cannot transfer to another university


Current: From September (after my internship) through December 31st, I have been able to earn enough money (working as a Nanny and other odd jobs) to pay off the entire debt in full. I've read the posts on the sidebar on debt and credit, and I've also searched for comments specifically related to W&amp;F but I haven't found a situation where the student had not graduated. They have a lot of leverage and I'm unsure how to negotiate.


Need Advice: I'm not sure if I should try to negotiate a settlement as I've seen in multiple posts here or should I pay the full amount which includes the penalty fee. I feel like I can't use any hard-line tactics to negotiate as they have control over whether I can finish school.


***Note: I am not trying to get out of paying the debt but if there is any way I can negotiate to pay the original amount and not W&amp;F's fee, it would help significantly because I still have to pay for two classes around $4,000 and I don't think I'll be able to do that without the extra $1,083. 


Thank you for all your time and help!

tl’dr :

Started a digital out of home advertising business and my 6-month journey as a 22 y/o entrepreneur so far is down below.

Hi there redditors , bit of a long post so prepare yourself. I’m a 22y/o old design student and last summer whilst interning at a large tech company I stumbled across a reddit post from a guy who told the story of how he was making $3,000 a month selling advertising on placemats in his Universities cafeteria.I have a keen interest in business and thought this was a perfect opportunity to jump in to the world of entrepreneurship.

Finished my summer internship and set about trying to figure out this new project. I went for the straight solid business of placemats as inspired by reddit. Got in contact with university , landed a meeting had all prepared , they were lovely but unfortunately said they couldn’t do anything for me. All cafeteria handling’s were done by a third party . Went back to the drawing board worked hard on my prototypes of the placemats and tried to find the manager of the cafeteria at my university. A week later I found him , no luck he was point blank not interested in hearing what I had to say and essentially told me to f**k off.

Now what I’d be rejected twice by the placemats concept. Rather than give up I tried to pivot and explore other options of local advertising in my town. I noticed all of these outdoor posters / billboards (scrolling lightbox types) in my home town and thought that could be a good bet. Only thing was the town was littered with them I’d need to find a high traffic location that was unused. So I got out and scouted the whole town. Eventually found a wall that was perfect  , just by the train station lots of footfall. 

Location found , next was to find who owns the wall. Directly went and asked several local business owners and nobody could help. Eventually found one guy who owned the local bar. Despite being a straight out dick he told me who owned it. I got in contact with the owner and set up a meeting. This guy was a real estate agent , again seemed like he was trying to shake me down for money rather than help out a budding entrepreneur. I had sourced my lightbox on Alibaba and negotiated with suppliers for the price taking my initial investment to €800 per box. He then wanted me to rent out the wall with the condition that I would put up 3 of these billboards on his wall. Taking my investment to €2,400 and he then wanted €9,000 a year for the wall , which is ridiculous. But at the time I was so eager to get going I didn’t care. I drafted paperwork and almost signed myself into €9,000 of debt. The day before signing I had thought about how he treated me , he looked down on me , gave me very little of his time and belittled me and my idea in most cases. Thought to myself money aside is this someone I wanted to do business with? The answer was no and despite wanting to get this project going so bad I told him the deal was off.

2 weeks later slightly discouraged I moved onto my second pivot. I discovered the world of digital signage. Indoor tv’s that you place adverts on. I spent almost a month on figuring out how the systems work and what business model I could use.  I thought this could be it. I was inspired by outdoor advertising models used by some large industry players. They would offer free furniture to cities in return for exclusive advertising rights on the furniture. I thought this was my business model , offer a restaurant a free tv to display their promotions on and get exclusive advertising on the tv. Next was location , I scouted 3 restaurants to deal with and got  a meeting in two. I was rejected by one but accepted by the other!


I just launched last week and have the solution running. Built a website , registered as a company , bought a landline number, set up email with ZOHO and I’m now in the sales side of things trying to sell ad space on the TV but struggling. I’m working on a yearly term with clients and offering a months free advertising before they sign up. The screen offers over 2,500 ad plays a month and is only €150 a month for a 15 second slot working out to €5 a day. Despite this I’ve only managed to sell trials for 8/20 slots. I would appreciate any help on the sales fronts. My prices are much much less than newspaper advertising or any other forms of media. The restaurant gets well over 10,000+ impressions per month. A lot of impressions would come from students and staff from the local university so I’m targeting people interested in advertising to the 18-35 demographic. Any thoughts or advice is appreciated greatly."

Before September of 2016, I was severely depressed, borderline suicidal, crippling social anxiety without the ability to make one friend in two years of my university life, a hollow human being. I cried to sleep daily, pondered what the point of my virgin, kissless, stupid life is. 

Until I went abroad to study in another university for 5 months. I met the greatest bunch of friends, I met an amazing girl and made her my girlfriend. Learnt the values on how to be a man, a responsible adult that took care and loved other human beings. My panic attacks, depression miraculously went away after 2 years of constant, constant pain. It was one of the greatest time periods of my life. I thought this was going to be a light at the end of the tunnel, a ladder up this well of depression.

Then I had to leave, and go back to my university, leaving all of them behind.

My parents had me do math workbooks since the age of 5, and I quite enjoyed it to be honest; it's one of the reasons why I'm in Comp Sci. I live in Canada now, but I believe this Kumon-like thing is very common in South Korea. Anyways, it always gave me great satisfaction coming to a definitive conclusion to each problem. I always did well in school back in Korea but I hadn’t stayed there long enough to know how well I’ve been doing in comparison to all the other kids.

When I was 9, my dad had decided that we’d move over to Canada for his kids’ “future” (I now know that it was really to escape the cultural and corporate life of Korea he had endured for 40 years). We settled in a nice neighbourhood with an elementary school just a few minutes walk away and I was as happy as a kid could be. Made a couple of friends despite my language barrier (or perhaps it was because of the language ineptitude, I’ll never know) and was just coasting by in school. The school curriculum is much ahead in Korea so I was at the top of my class; I believe this is where my bloated ego took a place in my personality and felt that a person can only be either superior or inferior to me. I wouldn’t have known whether this was a good outlook on social interactions or not. How could I have known what was normal when my dad always told me that I was smarter than everyone and deserve more? How could I have known such a thing when I was normalized to being forced by mom to ask my dad to eat dinner with his family because she couldn’t bother to do that herself, while expecting his rejection every time? I’m positive that I’m giving my parents more shit than they deserve, but at the same time, I’m not. I just don’t know. Like everything else in my life.

Come middle school and all the hormones that puberty brings, you’d just about expect the norm in my life as well. Constant need to assure my self-worth with sociopathic approaches to relationships and constant needs of others to assure their self-worth with sociopathic tactics. It’s too bad I’m still stuck in this childish mindset.

I can never be sure whether I was bullied in middle school or not. I was never sure whether the friends I had since elementary school just started being mean to me or it was just me not being able to handle the banter. It should be noted that I was instilled a sense of duty to entertain them as a superior kid and did low brow comedy routine as a middle schooler. Even in another clique I thought I found myself in, whenever I said something that may have been funny, it always felt like they were laughing at me, not with me. And when I wanted to reaffirm that they were laughing with me and speak from heart, it was always met with more laughter. It was never a line directed towards a fellow human being. But it’s just middle school, right? Nothing same with the way people speak to me right now, right?

I found a group that I knew for sure wouldn’t make fun of me, they were inferior to me after all. Nerds, social outcasts, weirdos. These people were probably the only friends I carried with myself towards high school.

Lot of things to be mentioned in high school but I feel that this post is getting too long, so I’ll keep it short. Parents got divorced (best and the worst thing to happen to me), lost a good friend of mine because I was being an ass towards him for trying to enter MY clique, started placing 2nd instead of 1st in provincial math competitions, absolutely bombed in playing trumpet in my concert band, became an ass towards everyone in band (debatable), tried talking to more people because “you just gotta get yourself out there man”. These points should be enough to lead into my next topic.

There were many evidences of people holding back whenever they were talking with me. In concert band, whenever I tried to initiate conversations (I seldom do) the replies were curt and conclusive. Whenever I tried to talk to my teachers to discuss about a topic in greater detail (and often in passion), they never felt personal when clearly they showed more personality towards the class and other individuals. When I was forced on a month long camp (Shad Valley, fuck you) because my mom told me that I needed more extracurricular activities for universities, all but my roommate (god bless that boy) showed the same replies: curt statements with occasional remarks out of pity. Now I was rather naïve back then, thinking that getting myself out there would help me with getting friends. My observations showed me that this wasn’t all just in my head: there are distinct ways that people talk when they’re speaking from their hearts (when usually with friends or are enjoying themselves) and when they’re just trying to be polite. 

This fucked with me, fucks me at the moment, and continues to fuck me for the foreseeable future. At this point, I knew I was the problem, but just didn’t know what it was. I tried to come up with all sorts of explanations, as of now the possibility of my ego being imbedded into my personality and as of result coming very much off as an asshole seems to be the most plausible answer. I’ve also been told that I look high all the time when I haven’t touched weed in my entire life. A friend also told me that I look intimidating. I’m glad my friends were there to shoot the bull with me in the high school, they helped me forget that my self-worth was in complete shambles. I wish they were still with me.

My senior year was pathetic. I got into a university I didn’t really care about. I was told that I did so well maintaining a 95% average when I felt I hadn’t worked for that number at all. My teachers continued to grind down my enthusiasm for their courses to the point that even when I had questions I’d keep them to myself because their replies felt devoid. My prom partner (who chose me because her date ditched her at the last minute) and her friends did not make any effort to talk to me during the 1-2 hour long line (to be fair, I never tried to initiate a conversation with them neither).

My outlook just kept getting bleaker. I decided to live in a dorm in my first year at university so that maybe I could try again, but I knew that nothing would change. I knew that every interaction I’ll have will be one sided. I knew that I would stay in my room throughout the entire year. Despite this, I still tried. All of the predictions came true (I probably made them true), but I still had a sliver of hope. I joined a club (gotta get yourself out there am I right haha xd). I’m sure with the tone of this post, you’d know that nothing came out of it.

I finished first year being on the honour’s list with distinction, but that doesn’t mean anything to me anymore. The only reason I get good grades is because I love getting lost in finding definitive answers. There is no ambiguity. And I have been trained to study like a robot since 5.

I planned a visit to my best friend in high school during the last summer. It ended with him telling me over facebook that his mom had forgotten about me staying over his house and that they had no rooms for me. It should be noted that I was just over there 2 weeks ago, and that I had left to visit my dad for a week. I have made it abundantly clear to him and his mother that I’d be back, and it was mutually agreed upon. To make our break in friendship more clear, he’s never sent me any kind of messages since that notice. He also is not going through a problem of his own. I still see him online playing video games with my former friends who had also cut off communications with me. My dad also told me on this trip that he wished to never see me again. Pretty sure Harambe also died around this time.

I’ve talked to a counsellor and she’s told me to get myself out there and that a relationship works two ways and that I’m not the only problem. Fuck you. 

My second year consists of me dreading to write down anything on my resume for internship applications because the only thing I can write down there is my grades, which I feel is of no value to me. I also feel I don’t want to go to the internship. First thing is I feel I have nothing to contribute to a company and the other thing is that I don’t want to be let down again. I don’t want to see other interns happily indulged in a conversation without me. I don’t want them carefully choosing their words to say when we have conversations that only I ever initiate.

I don’t want to be hurt over and over again.

My sister told me that I was never there for her when she ran away from home threatening suicide when I have searched for her for the entirety of my evening and had given her advices on what I think she should do regarding depression based on my experience. She’s also been skipping school and my mother went absolutely nuts. My dog’s also been eating rabbit shit every time I let him outside.

That should be all my unfortunate events I’ve harbored, pondering to myself what was wrong with me with all the time I had to myself being alone. There were also good things that have happened to my life, it’s just that negative thoughts always tend to persist over the good ones. I know my dad’s not a completely horrible being, he just doesn’t want his son to end up like him. I know I have been playing the victim card here throughout my post, and I think I’m aware of it. I’m also sorry for the complete lack of editing here, I have a lecture in half an hour and I just wanted to get this thought out for anybody to see while I could.

I don’t know see a fitting way to end this post, so this sentence will signal its end.

Tldr; don’t bother, it’s not worth your time.

5n9ofl,2,2017-01-10,"I am an earth sciences major, I have a few questions.",conman526,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/5n9ofl/i_am_an_earth_sciences_major_i_have_a_few/,"First, some background. I wanted to do engineering for a while because I enjoyed learning how things worked, and because I enjoyed math and physics. I stumbled upon earth sciences/geology and thought that it was a perfect fit, especially because I have also always enjoyed learning how the earth worked.
First question: Geology or geoscience? I really enjoy being outdoors, rain shine mountain or plain. However, I also enjoy working with technology (I actually work at my universities IT department), but I am not a fan of software development or testing. I read that geologist often spend up to 80 hours a week in the field for months, and then spend the rest of their time indoors. And that geophysicists hardly ever go into the field to gather data, and all they do is computer simulations and modeling. I am specifically interested in the difference between a typical work week between geologists and geophysicists.

First and a half?: What do you do in an average work week/month? Are you a geologist, or are you a geophysicist? I am also considering hydrogeology/hydrology focus.

Second: Do I absolutely, without a doubt, have to get a graduate degree? I am not keen on getting one right after my undergraduate degree, but I will definitely consider going back to school in the future. Also, if I do absolutely have to get one after my BS, what should I get it in?

Third: What is the difference in work style of O&amp;G companies, environmental? Like, is O&amp;G only into exploration, and is environmental only consulting?

Fourth: What should I expect, job duties wise, at an entry-level position with a BS with little experience (maybe an internship or two)? 

Fourth and a quarter: What kind of advancement opportunities could I expect to see 5 years down the road with just a BS? 10 years? 20 years? Government career opportunities? Private sector?

Fifth: As of right now, I am really interested in traveling abroad for work. I have heard that this is a possibility. Is this true? What kind of qualifications would I need? What kind of job would it have to be?

Sixth: As I mentioned earlier, I am interested in hydrogeology. However, I have heard that the job outlook on this isn't as great, and the pay is not as good. Is this true?

Thank you guys! If you can't answer all or any of my questions, just please leave your opinion on how you enjoy your job! i.e. what you do (job title), what you do (duties), what you like about it, don't like about it, I would love to hear about it. Thanks again!"
5n9qhp,2,2017-01-10,Intro - Starting Again,MizunoKaze,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/5n9qhp/intro_starting_again/,"Hello, everyone! I recently found this subreddit, and I figure I could use all the help I can get, so...here I am!

Other than my stats in my flair, probably the biggest thing to know about me is that I've done so much of this before. Over the course of 2014, I lost over 100 pounds. I still wasn't at my goal weight, but I was certainly much closer than I'd ever been. As someone who'd been overweight as long as I could remember, it was so great being that comparatively slim. I wasn't paying extra for jeans. I was buying shirt sizes without an X in them. People treated me better, and I felt better about my body than I ever had.

And then...I screwed up. I let it all slip away. A major factor in me losing that weight had been the amount of free time on my hands. I'd been fresh out of college, finally completing my bachelor's degree after almost 10 years of off and on college whenever I could afford it, but no one wanted to hire me. I'd supported myself on some inheritance for the last year or so of college, so that I could actually go full-time and not have to juggle a job at the same time, but that meant that once I graduated, there was a whole lot of nothing going on. I used that time to work on my weight, but then, at the start of 2015, I'd had so little luck that I decided to go back for another degree.

I went at the second degree as hard as I could, taking 16 credit hours each quarter (18 in one of them, actually). I finished it within the year. But along the way, workouts slipped and eventually became non-existent. My diet got worse, capping off with an internship that saw our department eating out literally every workday for lunch. By the time 2015 ended, I realized I'd gained all of that weight back again, and with a few pounds extra, to boot.

I think in a way, I didn't do things right the first time around. I was still eating plenty of carbs, albeit in smaller portions and with more vegetables mixed in. I ""made up for it"" with exercise, usually ""power walking"" on the treadmill. 100 minutes at 4 MPH was pretty much my daily minimum. That's great and all, but working a full-time job with a commute, I don't see working that much time into my schedule every single day being feasible.

There are a few more complications on the nutrition side of things, listed in no particular order:
 
 - I'm fortunate enough to have a partner who's currently back to being a student, and has time to do all the cooking. However, he's used to fairly simple cooking, and is a picky eater.

 - We're trying to save money and pull ourselves out of debt, so budget is tight.

 - My current employer provides lunch, but that's kind of a double-edged sword. I work in the office of what's basically a country club, and the kitchen puts out lunch, buffet-style, in the employee lounge. I used to track my calories all the time, but I don't know how to handle a daily meal where I have no clue of the nutrition value. The chefs are no real help, as it tends to just be whatever they can throw together for the day from surplus or leftovers, and I don't think they have any idea of calorie counts. I could describe the food in MFP and hope I get something close, but that could very well be wildly off. I could bring my own lunch instead, but with budget also being a focus, it's hard to turn down free lunch every workday.

Obviously, exercise is the other part of the equation. I realize it's not nearly as much of the equation, that 80-90% is diet, and you can't outrun your fork, but still...exercise has been inconsistent, to say the least. There's so much information out there about different workouts, and it's so hard to know what's right for me. I know ""right for me"" is the biggest thing, that the best exercise program is the one you stick with. I know the only real way to find out is to try, but I still find myself gripped by a bit of analysis paralysis. That, and a general lack of energy. Even if I start the afternoon swearing I'll exercise when I get home, after finishing out the work day, going through my commute, coming home and eating dinner...I find myself not wanting to do much.

I do try to work a little bit of walking into my routine at work, but with a busy desk job, that can be tough. Usually, the most I manage is going for a pretty short walk down a quiet hallway at my work each time I get my hourly reminder from my FitBit, and parking in the furthest parking spot. This still only amounts to maybe 3,000-4,000 steps a day. I'd really rather not add any more monthly expenses to the budget, which means a gym is likely out. I do have some tools at home. There's my treadmill, although I am a bit afraid of damaging it if I use it too much while over its 300 pound weight limit. There's a pair of 10 pound dumbbells, a pair of 20 pound dumbbells, and a very nice set of adjustable dumbbells that go from 5 pounds to 55 pounds in 2.5 pound increments. And of course, there's always my body weight, though that can be difficult with so darn much of me to lift. It's just a matter of figuring out how to use those tools in a way that works for me, and having the energy to actually do it.

I should probably mention my hobbies are, unsurprisingly, pretty much all sedentary. I love PC and console gaming, particularly RPGs, fantasy books, that sort of thing. All very fun, but not really contributing to a solution.

Anyway, that was my introduction. I know it was a massive wall of text, but I never was very good at being concise. I look forward to any input, suggestion, inspiration, etc. you all may have!"

5na9oy,23,2017-01-11,How do I accept my own mediocrity?,adeliepingu,getting_over_it,https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/5na9oy/how_do_i_accept_my_own_mediocrity/,"**Disclaimer:** Wall of text ahead, with no visible point. Might delete this later when I'm feeling better.

I'm graduating college this spring. It's been rough.

I went from straight A's my freshman year to nearly failing out my junior year because I didn't want to live anymore. There were a lot of factors as to why - I felt incredibly discouraged by how many other students came in with an advantage due to their prior programming experience, my own lack of genius, and on top of that, my roommate started dating my high school friend and my jealousy was distracting. I've always reacted very poorly to feeling *not good enough*, and things just slowly fell apart.

It's a typical negative cycle. You feel bad, then you start feeling bad for feeling bad. Eventually you don't know how you started in the first place, just that *feeling bad* has been all you've ever known.

I'd like to think I'm recovering. My grades are mediocre, and I'll graduate on time thanks to generous AP credits and lax degree requirements. I don't think about killing myself much, and the emptiness and apathy has been replaced with plain ol' anger and bitterness. Sometimes I even think I'll be happy in the future.

But it's hard, graduating and finding a job and becoming a competent adult. I'm home for winter break and I don't think I've had a single conversation with my parents that didn't end in tears. Just a matter of differing viewpoints and expectations - my parents just want me to be able to graduate on time, find some kind of job, maybe do what my roommate did and find myself a rich boyfriend who'll take care of me.

That's not what I want. How have I gotten to the point where just *graduating* is an accomplishment? Why am I so absolutely, so infuriatingly *mediocre*? All I ever wanted to be was *good at something*, but it seems that's too much to ask for.

I was a really good student in high school. People respected me and expected me to do great things. Now, when I look at the accomplishments of others - they're starting companies, picking up internships with Big 4 tech companies, enjoying themselves - I can't help but feel I peaked in high school, and my life has just been a long trend downhill ever since. I don't want to be a disappointment. I'd rather die than be a failure - if at first you can't succeed, destroy all evidence you tried.

I don't know where I'm going with this, really. I don't have a clear question someone can answer.

My thinking is illogical and self-contradictory. I am too proud to accept I am just a normal person - not special, not talented, not going to change the world - but I've always struggled with imposter syndrome and feeling like I'm not good enough and never will be. I know that I need to improve myself but I can't make the first move because I'm too crippled by my fear of admitting failure and by my suspicion that no matter what I do, I'll never catch up with what I want to be.

I can find the flaws in my own thinking, identify why it's negative and doesn't make sense, but I can't make myself believe my own logic. I know the way I think is overwhelmingly fatalistic and negative, but knowing won't make it go away.

Honestly, I just want to look at my resume without crying. That's all.

**Aside:** I dated someone last year, during the worst of my depression. I still feel awfully guilty about it - I spooked badly and just cut off all communication with them because I couldn't handle and didn't think I was worthy of being in a relationship. I'll apologize to them one day. I just don't know when I'm ready to do it."
5na9w3,1,2017-01-11,What is at the root of your depression and what are some ways you have learned to cope with it?,zeppelincheetah,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5na9w3/what_is_at_the_root_of_your_depression_and_what/,"My depression (actually diagnosed as bi polar but it is mainly depression with occasional hypomania) hit me like a ton of bricks when I was 12.  Both parents have a family history of mental illness.  My dad was the brightest kid in a privledged family of six, the only one accepted to a very competitive academy and the only one with a scholarship to Vanderbilt.  He went insane in his early 20's, bi polar and schizophrenia.  He had electroshock therapy and never was the same.  My mom's mother died suddenly when my mom was only 14.  She comes from a family of 11 kids and was the middle child.  I should say both came from very Catholic families so were extremely sexually repressed, and even talking about sex was seen as taboo.  Two of my mother's brothers suffered from schizophrenia and killed themselves during my lifetime.  One lit himself on fire when I was too young to remember, the other jumped off a bridge when I was in my 20's.  My parents divorced when I was 4 because my dad was verbally abusive (would get VERY ANGRY for almost no reason randomly) and my mom re-married about two years after to a former military man who was very strict.  In addition to all of this we moved many times while I was growing up, each time leaving behind forever the friends that I had made.  The most disastrous of these moves occured when I was 12.  We moved from an urban neighborhood in sunny Nevada where I had a plethora of kids to play with to a dreary (almost always overcast) hillside just south of the Ohio river in bum fuck nowhere Kentucky.  We lived on 40 acres and the nearest neighbor was a mile away.  In addition to this I was put into a private school for the first time in my life because the public schools weren't supposed to be very good.  I became pretty much mentally retarded (was the laughing stock of the 7th grade) and even walked extremely awkwardly in front of my schoolmates due to being suddenly acutely self conscious of my every move.  In addition to this nobody properly explained sex to me.  I missed out of sex ed due to the private school and never even talked about it to my peers until years later so I was clueless as to why I got horny and had the tragic catholic guilt about sexuality.   I became severely addicted to videogames, an addiction I wouldn't start to overcome until my mid 20's. We moved to South Carolina in the summer between 8th grade and High School.  In high school I only fared marginally better than Middle School, and didn't feel part of anyone.  I wasn't a jock or a prep or a nerd I was just there.  I didn't go to prom and instead played videogames.  I went to college for a year(which actually was fun for the most part, though I had the emotional IQ of a 10 year old and didn't even hold hands much less kiss until my mid 20's) then got a sales job selling books door to door in rural texas.  I made no money (I was a pitiful salesman) lost my car (because I didn't change the oil in time) and when I went back to college in the fall I flunked out.  I got on meds that sort of worked but really made me numb to everything.  I ended up going back and finishing college by the skin of my teeth, having no plan for the future, having foolishly dropped out of my crucial internship because it reminded me of my sales job.  The first job after college was working as a walgreens store clerk.  I should say in addition to everything else I was morbidly obese since Kentucky, eating junk food and never excersizing. I also have absolutely atrocious metabolism.  I quit Walgreens after a few months, went home to live with my mom and hit another low point when she told me I had to get a job, any job if I wanted to live with her so me, a college grad and son of a Vandy grad, worked sweeping floors at a filthy plant that makes rubber for tires.  Fate stepped in luckily and I jumped at the oppourtunity to work an unpaid internship at the Nashville Chamber of Commerce, where my dad lives.  I got a job at a grocery store to make some money and was made fun of by management (being referred to as a neanderthal because I was still self conscious in public).  After 6 months I quit the internship to work at the grocery store full time and I finally started to make friends (thanks meetup.com) and even got along with my coworkers once one super friendly cool guy started working there and invited me to a party with coworkers.  I was on my feet a lot and I ate very little because poverty so I lost weight and my life seemed to be working out (finally had the confidence to have my first dating experience when I was 26).  Gradually this life eroded.  Friends kept leaving, and I was put almost exclusively on the overnight shift alone.  I had three different managers telling me three different things and no matter how hard I worked It was never enough and I was never appreciated.  I heard about a ride sharing service and quit the grocery store.  At first it was great because I was making so much money but after 3 years I am making less and less money all of the time, have almost no social life because of my work schedule (nights and weekends).  I got off my meds about two years ago because they were just making me feel too numb and every experience felt hollow and artificial.  I cope somewhat by doing the following:

1) working out and eating right.  No sugary sodas and limited sweets and fast food.   Lots of fruit and veggies.  I work out almost every day

2) having a dog in the house so when I feel at my lowest I can hold the dog and he always greets me when I come in

3) I have kept a journal for the past 5 years.  Writing my feelings is extremely important and therapuetic.  Especially excersizes in creative writing

4) reading a lot.  I am an introvert so this has helped me tremendously.  Also consuming info on the internet, but in moderarion.  I have been atheist/agnostic for much of my adult life but through hearing Jordan B Peterson on Joe Rogan's podcast I have a new hope for adding religion to my life

5) curbing my enthusiasm.  I have had a horrible habit of putting all my hopes into something only to be very disappointed.  Try not to think x will solve all of your problems and make you happy.  99.9999999% chance it won't do shit.

I still get down and still feel suicidal at times.  I have never had a girlfriend and don't plan to anytime soon because everytime I try I can't handle it and my life falls apart because I don't know how to juggle a relationship and a job where I work nights and weekends and I tend to be an asshole.  The longest a relationship has lasted one week.  But doing these things has helped keep the terrible depression at bay a little bit."

5nar95,4,2017-01-11,i am graduating college in may and im terrified of the job search,whatdoido12345678888,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5nar95/i_am_graduating_college_in_may_and_im_terrified/,"it’s a bit late so i’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense/is disorganized. it could definitely be improved but i need to get this off my chest because it’s eating at me. 

i graduate in may from a prestigious university with a degree in history and i’m finding it really hard for me to think of anything i want to do. i have experience on some on-campus casual/part-time jobs, but nothing serious like an internship. i feel like the fact that i have no “real” experience combined with my degree in history will make it impossible for me to find a job, even if i knew what i wanted to do. 

i came into college wanting to go to law school which is why i majored in history. but now that’s changed and i don’t know what to do. i spent a lot of time focused at my studies but that is now no longer an option for me and i am now reaching the end. to be honest i really don’t know how to do anything *but* study. my entire life has always been about grades and i did well in my studies and i’ve done well but now it’s over. 

i have a lot of experience as a research assistant for other people, helping them with their projects. i’d like to get a job where i read and write things and work with people on projects or something vaguely related. i really love that kind of stuff, especially writing things. it doesn’t even have to be history, i’ve done stuff in law, sociology, jewish studies, etc. but i don’t know where to look and i don’t think that kind of job exists for people outside academia, or at least not for people with my qualifications and background (which include no science or finance-related research). i did some work as a distance marketing intern (internship over the web) for a startup that has since failed but it wasn’t really an impressive campaign. 

whenever i look at jobs i get depressed because i don’t meet the qualifications. i don’t have experience. i don’t have the skills. i don’t have a degree in the field they want. i know that the qualifications don’t have to all be met but i feel like why would someone hire me, without any experience, over someone who has way more experience than me (which would be any experience at all) and a relevant degree? usually the only qualifications i meet are familiarity with the office suite and organizational/communication skills. i have those skills but so does everyone else, or at least they say they do, so i feel like i don’t stand out. i know i have skills like scripting and programming but i feel that aren’t good enough to be useful, or jobs don’t ask for them at all. in short i feel unprepared for the job search. 

i get depressed and anxious thinking about it. i feel like i’m going to fail for sure and i haven’t even started seriously applying for work. i haven’t gotten a single rejection yet but i feel like i’ve already failed. people tell me i’m really smart and talented and i’ll find something that’s right for me. but i feel like everyone is being optimistic and it’s hard for me to believe them when they are also struggling to find work. i tried to tell myself the same thing but i feel like i’m just trying to make myself feel better. 

i feel like part of it is that i tried to find an internship for the past summer (between my junior and senior year) and found it incredibly difficult to even get interviews. i ended up not getting an internship and instead working at a library on campus. i went to my career center tons for advice and was told that my resume, cover letters, etc. were good as they were though i did incorporate their feedback on how to improve. but like i said i found it difficult to even get an interview. 

i don’t know what to do. it’s obviously too late to change my major and i have no clue what i am going to do with my life. i don’t care if my job has nothing to do with history. i love history and i don’t really regret studying it. it developed my skills in synthesizing material, making judgements, writing and organization, understanding trends, etc. i originally picked it though because it was apparently a good major for law school because of the skills. i felt lucky that it coincided with my passion because i love history.  

but now all i know is that i don’t want to go to law or grad school, at least right now, so i feel like my major is a wash even though i love/loved studying it. it probably doesn’t help that i have no clue what i want to do or what is even out there. i feel so dejected. i’m going to therapy but it doesn’t change the fact that i have to decide what it is i want to do, at least come this summer. i know i may not find a career i love right away but... i really have no clue. i feel like this is impossible. i feel like i’ve failed. 

i would appreciate your thoughts, stories, advice, feedback, etc. as long as it’s helpful and constructive. i know there are a ton of things i *should* have done but it’s way too late for that now. thanks for reading. "
5nbjp9,0,2017-01-11,Question about exercise and sleep,ShowtimeSpicer,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5nbjp9/question_about_exercise_and_sleep/,"Hi!

I am wanting to start running and working out. However, due to my work and school schedule it is a bit complicated.

I work third shift, so about 10pm-5am each night. I have class Tuesday and Thursday at 11 am so I get 3 hours of sleep on those days after work, and then nap later in the day.

On Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday I work an internship and I'm there by 3.. so I get a little bit more sleep on these days, about 6 hours. Still not the full 8 though.

I'm used to not sleeping much but I'm wondering how this will impact me if I start working out. Will I be able to see any benefit from exercise because of lack of sleep? Will not sleeping a full 8 hours ever really hurt me and keep me from seeing any noticeable difference?

Just want to make sure I'm not wasting my time. Thanks guys!"

But unless he's fired, he cannot be hired by another team unless its as a head coach, correct? Or does the fact that he was promoted to intern HC mean he can't go back down to OC unless he signs a new contract?

5nd35o,13,2017-01-11,"I'm 27 and I have been living with degenerative disc ""disease"" for 6 years. Marijuana helps me in a very real way.",[deleted],ChronicPain,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/5nd35o/im_27_and_i_have_been_living_with_degenerative/,"I want to let people know that marijuana, especially the right strains, really does help with the chronic pain that comes with degenerative discs. 

My L4 and L5 are both degenerative, L5 herniated 6 years ago which I had a microdiscectomy to repair and L4 is bulging forward and to the left. Over the years I have lost everything that is important to me and I have thought about suicide more than I'd like to talk about. I used to play football and other sports all the time and had started a career as a fire fighter/investigator with my Bachelor's in Criminal Justice but had to drop it all when my back problems were diagnosed as degenerative. I hid my problems the entire time and many times in my internship with the fire department I had to discretely use my shovel as a cane while working a fire.

Since then I have tried so many of the different pain pills and recently tried anti-depressants. I can say with confidence that these are both terrible options and will only destroy you in the long run. For me, that pain pills did not even stop the pain, they just altered my mind and body in a bad way, making me even less functional. The anti-depressants didn't make my pain-triggered thoughts any easier and only made me somewhat of a sad zombie.

I want everyone in this community to know that I truly do find real relief in the use of marijuana in it's many different forms, not just CBD. I lived in Colorado for about a year and worked in the medical marijuana industry to learn how to make my own medicine. I unfortunately had to quit my weed-growing job because my back pain was so bad I could not handle doing the work anymore, even with the regular use of marijuana. All the while, I was seeing the most progressive spine specialists I could get to and was only left with an ""I'm sorry, you really got the short end of the stick on this one..."" and that was it, again and again. I had once again spent all my money on getting my hopes and then shot down.

ALTHOUGH, I learned a lot from a physical therapist I saw there in Denver and the focus on fitness and doing the right therapeutic movements/strength building has helped me tremendously, and I still work out at the gym every day, in the ways that I can. I cannot run anymore or really lift weights without being extremely careful. I cannot stress enough how important regular exercise and the application of heat in a hot tub or steam room helps me.

For reasons I'm no longer sure about, I've moved back to North Carolina and I am now without any marijuana and my pain is getting worse. I live with my parents, which is humiliating as I cannot get a job that I can physically handle and will pay me enough to take care of myself. Also, having a marijuana job on your resume doesn't make it any easier to get employed in backwards-ass North Carolina. I cannot sit down or stand stationary for very long and I cannot do manual labor anymore either, for the obvious reasons. I am working on getting certifications toward a job in networking (A+, Networking+, CNAA) that will allow me to move around as needed but without lifting all day or bending over. 

I try to stay focused on moving forward and getting a new job but I am so depressed about being trapped in my parents house at 27 with no job, no friends, no love in my life, no money, and no hobbies I can really enjoy anymore. I truly feel like my life is ruined and I am having a hard time staying positive enough to find my way out.

I want to share a message of relief with you all that there is hope in marijuana, we all have to push through the government's corruption and fight them to legalize it for everyone, especially us.

I am also posting this because I am asking for help. If anyone has anything to share that will help me feel better about my life and give me some hope again, it would be deeply appreciated. Sharing is caring and I want to share with you all. You're not alone and I want to feel like I'm not alone either.






EDIT: Thank you so much for responding to this. I wanted to give it some time before I read what you all had to say, thank you again. It really means a lot."

5neilp,8,2017-01-11,"I've been here before, but I needed to say it again. Bit of a rant.",chewyhulksmash,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/5neilp/ive_been_here_before_but_i_needed_to_say_it_again/,"Background info: 26 (F) married 8 years to 26 (M) and together for 12, 2 year old boy, 7 month old girl. STBXH cheated at various levels over the last 3 years.  

Often times this sub has been more therapeutic than the actual therapy that I am in. I have been increasingly angry lately and I find it more difficult to maintain my level of external apathy toward my STBXH. Yesterday I was so angry about everything he has done that I couldn’t muster more than two word responses to him. I know I cannot stay in this place forever and I need to process through it. I guess I just want to feel heard. I want to verbalize everything he has done and feel zero guilt because I worry it might change the way that someone views him.

When I think about my financial situation moving forward bitterness does not begin to describe my feelings. I worked 40+ hours along with going to school full time and part time internships to provide for us while he barely worked part time and dicked around playing video games excessively. He proceeded to live above our means, take out multiple credit cards in my name and his, take out school loans in my name and irresponsibly spend. Meanwhile I was working my ass off and also processing the death of a loved one. One of the harder times of my life. He couldn’t be bothered to help with financial responsibilities, household, or be there for me emotionally. The day before my grandmother’s funeral I had one request “Please just don’t leave my side today.” He drove away after I pleaded with him in a puddle of tears so he could play football with some buddies.

His pattern of cheating goes something like this:

“I need space and I think I might want a divorce. Idk, can you just let me process and leave me alone?”

Approximately 3 days later I would find evidence of some online relationship and eventually a real one that he would try to lie about and say was a friendship. Only to then compare me to the OW and explain why they were so much better than me and how he just hasn’t been happy. Meanwhile just days prior everything would seem fine. No fighting, spending time together, and seemingly get along in every facet of our relationship.  

He meets women by answering want ads online. Over the last 3 years (including our 7 month separation) there have been about 12 women that I know of. Most of which he has told me about because I have come to realize that he is a massive narcissist.

The first time I found out about the cheating he was deployed. I centered my life around supporting him. I made sacrifices wherever I could to maintain connection with him. I mailed him a care package every single week for 9 months with baked goods in it and all of his favorite things. I was a fucking bomb ass wife – not perfect, but god damn I put my best foot forward even after all of the emotional abuse. What did I get in return? I got “I want a divorce so I can talk to other women, but I don’t want you to actually file, I still want to talk every day, be best friends, and still have sex…but we’re not together, you understand, right?”

 NO I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

When I would feel utterly confused by his actions and words he would tell me that he’s been clear. That he doesn’t understand why I feel confused.

The second time was shortly after we decided to have our first baby. I was about 6 months pregnant with our son and suddenly I heard the words “I need space.” It felt like the floor was falling out from under me. My suspicions were right and there was someone else. I should have left him then and never looked back. I spent 3 days on the floor of our bathroom. I barely slept or ate and actually started to drop so much weight while pregnant that my doctor was concerned. I was a complete mess. I waited for him to figure himself out. I did the “pick me” dance. I let him manipulate me yet again. This time I was more desperate than before because I so badly wanted my family to be happy and whole. During those waking hours of enlightenment he said things like “I don’t know what is wrong with you. I don’t know why you are trying to make me feel bad with all of this crying. I just want to be happy. Don’t you want me to be happy?” Add that to the confusing statements about not wanting to actually file for divorce and remain best friends with benefits. So eventually I decided to move on again. He ignored my pleading for counseling and insisted we didn’t need it and neither did he. I have been an individual counseling off and on for almost six years. Not necessarily because I have some massive thing to sort out—I just think it’s very healthy especially during times like this.

Then there was the third and last time. We decided to try for baby #2. We hit it out of the park with the first one and we wanted one more. Late in my pregnancy he came home talking all about his new coworker that he was training. More and more stories every day. My red flags started going up. I started to feel uncomfortable. I am not inherently a jealous person, but given our history I thought it was worth a conversation. He got angry and told me that it was absurd that he couldn’t have female friends. Our daughter was 2 weeks old and suddenly he “needed space” again. I lost my mind. Then I looked into my daughter’s eyes and thought about the example I wanted to set for my kids. I started to realize that he was never changing. That I was going to be one of “those women” that become this hollowed out empty shell of a person. One of those people that get their joy stolen by the toxic people in their life. Because I have so much joy. I am such a happy person and I am ecstatic to say that I have found my way back to that. A few days after he asked for space I found sext messages between him and his coworker that were just “friends.” This was about an hour after we had just been intimate. I finally asked him to leave. Demanded it actually. He refused to leave.

A few weeks go by of utter hell where I left my home and took my kids with me because I could not be around him anymore. I finally went back because it was a struggle with me and 2 little ones sleeping in one room. He still refused to leave. Over the last 7 months he has tried to manipulate me into emotionally staying. He said he wanted a divorce but kept feeding me the same lines about sex, friendship, and never filing. I finally emotionally left. I checked out. I pulled away. I got all of the necessary paperwork for divorce and am filing with my lawyer in the next few weeks. He has complained at me every step of the way. He has tried to make me feel inadequate about everything from being a wife, a mother, and anything else he can think of. When that doesn’t work or get a rise out of me he tries to compliment me and be overly positive then comes the affection. He has gotten drunk multiple times and made unwanted sexual advances that have left me in tears. He has been in contact with countless women to fill whatever void that he has. Most recently he has said “when are you getting a better job so I don’t have to pay so much in child support?”

I am angry about all of it. Angry about the lying, the cheating, the inability to be a decent partner and the ease he feels about destroying any potential home our children would have had. Over the last few months I have quickly realized how much he was controlling me. I gave in to his every whim because I wanted to make him happy. He got out of any responsibility by simply saying he doesn’t like doing X,Y, and Z. Guess what?! Sometimes I don’t want to adult either! But we’re adults! At least one of us is. It got so bad that I realized I was doing everything and I was doing it with a smile because I just wanted to be happy and I wanted him to be happy. But I was so alone and so broken.

I feel relieved that I have broken free, but I am bitter an angry about all of the scars it has left me with. I am angry about all of the things I gave up. I gave up an internship in Prague, Spain, and at the White House. I postponed law school so we could have kids. Looking back I cannot help but feel like he chose to try and control me thought I essentially would never leave once we had children. It was a matter of weeks after he cheated the first time that he wanted to start trying for a baby. My kids are my world and it is a privilege to be their mother. I love every moment with them. But I hate him for tainting so much of my life.

If you’ve gotten this far, thank you. I just needed to get it out. I needed to say it. Now I am going to go to the gym, I’ll continue to process, and feel grateful that I have broken free and will NEVER go back to that kind of relationship again.

I don’t know what I’d do without this sub. Thanks for the free therapy, guys! "

Looking for some guidance.",LaidOffAndLost,cscareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareers/comments/5nftei/company_downsized_and_i_was_laid_off_only_have/,"A bit of backstory, I am an older programmer who went back to school and got my CS degree after being in the military.  During my last year in school I got an internship as a QA engineer at a relatively small company that no one has heard off.  What they were doing with their product was really cool, and I thought it would get bigger, so I signed on full time when I graduated as an Associate Software Engineer.

I was put on a team that was trying to port their established windows product over to Android.  I don't want to reveal too much, but the product was basically a way to virtualize applications on a computer or mobile device without the app taking up all the space it normally would.  It utilized cloud technology to deliver data to the device on an as-needed basis.  So it basically saved space at the expense of network, but it wasn't pixel streaming.

The stuff I got to work on and learn were:

1) Getting to know the details about Android APKs and OBBs, including how they were built with Gradle and the Android Build Tools, APKtool and the like.

2) Converting shell scripts into Gradle scripts.

3) Developing an invisible system-level Android app for installing/uninstalling apps and some lower-level JNI-calls.

4) Creating a GUI wrapper for all of our scripts in Java Swing.

5) Spot debugging windows code in C++ when our team found something amiss.

Unfortunately the company had to downsize and since my team was mostly R&amp;D and we hadn't secured a customer yet most of my team was laid off.  So now I have a couple years of experience in... a few different things that not a lot of people are looking for.  I am not really sure what kind of job would be looking for someone like me, and if I should just ""start over"" at another entry level position so I can build a better foundation in C# or front-end stuff.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated."

5ngirv,36,2017-01-11,It's long overdue but here is my story,Olechranon,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/5ngirv/its_long_overdue_but_here_is_my_story/," Early life

           My family goes back multiple generations of Jehovahs Witnesses. My mom became inactive when she was eighteen years old. During this time she went to college for nursing and married my dad at twenty years old. A year later I was born while my parents were twenty one years old. My mom dropped out of college while my dad continued to go to school and work full time. During this time my mom worked days and my dad worked nights. A couple years later my mom started to go back to the meetings. It started out very spread out and not often. My dad never started studying and never became a Jehovahs Witness. 

 Teenage Years

            Years go by and my family turns out to be just like any other Jehovahs Witness family. I have a brother and sister now we live in a decent house and everything seemed fine. It didn't really bother me being a Jehovahs Witness but I did feel like I never fit in. We would get to the Kingdom Hall thirty minutes early and I would just sit in my seat until it started and then when it was done I would sit in there for thirty more minutes while my mom talked to other people. My mom almost forced me to be friends with other people my age from the kingdom hall but all I wanted to do was hang out with kids from school.

 The Divorce

           My parents got a divorce when I was 13, my sister was 8 and my brother 7. My dad divorced my mom because of her being a Jehovahs Witness. It was really hard on all of us. My dad moved around a lot after that and I had to grow up and help take care of my siblings as my mom took it really tough. We had to move to a smaller house and my mom started looking at everything as a blessing from Jehovah. 

 Late Teenage years

           My dad finally settled and found a new wife. She is the biggest bitch in the world but that is another story. I wasn't very close with my dad anymore just because we only saw him every other weekend, I was definitely a mommas boy. My mom started taking the truth very seriously when I was around 17-18 years old. She married a ministerial servant and we started having saturday service at our house and having family study every week and watching all the jw.tv things. I finally had friends in the Kingdom Hall but these friends were brothers and one of them went off to bethel after pioneering and the other was pioneering. I felt I wasn't doing enough and whenver I went out in service I was asked about baptism so I soon made the biggest mistake of my life and that was getting baptized. I was 17 almost 18 when I got baptized and I was happy I was baptized for about the rest of the convention and once that was over I knew I messed up.

Teenage years Chapter 2:

       I did an ama on casual conversation about a year after being baptized. I did it as a last ditch effort to save my faith. You guys bombarded and I tried I really did to try my best and prove that what I was doing was right and I thought it would help my faith but all it did was justify what I already knew and that was I didn't want to be a Jehovah's Witness anymore. Now my whole family is witnesses so it wasn't something that I could just do so I put it off and just faked it and thought I could just do that forever. In may of 2015 I asked a girl I worked with on a date and she said yes. She knew that I was a witness and what that entailed. About a month in I told her I couldn't be a witness anymore and how scared I was. We kept our relationship a secret until August 17th, 2015 when I told my mom what was going on. 

 Aftermath

          I told my mom what was going on on August 17th, 2015 which was a Monday. On Friday I was kicked out and I went and moved in with my dad and stepmom. Not being close with my dad and hating my stepmom we butted heads and I was kicked out of there three months latter. I then went and moved in with my girlfriends parents. My girlfriend was away at college around an hour away so it was just me and her parents. I was going to school too while all this was going on at a small tech school. Her parents treated me amazingly. I lived there for the rest of the school year until my girlfriend and I got our own apartment after the school year.

 present day

         Hopefully this will fill in any holes and just some thing I feel like adding. I am now 21 years old my brother and sister who still live with my mom are 15 and 14. I have seen my mom once in the last year and a half and that was to grab my birth certificate. I am trying to have a good relationship with my dad and stepmom who have two girls now ages 3 and 1. The only reason I go there is to see them and my older siblings too. I am still with my girlfriend and we live in a small town outside of the twin cities. I work 50 hours a week while going to school full-time and I get my associates degree in software engineering this spring. I am trying to get a internship or job after this spring as I want to show my family what I can do and how I can do this without them. I am happy with where I am in life and what the future holds for me.

I appreciate anyone that read the whole thing and I hope it wasn't to bad of grammar or writing as it isn't my strong suit. I appreciate all of you and if you have any questions or anything you want to add just let me know.

5ngmzk,7,2017-01-11,"Anxious - Young and ""successful"" person known for career growth...Just started a terrible job",lcbb42099,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5ngmzk/anxious_young_and_successful_person_known_for/,"Hi. 

The quick of it:  At 21 I had my first temp job at a startup in NYC. It was awful. 

Then, I got an internship at one of the most prestigious brands in the world, and then a full time job with them at age 22 in NYC. 

At 23, I was recruited by larger conglomerate company. This job was super corporate, it was fine, I was there for 10 months, at the same time I was recruited by another luxury brand I love.  I turned 24, I decided that this brand being small, would be a great opportunity to grow and own more things, although not entirely matching my current job/past job descriptions.

I've been at this job now (for under a month) and it's BAD. The systems are messed up, the job scope is bad, the processes are all manual. I've presented to my boss on ways to streamline the job, but I have little faith these changes will even be made. (unless I strap myself to my desk for all hours of the day and push a team in office in a different country to make them. The hours here are AWFUL) The company is so small that there is NOWHERE to move into.

I'm EXTREMELY anxious. Everyone that knows me knows my past and the work I've done and also that i've been at two large companies now. Leaving very early to me would look like i'm flakey, all my references from my first job would lose faith in me, and all of my former coworkers and classmates would question me. These jobs have been a lot of my identity thus far because I'm so young. I was also only at my last job for 10 months, which is the kicker here to me as well. I could've stayed out the year, but I thought this opportunity would be IT.

I'm so anxious it makes me sick to think about all of this. I go to work and I'm kind've in a panic mode about how I won't be able to stay out the year there.. 


Any advice?

5nh9ws,2,2017-01-11,Survivor Borneo Rewatch (SPOILERS),FantasyPNTM,survivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/5nh9ws/survivor_borneo_rewatch_spoilers/,"I'm working a full-time internship this semester, so I've decided to rewatch every season of Survivor. I've already seen them all, of course, but some are foggier than others and I just need some Survivor in my life.

Spoilers ahead (I'm on mobile)

Let's start with the gameplay:
I felt like this season had a lot of potential for gameplay, but it never went anywhere. So many people (Gretchen, Colleen, other Pagongers) had such great perceptive skills and really understood what was happening around them, but they didn't DO anything about it. It was clear that the experience was meant as an adventure to some and a game to others, but ultimately I don't think the relative lack of gameplay detracted from the overall season.

Let's talk about the location. Borneo was absolutely beautiful. Those sunrises and sunsets were just DAMN! I felt like the contestants had it pretty easy, honestly... seeing how little other castaways get in the future, the two tribes made out from the marooning like bandits! Too bad there wasn't much TAPIOCA.

The challenges: A lot of these challenges were clunky, if we are being completely honest. ""The Survivor Witch Project"" felt hoaky, though "" I don't know"" definitely saved it, and I was surprised by the easiness (both physically and mentally) of the challenges. And I hate to say it, but without jeff's commentary (as long as it isn't incessant) the challenges were just kind of dull.

The cast: This is a character driven season, and these characters are what allow the season to succeed. We get a firm grasp on who everyone is, and I feel like they're all pretty fleshed out. Casting definitely succeeded in finding 16 headstrong leader-types for this first season, which might have rendered most of the pre-merge boots (BB, Joel, Stacey) a little dislikable. As always, there were a few standouts.

Rich: He really had an excellent grasp of social relationships, and is truly the father of the game. Honestly, I feel like his fishing abilities and work ethic greatly contributed to the formation of his alliance, but he most definitely deserved the win over Kelly.

Kelly- Kely was possibly the most complex character. Her conflict between right and wrong was interesting and at times frustrating, but her final tribal council performance just felt false. Rich truly pummeled her.

Rudy- well, he was honest. I think a lot of what Rudy said wouldn't fly today, but he was and clearly still is from a different generation. He wasn't malicious or oppressive: he merely had a different upbringing that didn't necessarily change the way he treated people, just how he thought of them. Great source of comedic relief, but to be honest I don't know how he's still alive. He seemed like he would croak any second 17 years ago.

Sue- I didn't realize how likeable and intelligent Sue was until the rewatch. She really had her finger on the pulse of what was going on, and I felt like she was perhaps the second most deserving of the Tagi 4 for the win. That final speech was iconic, and I couldn't help but feel sad for Sue, who really loved living on the island and thought she had made such a strong bond with Kelly.

Sean- absolute doofus.

Colleen- Perhaps my favorite survivor contestant of all time. Such a shame that she didn't want to (not that she couldn't) play the strategic game. She was so witty, and bright, and funny and just shone throughout the entire season. So glad she's been able to live a happy life outside of the spotlight.

Gervase/Jarvis/gervis/gervace- Moo

Jenna- I didn't remember how peppy Jenna was on this season! That incessant talking was sort of grating, but she was a good egg.

Greg- He was honestly too intelligent for this game. What he wanted from the experience conflicted with the nature of the game of Survivor, but he was still exciting to watch and such an enigmatic character.

Gretchen- Would love to see Gretchen return. One of the purest and kindest contestants in Survivor history.

A few dull moments might have dimmed the season, which seems like a totally different show to today's ""BIG MOVEZ"" iteration, but overall the arc of the show was really interesting to watch.

5nhtv1,80,2017-01-12,Meet Debbie Diva,LadyLlamaDrama,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5nhtv1/meet_debbie_diva/,"Hello there ladies (and llamas). I've been lurking for almost a year at this point, reading through your stories and getting my daily fix of crazy. It's been incredibly refreshing to realize that I'm not the only one with MIL issues. Mine stem back just about six years when I started dating my D(ear)H. He truly is the sweetest, kindest, most wonderful man - some days I'm not quite sure where he gets it from. Which brings me to my point: allow me to introduce Debbie Diva. 

On our first date, my DH told me that his mom could be kind of crazy and hard to handle. I shrugged it off, I've dealt with plenty of crazy in my life. Our first few meetings were totally fine, Debbie Diva and I got along fine and while she wasn't overtly warm and fuzzy to me, she tolerated me and treated me nicely enough. The first time I saw her claws was when DH was offered an incredible opportunity through school - a several month long internship a few states away from home. At this point, DH and I had been together about six months, so the thought of going long distance was not super appealing to me. Debbie Diva immediately went on the offensive, touting how important it would be for DH's schooling and how this was such a wonderful opportunity for him. I never asked DH not to take the internship - I actually encouraged it. I knew it would be an awesome experience for him and that if we were meant to be, it would work out. DH on the other hand struggled mightily with this decision and really waffled back and forth for a while. In the end, he agreed, and he decided to move three states away. 

All is well in the world for about five minutes. Easter holiday is coming up, and DH gets a break to come home. This was our first holiday where we were a serious couple and we knew that we'd need to split it between my family and his. Debbie Diva made it extremely clear that she needed to know if we were coming for dinner so that she would know how many to cook for (as if 2 people really changes the plans that much). So I told her that as soon as my family figured out our plans, I'd let her know. My dad is a cardiologist and he was scheduled to be on call for the holiday, so our plans were very tentative. Debbie Diva asked continuously over the weeks prior to Easter. DH just kept telling her that our plans weren't set in stone but we would let her know as soon as they were. 

We finally decided that we would eat dinner at Debbie Diva's house and then go to spend time with my family afterward. Before DH could get in contact with her to tell her that, she texted him that 'he'd better figure it out soon or there wouldn't be place settings for us at their table'. I instantly put my foot down. I told him to tell her that in that case we would be spending the holiday with my family. That completely pulled the rug out from under her as I'm sure she expected me to beg to be included. Little did she know that I don't play those reindeer games. DH and I had a lovely dinner with my family while Debbie Diva pouted with FIL and their neighbors. 

After dinner, DH began feeling guilty and said that he thought he really should get home to see his family. I walked him out to his car and he said 'I never realized holidays could be like that.' I looked at him and said 'Like what?' He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said 'Fun.' Ya'll. All I could do was hug him. It was my first true warning as to how fucked up the next several years were going to be - and BOY did they ever get fucked up. I have some LOVELY stories for your llamas that I'll be writing down and posting for you. Stay tuned and thanks for reading - it feels so good to get it off my chest! "
5ni8n6,1,2017-01-12,"My girlfriend (20F) feels she cannot tell her controlling, emotionally abusive parents about me (19M) and our relationship (on/off for 10 months = 7 months then 3 months).",Blawdfire,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ni8n6/my_girlfriend_20f_feels_she_cannot_tell_her/,"**TL;DR**: Girlfriend has controlling, emotionally abusive parents who aren't accepting of our relationship - or even the fact that she's talking to me. I haven't done anything to deserve this opinion - beyond being a poor boyfriend in a long-distance relationship months ago (we both agree I've addressed that issue). She doesn't have the strength to confront them directly, but is having issues lying to them about the fact that we're with each other. She's stuck feeling like there's no solution, and I think the only solution is to confront them directly, tell them how it is, let them get angry, and deal with it - even if that means cutting them off, because this is an issue more about her freedom as an adult than our relationship. I'm trying to be patient, supportive, and helpful, but it's difficult given that she doesn't seem capable of helping herself and appears to be considering ending our relationship instead of confronting the real problem. Any advice?

**Quick summary of our past**: We both go to college together and we first started dating last February. My first encounters with her parents were super positive - I was certain that they, and her siblings, really liked me. Over this past summer, we went back to our hometowns and this became a temporary long-distance relationship. I failed pretty spectacularly at holding up my end of this, partially because I was working 45 hrs/wk in a new internship in a new city, mostly because I was an oblivious idiot and started taking the relationship for granted.

When we returned to school, we were on and off; she would want a break, then we would get back, then break up, then back, etc. (this happened 3-5 times over 2 months). I was devastated thoughout this because it was clear in my mind that we still had a thing for each other. Eventually she broke up with me, but she left the door open and I made it clear how much she meant to me. Several weeks later, she came back and asked if I wanted to try again - turns out her family and friends were pushing for a breakup and it was never what she really wanted. I said yes of course, and we've been pretty happy with each other ever since.

---

Here's where the problem comes in - her mother gets upset with her because she chose to turn down a suitor who had been pursuing her during the downturn of our relationship and had asked her out when we were no longer together. This resulted in her mother acting childish and irrational - demanding my girlfriend call every day, then refusing to answer the phone and later getting upset at her for not calling; this was only one of many irrational, childish, and abusive acts - also including name calling, demanding she stop talking to her (actually supportive) ""unsupportive"" friends, and spreading misinformation to the rest of her family such that they would also be upset with her.

Eventually, this was sorted out(ish). Her mother still appeared to be upset, but would talk to her and their relationship improved. However, her mother continued asking about me and whether or not I would come and hang out with her and our mutual friend group. Then comes winter break - my girlfriend and I still want to make the effort to see each other over the break, so she agrees to tell her parents about us and see what happens. She puts this off indefinitely, she eventually tells them we're ""talking"" when we agree to see each other to exchange Christmas gifts. Her mother's reaction was to say nothing and walk away.

We met at a mall roughly halfway between us - the plan was to get lunch. On the drive there, her mother calls and starts screaming about how deceitful she's being and how she's to be back home house within the hour. We exchange gifts, talk about how this is pretty much the only time we'll see each other, and cry a bit. She leaves, and when she gets home her mother takes her phone away - only to give it back 4 days later on the condition that she's not to talk to me. We still talked, but it was always texting during the day and calling at night when her parents were in bed.

---

**Aside regarding her family**: Her family is really, really close. Like insane, unhealthy close. They do literally everything together, her mom makes her watch movies with her (pretty much all day) when she's home and they even appear to refuse to run errands without dragging my girlfriend along with them (they'll put them off until she can come - this is just trivial stuff like returning something and going grocery shopping). My girlfriend really doesn't enjoy her time at home. Now that she's back at school, her mother still requires that she call her once a day, and her family requests she text them every day. Her mother's the worst - her father has no guts and just gives in to what her mother wants and they've raised their children to accept everything she says as gospel. It's clear that her mother has the expectation of her being a perfect human being - and gets angry when my girlfriend makes a decision that she disagrees with.

---

We're back at school now; we saw each other for the first time in weeks just last night. She really wants to talk to me about a number of things that are bothering her - mostly how she can't handle lying to them about us still (obviously) being in contact. She recognizes that it's absurd that her mother thinks she can control who she talks to, but it seems like she thinks our relationship is a problem until she can handle her mother.

Here's what I'm asking - we're clearly both very passionate for each other. I love her. She loves me. There's no question there. She needs to figure out how to handle her parents, and I don't think she's strong enough to confront them directly. We're talking about everything that's bothering her tomorrow night, so I'll have more to work with then, but I don't know how she can approach this best. 

It's gotten to the point where she's unable to sleep and is having anxiety attacks (which her mother gets upset at her about, of course). Our school provides counselling, which might be helpful but she's gone in the past and I don't think she wants to go again (she has trouble opening up to people she isn't close to). I think she feels stuck, but it's clear that she can't let her parents dictate who she is and how she lives her life."
5niepw,1,2017-01-12,I [25 M] met with my Ex [ 23 F] after half an year away and she gives A LOT of MIXED SIGNALS,PocketTennis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5niepw/i_25_m_met_with_my_ex_23_f_after_half_an_year/,"Hello Reddit!
There is a lot of text, so if you want to know all the details, please read the whole thing. I tried to write down all the things i think might be relevant.

So, here‘s the thing:

Me and my ex broke up half an year ago and a little bit after that she went abroad for studying. 
I initiated the breakup by asking that we should talk about where we both are in the relationship. The reason for the breakup was that she wanted to do something on her own at last, because she had always been dependent on other people and didn′t want to occupy her thoughts with what′s going on back home (Meaning she wanted to have sex with other men and be more adventurous). I said that if she does not want the same as me (which was having a clear way to identify what we both are) it would be hard to stay friends and that it‘s better to stop seeing each other. This came out of the blue for her. I was also sure that she would have broken up with me shortly before going abroad for the same reason I mentioned above (which she actually also said was true, but did not say how she intended to do it). 

**Some background on the girl:**

She has always been very polite, but she would many times say nothing concerning very important things, such as „where do we stand in this relationship“ and things of the sort. She would mostly wait until somebody starts talking about this stuff. If she DOES initiate a conversation about something of the sort, she would feel very bad and sad about it, I guess because she wants to be liked by everyone ant that by saying things more directly she might hurt somebody. This is another thing about her – she finds it hard to say „No“. She likes to meet people and have a lot of friends. Also, she is not really the Social media type – she does post things on Facebook, but rarely and mainly a Photo or two of her with some friends posing at something. Still, she IS very social. When meeting people she would always show interest and ask about the person. In this case though, 30 % of the time this Interest is genuine and not simply being „nice“. With this I mean that she would ask how are you doing, and if she remembers something about a thing you mentioned at one point, she would ask you about it. 

During her time abroad we texted from time to time, she being the one to initiate it. We kept things short, we wrote every week or two, both of us answering sometimes on the same day, sometimes two weeks later, neither of us explaining any details about the things we are doing. 

She was gone for 5 Months, but she recently came back. I met her three times already. The first and the second we were not alone, there were other people aroung – both times at her home. The first time I had to bring her mother some stuff because I give her some Computer lessons, the next time she invited me to a „I am back again“ party – nothing big, just some cake, soft drinks and music. 

Both of these times she would give me A LOT of signs. She would sit next to me, she would ask me what i would like to drink and would pour it for me in my glass, she would help me wear my jacket on, look at me and smile and so on. Still, we didn′t have time to talk one on one about anything really. Still, this could have been simply her being nice. 

Of course, I saw the way she was acting as a possibility for hooking up or starting to date again and asked her on a text a couple of days later to go and grab a Coffee. She said yes and two days later we met at a very nice Coffee shop. 

My Idea about the whole meeting was to talk about how it the last five months she was not there. I didn′t want to start talking about the whole relationship thing and ask her uncomfortable things, because I know that she would never answer in a direct manner and that when a girls knows what the guy wants to hear, she would say it in a way that it could  mean two opposite things. 

So as I said, I wanted to do some catching up and if she remotely mentions something about the two of us to also talk a little bit about that. 

The whole atmosphere was nice, also she laughed a lot, mainly because I could always make her laugh.
I asked her to describe her time abroad it in two words. She found that difficult, so I told her three words is also OK. She laughed. The first word was tiring, the second one I forgot, but the third word was „Full of events“ which is one word in the language we both speak. She then smiled a little bit and looked at the celling. I repeated the word playfully, but she just lightly bit her lips, just for a second and said nothing more.

I asked her about her stay abroad, the places she visited, how it was compared to what she knew before that, how the visits by her friends went, how was Christmas and new year and so on and so on.
She asked NOTHING about what I did in the last five months, how the wedding of my best friend was, which she knew about, how my internship was, which she also knew about, how my stay back home was (because I am a foreigner). I found that funny and it was the first thing that started making the whole thing a little bit unpleasant. Still, I carried on as if nothing had happened.

I didn′t want to start directly with touching her in any ways, because it was the first time we saw each other alone for a long time. She would always be kind of on the edge of the couch we were sitting on. At times our legs would touch a bit and she would not react on it. One time she joked and i poked her with my finger in her hand. At one point when she was showing me a photo on her phone I used this opportunity to place myself better on the couch, so when she puts her phone back in her purse our legs would touch a little bit more. The moment they touched she moved her leg away from mine while continuing to talk. 

If she did ask me something, which was not really that often and if she did ask, it was more like „how are studies?“ „how′s my mom doing in her computer lessons“ she would look at different parts of my body, being my hands, my arms, my hair, my shoulders, neck and so on while I was talking. I also talked about that me and two other girls, one of which she knows, study together four days in the week at the library. Also she knows that I am leading a University group, where at this point there are a lot of attractive girls. Actually at this specific University group me any my ex started dating (before I got to lead it). 

At one point a couple entered the Coffee shop and I thought that I knew the guy, so I started looking in his direction.My ex noticed that and she did that as well, but for less time and was trying to hide it. I guess she thought I was looking at the girl. I did this a couple of more times on purpose and she repeated it as well. A couple of minutes later she said she had to go to the Restroom. On the way there I think she took a look at the girl in question. 

I was thinking about leaving soon, so I asked her when she had to go, because the way I know her, she was always having plans for everyday, weeks beforehand. She said she still had time and that she could stay a little bit longer. 

Until then the way the whole conversation went down, there was no easy way asking about more personal things without being too direkt and potentially making her uncomfortable or making me too curious about things, which for THIS kind of meeting I think was not a good idea. 

While she was talking how living with three other girls in an apartment was not so pleasant I jokingly said „Now I see why your time abroad was so „full of events““. Again, she said nothing, just kind of twisted her lips a little bit. 

Just before leaving she asked me if I still had contact with a female friend of ours who is also abroad at this point. We are both friends with this girl, which if I had to guess, likes me better and contacts me more than my ex. Also, she was the first to learn about us starting to date and then breaking up. Also I must note that I see this girl as a friend only and that we haven′t seen each other for five months as well. I said yes, I do still have contact with her, and that we also sent each other presents for Christmas. She said cool, that′s nice. I guess she asked because she was curious if I have been asking that girl about her. 

We left the Coffee shop, we hugged each other and I told her we should meet again at some point and that I′ll call her. She asked me if I will be on two specific small circle events which she was also attending. I said that I would be at one of them, about the other one was not sure. 

Then she said: Ok, so we′ll maybe see each other tomorrow (event one); if not, on Sunday (event two) if not - at some point after that. I answered playfully „Maybe“, we both said Bye and continued home. 

**TL;DR: Met ex after her being abroad for half an year, first two times very short with other people, with LOTS of positive signals, which still might have been her simply being nice, third time at a Coffee shop for a couple of hours, nice and fun atmosphere, she would try to avoid physical contact, would not ask me anything about what I′ve been doing the last few months, and says some vague things.**

Guys, I have my own take on the whole situation. While writing this text I have also had the chance to analyze the whole thing on another level. But still, I′ll be happy to see what you have to say.

And please, no „One word answers“ or „Forget her“. If so, please explain yourself at least a little bit.

Edit: Formating and 1 sentence explaining there is a lot of text"

No one intervenes. I'm furious, but am I in the right?**


Hi everyone! 
Sorry this is going to be long.



I really need some advice on a situation that took place at a birthday party last night.
 
I've been with my boyfriend for a month now, after dating for 2 months, and last night I was supposed to meet his friends. 
It was his best (female, not that it matters) friend's birthday party.

They are going away with 30 other people  (SOs included) to a cabin in another state this weekend to celebrate her birthday. 
We had a conversation earlier this week about how I completely understand that I  wasn't invited to that, as I'm such a new girlfriend, *but* didn't like that he basically lied to me saying that he wasn't bringing me because 'the rooms had been blocked weeks earlier '. When I came across a Facebook post that basically told me that wasn't true I asked him what the deal was.
And mind you, like I said, I'm fine not being invited this early into a relationship but I didn't like him not giving it to me straight but instead lying about it.


But anyway, we talked it out, everything's aok. So a couple of days later he tells me the same friend is going to have a little birthday party in our city (the one we went to last night) and he'd like me to come and meet everyone.  

Ok sure, I'll come! 

Now to the issue ; the day before he mentions his ex is probably going to be there in a very offhand manner. 
I was like, umm look, I'm not sure that's the kind of situation I'd want to meet your friends in. Small party, maybe 10 people around a table all of whom I've never met. And his ex.
All of who work in the same field (advertising) and are coworkers and friends. I'm in the medical field fwiw.

He said to please come, she probably wouldn't even show, his friends were going to love me. 
I said I was worried it would need an awkward situation know top of meeting his friends and that I was a little worried they'd just talk job and I'd be an outsider.


But honestly, I'm an eternal optimist and I thought, nah this is all going to turn out just fine. I'm good with people, I'm friendly and I'm enough of an adult to nicely kill an ex with kindness if need be.


Boy, this time optimism came back to bite me. 

Not only was she already there when we got there, his best friend specifically brought her as his plus one, she was sat right next to me and I was at the end of a bench. With my boyfriend across from us and all of his friends on the other side of her. 
I had no way of placing myself anywhere else so I was stuck. 

So I thought come on, put on your big girl panties and tried to make friendly conversation with her. Alright. Seemed to work. Then his best female friend came and squeezed in next to me to say hi, which was nice. 

The issue started right after. 
I don't expect anyone to ask me a lot of questions but they literally asked me ""what do you do?"" and I told them a little about it and that was it. No more interest in me as a person whatsoever. 
They talked about work the entire night.
Fine, I could have just brought myself into the conversation, except I did, only to be ignored if I did anything but ask about pr accounts. 
Not the greatest start,  but the real issue was that his ex had apparently decided she needed to mark her territory. 
So (since they all worked together for years) she started 

- literally directing a flurry of inside jokes (some of which I thought were his and mine :( ) at my bf

- talking over me every time I try to say something to follow up with some ""Hey ex bf do you remember that awesome time when...?"" Thing

- kept mentioning how his parents were, how she was such good friends with his best friends, how she hangs out with them aaaalllll the time

- kept saying how she was the best intern at their former office and not one of those girly girls (sideeye over to me) which was why they could put her in the same office as my bf and his friends because she just gets their ""man- humor"".

- kept asking me ""has he told you this or that yet??"" Or ""you know how he always...""
Or ""oh, you *don't* know about that time when/thing he does????here let me tell you""

Honestly, it was torture. I refused to just get up and leave after 10 minutes so I sat through over 3 hours of this, literally being nothing but nice, while my bf and his 2 best friends looked on and even engaged with ""yes that was totally awesome, oh yes I  do that *alll the time* 


When we left he almost went off with them after I said I had to go the other way (glad to finally be able to fucking run for it , I was) and didn't even offer to walk me to the subway until I kind of annoyed said ""Hey are you not going to walk me back?"" 

I was incredibly upset with him and told him so immediately when we git back (at this point we'd both had a little to drink, it being a party) and so I was quite emotional and probably meaner then need be, but he kept saying that yes it was shitty (even though he also said ""come on, 2slothalicious4you, she didn't really say anything against you, it wasn't that bad!"") but that he had no fault in it, and neither did his 2 best friends. 

I on the other hand am upset with him because at any point could he have just interrupted the long-ass stroll up memory lane but he didn't and even engaged , his best male friend who brought the ex (bf says, well of course he did, they're friends!) and also his female bestie, because she was also watching the whole thing unfold and didn't put a stop to it (bf says: it's not her fault, she had only known me for half an hour why would she defend me) 

Reddit, am I  overreacting????

I'm honestly furious. I feel like I was humiliated in front of people I was supposed to officially meet, I feel like I handled the situation with as much grace as I could muster, and I'm upset and confused why his friends would think this was a good idea or not diffuse the situation. Like my only way out would have been to literally get up and leave, which I feel would have been even more humiliating. 


I did not handle the argument with my bf with grace, I'll admit to that. 
He kept alternating between ""it wasn't so bad"" and ""if it was it wasn't my fault"" and was super concerned with defending his buddies. 
He never even asked how I felt. His apologies were all verbatim ""Sorry, but it wasn't my/our fault""
I honestly felt like I was losing my mind! 


I said, I'd want him to clear up things with his buddy who brought the ex and find out why he thought it was such a good idea  
I also feel like him going on this weekend trip with these friends  ( ex isn't coming but would have been invited) 2 days after what I perceive as a major slight happened is kind of a slap in the face for me and shows me where his priorities lie. 
(I was stupid enough to drunkenly cryingly tell him that if I was more important to him he wouldn't go. I know...idiotic)

But his response...he said he doesn't want to upset his friend. I understand that and I also understand that him backing out of the trip wouldn't lessen my discomfort but at no point was he worried  about upsetting me. 

I woke up so upset this morning I literally didn't go to work. 
I look at him and all the little things we shared i thought were unique cutesy quirks suddenly turn out to be just a lukewarm remake of what he had with his ex of 4 months(!). I hate that she got under my skin like that but it makes me feel sick to my stomach and I honestly look at the relationship differently now. I'm a little insecure but usually I feel pretty good about myself. I'm not bad looking, I'll be an MD in a few months, I have my tattoos, which I love and generally a very 'tough girl' vibe going, but I feel.so small right now. 

He kept telling me how I'm the most import thing for him but ""he's not going to ditch his friends "" .like, fucking what dude, when did i ever ask you to do that?
He says if he doesn't go on the weekend we won't be able to hang out with his buddies ever again because they're going to be upset, yet when I said I'm not sure *I* want to hang out with them again he was totally taken aback as to why I'm upset.

I also should say, I don't think my friends would have thought it a good idea to specifically bring an ex of mine to a thing where they KNOW they'll be meeting my new SO and if they did, I'd have a longgggg talk with them. They welcomed my bf with open arms and asked him all about him. Also, if they had accidentally brought on such a situation I think they would have been mortified.



I honestly feel like breaking up with him over this. She's not going anywhere, from the looks of it I'm going to have to bite the fucking bullet every time because he and his friends are going to let her walk all over me. 

He doesn't seem to understand why I'm upset, nor does he seem to care about me being upset vs. potentially aggravating his friends (which of course I don't want either!)


I really don't know what to do.
I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, but this really hurt and I feel awful about myself&amp; the situation. 



He kept hugging me and going ""you're so important to me but it's not my fault and there's nothing I can do, also Anna (his friend) is not at fault!!!!"" 


Help!


**TL;DR Boyfriend of a month's ex gfs uses me as scratching post in front of all his friends who I just met. No one intervenes. I'm furious, but am I in the right?**



**UPDATE** **from the comments 
Little update. He has apologized but also asked me to apologize, because I said some nasty things during our fight. I of course did. He maintains that it was a bad thing but says I need to get over it.
I requested he remove her from Facebook because I do not want her to be that involved in our lives. He said no. Now she makes a point to like everything and make sure I know she sees me. I feel very weird about this. He says to not let it bother me, yet won't remove her. He says if I grew a decent self-esteem it wouldn't bother me.
This whole thing is starting to give me anxiety.**

5nir4i,3,2017-01-12,35M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5nir4i/35m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
5niw5g,3,2017-01-12,Help me escape the poor film student stereotype! (investment/savings advice needed),AFlyingAmigo,PersonalFinanceNZ,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceNZ/comments/5niw5g/help_me_escape_the_poor_film_student_stereotype/,"Kia Ora!
I am a recently-turned 19 year old student, and I am trying to sort out the next five years of my life financially. However, I am in a bit of a different situation than the average NZ student:

From a mixture of inheritance and my own personal savings, I have been able to attend tertiary education without any student loans required. I have just entered the second year of my two year course at a rather well renowned film and television production school (from which I will receive a bachelor of Media Communications, with a major in Screen and Television Production). From this I have been guaranteed a six month paid internship (on the condition that I pass this years course). The school boasts a reputation for holding a 95% job offer rate that comes from these internships. If all goes according to plan, I am going to continue to work for the media or communications company I am assigned to for the next 2-3 years after my internship, continuing to live at home with my family in order to maximize savings (by avoiding standard rent, food costs, power bills etc).

From there is where I make my big decision. My big goal is to set myself up abroad (preferably in the U.S., Canada, England or Japan) and begin working in a more diversified media market, with more opportunities. However, my finances will weigh heavily on this decision, as I will have to support my travel expenses, as well as be able to establish living accommodations and a job from my own savings, while being able to continue to support myself financially.

This all being said, I would like to know what my best options are in terms of acquiring the finances that I need, without taking any loans. Am I in a better position to invest my finances down the road and continue to work in NZ? And is there anything that I can do now or during my first few years of work to give me the most financial benefit (investing etc.) 

I have very slim knowledge on taxes, however, I have estimated that the job market I will come to work in houses an average income of 40k a year, with a 17.5% personal income tax (if my math is wrong here, please let me know). 

So, after saying all of this, please help me escape the 'poor film student' nightmare that plagues me! Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"
5njaso,5,2017-01-12,"Am I really learning or just being ""tricked"" that I am learning?",rexonology,arduino,https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/5njaso/am_i_really_learning_or_just_being_tricked_that_i/,"This is gonna be a extremly, and purposefully, critical post about the Arduino. Im just gonna say that Im addicted to the arduino and am grateful that it had introduced me to the world of electronics. These are just nagging thoughts in my head which I wish werent there XD.

It all started out with the Arduino Starter kit. I was amazed that just by typing a few lines of words and connecting some wires I could make motors move and LCD screens light up. Things that I thought were soooo complicated could be achieved so easily with the extensive amount of libraries in the Arduino IDE that let me control servos effortlessly and achieve RF communication. Theres even WIFI boards like ""The Thing"" from sparkfun that allowed me to connect my Arduino as easily as cooking eggs.

Then one day, after spending a lot of my savings purchasing ""learning products"" that I thought would be a useful way to build up my engineering knowledge, I realised that all my knowledge was based around these products. They existed because someone invented these things that were specifically designed to be Easy to hook people onto using them?

Ive read around people saying that true engineers dont use Arduinos. And I cant help but grudgingly agree with them. Without the IDE and some pre made modules like WIFI boards, I wouldnt even be able to make a LED blink. Now I always have this feeling that my ""learning"" was in fact an illusion.

I know I am being overly critical here, but ultimately, I cant help but feel that Arduino, Sparkfun and Adafruit are all (understandbly) out to earn money at the end of the day. Have I just been brainwashed by their subtle advertising to make their products seem ""educational"" When they really are just designed to be easy to use and give us a false sense of accomplishment? Take those products away and it is as if I had not learnt anything at all. I know this is as ridiculous as saying ""Digital Artisits are all fake because without Adobe photoshop, they cant do anything"". But I just have the impression that the Arduino is an amateur product not really used in the real world anyway. And really passionate people wont bother with something as ""commercialised"" as the Arduino. Hence, contributing to my inner feelings that Im just wanting to believe that I am learning something useful when I really am just falling for their ""educational ""advertising.

Again, I know this post has been overly critical. Perhaps its because Im just worried I have wasted time and effort learning all these things. I am still in the process of self-learning C coding and eventually learning more about embedded electronics beyond the Arduino. But its really difficult finding a starting point as compared to the arduino. Plus with internships and school starting soon it seems like this will be particularly challenging.( I am determined though)

I don't think I like it here and would like some information about Software engineering. My biggest concern is where I will be hired if I stay at UCF vs. where I will be hired if I go to FGCU. My question is as follows: where can I get hired with a computer science degree vs. Software engineering? Do the schools differ that much? And of course how are the internships over at FGCU?

5njzaa,0,2017-01-12,Should I bother taking CPA exam in home state where I don't plan on working?,Mikehour1,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5njzaa/should_i_bother_taking_cpa_exam_in_home_state/,"I'm 26 and graduated already with a degree in business management from a sma state school in Connecticut. I'm going back to school in a week to get another bachelors in accounting that will only take me 1 year to complete.

My goal is absolutely trying to get into a big 4 firm but coming from a small school with no internship expierence i realize this to be unlikely. 

A big reason I'm interested in accounting is because there are oppurtunities everyone and I'm trying to get out of CT. Hartford and CT in general is awful. I'm not to picky in where I want to go, interested in Tampa, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and a couple other spots.

My question is simple really as the title stated. If I don't plan on working in CT should I graduate then move somewhere else right after to find a job and begin studying for CPA exam there? Or would I be better served finding a staff accountant postion in CT while taking the test and moving after I pass. The only thing that worries me is moving first without a job is very nerve racking and I wouldn't even know where to begin doing that.

Thanks for any input you may have !"
5nkkg1,113,2017-01-12,Debbie Diva and the first time she lost her mind (with me at least)...,LadyLlamaDrama,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5nkkg1/debbie_diva_and_the_first_time_she_lost_her_mind/,"Alright ya'll. I introduced you to Debbie Diva, now it's time to really feed your llamas. This was the first time that I experienced the depth of my MIL's specific brand of insanity and it hit me like a bitchslap to the head. I just didn't know that people could **be** like this. Of course that is until I started reading all of your stories and then realized that there are a **lot** of people like this! Alright. On to the story.

If you read my last post you know that DH had accepted an internship a few states away for school. While he was there, he started having some weird medical symptoms. Since my dad is a doctor, I ran them by him. He recommended that DH see a doctor just to be on the safe side. Now DH has **no** medical knowledge whatsoever, so he was strictly relying on my dad's recommendations. He goes to see a doctor near him and gets news that none of us were expecting. He has a mass in his neck. Well shit. Now I'm no doctor, but I know that lumps in places they shouldn't be are bad news bears. DH meanwhile is blissfully unaware. *It's only one mass. It's not that big. They don't seem that concerned.* I asked him to email his lab results to me so that my dad could review them. We found that DH actually had four masses. This was the point where I had a little mini panic attack because it doesn't take a doctor to figure out that DH probably has cancer. Keep in mind that DH is still STATES away and blissfully unaware of how big of a deal that this is. He wants to stay and finish his internship and seek medical care when he returns home. Dad and I know that this is not a good idea. 

So. Rather than call him and freak him out completely, I decide to call Debbie Diva and see if she can convince him to come home. That conversation went over like a lead balloon. I called and explained that after reviewing DH's test results, my dad really felt like it would be a good idea for DH to come home now to seek treatment. I told her that DH didn't really understand the seriousness of what was going on, and that myself and my father were concerned about DH's health and what could happen if he stayed the remaining four months of his internship. I said that my dad thought that this problem was most likely cancer and that it was probably going to require surgery and that it would likely be better for DH to have this done sooner rather than later. *Silence* Then... ""Well, I really think that it's important for DH to focus on his schoolwork right now. That's going to be very important for his future.""

*Um. Did this crazy person really just say that? Like did those words come out of her mouth?!*

So, while struggling to keep my crazy tamped down I said ""Well Debbie, I agree that his schoolwork is important and that this internship is a crazy good opportunity for him, but I really think that he needs to see a specialist and have treatment more than he needs to finish his internship.""

She disagreed with me. Ya'll we argued for over forty-five minutes about this. I wanted to scream **Well his schoolwork isn't going to mean much if he dies from cancer!**, but I didn't. I just let her keep arguing. Finally, when it was clear to me that we weren't going to get any further in this conversation, I said ""Well Debbie, we can agree to disagree, but I just want you to know that I'm going to call DH and recommend that he come home immediately."" She hung up on me.

Shit. Now I have to call DH, break the news to him that we think he has cancer, and tell him that I got into an enormous fight with his mom who believes that he should stay where he is and delay treatment for said cancer. 

*/deepbreath*

So I make the call and interrupt him at work. I explain to him what my dad thought and how at this point we think it's a good idea for him to come home and seek treatment immediately. I told him that I understood how important this internship was to him and that I understood what a fantastic opportunity it was, but at this point, his health was more important, and he needed to come home. DH agrees with me and says that he's got some stuff to figure out, but he'll look into coming home ASAP. I then tell him that I got into it with his mom. I explained what she said and how I countered it. He kind of just sighed and said ""Okay. I'll talk to her at some point I guess."" He hung up with me to go talk to his internship coordinator.

That night I talked to him again. His internship coordinator was beyond wonderful and arranged a flight for him the following week so he could get home as quickly as possible. Then came the first barb from Debbie Diva towards me. DH told me that when he called Debbie Diva, she told him that maybe he should listen to his mother instead of his ""failed nursing student"" of a girlfriend. (I left nursing school for personal hardship reasons). I asked him what he said back to her. He (ashamed) told me that he didn't really say anything back. That didn't surprise me; he's been trained from childhood not to go against her or what she says. This defiance thing was still new to him at that point. I shook it off and told him not to worry about it, that all I wanted him to worry about was packing and getting himself home - we'd worry about the rest when we got there.

Whew. That took a lot more time to type out than I thought. Sorry it was so long... This is only the beginning, but I'm going to take a break now because my fingers are starting to hurt lol. Until next time!

ETA: This happened years ago and DH is completely fine now. I'll be going through the nightmare that was his treatment, but I realized that I should let you all know that it turns out fine in the end - he's health as a horse now! :)"
5nkxqi,1,2017-01-12,New to this reddit! :) Anxiety Letter Part One,Galistor,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5nkxqi/new_to_this_reddit_anxiety_letter_part_one/,"Hey all!

This will be my first post on this subreddit, which has already been a helpful tool in my struggle and fight against anxiety. Recently, I've begun just writing out what is frustrating and annoying about anxiety and a little bit about my history. 

Not too sure who I'm writing to or who will be reading this, but my fiance had the awesome idea of posting them here to see if it might help anyone or insights could be had from it. 

Apologies for this first post will be really long, but it's just how this letter was written. Thanks all and maybe this'll help in some regard, who knows? 

----------

I struggle with anxiety.

Well, struggle might be a nice way of putting it. Struggling has the assumption that both sides win at some point during the struggle, which is technically the truth. There have been moments where my anxiety has been beaten and I have fought my way through it.

But, recently, it has felt like a one-sided affair, one that is hindering me and one that is changing how I view what to pursue. 
Anxiety never seemed to be something that was a huge issue. It was something that had always been around, but I always found some way to see past it or to push through the emotions that came with it. I vividly remember the first time I played drums for the college group at my previous church, for the entire week, I was a mess.

I was so nervous and overthinking everything that I tried to find ways to get out of it. Even on the day of, I was trying to find ways to move when I would play or just simply not having to think about it anymore. My parents, in that scenario, forced me to do it and were there every step of the way. By the time I got through practice, the anxiety melted away and it was all about music and playing drums, something that relaxes me and is comforting! 

But, in 2016, it became apparent that as I was getting older, my problems and struggles with anxiety would only increase and would change the decisions I made regarding jobs, careers, and locations. When I graduated from college, I had this plan of becoming a sports writer for the Oregonian, or finding some way to become the beat writer for the Portland Trail Blazers. 

As it became apparent that jobs in this field were lacking or simply not a comfortable opportunity, the anxiety began to shift into the greener-grass syndrome. I immediately began looking for jobs at places like Starbucks because I felt like I needed to work into the job force. My thinking was that I would start at the ground level at Starbucks and work my way up to become a manager. Only then, would I consider moving on to pursuing journalism as a full-time career. 

It seemed perfect, I could find my own place to live in Beaverton and take it slow, all while making money and moving up the ladder. That dream was shattered on my first day at Starbucks. It was a nightmare, a place that seemed to go against every bone in my body. But, I couldn’t explain it. There was nothing glaring or inherently wrong about the job, but something about it triggered every switch inside of me. 

I remember sitting in the back room doing my onboarding and it was around 3:00 in the afternoon. All of a sudden, I had this intense emotional surge and voices saying “You need to get out of here”, “I want to go home and crawl under a blanket”. At the time, I thought this was just Satan trying to get at me, which was definitely a part of it, but I didn’t notice how my body was reacting until later. 

My first shift was over and I went home that night hoping that it would feel better and that I would stop feeling so terrible. It got worse that evening, knowing that I would have to go back into that Starbucks. I bawled my eyes out, but it seemed less like sadness, and more just getting rid of a bunch of emotions and tension inside my body. It was a full-body anxiety/panic attack. The next day, I quit. It went against everything that I had learned growing up and against my character. 

But, it seemed like the best decision, as the anxiety went away and I felt like I got some clarity throughout the whole mess. Shortly thereafter, I got an internship at eBay that showed me that I could work a full-time job and that anxiety did not have to be a part of it. The people a part of the team I was in were terrific. Constantly making me feel like I was wanted and that I wasn’t just some intern who was going to leave in a week. It truly felt like I was a part of the team and that God had put me there to show me a good example of a working environment, something to strive for.  
There was talk that the internship could roll right into a contract or even full-time position at eBay, if things fell the right way. They did not and I remember feeling like I really didn’t want to leave at the end of the week. I wanted to come back and see these people and work with them on testing problems. It was an amazing environment!

Looking back now, after the internship, my brain switched to the greener-grass syndrome again and for the next seven months, I searched for jobs within the tech industry doing quality assurance work. It seemed obvious, I grew up in these working environments since I was a kid and it seemed fitting that I would follow my dad’s footsteps and work with computers and applications. 

Throughout the process, however, I began to struggle with not having a job right away. Throughout the summer, I started hating myself for not working hard enough to have a job already. There was always something more to do, at least in my head. I kept making unrealistic goals that I could never meet and assuming that the people close to me hated me or looked down on me and took pity.

I felt like I was a failure, I was getting close to my mid-20s and I was struggling with even finding a job. I was still living at home and figuring out what to do with all my free time. It was nerve-wracking; I cried every day and got angry at the world for not making it easy on me. Where did I go wrong? I went to college, graduated with a 4.0, and did everything right. What happened? 

It seemed that my prayers were answered in December when I accepted a job offer at a job in Wilsonville. It was a contract position that was going to stop in February, but it was quality assurance, and in a location that was moving closer and closer to the person I wanted to marry. Again, it seemed perfect and it seemed like something God put in front of me at just the right time.

However, this time around, my brain started throwing Starbucks into my head again, telling me that it was going to go horribly and that the first-day struggles would return. I fought through that with prayer and endurance. I didn’t want to judge something I hadn’t already done and I had more motivation. This would allow me to make money and start the journey towards marrying the person I loved with all my heart. 

The first day arrived, traffic was terrible and already my anxiety was ramping up. I started sorting through all the scenarios in my head about how these people were going to fire me for being late and how they were all going to be incredibly rude. So, I was already not in a good place. I arrived on time and began the process of getting included with the team and learning all that I needed to learn.

It was obvious I was tense; I was surprised that no one stopped me during the whole day and said “Are you okay?” It was that obvious and I was not doing a good job of hiding it. I seemed to be at a certain level of anxiety all day that I just began not to notice. But, at around 3:00, once again, it was like my brain switched to a fight-or-flight response. Immediately, I wanted to leave. I wanted to get out of there and not be in that place anymore.

It got worse after getting taking on a tour of the place and being told what I would be doing for them. It was way more than I expected, including the use of dangerous chemicals and understanding all the protocols that were extremely precise. My brain locked up, there was too much information and too many variables that I could mess up. I was done. I just wanted to leave. I remember thinking, “This was supposed to be a Software job! I’m not a lab technician!” When they said I would have to wear a lab coat at some points, I knew right then that this was far from the job description. 

I got home that night and surprisingly did okay. I was home, familiar surroundings, and was even eating some of my favorite food for dinner! But, I could tell as I went to bed that night that I was not okay. I cried like crazy when I was about to go to sleep. I couldn’t stop. The tears and emotions kept hitting me like bricks. I tried to go to sleep, but then I woke up again with tears streaming down my face. But, it was not sadness; it was like I was evacuating everything that had been built up all day.

I woke up the next morning feeling terrible. I was already shaking and trying so hard not to lose it in front of anyone. I got my lunch ready and as I was about to leave, it’s like my body shook and I just lost it harder than I ever had. I saw my dad come downstairs and I just fell into him, wanting things to change. 

I was crying because I didn’t want to go back, but I think I was also crying because that it happened again. I worked my ass off for seven months trying to get into that position and was hoping beyond hope that this experience would be different. It wasn’t, in fact it felt worse in the moment!

I felt like I let everyone down again. Especially this instance because my girlfriend (fiancé now) and I were so excited for this opportunity. I was completely ready to start moving down south to Salem and this seemed like a good start to the plan. 

I remember showing up to help my fiancé move into her new place and feeling so shaky. My emotions were bouncing all over the place and I remember giving her a hug and not letting go. She was my safest place, the place I could go to cry, and after a long day of just wanting to get out of the office, I almost buried my head in her shoulder the moment I saw her. 

Throughout my life, especially in high school, anytime I walked away from something or made a big decision based on health reasons and my well-being, friends would look at me and ask “So, what now? That was kind of weird, what’s your plan? Are you okay? You know you need to fight through this right?” 

Those people would cause my anxiety to just flip out. And, it shaped a bunch of decisions I made when I was younger to simply avoid those lines of questioning. Or, simply just not telling some of my best friends at the youth group I attended. 

So, I was scared and nervous that I was going to receive a similar treatment from my parents. And, I felt so defeated when I explained to my fiancé what was wrong. But, she said something that just floored me and made me finally lose it in front of her. She just said “It’s really okay if you quit. I love you!  Just go talk to someone about your anxiety. It’s eating you up”. Just the way she said it and how genuine and sincere it was, it made me start crying immediately. She just pulled me in and held me. 

After a couple of days where everything went with the script and the anxiety ruled my brain, she changed the script and it was a feeling like I had never experienced before. 

After seeing a therapist for three sessions, it has become apparent that this anxiety has sunk its teeth into every part of my life. It effects my emotions, my assumptions, my habits, the life decisions I’m making, and even what I want to pursue. From the physical manifestations in tension, frustration, shaky, change in breathing to the more emotional and mental effects, like being frightened while reading a job description or feeling terrible when I wake up in the morning. 

There has been some slight progress, but just becoming aware of what anxiety is doing is showing the magnitude of this issue. Something that I thought was just a little aspect of my life is turning out to be something that is almost ruling my life, which is scary in its own right. 

The most recent development has been that mornings when I wake up at home are the worst times. My body starts to feel inadequate and I also feel sad or down whenever I try to calm myself my playing video games. I paint this picture in my head of the overweight, anti-social nerd who plays World of Warcraft all day. And, then I just feel awful in that I feel like I failed somehow by not look at jobs for three hours already or not being more professional.

This letter is simply a way to begin to put into words what I’m struggling with and I’m bothered by. I know that God has something cooking because he brought into my life the most amazing woman I have ever met and who is going to be my future wife. He is making the wedding plan as smooth as it could be and so many things are falling into place that it has to be God.
I’m praying every day for His will to become clear and to see how He is going to complete this part of my life. 

He can overcome anxiety and that gives me encouragement.

Anxiety, screw you.

Let me tell you, I am a small streamer and I had a break for three months (no streaming). The reason for that was: that school and my internship became so busy that I didn't have the time to stream which is obviously the thing I love and to do the most when I have free time. So after everything with school and my internship settled down at the start of Christmas break, that means all the exams are finished and I got a good grade for my internship, I had a thought about starting to stream again. But with no luck I decided not to because I thought it would feel different than it was before.. So through the two week break (14 days) I decided to spent time with my friends and just watch/read Anime/Manga when I was bored or just wanted to do that. But in the middle of the break, around day 12 of the break I woke up and decided to start streaming with no buts etc. I just went along my plan and started to stream (ofcourse League of Legends and Ovewatch) and gained a steady ten viewer count and five follows that day, I was so happy that I went to my friends to tell them about it and they looked proud :D. For your information I am 19 years old.

The next day (day 13) saturday I started streaming early in the morning at 09:00 untill 14:00 in the afternoon (I had to prepare for work afterwards). That day was the best stream I ever had in my sort of streaming career. The chat was fun to talk to and I won a lot of games because the viewers supported me and gave me a lot of advice throughout the stream. I had a steady viewer count around 30 or so and i gained 42 followers that day! I told my friends during the stream that the should come to and enjoy the stream with me. Ofcourse my friends are moderators so it was easy to deal with the viewers if they crossed the lines and broke the rules.

This was it, the awesome moment I wanted to share with you all!!

*Kanazawa Fish Packing*    
*August 3rd – 1:13AM*    
***
Laughter echoed off the surrounding buildings, probably irritating to the local residents given the hour. After all, Kanazawa Fish Packing had been here since the seventies. Industrial production, storage, and cheap housing formed a maze of brickwork around Kanazawa. Just behind the business was a lot. Many of the establishments here needed a place for shipping, making the alleys here far wider then they might be elsewhere. They needed to be to accommodate all the snub-nose Toyota trucks coming and going in the everyday hustle and bustle. Atop an adjacent building across the lot, Hideyoshi sat. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
It was his first night hunting for money. Sitting against a rooftop A.C. unit, the boy had been taking a break from trawling the night streets of Tokyo to watch two male grasshoppers fight over some grasshopper pussy in a small patch of vegetation below. When two men came out to smoke behind Kanazawa, the boy's attention had shifted. Perhaps one of the two of them would do. For the past ten minutes he had sat here listening to blue collar small talk. The acrid aroma of the cigarettes was stinging his nose all the way to his perch, even under his mask. Such a nasty habit.
&amp;nbsp;
    
If one of them would just leave, he could kill the other and make off with the body pretty cleanly. It wasn't that he couldn't kill both, but even as a ghoul the boy didn't have enough strength to cart two full grown men across the city *subtlety.* One was all he was being paid for anyway. A glance was shot through his orange bug goggles at the equipment that rested beside him, an A frame, a plastic and cloth sack, and packing straps. The young ghoul figured this would make transport quick and efficient. With the slam of a heavy door, Yoshi's attention snapped back down to the scene below. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Kensuke,'' the two smokestacks greeted the newcomer loudly as the man pulled out a cigarette of his own, cramming it into his lips and letting dangle there. As he produced a lighter and lit the cancer stick, the orange glow of burning tobacco lit his middle aged features, revealed the bits of fish in his scraggly Asian beard. ''What kept you, man?'' His tired brown eyes regarded the two with just a twinge of annoyance as he brushed a few strands of oily hair from his face.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Canning machine three is down again.'' Kensuke inhaled sharply and exhaled a little more relaxed, the nicotine calming his frustration. ''Had to do a little emergency maintenance.'' The two smiled and the shorter of the coworkers spoke first.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''You ever get tired of doing maintenance's job too, Ken?'' Kensuke nodded grimly.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Complaining won't do anything. You know that.'' A melancholy acceptance of reality crossed the faces of all three. Now it was time for the fat one to speak, lounging against the back of the building, naturally. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''You're the most talented guy here, Ken. You could score another job if you wanted.''
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Yeah,'' the short one concurred. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''I make good money here,'' Kensuke parried. He attempted to change the subject. ''You know that new kid they got logistics? Soujiro?'' The two nodded. ''He asked me how much I made the other day.''
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Rude,'' fatso commented.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Get this,'' He continued with a weary smile, cigarette clinched in his teeth. ''When I told him he says 'wow, I haven't made that much in years.' That punk is barely out of college. This is my *top pay.* I worked my ass of to make what I do.''
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Wow,'' the short one whispered in disbelief. ''Don't you have a medical degree or something?'' The man of the hour nodded again.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''I'm qualified to be a nurse. I don't really wish to do that for the rest of my life though,'' Kensuke answered gruffly.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Why not see if you can go back to school? Become a doctor?'' A look of disbelief was shot at the tubby man's suggestion. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Are you kidding me? I would be a forty two year-old rookie doctor. All the other doctors would be laughing watching me struggle to properly suture a wound. Then some snot-nosed intern would be coming up to me going 'wow, I haven't made that much in years!'' Kensuke chuckled and the other two burst out laughing. As the chubbier man finished his smoke and flicked the butt away he stole a glance at his dinged up wrist watch before shaking his flub off the wall. 
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Come on,'' He slapped his short buddy on the shoulder. ''Our fifteen minutes is up.''
&amp;nbsp;
    
''Enjoy your reprieve, Ken.'' The two have a small wave and Kensuke nodded in response as he took another drag. When the door closed, Yoshi got ready. He was getting paid good money too. Now that he had a man alone, the boy stood and just jumped right over the side of the building. It was only two stories. The shadows and the steady hum of canning machines from the plant masked the small noise of his impact. The only light illuminating the lot was the one under which Kensuke stood. This gave the little ghoul plenty of darkness to mask his approach. As he maneuvered around the parked trucks and garbage cans, Yoshi's heart began to beat faster from the adrenaline.
&amp;nbsp;
    
By the time the boy snuck up beside the shipping dock that his pray stood upon, his kakugan was already burning brightly, causing the bug eye goggles to glow over the top of his face mask. Running at the dock, Hideyoshi leapt a few feet from it and catching the ledge easily with his hands, he pulled himself up in a smooth quiet motion. Ryuu's training had been paying off. While the base of the dock was concrete, the surface was wooden planks. His kagune came to life behind him spreading out through the night air in silent malice. His charge at the man was not a quiet one thanks to the wood. The sudden racket caused Kensuke to turn enough to look over his shoulder. He saw death coming swiftly and yelled in surprise and lament.
&amp;nbsp;
    
''UBWAAAA - ''
&amp;nbsp;
    
His scream was cut short, and with a thunk his head tumbled across the planks. His corpse fell to its knees before the boy and Yoshi kept it suspended from falling any further with his bug-like claws. Blood spurted from the gouge he had cut into the shoulders below the neck, spattering onto his black rain poncho. For a moment he stood there in apprehension. Normally his victims died before they knew what was happening, but this one had had just enough time. Had anyone heard? Certainly the factory hid his deed from the workers within. Who could be on the streets at this hour? Surely, he was safe."
5nlemo,6,2017-01-12,Which Cartoon Creators Would You Like To See Direct An Animated Film?,Spidey10,movies,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5nlemo/which_cartoon_creators_would_you_like_to_see/,"Here are my picks.

Alex Hirsch (Gravity Falls). Even though the second of Gravity Falls season 2 was very disappointing, Hirsch has a lot of talent. And GF shows that. He has a very creative and weird mind And he can create great funny characters that you care about. I know he was offered to work as an intern at Pixar once, but he turned it down. Disappointing to hear because I think he could make a really funny and weird Pixar film.

Daron Nefcy (Star Vs The Forces Of Evil). I had no interest n Star Vs until a few months ago when a friend of mine convinced me to give it a try. And I'm happy I did. Super entertaining, weird, and imaginative show. I wonder what Nefcy could do with a Pixar or Dreamworks or Disney animated film.

So I can start applying for internships.",maekart,design_critiques,https://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/5nlo7m/like_everyone_else_looking_for_a_portfoliowebsite/,"https://meravkleinmann.myportfolio.com/

So this is my first attempt at making a design portfolio. I used the Adobe Portfolio program. I don't have a whole lot of projects under my belt (working on that) as I only started designing last year.

I've had issues with low image quality, I'm continuing to try and make the images better quality. I'm not too good with all the file/resolution/exporting/print stuff yet, so I'm kind of flailing around with that. Most notably in the spreads for my ""Event Book"". Those images are a placeholder right now until I can make my own mockups.

I'm desperately trying to get together a passable portfolio that I can land a summer internship with. Is there any chance? The deadlines are starting to come up so I'd appreciate your feedback. 

I don't have a lot of work so I've included some older work from when I was just starting out. I'm not sure if I should leave the older stuff out, maybe you guys can tell me if it sucks and I should scrap it.

Thank you!"

There are several videos and screenshots out there showing the glitch. You can see his weapon, but his body is completely invisible - even in the MVP screen!

The biggest problem is that after I little search, I found that this has been reported (with proof!) in this subreddit at least three times but it didn't get the deserved attention. I've done some digging here and in the Rainbow 6 official forums and haven't found any response from the community managers or developers in this matter even though this issue is ridiculously annoying.

I just heard about this issue for the first time in a Brazilian Facebook group about Rainbow 6 and that's why I came here. It got a lot of attention there but I think things that happen there don't get transmitted to the devs. Even though there are a Ubisoft community manager and an intern, they don't really get very involved in the group, but that's a different subject.

Anyway, can /u/its_epi or anybody else responsible for the game's development send this to QA and get it fixed? I own the Elite Uniform and if this is a glitch, I really don't want it to happen randomly with me. It's super annoying.

5no01i,28,2017-01-12,Microdosing has reignited my drive,sirvegastein,microdosing,https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/comments/5no01i/microdosing_has_reignited_my_drive/,"Hey dosers, I just want to share my experience with micro dosing this past week. I just started on Monday and and as we head on to Friday, lemme tell you about how I am slowly but surely starting to notice a shift in attitude towards life, academics, and the future. 

First some background: I am a 4th year in uni graduating this June from Mechanical Engineering. My first two years in school I was filled with drive, motivation, and discipline regarding my studies (maintained a 3.3 GPA) , 15-18 hr/week pt job, and extra-curricular activities, research involvement. I was eating right and even lost a significant amount of weight (~30 lbs). As a first generation college student from a low income family, I wanted to prove everyone wrong.

Something went amiss during my last quarter of my 2nd and leading up to my 4th year. I went through some depression that derailed every aspect of my life. I barely passed classes and failed some, I was doing the least at work, began to close myself off in my apartment, gained about 60 lbs, and worst no motivation for self-improvement. I was  in a downward spiral and I notice my family notice as they would often comment on my appearance, but despite this I could find a reason to make myself better. In the start of my 4th year, I made half-assed attempts to get my life back on track. I tried in my classes while still leaving assignments to the last minute, I canceled a co-op interview with a casting company and sabotaged a second round interview for an internship with an electronics company by showing up in jeans and a baseball T-shirt. Obviously, the interviewer was less than impressed. They were second-rate efforts to progress but I didn't realize that they were only that way because I had no drive to do any of it. I just did those things because it was something I felt i had to do.

I discovered micro dosing while browsing r/LSD (I had tried LSD several times before). I browsed this sub for quite a while and until I was convinced that this was something that might help with my depression and lack of drive. I made an solution with 250 ml of water with 2x250 ug tabs and use an oral syringe to dose 5 ml =10 ug. First time I dosed, the results were sub-optimal but definitely there. I started reading a book for a class and noticed I had a longer attention span to read a full chapter (usually all I could handle were a couple pages before feeling drowsy) whereas I would normally fall asleep during lecture, I mustered enough energy to stay awake. if anything the dose lasted almost the whole day and it was comparable to a cup of coffee. 

I dosed again Thursday, this time with 7 ml = 14 ug. I dosed at 8:00 AM bc I knew I would have to meet up with a friend to catch up at 10:00 AM giving the dose enough time to do its thing. Well I would say there wasn't much of a dull moment. At first, we exchanged standard ""how have you been"" but just min after this the conversation took off and we always had something to talk about. I was actually surprised bc I was actually keeping up (my friend is more on the extroverted spectrum while I am more on the introverted side). After our meeting, i figured I would do some research for my senior project in the library. This was when the effects really really started to kick in. i could not believe the amount of energy and focus coming out of me. I read paper after paper with regards to my project (very technical stuff) and found that I actually gathered and understood a surprising amount information to bring back to my group. On a good week prior to micro dosing, It would take me days to produce that kind of work.

Ahhh that's all I am going to say for now. I have a 3hr lecture to attend from 7p-10p. yikes! but I will come back and add to the above once I get home. til next time. also I am running late so pls go easy on my grammer and spelling mistakes. I haven't had a chance to proof read it. "

The place where I'm renting is in a shared house with 3 other roommates and thats where I spend 90% of my time.  When I'm not there, I'm at my parent's house where my brother who's older than I am still lives.  Right now, I'm renting a couch to do literally the internship of my dreams.  


*In the first house, one of my roommates is very passionate about politics that I don't believe in and will fight and be chaotic about it, another won't do his share of cleaning and is just a general mooch who once in a blue moon will do something, and the last roommate is the owner of the house and is a 73 year old who buys way too much food (to the point where tons of food gets waisted) and who's coping mechanism is to find something wrong and then nag other people to fix it for her. 


*at my parent's house, I'm the chick that left the nest and so all of the other birds at the house are constantly vying for my attention.  My father is the opposite political ideology from me and is also going down the mentally deranged train, believing in aliens and stuff, and is very vocal about the aforementioned, even after I've reminded him time and time again that I don't want to talk about that with him because it will go no where.  My mom is loosing her memory and gets confused really easily, so everything has to be explained to her at least 3 times before she gets it.  My brother is 30, has a job that may be paying, at best a bit more than minimum wage and is sore that he hasn't gone to college like me.  All 3 of the characters think I am the golden one and are very demanding of my attention when I visit and get vocally upset when my attention isn't on them for even the amount of time it takes to write a text. 


*I went on craigslist to find a temp place to live for 4 weeks while I did the internship that I've literally been looking forward to for my entire life and I find this guy renting a couch/bathroom/kitchen privilege thing for super super cheap compared to the surrounding area and its close to where I go for my internship.  Turns out he's a gentlemen over mid 60s who never married and who is lonely, which is fine but he fucking talks for HOURS!  I could handle a certain amount of conversation as well as the next person, but this is excessive.  The only times I have to myself are when he's not home, and then when he does come home he talks for hours, stressing me out enough that I have to take another 45 mins to an hour to settle myself down to sleep. Today was even worse because he had a temper tantrum about not being able to eat enough when (a) he has eaten in the last couple of days (b) he was worried about disturbing me when he was cooking and I've told him repeatedly it wouldn't bother me and to do what he needs to and (c) that he was let down because he thought I was going to cook (he said in his add, he would reduce rent for people who cooked, but I'm paying the posted price so I thought that it wasn't going to be an issue if I didn't cook for him that often) more because I told him I love to cook. Well the first day I was there he didn't trust me in the kitchen to actually do cooking and so I didn't cook unless he wasn't there so he wouldn't get in my way.  But now he's upset that I haven't been cooking for both of us, and what little groceries or food that I've bought that I've kept inside has gone to him. What annoys me even more is that he's a food snob, but at the same time refuses to take care of himself by cooking and/or feeding himself.
    

 These are the three places I've laid my head to rest at and they have all been driving me crazy.  I barely have time to rest and unwind at any of those places and I've complained so much about at least the first 2 places for over a year.  Ideally, I'd like to live by myself in a one-room apartment with my fiance. Now, is it just me?  Am I being too sensitive and should I suck it up and stick it out?  Place 3 had a temper tantrum this evening which is why I felt like I needed to vent, especially since my fiance is swamped with work. Sigh...thanks for listening. "

5nr0o7,2,2017-01-13,The whiter than white PR machine funded by her parents and Trump no less. Americans just cant believe that an upper middle class snow white could be guilty.,curdokur,amandaknox,https://www.reddit.com/r/amandaknox/comments/5nr0o7/the_whiter_than_white_pr_machine_funded_by_her/,"The netflix documentary shows how much power and influence an upper middle class white girl has, when she has the whole state department on her side, trump, even clinton, while Meredith has nobody to respond with a similar documentary

Amanda Knox claims that she had never been in love before Raffaele.  She is lying here as witness testimonies and in her own book she wrote that she wasn’t serious at all about Raffaele.  She even called him just a friend in her email home.  Raffaele said he never wanted to see Amanda again in court.

Amanda released a never seen before video of Meredith Kercher.  This has raised serious questions about how this escaped police files and also whether the Kerchers had been aware of its existence.  If Amanda had been hiding this video for almost a decade without showing anyone, including the victim’s family, then airs it on a Netflix documentary without warning… it is in extremely poor taste to put it mildly.  It can also be interpreted as an attack on the Kerchers who, like most everyone else, believes Amanda and Raffaele were involved in Meredith’s death.

The documentary shows explicit photos of Meredith Kercher’s body and bedroom covered with blood.  This is gratuitous and offensive since this video is not a careful look at the crime but a pro-Amanda Knox propaganda flick.
Amanda revels in the divisiveness she instigates in the first words of the documentary by teasing the audience with “If I’m innocent this and if I’m guilty that.”  Clearly Amanda is feeding into the controversy rather than trying to settle i once and for all.  She enjoys her distasteful displays of attention whoring.

Amanda prattles on about how she left for Italy to “become an adult” while neglecting to mention the police citation she received in Seattle just before she left.  Amanda had to go to court and face a fine for an out of control party she held. Then she blew off a prestigious internship in Germany that her uncle had pulled strings to get her into.  She walked off the job on the first day and never returned, preferring to drink alcohol in the park.

Amanda shows a video that her sister took of her in Italy.  In it Amanda swears and talks about how she admires men’s bodies.  Amanda omits that fact that she hooked up with a cocaine dealer on the train, abandoning her little sister in the hotel while she fooled around with drug dealer.

Amanda claims that she thought she was going to be a part of a scholarly program in Italy.  This is another lie. She enrolled in a school for foreigners which is open to anybody.  Meredith Kercher, on the other hand, was part of a prestigious Erasmus program at the University of Perugia.

Amanda claims that her boss Patrick Lumumba was “trying to get his bar off the ground.” This is a lie, his business was doing well until Amanda falsely accused him of murder.  Here Amanda tries to downplay her part in destroying the young fathers livelihood by claiming it was just starting.
When they showed pictures of Meredith’s vigil, the documentary omits fact that Amanda and Raffaele couldn’t be bothered to attend it.

Amanda doesn’t mention how Meredith blew her off on Halloween by not responding to her text messages.
Edited Raffaele’s call to police, deleting incriminating statement he made about nothing being stolen from Filomena’s room where there was a staged break-in"

I'm a 22 yo Spanish girl, I've just finished college and I've decided to quit smoking weed after two and a half years. I've been quite functional all this time, did internships, had good grades and all... But I was constantly feeling guilty, depressed and hopeless towards my future. The reasons why I quit are mostly the same I've been reading around: lost touch with reality, myself and my beloved ones, felt depressed and demotivated, not wanting to do things that I usually enjoyed, often found myself making up excuses not to go out, go to classes etc. because I just wanted to be stoned... And the money! I've been smoking around 50 euros a week and I'm afraid to do the maths!

I started smoking with my boyfriend. He suffers from depression and anxiety and so do I, according to my psychologist. Anyway, I don't think I am depressed, I've just been through bad moments recently and trying to suppress my pain with weed has not helped at all. 

I've made this decision along with my boyfriend, which is great as we can rely on each other. Anyway, I'm also taking this as a personal decision and a kind of fight against my true self in order to achieve stability in my life and acknowledge that I can be happy.

I'm experiencing some withdrawal symptoms such as extreme boredom, mood switches, irritability, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, lots of disturbing dreams, lack of appetite and so on. I also have the flu and my period, so I reckon I have a mixture of everything going on haha.

I have some plans for the future: do some freelance job that I've been putting off (freelancing and weed are the worst combo ever), rejoin ballet classes, cook and eat better food and find a 9 to 5 job in order to have a sense of routine. I know it's a lot, but one step at a time...

I'm now feeling really good speaking about my problem, but the downs are also real. When I'm feeling hopeless, crying and wanting to die I say to myself that those are not true feelings but symptoms of withdrawal. I used to be a rather happy girl (the existentialist kind, but still happy). I'm willing to meet myself again and I know all I have to do is wait while tricking myself into having a ""normal"" life.

I'm so glad I found this community. See you around!"

I have great credentials and even had 2 internships at Lockheed Martin and IBM before the accident.

I've had about 10 interviews since my graduation that were going very well until I told them I had to work remotely from my bed (their attitude changed completely, now being rude and rushed instead of friendly). With such good credentials, it should be easy for me to get hired, but I'm not, so I can only assume it's because I'm being discriminated against. I can understand that if the interviewee doesn't want to relocate on-site, then he wouldn't get hired. I WOULD relocate, but physically can't. Is there any law that prevents people like me from being discriminated against for hire? Thanks."
5nsoo7,3982,2017-01-13,Made it through an entire year of manually entering my + my wife's expenses in a spreadsheet. Here's what we found!,utb040713,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5nsoo7/made_it_through_an_entire_year_of_manually/,"Backstory: My wife and I are both 24. I'm a PhD student, making $28k/year. After being unemployed for the first half of 2016, my wife is now employed as an elementary school teacher, making $34k/year. We got married right before the start of 2016. We live in a very low cost-of-living area, so we don't have huge rent expenses.

I'll admit it; I've always been a bit of a numbers geek. So, at the beginning of 2016 my wife and I decided to pay for everything via credit card, so we (I) can track our expenses. I break everything down into categories each month, and I calculate our average expenses per category. I know there are some programs out there that will do this automatically, but I wanted to do it myself because 1) I found that it really didn't take much time, and 2) I wanted to be able to separate expenses into categories manually (example: being able to separate buying $50 of groceries and $25 of school supplies in one run to the grocery store).

I won't go through category-by-category since I'm sure most people don't care, so I'll go through some of the highlights/lowlights:

* Before my wife started getting paid, we were about $1000/month in the hole. Luckily, I had about $30k saved up via working in high school/college, summer internships, etc., so this wasn't a huge issue. By the end of July, we were about $3k in the red for the year. It would've been much worse, but we got a $4k tax refund, which helped immensely.

* Despite being $3k in the hole at the end of July, we were back to breaking even for the year by the end of September. By the end of December, we were able to save $3500 for the year. It's less than I'd like to save, but it's better than nothing I guess!

* We spend way more on eating out than I realized! We spent about $3800 on eating out in 2016. A significant portion of this was due to the fact that we go do trivia with our friends every other week; once we both eat and have 1-2 drinks each, we're looking at a $40+ tab. Also, once my wife started her job we started spending more on fast food (she was too busy/drained to want to cook anything together). This is one area we're trying to improve on.

* Teachers really end up paying for their classrooms out of their own pocket! Before she started her job, we were spending about $40/month on school supplies (books, pens, paper, etc.). Since she started teaching, we're up to about $200-250/month in expenses between the two of us, mostly spent on supplies for her classroom.

* Adopting a dog is more expensive than you'd think. We adopted a dog from a local rescue in January. Between adoption fees, vet visits, toys, food, and supplies, we spent $850 in the first month alone. She also ended up getting sick a few months later, resulting in several hundred dollars in vet visits and medication. Now that she's all better, we still spend $75/month on average for food, toys, vet visits, heartworm prevention, and getting her nails trimmed.

* Not really expenses related, but moving our money to a high-yield savings account was definitely worth it! We're now getting about $16/month in interest, compared to the $0.48/month we were getting before.

* Also not expenses-related, but once my wife signed the paperwork for her job, I/we opened a Roth IRA! There's about $6500 in contributions in there right now, and the account balance is at $7150 or so.

Anyway, I just wanted to share that I found tracking our expenses manually to be *very* useful, and that it didn't take much time at all (2-3 minutes every night). I highly recommend it!"

I graduated from an out of state college in 2014 with quite a hefty load of student loan debt. Because of this debt, I decided my best option would be to move back home with my parents so that I could quickly finish paying off my student loans. Since moving back home, I've had a really hard time focusing and finding a job with my degree which is in economics. I was stupid in college and never had a serious internship to put on my resume. I went into college as undeclared and didn't decide on my major until the end of my sophmore year. Because I was in a hurry to finish my degree on time, I decided to take summer classes to make sure I would graduate on time leaving me no time for a summer internship. 

Because of my troubles finding a good job in my field, I have been lucky enough to work for my fathers business during this time. Because of my debt and me living at home, dating as been really tough. No girl wants to date a 25 year old still living at home. I felt stuck and still do. No prospects on any girl, no chance of bringing them home to have sex, I was depressed and didnt see a bright future. Thats where my recent ex comes in.

I met her through tinder last september. She was also living at home at the time and still is. I thought I found a girl that would help me out of my funk. She didn't care that I was still living at home. We instantly liked each other. One of the problems we had though was that we had very different types of friends and social scenes. Her and her friends are really into dupstep and going to raves and my friends aren't. Her friends ranged from past  highschool friends to work friends to college friends. When she would have a party at her house, there would be a range of people from 18yrs old to 30yrs old. I felt so out of place and never invited my friends over because they wouldnt know how to fit in. 

She went to the local college and worked part time at jamba juice so her work friends weren't exactly the type of people I was used to hanging out with. Despite all of that, This past year and a half has been amazing with her but I was still going nowhere with my life and hid it from her. We started off dating casually because of our conflicting schedules. Meeting up  at night for happy hour, or going over to her house when her parents were out of town and vice versa. Another problem we had which was my fault was that I never made any moves to progress the relationship to the next level cuz I believed we didn't have the time for it. I believed that since both of us were still living at home, only getting to see each other maybe 2-3 times  a week, and only at night to smoke weed or get happy hour, that a casual relationship was all that we could handle.

 But I never told her that.  Thats why I never asked her to officially be my girlfriend. Over the past year and a half she had only meet my friends once and I never introduced her to my parents which is my biggest regret. She felt like I was hiding her which was not my intention. I just didnt want to get too invested when I knew that I would not be able to move out until I finish paying off my student debts. I felt too old to have an official girlfriend and to be still living at home. I was ashamed. It felt like it would only be a highschool type of relationship and I didnt want to bring that on her. She was going to be graduating soon and was planning on moving out for a job. I didn't want to hold her back from her life and make her stay for me when I couldn't really offer her anything.  Anytime we would hang out, it would only ever be just us two or me going over to hang with her and her friends. I was embarrassed of my situation and was not ready for a serious relationship but never told her that. I fell complacent with how things were going. Months came and went and we were still doing the same things over and over again. She was my escape.  I never said I loved you even though I had been feeling it for awhile. She got so fed up wondering where this was going, me never really having an in depth conversation about our future, that she finally called it off two days ago.

 I was heartbroken because just recently I had finally become ready to ask her to be my girlfriend and introuduce her to my family. I could see myself finishing off my debts within the next year and could see myself moving out soon. She just graduated and would have more time on her plate for us. I didnt tell her this until it was too late and its killing me. She got tired of putting in effort to never go anywhere. I had strung her along too long that by the time I was ready, she was over it. This break up has been killing me because I thought we had more time and I waited too long to let her know how I felt. Im filled up with so much regret because if I had just been honest with her, this wouldn't be happening. I dont know what to do with myself. I have this aching bottomless pit in my stomach that I can not get rid of. I can barely eat or sleep. My mind just keeps going on rewind to times when I couldve told her how I truly felt and how important she was to me. Just soo much regret its killing me. How do I move on? 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Causally dated a girl for 18 months. Never made any steps to progress the relationship until it was too late for her. Don't know how to process this regret I have for not taking action earlier and communicating how I truly felt. How do I get over this?"
5nszs0,1,2017-01-13,Limerence made me think I'm a lesbian/bi,DangerTerritory,limerence,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/5nszs0/limerence_made_me_think_im_a_lesbianbi/,"Just now, for the past few hours, I've been sitting around, waiting for an email response from her and dreaming about her. I've started to adore everything about her - her low and sensual laughter, the gleam in her eyes when she talks about a subject she's passionate about, her body, the gestures with which she rolls her cigarettes... I just want to be next to her, breathe in her smell and presence, although I know that there is no way that we are going to end up together.

So I'm a straight girl, but I've obsessed over people for as long as I can remember, to the point where I live the entire relationship in my head, but nothing really happens in reality.
This year I fell for a young female teacher from my university.
I walked into her office one day to talk about a project and I just sat down and we started talking about literature, getting along and laughing. Then I was just very enthusiastic about the subject and wanted to do a good job and impress her.
The next time we met we were out, with a few other people from uni, and had a beer and just laughed together and had fun. We regularly meet - either at uni, or when we go out and have a beer.

Then I started being really euphoric after each time we met and, at the same time, I started being pretty sure that she was a lesbian - I think anyone would think that just from what she looks like and how much of a feminist and pro LGBT she is.
Before I knew it, I felt butterflies in my stomach every time I ran into her and started actually having romantic fantasies about her and making up elaborate scenarios of how we could end up together. I started adjusting my opinions and style to be more of a person that she would like - even if this meant pretending to agree with some things that actually oppose my principles. I think this a very typical limerence-behaviour and I've always done this. I've always tried to adjust my whole personality and style to be more like the person I was currently obsessing over.

Back to the story: a couple of days ago she casually mentioned an ex-boyfriend and I instantly felt my heart pounding like crazy, then like something slowly died inside of me, because that means that she's not a lesbian.
I already actually knew that next year she's going abroad - for good - and I was kind of desperate, but I even came up with a plan to go abroad myself and do a sort of internship in the same country.
But now, that I know she's straight, the whole sort of high that I've been feeling in the past couple of months is gone and I feel a big void inside of me. The thing is, I'm sure she likes me, because she keeps inviting me to events where we meet and talk, but probably only as a friend - we use our first names and she's quite informal.
Now I've started to analyse all the gestures and things that she said and to feel a sort of resentment - why has she been so warm, can someone be so warm and not feel anything? I guess this is actually a general problem when someone falls in love with a person of the same-sex, who's straight. They might be showing interest and warmth, but only as friends.
In this whole period of time, I actually started looking at LGBT events and felt a bit of attraction for other obvious lesbians - that I've met at these underground-art events, where members of the LGBT community hang out. I've read more about this and felt like I could really love a girl, not any girl, but a girl certainly.

Anyway, this is my story. I'm hoping you guys can tell me if this just seems like a very delusional stage of limerence, where the gender and sexual orientation don't even matter anymore, since  until now I've only ever fallen for guys.
And I should also mention that I am extremely shy with guys (just the ones I like actually) and maybe I'm just so hopeless, that I would just fall for any person that shows interest and gives me attention.
Sorry for the long post, I just really wanted to get all this of my chest."

5ntkj1,4,2017-01-13,I feel like I'm in a tough place and I shouldn't be.,amomentintimetime,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5ntkj1/i_feel_like_im_in_a_tough_place_and_i_shouldnt_be/,"Hello there, people of /r/depression. I have read a lot of stories, personal deep thoughts here, and I think each and everyone of you are incredibly strong individuals that keep fighting through all the pain and suffering you deal with every day. 

I've been feeling quite down recently, and progressively worse, so I figured this could be my turn to share them with you.

I come from a well-off family who has awarded me with an incredibly privileged life, from school, my health, my spending, my opportunities to pursue any hobby I want. I have great friends, not too many, actually just a little, 2-3. They are friends that I will die for, and friends I can tell anything to. But I don't share negative feelings with them because I still believe negative emotions are contagious, and I want them to be happy.

I'm in my 3rd year of university and it's been very miserable ever since it started. My depression and anxiety, and my idea of always appearing strong and not appearing vulnerable as a man has led to me not ever sharing my emotions, thus building a wall between me and any potential friendships. The sad truth is I don't have one single close friend here, the closest friend I have in university are mere acquaintances at best. 

The 2-3 very close friends I have live overseas, where my hometown is, and we see each other 2 times a year, winter and summer break, so pretty much I'm alone here. Alone in this small university town, where drinking and strenuous studying to get ahead in your career are the norms. I don't like drinking, so all I do is study hard. My interests are in studying politics and economics, reading books on financial news and things of related fields. Basically hobbies that are consumed by yourself, so a lot of the times, actually, all the time I'm by myself in solitude. 

I'm an introvert, but god damn it, even I crave social interaction. I'm an open minded person and I would love to meet new people. But there aren't any clubs here that interest me. So I don't go to any. In our university, we have an exchange program where you go study abroad for one semester in a partner school somewhere else around the world. For my exchange I went to the UK which happened last semester. I met my girlfriend there, I have only had flings in the past, and a relationship where we were all too young to care and invest into. She's wonderful, extroverted, happy, optimistic, lovely, all aspects of personality and quality that are the opposite of mine. We had a wonderful time together, and I also made a lot of close, tremendous friends there. But time passed, one semester passed like what felt not enough. And I'm back here. All alone in this sad and miserable place.

Everyday I wake up, read books, read news, study, apply for summer internships. Everything there is to do is all by myself, with no one to talk to and hangout with in person. I'm so tired of this loneliness and I really, really want to have someone to talk to and care about in real life. My girlfriend and I are attempting long distance and it's been hard. She has great friends, she's having a great social life and despite Skyping with each other everyday, I feel like our differences are drifting us apart. I ask her how she's doing and she seems to not be giving effort into updating me. Of course, she's not obligated to. Who has time for a sad man when she's busy having fun? It's logical. I'm alone and sad, of course I'm going to wonder how she's doing because I care about her. But I don't want to appear needy and be overbearing. She's having fun and all I am is sobering alone in this sad town. I have nothing to tell, no stories to share apart from the knowledge I learn from my books and documentaries. She tells me all these great stories about her life, and I'm so, so happy for her. She has mental issues in the past, and I'm so proud of her for finally stepping out of that zone. 

I'm falling deeper and deeper into this depression hole, I really ponder about the reason to live anymore. A lot of people have it worse than me, in terms of circumstances, but my tolerance is much weaker than a lot of the strong people here. Years of depression and sadness, chronic loneliness is crashing down on me all at once, I don't know what to do. I love my girlfriend, and I HATE that I'm in such a dark place and I'm nothing but a dark spot in her life.

I'm just depressed. Just needed to vent this all out, if you made it this far. Thank you for reading."

5ntxvd,2,2017-01-13,[TECH] Kamikaze Drones,TysonMcNuggets,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/5ntxvd/tech_kamikaze_drones/,"An important fact was brought up at a meeting recently, Luxembourg does not have a lot of money nor does it have a lot of people. The heads of the DoToL and the DoDoL agreed with this intern and said there needed to be a new solution to the fact Luxembourg cannot just buy all the fanciest equipment for its own defense. That where Kamikaze Drones came up into the discussion.

The principle of Kamikaze drones is simple, stick a brick of C4 to a drone and then fly it into what ever you want to blow up, cheap and effective. After just watching Star Wars XX: The Empire Strikes Back a Second Time, an intern thought of a sort of mothership set up where dozens of drones could be fit onto a plane and then launched and controlled with the planes own computers to decrease the cost of shooting each drone.

The Drones would need to be able to withstand shooting out of a plane at flying speeds so a normal quad-copter would not able able to work. A design like that of a paper airplane was the solution. It was streamline enough that when it falls out of a moving plane it could pick up enough speed with the help of one prop to reach and maneuver to its destination. Since this drone technology has been around since 2016, consumer manufactures already have a wide selection of suitable models that we can test out to see which works best.

As a joint effort the DoToL and the DoDoL plan on spending a joint $200 million total on testing and software development over 1 and a half years to complete this project. Unit cost is expected to be around $200 while the system to control the drones is expected to cost $500,000 a unit when completed.

Other foreign technology departments are welcome to help fund this project to help the small guys around the world prevent themselves from becoming a stomping ground like Luxembourg has been in the past."
5nu6pc,7,2017-01-13,A Fair and Balanced Review of the New Chainsmokers Single,PGP_Shambles,PostGradProblem,https://www.reddit.com/r/PostGradProblem/comments/5nu6pc/a_fair_and_balanced_review_of_the_new/,"*note: apparently this wasn't funny enough for the new intern so read at your own peril*

In a move that makes T-Swift’s attempt at selling out seem like an alt-punk album, The Chainsmokers have released a new single and plumbed new lows of basic. I’ve never been one to blindly hate on something, so I decided to sit down and loop the song in order to properly disparage it. 

Opening with the kind of synths that would do any sorority girl’s “Summer 2k16” video proud, the tone is set for a perfect pseudo-deep tale of love lost. At least I think that’s what the song is about, since trying to get a message out of this is a lot like trying to stop your drunk friend from ordering another round of shots. Better to just walk away.

The Chainsmokers have fully committed themselves to producing music made for themselves and those like them: frat stars who have problematically low amounts of respect for women and bafflingly high self-esteem, and the freshman girls they’re plying with drinks. I’m no stranger to generic club hits, but this is just offensively bland. This song was so forgettable that I had to listen to it 3 times before I could focus on it long enough to form an opinion. This is muzak for clubs with too many people and not enough lights. I can only assume the complete lack of bass is an acknowledgement that five remixes better than the original song will be out shortly, and adding a bass line of their own would only slow down the process. It’s hilarious that a song that represents such a fall from grace uses hook “let’s show them we are better”.

I’d say that the three lyrics in the song are sung poorly but that would acknowledge the mutterings of Chainsmoker #1 as music. One would be surprised at the audacity the group would need to stat phasing out actual singers from their songs in order to feature themselves even more broadly, but then one would remember these are the same people who compared themselves to the success and influence of Bieber and Drake in an interview:

“Only Justin Bieber and Drake can hold a candle to what we’ve done. Now we’re influencing the industry, putting out songs everyone copies”

There is an incredible irony in people who specialize in generic club music claiming to be the golden standard everyone aspires towards.
While I could continue to go on pointing out flaws in the song and the respective issues in society they highlight, I am entirely unable to listen to this anymore. Instead, I’ll end with a selection of candid reactions to the eventual #1 hit from the GroupMe:

“Just started listening to Paris. Wtf is this song? He can’t sing and the lyrics make the opposite of sense.”

“Their idea of showing people they are better is using their parents’ money to fly across the world to have a drunk night on snapchat?”

“This song is beyond trash.”

“Have the Chainsmokers not heard of going on a Mission trip and posting a pic with the entire village to show people you are better?”

“The beat is too similar to roses I think. So they’re not very original.”

“I made it 3 minutes into the song, and all I can say is that I wish they had never made it out of Paris. For the first time in my life, I kinda wish the axis powers had won WW2""

“Sounds like it’s written for a rebellious 17 year old that buys a passport and then asks her parents to pay for the vacation abroad with her similarly idiotic best friend. Then they end up getting kidnapped by some 26 year old smooth operators and Liam Neeson has to come save them.”

“This song is the longest 4 min of my life.”

“It fucking sucks. That’s about it.”

5nuflj,2,2017-01-13,"So this is me, milkyway. And I want to know if I need to change ?",mywayinthemilkyway,AvPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvPD/comments/5nuflj/so_this_is_me_milkyway_and_i_want_to_know_if_i/,"Hi, I want to talk about a little story. It's the story of my life, the life of a man lost in the milkyway. Well I am a person who happen to have an AvPD, like you probably. 

I want to share my experience of the last few years of my life. I posted here from time to time and was an avid reader. But later I lacked time because of my studies. 

I graduated from a business school (it's free in the country where I live), I have made many sacrifice to be graduated and have an opportunity to have a job, a job for a living.  Sacrifice because I needed to have social interaction, many social interaction, and try to have conversation with people both in school and during my internship. Well I managed to do that even if it's was very hard, not very well but I have done it, that the most important ( and hey I am still alive ;) ). Maybe I will share some stories about that time but now I will talk more specificaly about the recent period.

During my internship I had made sacrifice because I needed to have good relationship with coworker and customers ( I was in an audit firm). I was not myself, I was acting, I needed to do that in order to survive in that environment and to get my diploma ( this was my way to have a job my way to get food and water, simply to live ).

Then I get my diploma and during that time (*), I don't know when exactly, slowly I started to accept myself as I was. I accepted that I was not good at social interaction and well after that I started to feel very well, very warm inside me. I was much more able to express my opinion on different subject, I was not seeking attention or friendship, I was just myself not caring much ( well still care but not as much as before ) about what other think of me, I am just a guys who is not good at social interaction, that it, simple as that.

(*: maybe before or after don't remember exactly )

At present day I still think like that, I am working on accepting myself as I am. But there is a problem, they don't accept me like that, I have found a job and they don't like the way I am. They want me to change, to be more ""open"", more talkative, to go more toward others. But I don't want to do that, I can do it, I have done it in the past, it's hard but it's possible, but I just don't want, it's not me, and it's not the me I want to be.

Life in never simple as it seems. At least with me, probably with you also.

So, recently, they asked me if I can change the way I behave. And I don't know why, maybe because I was tired (of the hardwork), or more realisticaly because I was afraid (of the direct consequence and long term consequence ) I said ""Yes, I will do an effort"". Unfortunately. 
	
So what should I do ? Should I change or stay the same ? I am afraid of not finding a job where I can be just myself, do my task, and go home without bothering anybody or being bothered by anybody or any social norm.
It's seems to be asking to much to the society, to much to this life... 
...maybe there is a place in the MilkyWay, where people like me, like you, can find jobs, make a living, live their lifes and be accepted as they are...
The Space is big....  WHO KNOWS ....

5nuudc,50,2017-01-13,[FM] Meeting a lawyer on craigslist and playing as his niece,Lyke_,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/5nuudc/fm_meeting_a_lawyer_on_craigslist_and_playing_as/,"Wow, this turned into a fucking long post, sorry about that. Also, this is more sexual than my pizza incident, but not a ton, so if you really want full on sex you should keep looking. This is just another one of my craigslist encounters that happened a few months ago (I'd probably never agree to do this kind of thing in winter, too damn cold).

In his listing, he described what he wanted as something “only for risk-takers” and “real exhibitionists”. I know both of those sound dumb out of context, but when I’ve had a bit to drink and I’m really craving that particular fetish that kind of talk really appeals to me. The post was pretty simple, he worked at a local law firm that had an attached parking garage. He wanted to meet a girl willing to blow him in between two strangers’ cars and maybe then fuck in the back of his SUV. What really sealed the deal for me was that he finished his post by mentioning that there were security cameras in the garage, but he was pretty sure they were just for show. The idea of possibly getting caught (even though I doubted he’d risk his job so they probably were just for show) makes me almost feel like I’m going to have a panic attack, but in a good way so I had to message him back.
 
I sent a reply with some pictures and made it clear I really wanted to make this happen. Learned a bit about him; he’s in his 40s, not married, not in great shape (pretty chubby, but I like bigger chubby guys so that was a plus), and was obviously excited at the prospect of a girl half his age sucking him off in public. We talked a bit about how we wanted to set this up, if I should just be waiting for him, and he brings up the idea of me posing as his niece. He wanted to take the whole thing a step further and have me first show up at his office and pretend to be his nonexistent niece who was studying law and wanted to see what an actual law firm was like. I didn’t immediately warm up to the idea, it kind of seemed a little too risky to me, but we chatted over email for a few days and he slowly brought me around on it. The idea was straightforward. I’d dress up a bit, show up to his firm around lunch time, he’d walk me around and introduce me to some coworkers, we would maybe fool around in his office, then he’d take his “niece” out to “lunch”.
 
For our “lunch date” I wanted to look the part of an eager law student, but honestly didn’t have a single thing that would be quite formal enough so I had to hit up our local equivalent of goodwill. I ended up grabbing a white blouse (that was a little too small but I’ve got a pretty flat chest so it wasn’t bad), grey H&amp;M blazer, and almost knee length black skirt. I finished it off with an old pair of black heels I’ve had for ages and a black choker (and for those wondering what I had under all that: matching black bra and panties from free people). I always keep my hair short but still tried not make it look semi-professional (although I probably still looked a little out of place). I showed up at the building at noon and took the elevator up. I was sweating bullets. You might think that after doing as many craigslist hookups as I have you might start feeling comfortable, but I am always a nervous wreck. My whole body feels twitchy and I can feel my face just burning up. Before the doors open I have to remind myself to breathe, but it barely helps as I step out of the elevator. This was a serious law firm. Silly decorative books lining every wall, at least 3 stories with a nice dark wood staircase in front of floor to ceiling windows.
 
At the front desk is a dark haired older receptionist who immediately sees that I’m out of my element. “Hi sweetie, can I help you?” She sounds completely sincere, which helps calm me down a little. “Uh yes, I’m here to see John Smith, he’s my uncle,” I say and do my best to look trustworthy. “Let me call him, take a seat and he should be right out.” I quickly sit down on a nearby chair (pretty cushy) and wait uncomfortably with my hands clasped in my lap. The receptionist barely hangs up before I see john trotting down the stairs. He’s wearing a pretty typical not-great-fitting black suit, white shirt, and red tie. “Lyke! It’s great to see you, how was the flight?” He hugs me and turns toward the secretary, “Diane, this is Lyke, my niece. Lyke this is Diane, she keeps everything running around here.” Diane does a little wave from behind her desk and smiles. “Come on, let me show you around.” He puts his hand and on my shoulder and scoots me forward. We turn into the first door we come to. It’s a large room with maybe 10 or so desks. “We call this the intern pen,” he grins and pulls me back through the door and we head towards the stairs. “I work upstairs.” As we climb I stare out the window that looks over downtown. “Wow, this is a really incredible view.” “I know,” he responds, “but the view from my office is even better.” I smirk and let out a giggle, I’m pretty I know exactly what kind of view I’ll be getting from his office. As we go to his office we run into someone that I assume he’s pretty friendly with. John introduces me again and mentions that I plan to study law. His coworker asks me where I want to study and I make up some bullshit about currently going to a state school for pre-reqs and I have some dream schools but I don’t want to jinx them so I didn’t have to really say anything concrete. We say goodbye and finally make it to his office. John does a quick hallway check to make sure no one sees us go in together and then closes the door. I wander to the window, and he was actually right, the view from his office is even better. You can’t see as much of downtown, but he has a nice perspective on some of the nearby mountains. I’m distracted enough that I jump when he comes up behind me and puts his hands on my hips. They start sliding up my body and he whispers in my ear, “I’m so glad my favorite niece decided to visit.” His hands reach my breasts and he gropes me so hard that I yelp. He shushes me, “come on, we don’t want my coworkers to hear.” John pulls away and sits in his chair. I slowly follow and climb into his lap, pushing up my skirt to straddle him. Now, I’m not really that into incest roleplay. It doesn’t turn me off, but it just doesn’t do anything for me, but I was definitely getting caught up in the moment and wanted to play along some. I started grinding against his crotch and I could feel his cock perk up quickly and press back against me. “Well you know I’d never miss a chance to see my favorite uncle.” I lean in to kiss him and he pulls me tight against him, locking our bodies together as his tongue slides into my mouth. I honestly don’t know what to do with my hands so I settle on wrapping my arms around his neck and grinding even harder. I know I shouldn’t moan but I can barely stop myself with him pressed against me like this. I think we made out for a good 15 minutes before I pull away, “You know we should really get started on our lunch date.” I climb off of him and can tell he’s disappointed that we didn’t go further in his office. “Don’t worry uncle, I promise I’ll make up for it.” Feeling more confident (or just hornier) I grab his hand and pull him out of his chair. We get back to the elevator, only saying goodbye to Diane on the way out.
 
From the elevator we go to the parking garage and I let him lead the way, thankfully he had planned ahead. He parked on a higher level than usual where almost nobody else would be and he had his SUV right by the wall furthest from the elevator. There’s nobody around, but we both start walking faster to get out of sight just in case anyone else drives onto this level. The second we’re behind his car his hands are all over me. John helps me out of my blazer and turns me around. With my back pressed against him he starts to undo the buttons on my blouse (honestly I probably undid more, guys have trouble with buttons on the wrong side :P). I shrug off the blouse as he massages my tits. I reach behind me and put a hand in his hair as he lowers his head and starts kissing and biting my neck. One of the bites is just a little too hard which makes me yelp. We both immediately freeze and listen to make sure no one could have heard it. One of his hands slides down my stomach, into my underwear. I’m still soaking from our earlier make out session; rubs my clit for a moment before moving his hand lower and sliding a finger inside me. It feels good, but there’s so little I can do from this position that it’s actually a little frustrating. Eventually I pull away and turn around while dropping to my knees. I unzip his fly and reach into his slacks. I look him in the eyes and bite my lip while my hand plays with his cock. “Do you like this uncle? Do you want your little niece’s mouth wrapped around your cock.” John laughs and cups my face in his hand, sliding a thumb into my mouth. I decide to stop teasing him and guide his cock out through his fly. He’s not huge, pretty average length but fairly thick. I take the tip into my mouth and suck the first drop of precum out, moaning as a slowly take his cock deeper and deeper until he’s completely inside my mouth. I take his balls gently in one hand and slide my head back. I wrap my other hand around the base of his cock and start moving my mouth back and forth, going just past the tip of his cock every time.
 
 It’s not long before he’s grunting under his breath and shallowly thrusting into my mouth. “Oh fuck Lyke, I’m gonna cum,” I keep going for a second to get him even closer right before I pull my lips off of his cock and start jerking him off with one hand. My hand is sliding the length of his shaft and I have my face pressed against. I let out an exaggerated moan, “do you want to cum on your nieces tits uncle? Oh please, I want to feel your hot cum on my chest.” He manages to let out another “oh fuck” and I can feel his balls twitch so I lean back and arch my back, pushing my chest up towards the tip of his cock as he starts to cum. This wasn’t porn levels of cum, but it was a few solid ropes splashing onto my tits and bra. I rub some of it in and lick a little bit of the cum off my fingertips as I stare up at him and lick my lips. I don’t know why, but I always get kind of giddy when a guy cums and end up laughing or giggling and I couldn’t maintain the whole incest roleplay at this point. I laughed, “wow John, you must have been pretty backed up huh?” He’s breathing heavily and leaning against his car. “Mm, that was fucking incredible, hah damn I wish I had more time for my lunch break.” He was right, it hadn’t felt like long, but we had probably been in the garage for at least 45 minutes between paranoia, foreplay, and blowing him. I didn’t really have a good way to clean up so I just put the blouse and jacket back on, hoping nothing would leak through too badly. We sadly didn’t end up having sex in the SUV, but I think that I’ll have to try playing in garages again some time.

Thanks for reading! Hope you liked it, sorry it was another one without much “real” sex, maybe next time haha. Feel free to comment or send PMs, I love responding."

I got automatic replies saying they would respond later with more details about the process. A month or two went by and I didn't get any response, I had pretty much given up BUT THEN, I got an email from an intern from Elizabeth Warren's office saying that I was still on the list and asking for some details (my phone number, # of tickets requested, etc). Fast forward to today, SEVEN DAYS before the Inauguration and I get an email that I have two tickets!!!! I'm SO excited! She probably waited this long hoping that anyone who wanted to go wouldn't be able to get the day off work, but little did she know my birthday is on the 21st and I took two days off to relax!!

Any advice on finding a cheap/fairly close to DC hotel that still has a room? I'm thinking of driving down because it will only take a few hours and flights would be insanely expensive at this point. "

5nwkie,1,2017-01-14,"How do I [21 M] get over my ex-gf [30 F]. We saw each other for a year and a half, have been broken up 5 months.",magicmikewaddup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5nwkie/how_do_i_21_m_get_over_my_exgf_30_f_we_saw_each/,"I started seeing this girl (she was 28 at the time), about 2 years ago. We were at the same class in community college together and things just kind of happened. We were casual for about half a year and then things started to get more serious between us, we became exclusive and started seriously taking about the future. It was somewhere around this time last year that I realized that things weren't going to work out, but I was in denial about it. 

There were many good things about the relationship, we were both ambitious, hard-working, had similar life goals, we got along great, and had a great sex life. When we decided to get serious there were a few stipulations that I asked of her for my own peace of mind/the longevity of the relationship. those things were an std panel (she was my first sexual partner had she had been very active sexually throughout her life), that she seek mental health treatment (she told me that she had bipolar disorder and an anxiety disorder, both of which were untreated when I met her), and that she move out of her current living situation (she was still living with an ex-boyfriend who she had been together with for seven years before me and based on what she told me was verbally and sexually abusive toward her). 

I told her in december of 2015 that I needed her to do those things, particularly to move out, in order for our relationship to progress. She asked for time as she was in the process of taking the PCAT and applying for pharmacy school, so we agreed on spring break. I also told her that the other things were less pressing, and didn't need to be done right away. When spring break rolled around she was just finishing up pharmacy school interviews and so I told her that she could wait until the end of the school-year. That didn't happen either, and so I ended up taking an internship in michigan during 10 weeks over the summer. Since she wasn't working or taking classes I told her that this needed to be done by the time that I was back or things would have to be over. She told me that it would happen. 
It was probably around the 4th of July, 3 weeks before I got back, that I started to feel her pulling out emotionally. I assumed this was largely because she realized that she wasn't going to be able to move out and I had been putting a lot of pressure on her to do so. About 2 weeks after I had been back, and about 3 weeks before I was set to leave for school, she told me that she needed some space to figure out whether she wanted me in her life. I treated this as her breaking up with me because she couldn't bring herself to move out from living with her ex-boyfriend. I didn't really blame her, since he was so manipulative and controlling that it made it almost impossible for her to leave, and she didn't want to move in with her parents, due to the fact that her father was an unstable bipolar and that had destroyed much of her family life. Her only other option was live off campus and take out additional school loans to pay for it, which was incredibly difficult considering that would add an additional 70,000 dollars of debt that she would have to pay back later. Knowing all of this, I was doing okay for the most part because I felt that the relationship had run it's course and I had done all I could. I then found out about a month later that she was already in a relationship with another guy and she had moved in with him. This really upset me because a small part of me still believed that she would come back, and because she had always told me how special our relationship was, how much she loved me, and that I was it for her.  I felt lied to and betrayed by how quickly she had moved on and done the one thing that I needed from her (moving out from her ex's), for someone else. I guess my question is, what can I do to deal with the loss and work to move on? I know part of this is that this was my first serious relationship and it was in a horrible situation, but this has really eroded my trust. This person was my emotional support during a very difficult time in my life. I was in community college because I had been dropped from a 4-year school due to poor academic performance, and she really helped me to find my footing and encouraged me to work hard and fight for my goals, and to have her completely removed from my life just as I was transferring to a new school has really messed with me. I'm sorry for the incredibly long post, and for the angsty teen vibe, but I felt that all of it was pertinent to understanding the situation.

  **tl;dr**: I'm struggling with dealing with the end of a bad relationship that lacked closure, and came during a bad time in my life. What can I do to help myself get over it?"
5nxbd0,192,2017-01-14,From Zero to Hero: My Story,asianoreo7,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/5nxbd0/from_zero_to_hero_my_story/,"Hello Fapstronauts,

Just got out of an intensive lift sesh and I thought I might wanted to share my long-overdue story here in hopes of inspiring others to reach their potential. This subreddit changed my life in ways I could’ve never imagined and I hope this brief (but lengthy) story starts my journey of paying it forward. 

4 years ago I was a social recluse in his first year at a southeastern state university who had the ambitions of Elon Musk, yet the interpersonal skills of an awkward turtle. I had been a fervent fapper since middle school and was fapping to porn atleast once daily. I had known about NoFap at that point due to my Reddit habits but I brushed it off as some bro-science not grounded in any real sources. 

After finishing my freshman year feeling sexually frustrated of my virginity, I decided to make a change and give NoFap a try. The first few weeks were the hardest since I never felt so horny before in my life. I would eye-fuck almost every attractive girl that I walked past during sophomore year. Studying in the library was even more rough. However, the newfound testosterone boost is real, along with all the flatlines described in the subreddit. Over time, you learn to manage your sexual urges better and you eventually learn to subconsciously focus it on whatever else you are doing, such as studying. During the next 3 years that I pledged my allegiance to NoFap Hardmode, I managed to score the highest of a 120-day streak. Along the way, some cool things happened:

•	My social skills improved dramatically. It wasn’t immediate but the before-and-after is easily visible. I had more presence around my friends and girls. Speaking of girls..

•	I lost my virginity. And proceeded to have dates and sex with quite a handful of girls as well. Especially sorority girls. My social anxiety was a shrimp compare to the serpent of testosterone motivating me to take actions outside of my comfort zone. 

•	Made some massive gym gains. 

•	Score quite a few competitive scholarships. 

•	Studied abroad.

•	Finally kicked-ass in a competitive game/hobby I’m passionate about (League of Legends). For those of you guys who are familiar with the game, I was able to go from Silver 4 to Plat 3; before hardmode and now, respectively.

Most importantly, my career transformed. I went from having a meager sub-3.0 GPA in Accounting to scoring dean’s list in consecutive semesters. I became a lot more involved in student organizations and even became the president of the business organization in my school. The pinnacle of the NoFap achievement came when I managed to score an internship, and eventual job offer, at a prestigious Big 4 accounting firm in Silicon Valley. This was after getting rejected by nearly 16 other corporate firms across the country, including the other 3 of the Big 4 firms. As a college student in the southeast of the US, I would’ve never thought that this was possible. But I managed to do it, despite all the odds and competition. And I’m proud to say that 99% of it was thanks to my decision to pursue NoFap. Yes, doing NoFap alone won’t do crap if you just say inside your house all day playing League of Legends. However, if you use your newfound energy to go outside every day and spend most of your day energy tackling your life objectives, you will see progress. So much progress that you will get hooked on. Progress over perfection.

I would love to get into the details of methods and strategies I took to make it far in my NoFap streaks, but this post is getting long. Please comment or pm me if you’d like to read more. 

Stay strong Fapstronauts.

5nxd5i,2,2017-01-14,Broke my whole life and it's ruining me,zeeko13,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5nxd5i/broke_my_whole_life_and_its_ruining_me/,"I have 99 problems and money is all of them. I'm in love with my best friend but she moved up north two years ago. I know she misses me as much as I miss her. I want to move to her city but I've never made much more than minimum wage. 

So when she moved, I started going to school for Computer Science. I got my associate's degree while working minimum wage at the school and at a pizza place. I've been accepted into a 6-month internship with the promise of a job at the end. I don't have parents, my grandmother is barely surviving off social security and a small pension. 11 of my friends moved away because they couldn't afford it here. There's only 2 left, and neither of them can relate to my financial burden. 

I don't have a car so when it rains, I get soaked on my bike. I have debt from naive decisions I made at 18. Eight years later, I haven't made a dent in it. I have $0.11 in my bank account right now, and no income in the near future. 

I'm at the point where I don't think I can afford a career. I can't afford this internship even though it promises so much for me on the other end. To top it off, I have PTSD and MDD and masking that to look professional every day is wearing me down.

I feel like I was dealt a shit hand and played it as best as I knew how, but it doesn't fucking matter. I know life isn't about what you deserve, but what you put into it. I feel like I put my soul into getting out of poverty. I grew up with an alcoholic who never worked, so I've never known what it's like to feel secure. 

In sociology, you learn that poverty typically acts in a cycle; people flow in and out of it throughout their lives. That is a luxury I've never been afforded. When I applied for food stamps last year, I was accepted only to have the benefits immediately revoked based on the fact that I was a student. I ended up owing them $350 that they never gave me. 

I'm exhausted and I feel like society judges me. Whenever I visit a family that is in a higher financial class than me, it doesn't feel as friendly. I can act like them, but I can't afford their clothes. I feel like my life experiences are so different that it's alienating. When describing hardship, they always respond with, ""why don't you get your family to pay for it?"" It just doesn't make sense to them. 

Los Angeles is a fucking meat grinder and I want out. I just want to walk around with my friend up north. I don't need a lot in life. Haaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh. I'm tired."
5nxn0e,9,2017-01-14,I've been a pharmacy technician for 6 months and I never got formal training,littlekapkan,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/5nxn0e/ive_been_a_pharmacy_technician_for_6_months_and_i/,"Basically, I have been a pharmacy tech since September and I never got formal training. All I basically had were ppls, which are like terrible online videos that I watched that showed how to register patients, and all that basic stuff. 

I was hired because I interned there for high school, but I never did anything other than count pills, outdates, and typed a little bit. They showed me and my boyfriend, also interning there, how to send out mail and stuff, but we really didn't do drive-through, did NOT handle any insurance, phones, or did much else. 

Our mentor and the guy who hired me said we'd finish my training after I got hired. However, he was immediately transfer to another Walgreen's the second day I was there, so I NEVER got my training. The other pharmacist there hates me (As in this one will NEVER greet me, always yells at me in front of customers, never talks to me and talks down to me when this one has too) 

When the new pharmacist came to replace my mentor, he liked me, for like the first day. Then after, he tells me stuff like ""Don't you remember this?"" and ""Their firing people out there, so stop messing up!"" if I ask a question about something, or if I make a typing error, or any kind of mistake actually, such as not understand the Intercom Plus completely and how to navigate it. 

All my co workers treat me like I'm stupid and that they can just talk crap to me. It feel like elementary school again, honestly, because I was bullied by all the people in my grade, even the ""nicer"" ones. However, I can't do anything about it because I'm a worker and they ARE better than me. 

However, my boyfriend was recently hired as a tech by a better Walgreens (as in they don't treat each other with stress and rudeness). They are giving him formal training including CLASSES! This was a surprise for us because I NEVER had anything like that when I was hired. Basically, I was hired knowing what I knew from my internship.

Well, this made not only me upset, but my boyfriend, too. So he called our old mentor and told him I never got my formal training. He basically told my boyfriend, ""Oh yeah, make sure (my name) let's the new pharmacist know about that because we didn't have time to get on her training because I left.""

Great. Wonderful news. I was never fucking trained by the people who constantly treat me like I'm a burden and an idiot for not knowing everything. And now I'm supposed to tell them that?

Here are my issues: If I tell them that like my mentor pharmacist said to, wouldn't they be like, ""You haven't said anything until now about that?"". I would want to said, ""No, of course not, because, as I understood it, I was hired and my training was done when I finished my ppls. Everyone here knew that I needed my formal training, except our new pharmacist, but never mentioned anything to me, so I had to understand that as my training was finished."" but of course, in a polite way. 

Also, would they say something like, ""You've been here since September, you don't need formal training anymore since you've been here long enough."" to which I would reply, "" I am here literally under eight hours a week, I am part time, and anytime I had asked a question, my answer was just one of you people doing it yourselves and I never got taught. I've been here since then, but I still was never given formal training. You're wondering why a girl who was hired after me is better than me, yet you training you completely and thoroughly and not me."" but more polite, you know. 

What do you guys think? I just want my formal training so I can kick ass because I know I can if I'm just taught it. Do you think I'll not get my training? Who's fault is this, in your opinion??

**Location of Origin:** *RACS – (Research Association Center of Singapore), Singapore.*

**Current occupation:** *Parkour Enthusiast.* 

*“Young Miss Plea was given two choices, either accept the terms in the desk or face the consequences of denial. Not an easy choice, since these were the papers detailing the experimentations and consequences of human bio-augmentation. 

Reluctantly, she agreed, and RACS was given a written permit to experiment on her by inserting a genetically modified embryo into her womb, in order to give birth to an unknown discovery.

Before the Omnic War and the rise of Overwatch, RACS was one of the most influential research groups in the fields of biogenetics and bioengineering, for that reason, receiving a special permit from the government center with accords to maintain the research in secret was no more troubling then sweeping the dead leaves in the facility’s courtyard. 

After the careful insertion of the embryo, the scientists checked every day their black and white screens for every small change in the embryo’s development cycle, until the day of birth. I remember Dr. Faust being very excited that day since he was the head of the Bio-Augmentation center. The day was unearthly hot and the birth process lasted a good long time before the newborn arrived. 

The birth was completed around 4:50 PM and the newborn was breathing from his own lungs. His mother however… was not. Complications during the birth made the poor exhausted woman draw her last breath. The baby seemed pretty normal in terms of appearance, and would have been considered a failed experiment if not for one thing… The baby spoke and had complete understanding of his surrounding and the people around him. 

Every single human being in that place was completely shocked by this and attempts to communicate were successful. However, no one knew how this was possible, and questions begun rolling in. By far the most shocked person in the room was Dr. Segla, that thought they had created a human being capable of great intelligence from birth. Dr. Fu was awestruck by the every word coming from the little human. Dr. Shaun was very happy that day… Seeing his experiments actually bear fruits. 

The infant even gave himself a name… Marcus Plea, for he somehow knew this was the name his mother had intended on giving him. 

Marcus turned his head to Dr. Shaun and in a very high pitched voice, said: “I will need a provider” 
Years passed since this, and young Marcus was tested in every way… Apparently, with the results of testing by Dr. Faust, Marcus had developed the capability of absorbing the memories of those he killed. His incredible knowledge and initial intelligence was given to him only because of his mother’s memories. She died giving him birth, so he had killed her and taken her memories as his. 
The testing of Dr. Faust was… how can I describe it… In depth. Marcus was given several humans to kill and absorb their memories in order to prove his abilities. He became someone who changed personalities constantly. Memories clashed through his mind and he had to decide all that was wrong or right.

Marcus ended up being employed in RACS as someone who would take information from RACS’s competitors and enemies… By force if necessary. RACS equipped him with every technological enhancement and weapons available at the time and sent him into his missions. 
Kill a bloke, kill a journalist, kill a CEO, kill a Special Agent. 

Slowly becoming better and better at killing and doing RACS’s bidding. Until one day, in one of his missions, Marcus ended up eliminating a small child by accident. This child was innocent and free of any guilt. His memories flew through Marcus and he felt sad for all he had done. The evil this child feared was people like him. 

Marcus tried to stop, and yet his personalities prevented him from stopping the murdering spree. Marcus then decided to end this madness once and for all. As he woke up during the longest night and murdered all heads and interns of RACS. In a single night, Marcus had absorbed the memories of hundreds of scientists, guards and agents. He uncovered truths about the experiments in the test chamber, his own genetics, the various different contracts on a new robotic factory development project, a super soldier project and even a war that would shake the foundations of mankind in the years to come. 

Marcus however, would do none of that. All these horrible things were not for him to cause. His child inside called to him, as it wanted to play in the bloodied courtyard of RACS. 
And so he did, he played. Jumping from building to building, using his technological equipment to play around, toying around with the mannequins and lab equipment.

Marcus became the complete opposite of what RACS became, and so… he decided it would be wise to show that. Marcus became SCAR, the opposite and had sworn to stop the plans from his memories and become a hero in the eyes of his inner child. Little did he know that his actions would provide a turn of events that would plague mankind to this very day.

Today, I, Marcus Plea, Codename: SCAR, seek redemption for my actions. I live a hidden, yet happy life and constantly shift from city to city. All of this because not only of how much danger I pose to people and to myself, but also, the danger of my memories, which some people would like to make me… Forget.”* 

**-The End**

*Well... This is the what I imagined for Scar.*
*It might be a little... too dark.*
*Still, it's improbable he'll ever be placed in the new hero waiting list so... whatever.*

Staying away from these bad habits have allowed me to take on some larger goals and take control of the ship that steers my life.

1) I plan to drop to 12% body fat by the end of 2017. 

2) Eating healthier every single day, and staying away from junk food.

3) I have one internship for this next year and I am planning to take on another one hopefully as the semester picks up.

4) I stopped making excuses for problems in my life.

5) For problems that carried on from 2016 and I realized I put time into for no reason, I just realized fuck it.. it's not worth my time. I am worth so much more than to waste time on things holding me back.

6) I have always wanted to travel, so I applied to a couple programs in LA for the summer. 

7) No I haven't found the love of my life yet. But compared to who I was a year ago, I am the best person I can be today. And I will continue to be that person moving forward every single day for the rest of 2017.

8) I've met some beautiful women these past few weeks. It would be nice to have something. I want to. But the matter of fact is that I am playing a long term game and I know that if I continue to believe and follow this track I am on now, I'll find the meaningful relationships I have been seeking since beginning NoFap.

9) I am happy with who I am right now. 

10) I used to get so mad about having bad days that I had to resort to something compulsive. Not anymore. It's a train of thought that doesn't let me think clearly. If shit happens, shit happens. We will all be okay.

As the title suggests, I have failed attempting this beast twice. 
I am a foreign med graduate (2014). After Graduation, I had to do a mandatory year of internship. In between my internship, I felt so cocky that I went ahead took about three months off and did FA once and sat for the exam. I was surprised when i failed and got a score of 170. 

After finishing my internship, I decided to renew my efforts and retake the exam. I took the exam in November and got my results back in December. I had score a 180. I feel so dejected and guilt wracked about how i could have messed this up again. 

I dont even know what i did wrong. 

I went through FA twice. Did Uworld with a cumulative score of 80%+, I did sketchy. I even used kaplan, DIT and parts of pathoma and goljan. 

I dont know if i should take the exam again. But almost all my dad's side of the family are in the US with 3 out of 6 siblings are doctors. The others are in the healthcare community also. 

I dont know what to do. 

Please help me"

&gt;Me – “Is no one else on this floor?”

&gt;Arnold – “I’ve checked the rooms and they’re all empty, but it’s only a matter of time until someone comes.”

As he finishes saying and I’m about to speak we hear Steve moaning loudly and say “My darling, we’ll be together forever”.  Deer in headlights again, with both of us in utter silence. Finally I speak up:

&gt;Me – “Go to the door and take a photo.”

&gt;Arnold – “What?!”

&gt;Me – “Do it, go there, take a few actually, try to get the screen and immediately call the tutor here.”

&gt;Arnold – “Why the pics though?”

&gt;Me – “Just in case. Uh, try not to look at them too much.”

Arnold leaves the room and, indeed, went to the door, snagged a few pics against his better judgment, and went straight to the office to call our tutor while I stayed behind waiting for them. I wanted to kick the door down so badly and just shout at him but I wanted to get our tutor here and get his advice. At the very least that way I wouldn’t do something stupid. The moaning quickly grew in frequency so I opted to wait by the elevator, and as soon as I reach it a security guard shows up, Always Happy Guard (AHG), I signal him and he looks at me quizzically:

&gt;AHG – “Hey there, bud, need something?”

&gt;Me – “Good question, actually.”

His face suddenly went from a small smile to a dead serious face. I talked regularly with this one guard during our breaks, and as the name suggests you would never spot this man without his smile, everything about him made you smile, from his laid-back personality to his trademark smile. When he heard my oddball of an answer he knew this wasn’t going to be a normal occurrence.

&gt;AHG – “What’s the problem?”

&gt;Me – “Well, you know Steve?”

&gt;AHG frowns. “Uh-oh.” I thought , “what did Steve do that we didn’t know?”

&gt;AHG – “Your colleague?”

The elevator doors open and I spot Arnold and our tutor. “I saw the photographs” he said as soon as he laid his eyes upon me.

Right, let me just take you out of the story a bit of time to tell you something about him. This man had a genuine passion to teach other people, and he was quite proud that this school was a popular place between would-be-internees because of him and his teachings. Sometimes he would space out for a bit and just ramble on, but nevertheless he was a good teacher. Now, the one thing you did NOT want him to do was to stay completely silent. You see, if you made a small mistake and called him, he would teach you how to solve it, after all, making and fixing mistakes is just part of any job, and he knew that, so he purposefully would let us fall on small pitfalls and be right there to help us out. Fuck up a bit too badly, however, and he would stay silent, which meant that was going on your report, and trust me, this guy was a 100% professional, everything you did was put on a report, and, as you can probably guess, internship has a metric fuck-ton of weight on your final grade. You really didn’t want a bad report. With that said, back to the story.

He walked along side Arnold while I and AHG were right behind them and all four of us made way to A302. When we reach there the tutor and AHG look through the window and Steve was still performing solo, still moaning. I looked at our tutor to see his reaction and… nothing. Not a single expression (I like to think he was screaming internally), not a single word, absolutely nothing. This moment, what seemed to last minutes, was broken by the tutor turning to the guard, saying “Deal with this to the best of your ability” and walked right back to the office. Steve was fucked, I knew it and Arnold knew it. AHG tries to open the door but it was locked. As he tried that, Steve heard it, snapped out and boy, the look on his face when he saw us both with AHG. Immediately, he took the cushion cover (eww) and ran in panic to the back of the room while AHG unlocked the door with a master key. The moment the door was unlocked AHG went straight towards him while Arnold turned off the projector. Steve went absolutely ballistic, screaming “NO! My dear wife! I don’t want to leave her alone!” among some other Japanese words the moment he was grabbed, sweating bullets and trying his damn best to free himself to no avail. AHG grabbed his arm with one hand and his neck with the other, making sure this eel wouldn’t slip away, and off they went, AHG with a half-serious-half-disgust face and Steve still with barely any clothing on.

After all that commotion me and Arnold just kind of looked at each other and shrugged, I mean, what do you say to that? He then noticed a USB flash drive plugged on the back of the computer. We checked the contents on the computer before turning it off to see who it belonged to, most likely from a teacher. I quickly identified it as Steve’s, the folder names were a dead giveaway, things like “Class X Project 1”, Class X being my class, but there was another folder, simply titled “Love”, and inside were dozens of other folders, moonrunes for titles, all filled with that one character he fancied and, of course, lots and lots of porn (and not just the regular kind, mind you). I’d like to point out this was a 16GB flash drive and it was about 95% full, and trust me, those project folders only had a simple text document inside them.
 
&gt;Arnold – “Let’s head back to the office.”

&gt;Me – “Hold on, let me quickly check something.”

I opened Firefox, which was their preferred browser and checked the history, just in case. Needless to say I had to delete a lot of it because it had become tainted, but not before I snagged a quick picture with my phone, just in case.

With the relief of leaving room A302 and hoping to never return we head back to the office to talk to the tutor about Steve’s actions, give him the proof in case he needs it and then head back to our previous task. From this point on not only I checked all of the projector light bulbs but also the computers, last thing I need is for suddenly having porn all over the school."

5o63zg,10,2017-01-15,"Asking for advice, is this burnout or depression",throwawayMSPsecurity,msp,https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/5o63zg/asking_for_advice_is_this_burnout_or_depression/,"I graduated about a year and a half ago studying CIS with a focus on networking, security, and forensics. I got an entry level security job at a local MSP that is doing well. The MSP is incredibly busy though, when working there are no breaks besides lunch, 3 days a week minimum I turn my hour lunch break into 15 minutes or less to help keep up with the work load. Last year I spent the entire winter and spring working 50-60 hour weeks because we only had 2 people in the Security department and my duties included the basic firewall modifications, network changes for small scale networks (our clients primarily involve small banks),  VPN troubleshooting (never worked with this before this job, now I'm the guy to goto for SSLVPN connections. We primarily work off of Dell [although their systems in Sonicwall were sold to Francesco]). I'm familiar also working with  Checkpoint, Cisco ASAs, starting to work with Cisco Meraki and with FortiGates. I'm also in charge of SIEM management and recently we have had to switch vendors which was an additional headache of retiring the old collectors, coordinating sales/finance to stop paying for the old vendor for clients, and installing new clients and all my work on my old baselines and exceptions are a complete waste of time as I have to start all over again after a year of getting the previous collectors configured to each network.

Essentially what I'm saying is I like my job and my coworkers, I have received a chance many recent graduates would kill for to go straight into security and not wasting a few years on the help desk (already worked on an internal help desk before, I do not want to return to that). I have been given an opportunity that not many receive and I try my hardest.

I work in an office environment with about a dozen other techs. I sit along in my own row unless one of our help desk techs is in the office and not at the client, he's a good friend. The other help desk coworker we have in the office sometimes I also consider a friend. But when they're not there, I'm by myself in the row in an open office where my boss' boss has me in his peripheral vision at all times. If I stop working for a minute, I'm self-conscious of it because I feel like I am watched at all times. Everyone appears friendly and our company tells us they want to treat the techs with anything we want since we're the workforce but there are so few of us, I do not ever feel comfortable taking a sick day. Over December, I had walking pneumonia (not as severe as full blown pneumonia) and then I got Bronchitis. It took 4 weeks to get over these illnesses and I still do not feel 100%, still have a sinus infection and extremely tired at all times but I have no PTO to take off. I took off 2 days and 2 half days over the last 4 weeks for these illnesses and although while I was extremely sick and was being told by friends, family and work, ""You need to take care of yourself first. What good are you dead?"". But anyday I took off, my family and work made me feel so guilty that I would spend the whole day either extremely depressed and ashamed of myself or I would just get drunk to help not feel the pressure.

Ever since I got Lyme's disease in high school, I've been getting sicker more frequently ever. Adding stress to it just makes getting a cold a normal thing in my life and I try my best to hide my discomfort because I know I do not have any PTO and I would like to take a vacation this summer (we get 10 hours of PTO a month for both sickness and vacation. If I take off one day a month for sickness, I'm only saving 2 hours for vacation or future sickness).

I just don't know what to do. I'm not paid much for someone in a network security job but because this company gave me a direct chance in a field that would take experience and years to get to, I do not want to complain and jeopardise it at all.

I have a girlfriend that due to her getting demoted and a paycut for us dating (we worked in the same office building but for separate companies but they still demoted her for fraternisation) , she can no longer afford rent and I am helping her keep her apartment. However, I also pay my own parents $500 a month for rent, I pay over $1000 in loans and car payment (not including insurance, cell phone, parking at work [parking is $150 a month and the company pays $70 and I pay $80 a month just to park at work) and I have an hour and a half commute (in the mornings, it's 2 to 2.5 hours on the way home).

My company heavily pushes for certifications and I'm about to take my Sec+ cert which I know is only entry level and a joke but I was 5% from passing last time ( I know they have their own point system, but the points I received and the points required were only 5% off but I know that questions are weighted differently so it's not truly 5%) with it being a $320 test, I cannot afford to fail it again.

I do not know what to do or what I am feeling anymore. I feel pathetic for this since I've only been working for an MSP for a year and a half (I've been working since I was a child, my grandparents had a farm and working on it in the summers is what made me dream of having an office job where I can sit in AC. But now I find it to be a hell I didn't know that existed).

I apologize for the length of this rant but I simply do not know anymore is I am feeling burnout effects or if it is simply depression. I used to go to a therapist weekly for my clinical depression but I have had to give that up because I could not afford it. I have spent most of my weekend drinking while my girlfriend is at work and crying. I spent an hour on my way to work on Friday just crying and having a breakdown. Everything feels so shitty and I feel so exhausted that I feel like you can describe me in one word, apathetic. I just don't care. I don't care if I die at this point. Every day feels the same and I feel like nothing is changing. My company is losing more and more techs and we have more clients so there is more and more work but we're not being paid any more. The new overtime laws are nice, I got a whole 2k bump to my salary thanks to my company so I can continue to work on-call without being paid overtime. Or the fact I have clients in timezones 3-4 hours away (Eastern time vs Alaska time) and I have to take time out of my personal life (which is 3 hours a day) to work on client VPN issues with their home computes because they need to wait till they get home, so I lose sleep to help them, then go back to sleep to wake up at 5:30am again and start it all over again.

My plan is to work at this MSP for a couple of years to get the experience of working on so many different networks but right now I feel like I'm barely treading water and the current is picking up. I feel like I'm drowning and I'm having near daily breakdowns. I can't tell if it's just work or if its my depression.

And the worst part for me is having to hide my depression at work. I don't want people thinking I'm a freak. I've always felt like I'm just off and never fit in but I'll be as polite as I can possibly be for strangers. I'm either walked all over on or just ignored. I'm pretty sure my CEO doesn't care for me because I look so pathetic and lower class. Our Sales director treated me with disgust when I first started, he was the type that went to an ivy league school and was in a popular fraternity. I went to community college, got a scholarship to a local university and graduated with a 3.89 gpa but I feel like I'm looked down upon.

Anyways, I'm sorry for the huge rant. Downvote away and hide this shit if you want. I just needed to vent somewhere how I feel as a worker that is always scared about their job and how after working so hard in school and getting out of retail, food service, and internships, I still feel like I am worth less than garbage in the eyes of most of my coworkers.

Edit: I apologize if this post looks like a pity party asking for upvotes to make me feel better. I know I'm ranting a lot but I am very confused right now. I feel like I'm pushing myself to my limit and that everyone looks at me like it's not good enough. I know I have depression issues and depression ruminates itself appear worse each time I think of it. So right now I'm so confused, I can't tell how of these daily breakdowns I'm having is depression and how much is just stress. And what sets me over the edge is the fact I know my depression is in my head. I would turn it off if I could. But it runs in my family and I have little control over it even with my medication and it makes me feel even worse because I know that at least my needs are being met and I will survive and there are many many many more people in the world that have basic survival issues. I try to tell myself that if they can do it, I can do it but it just makes me hate myself more that I'm so sad when other that have it worse are pushing forward."

Long story short, I got a internship at a major studio out in LA for this summer and they said they want to possibly hire me full-time but definitely bring me on as an fx associate after the summer.

The thing is I have two more years to go in Uni and I really want to finish my studies and I want to transition to tech art in the future (which requires programming skills). Just about all the UCs and CSUs dont give 2nd degrees so USC is my only hope.

I wanted to know if anyone here has any advice on this? I have a year of experience in the industry at a smaller game studio, GPA from previous schools combined is a 3.5 and was IB if that even matters.

[TL;DR]

Got an internship out in LA and they want to bring me on after but I want to finish my CS degree. I already have a degree and USC is one of the few schools that gives out 2nd bachelor's. How do I get in??"
5o6hkd,6,2017-01-15,Bits &amp; Bytes,MrCreepyCrowlie,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/5o6hkd/bits_bytes/,"My love for computers can be traced back to the spring of 1994. At that time, most schools didn’t have computer labs or software studies. I went to school in a small town where junior high and high school both took place together in one building. The school could accommodate up to 700 students. 

So, it was in no means a one room building like you might see on classic television shows such as “Little House on The Prairie.” We didn’t have a middle school to act as a stepping stone that would prepare us for the hell that was high school, so we were thrown right into the lion’s den. But I digress.

When it came to high school, I was not the most popular boy by any means, but I wasn’t a complete outcast either. I settled somewhere in the middle you might say. I played football, and was pretty good at it. I also played chess and became known as “the computer guy.”

My first exposure to any type of computer system was in my geometry class. It was a normal classroom, but around the walls they had six or seven old Apple computer systems. As I said before, we didn’t have anything special. This was well before USB ports were even a thing. Now, we aren’t talking Apple IIE here, but they were early generation Macintosh systems. 

This is how I met my friend Jake. I had procured a floppy disk from an undisclosed location in which I needed to somehow gain access. I knew little more than the disk in question was supposed to have two full color photos of naked women for my viewing pleasure. I didn’t have a computer at home at the time. In fact, at that point, I had never used a computer in my entire life.  

As I mentioned earlier, I played chess in school. We even had a small after school club. After our meeting, I snuck into my geometry class after the teacher had gone home. I made sure no one was around, and popped that floppy disk into the system. Now what? I had absolutely no idea what to do. 

The icon for the diskette appeared on the desktop, but nothing happened when I clicked the icon. So, I started clicking frantically on the icon, and finally was prompted with a menu asking me what I would like to use to open this unknown file. 

I tried everything from text editors to the painting program, but all that I could get to appear was garbled characters in a jumbled mess. I was getting more and more frustrated at the situation, and eventually my anger got the best of me and I hit the desk quite hard. It made a huge “THUD.” It was then that I heard someone laughing maniacally behind me. My heart sank as I spun around in my seat. 

“I was just trying to play “Myst..” I said frantically. I had heard other students talking about playing the game on those systems, but I had actually known nothing about it whatsoever.  To my surprise, it wasn’t a teacher or even an adult for that matter. It was just another student I had seen using the systems recently. I wasn't sure at the time, but I thought his name was Jake. I was  relieved, but still a bit uneasy because the disk was still in the system, and I had no idea how to go about forcing this computer to cough it up.

Apparently, all young men actually do think alike. Jake knew almost immediately what I was up to. “You need a photo viewer to open photos.”
Again, I protested. “What are you talking about? I was just trying to play “Myst,” but this stupid thing wouldn’t work!”  

He grinned slightly, and walked over to where I was sitting. He leaned down, grabbed the mouse, and magically my “special disk” ejected from the system. “I don’t remember Myst needing one old disk with the label torn off to run. In fact, it should be installed on here already and wouldn't need any disks at all.” He said with a snarky look on his face. 
I grabbed for the disk, but he was faster. My heart sank because I just knew he was going to rat me out. “Look man. Don’t freak out. I’m not going to squeal on you. If you really want to see the “content” on this disk, you can come over to my house. I have a PC that I built myself that you can use.”

I couldn’t argue with that offer, so off we went. Jake only lived a mile or so from the school so it took no time to get to his house. His mom and dad were in the living room watching an old Science Fiction movie when we got there. I had never met them before, but they were surprisingly nice. They offered me food, and they had a nice selection of soda to choose from. 

The house was two stories and very well built. We threw down our backpacks and went upstairs to Jake’s room. Sure enough, he had a huge tower PC in his room by his desk. It was massive. He said that his mom used to be a programmer, and so he had been into computers for a very long time. 

She even taught him how to build them as well. I didn’t know anything about what specs were good or even that I should be impressed when he spouted off things like how it had a 75 MHz Intel Processor, 4 Megabytes of RAM, and a 14.4Kbps modem.

We sat down at his desk, and he popped the disk into that huge tower PC. “This is what I was talking about at school.” He said, as he opened up a program called LVIEW PRO. “The operating system has to have a program installed that knows how to handle the file you want to open.” He added. 

He proceeded to open the files on the disk and sure enough, two of the most beautiful women I had ever seen in my entire life were displayed in full color on the screen before me. They were completely naked, and let me tell you that nothing was left to the imagination. 

It was a glorious day for a 15-year-old boy by adolescent standards. I would come to find out later all of the huge differences between the Macintosh computers at school, and the Windows 3.11 PC Jake had.

You want to see something even cooler than these pics?” He said proudly. I was extremely skeptical that he could possess anything cooler than photos of naked women, but I decided to humor him. “If you can top what we just saw, count me in.” I said with a smirk.

He began clicking around on the system and eventually opened up something called “DOOM.” I watched as he navigated the menus and manually set things like his audio/video hardware preferences. Then, he was giving a choice of difficulty that started with “I’m Too Young To Die” and went all the way up to something called “Nightmare!” Jake chose the middle difficulty and began. 

By this point I had figured out it was some kind of game, but had never seen anything like it before. I had a Nintendo and Super Nintendo at home, but I had no idea you could play games this violent on a computer. He then let me take a turn playing DOOM. It was so much fun that I was immediately enthralled.  Before I knew it, more than two hours had passed. I thanked Jake, and ran down the stairs, grabbed my stuff, and headed home.

After that day, Jake and I became good friends. I taught him how to play chess, and he taught me everything he knew about computers. The next step was for me to get a PC of my own. Jake had told me that if I had one too, we could dial up to each other via our modems, and play Doom one on one. This really pushed me over the edge. He made me a copy of the game on several disks, and now all I needed was a PC of my own. I saved every penny I could for the next few months, and just before Christmas I finally got my dad to agree to help me buy  one.

We went to Wal-Mart that night to see what they had. This was back when they had demo units out on shelves for you to click around on and play with a little. They had several models. An AST which was a 486, a Hewlett Packard with a Pentium 60 MHz processor, and one made by a company called Packard Bell. The Packard Bell system was the most powerful at 75 MHz so that is the one I insisted we get. 

At that point Windows 95 had just came out, and it came preloaded on the system. It was the latest and greatest. So, why not? Right? I even got a printer out of the deal after convincing dad that I could use it to print out letters and flyers for him when he so needed.

Over the years, Jake and I stayed close friends. In 1996, we jumped on the Duke Nukem 3D craze since we could play each other one on one with it as well. That was the same year dial-up Internet service finally became available in our little town. Before that, we were stuck with bulletin board systems, and dialing each other to play our limited game selection. 

The Internet changed everything. It gave way to the birth of chat rooms, e-mail, and all sorts of pictures/videos that would make your mother faint. Then later with the birth of broadband Internet, things got even more interesting. But we’ll get to that later.

After high school, Jake and I decided to open a local computer repair shop within the city limits of our little town. I had been working for a guy who had the shop for years, and he had a pretty good client base already established. He had been looking to retire, so Jake and I talked about it and decided to buy him out. 

We did just that, and moved to a bigger location on the main street in town. Business was steady at first, but got even better over time once more people got to know us. I took care of the in-store work, and Jake handled calls to businesses and homes in the area. I took a great deal of pride in my work, and often paid a fair amount of attention to detail when it comes to software licensing and other documentation. 

I have found that over the years it has been a great benefit to read the fine print on all sorts of agreements. On one occasion, a piece of software actually had a clause in the EULA that stated if you sent them an email with your serial number, a certain message in the subject line, along with a predetermined statement that had been provided, the company would provide you with a rebate and free software upgrades for life. The PC Pitstop software offered compensation of $1,000 to a limited number of licensed customer who sent an email to a specified address in their EULA. It was sneaky, but also a good way to see who is reading these licensing agreements.

That was one of the big differences between Jake and me. He had a bad habit of just flying through things halfcocked while not really paying attention to what he was doing. This often caused us both aggravation because he would forget appointments or get the time wrong because he skimmed an email from a customer. I tried to keep him on track for the most part, but I had a great deal to do at the shop myself.

After about a year, we had established ourselves as the “Go To” repair shop for miles around, which meant we were getting a great deal of walk-in customers as well as more and more businesses offering us contracts. We even scored a huge contract with the city/county government which meant we handled the Police Station, Ambulance Service, and 911 Dispatch Center. This was really a great boost for our small business, and it sure did keep us busy. We would often get calls at all hours of the night needing to go out to one of the service areas for an emergency repair.

As good as things were for us at that time, this is also where the problems started as well. The 911 Dispatch Center had requested a complete system upgrade that would be done in two phases. First the dispatchers would get brand new systems, and if that went well, we would then start replacing the servers with more powerful blade servers. 

We could have built the dispatcher systems, but we didn’t want a huge headache if there were any part failures down the road. So, for those, we went with Dell Precision Workstations. They are pricey, but are the definition of work horses. Also, with next business day replacement service, if a part failed, we could have a replacement to swap into the system the very next morning in most cases. Everything about the hardware swap seemed to go quite well, which was a huge relief for both of us.

The 911 Dispatch Center had some really strange software requirements that I had never heard of before. This went way beyond medical HIPAA security policies and even required DOD (Department of Defense) background checks and special certifications. I rarely went onsite because I took care of the shop, but I still had to jump through all of those crazy hoops just like Jake.

Occasionally, we would get a call about a software error that we could repair remotely by securely connecting to their network, and taking control of the system. This sounds easy enough, but was quite a hassle. We had to use a special Citrix secure VPN connection just to get onto their network. Then every click we made was monitored and recorded. It was really creepy to say the least. But the alternative was driving up there to accomplish the same thing and still have everything monitored. This was the lesser of two evils.

The workload became way too much for us to handle alone, so we decided to hire someone who could work in the shop and go on calls if needed. Our shop wasn’t that far from a pretty large technological university which provided an ample number of smart young kids needing a job. 

Around the same time, my fiancé and I had been planning our wedding. I had helped as much as possible with the interviews, but ultimately Jake would have to finish the process. The following weekend was my wedding, and my new wife and I went on our honeymoon to Cape Hatteras to see the famous lighthouse. 

She absolutely loved lighthouses, and this was by far her favorite. She also loved Monster Jam monster trucks. I had planned for us to spend a few days in North Carolina, then I was going to surprise her by taking her to Vegas to the Monster Jam finals. Her favorite driver is Dennis Anderson in Gravedigger, and he was going to be there. Everything went off without a hitch. We had a great time on our honeymoon, and returned the following week. I dreaded having to get back to work after having a relaxing week, but I knew I had no choice. 

I arrived at the shop on Monday morning and to my surprise, Jake was there behind the counter along with some guy I had never seen before in my life. I went into the back and asked Jake to come back for a second. He made his way to the back room rather quickly. “Hey Man! How was the honeymoon?” He said cheerfully. 

“It was good, thanks. So, who is that out front?” I asked. 

“Oh Yeah! That’s Tim. He is the new guy.” Jake explained. He went on to tell me about how he was on a house call this last week and had a tire blow out going down the road. This guy, Tim, stopped to help him and apparently, Tim had just graduated from the university with a degree in Computer Science. 

He went on to say that they hung out the next couple of evenings at the bar down the street, and found out that Tim was looking for a job to hold him over until he moved out West to start an internship somewhere in Silicon Valley next year. 

I can’t say that I was thrilled that Jake had hired some guy that I had never met, but if he thought that Tim was qualified, I wasn’t going to get pissed about it. We did need some help after all. I went back up front and talked with Tim for a about an hour, and while he did seem very knowledgeable, something about him made me uneasy. Since Tim wasn’t planning on staying with us for the long haul, we didn’t bother getting him certified and cleared to work at the government sites. He could stick to other businesses and consumer customers.

We had an upstairs section to our shop that we never used. It was sealed off via a large wooden door because we didn’t want to waste money heating/cooling it since we weren’t using it. Jake and I had talked about turning it into an apartment and possibly living up there back before I had gotten married, but had since given up on that idea. 

We had started occasionally storing old boxes up there in case we needed to ship an entire system at some point. There were also two huge deep freezers up there in what used to be a kitchen area. We knew they both worked because we had tried to sell them once before for extra money, and to get rid of them. But since no one ever wanted to fool with dragging them down the stairs, we unplugged them, and they just sat up there. 

I even tried to convince Jake that we could clean up the upstairs and make it into a man cave with a nice LED TV/Sound System and a pool table, but he never seemed interested because we were always so busy. I had a plan to revisit this conversation after Tim had been with us a while and the workload was under control. Tim added in his two cents explaining how expensive it would be to renovate the upstairs, and to heat/cool it. I really wanted to blurt out, “Who the hell even asked you?” But somehow, I remained civil.

The next several weeks seemed to go by quickly. I didn’t see a lot of Tim because he spent most of his time out on the road helping Jake or picking up the slack by handling other onsite appointments. This was fine with me because I can't say that I liked Tim very much, and I swear I would sometimes catch him staring at me all creepily on occasion. 

Other than that, things seemed to be working out okay for the most part, but I still felt uneasy around Tim when he would spend time at the shop. I really couldn’t even tell you why. He dressed well, and seemed smart. Still, there would just be those times when the hairs on the back of my neck would stand up when he was there. I would like to be able to say that eventually that feeling went away. Unfortunately, it did not. 

In fact, it only got worse over the next several weeks. Shortly after Tim started, Jake had given him a key so he could come in on weekends and work on systems in the shop as needed. I tried my best to not be there alone with him whenever possible. 

Yuck! For the past week there has been a faint smell of something akin to a skunk that had crawled up under the building and died. It wasn’t too bad at first, but was getting increasingly worse. I made a reminder in my calendar to call pest control to check for dead rodents under the building. The last thing I needed was customers getting grossed out and not wanting to come into the store because it reeked.

The next evening, after the shop had closed, I was alone in the back trying to catch up on some work when the phone rang. Now, I usually don’t answer the phone after hours because if it is important, they can leave a message and we will get back to them. On top of that, all of our government contracts have a special cell number they can use to reach Jake in case he needs to make an emergency on call visit. 

However, I recognized the number on the Caller ID as Mr./Mrs. Phillips. Tim had been scheduled go out there earlier that afternoon to check out a possible malware issue. So, I decided to answer. “PCS, how may I help you?” I was met with an angry male voice. 

“I want to speak to the owner!” He said angrily. “Listen. Y’all were supposed to come out here and fix this damned computer today, and it’s still just as slow and unusable as it was this morning.” On top of that, the webcam light won’t turn off either.” He added.  

I went into full damage control mode, and apologized profusely over and over for the inconvenience. “I see that Tim was supposed to come out there today at 2:30 p.m. today. Do you know how long he was there this afternoon?” I inquired. 

“Hold on. I’ve been at work all day, let me ask my wife….  No wonder the damned computer doesn’t work. She said that nobody came out at all to fix this piece of crap.” Said the man, now completely irate.  
“Again, Mr. Phillips, I am so very sorry for the inconvenience. I can’t imagine what happened to Tim today that made him miss the appointment. I will reschedule a call to your house for tomorrow, and the labor will be on us for your inconvenience.” I said, trying to save a customer.  

The thought of a free service call must have done the trick. His tone changed, and he seemed much more cordial. I penciled him in for 2:30 p.m. the following day and hung up the phone to continue my work.

I was quite annoyed that Tim had missed his appointment and didn’t even bother to call the customer or me to let either of us know what was going on. The more I thought about it the more pissed off I got. I couldn’t take it anymore! I grabbed the phone and tried to call Tim’s cell. Right to voicemail. I left a message asking what happened, and if he was okay since I hadn’t heard from him. I then hung up the phone, and called Jake.

***Ring, Ring, Ring, Ring,*** “Your call had been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. The person you are trying to reach is not available. After the tone, please leave your name and number.” “Dammit! Why does anyone even have cell phones if they don’t know how to answer them?!” I shouted.

About that time the shop phone rang again. I answered it quickly without looking at the Caller ID thinking it might be Jake or Tim. “Hey this is Harry up here at the 911 Dispatch Center. We cannot get any of our system to print to our main laser printer, and it’s causing us to get backed up. We tried to get a hold of Jake on the cell, but all we get is voicemail.”  

“Hi Harry.” I replied. “This is Will. I am just here catching up on some work at the shop. I haven’t been able to reach Jake either. I am sorry to hear about the printing issues you are having, and I would be glad to drive up there and take a look if that’s okay.”  

“Yes please.” He said in a panic. I told him to give me 15 minutes and I’d be right there.

I locked up, got in my truck, and headed up toward the 911 Dispatch Center. My mind wandered back and forth between Tim going AWOL and Jake not answering the cell. He never misses a call from anyone. Especially the 911 center. I arrived at the dispatch center and scanned my badge to open the gate. After parking, I again scanned my badge to enter the building. 

I went back to Harry’s office to let him know I was there. He greeted me, and came out to show me what was going on. Sure enough, none of the print jobs were completing. The print queue was pretty backed up, and it was a mess.  I checked a couple of the workstations, and they all had prints queued up. Odds of the workstations all failing at once was pretty astronomical, so I checked the network. 

The switches all looked good so I moved on to the printer itself. I kneeled down and noticed that there was no link light on the Ethernet port. I disconnected the RJ45 connector and looked it over. One of the twisted pairs inside had broken and the end wasn’t clamped on very well. There was a pile of cable that had been curled up behind the printer that wasn’t even the right color. 

Someone had replaced the original patch cable with this monstrosity. No wonder nothing was printing. I went to the back and measured out about 5 feet of Cat5e cable, and put new ends on. I plugged it into the wall jack, and then into the printer. Voilà! The printer fired up, and out started to pour all of the prints. 

I told Harry that I would wait here until they finished to make sure they completed successfully, and then bring them back to his desk. The printing went on for what seemed like forever, even though it was more like 10 minutes. I gathered up all of the papers and started heading back to Harry’s office. 
As I walked into Harry’s office, I started to show him that they all turned out okay by filing through them a bit. “They all look okay to me.” I said proudly. “I don’t see any banding or smudging in the pri……….”  My heart sank and those hairs on my neck stood on end. 

I grabbed the 4th paper from the top and threw the rest on the desk. The printouts were mugshots being transmitted to the 911 Dispatch Center to add to their local database. They print them out as well to add alphabetically to folders they keep within reach for the dispatchers to check when assisting police.

“No...no… no…. This can’t be happening.” I uttered in disbelief! I rubbed my eyes and looked again, but there was no denying it. There was “Tim.” His name wasn’t even Tim. It was Robert, and he was wanted for the murder of his entire family. The report stated that while they slept, he had crept into his brother’s room and slit his throat. He then took his father’s shotgun and shot his mother and father in bed. 

“Oh, Please No!” I screamed. “Harry! Jake hired this guy a few weeks ago to help us at the shop. He said his name was Tim. I haven’t been able to get a hold of him or Jake today.”

We ran outside and jumped into Harry’s state car. As we headed back into town, Harry radioed for police assistance. We went to Jake’s house. His car was there, but no one answered when we knocked. We waited for the police to arrive. They knocked the door down and did a sweep of his house. No one was there. 

I called Jake’s mom and let her know what was happening, and asked if she had heard from him. She hadn’t heard from him in a few days she said. We all went back over to the shop, and I told the police everything I knew about Tim, and how long he had worked for us. I explained the story of how Jake hired him while I was on my honeymoon, and I really didn’t know anything about him.

One of the officers kept sniffing around and making faces. I apologized for the odor and told him that I thought an animal had died under the building, and that I had called pest control to check it out for me, but they hadn’t made it out yet. He nodded, and went back out to the main showroom. 

I stayed in the back talking to Harry and the other police officers about what was going on. We heard a knock on the back door. It was Jake's mom, and needless to say, she was freaking out. Just as she came in and sat down we heard one of the officers yell out. “Jesus Christ!” We ran out of the office in time to see him burst from upstairs in a panic. He ran to the nearest trash can and threw up. Some of the officers ran upstairs with guns drawn, and I followed behind them. 

The stench was too much, and it got worse the further up you went. At the top, it was all you could do not to throw up. The two freezers were open, and even though it was dark, the flash lights illuminated parts of the floor and the white freezers. There was blood everywhere. The freezers were full of different body parts. Arms, legs, heads, and other assorted body parts. 

On the counter was a small hot plate with a skillet, a knife, a fork, and a stack of paper plates. In the corner was a small sleeping bag along with an old duffel sack with some clothes in it. 

This sick bastard had been killing random people and bringing their body parts to the shop to hide in the freezers upstairs. To make things worse, he was cooking and eating the body parts at night after everyone was gone.  By the looks of it, he had been squatting up there since he got a key to the place. They never did fully identify all of the bodies. I was told later by Harry that they knew the parts were from at least six different people.

Thankfully, Jake was not one of the bodies that had been stored in the freezers. The next day I got a call from him and as it turns out his girlfriend had slept over the night earlier, and she had gotten a call that her mother had a mild heart attack. So, her and Jake took her car and drove last minute all the way to the next state over so they could be with her. 

I explained everything that happened to him, and what was found by the police. Needless to say, we were both questioned heavily. Jake was never the same after that. I sold him my half of the business and moved with my wife to the Southern part of the state so she could be closer to her family.  But it wasn't long before I heard that the business went under. 

Jake slowly started to lose the will to keep it going. He got married, then divorced. Then remarried, and eventually had some kids. Shortly after they were born he and his wife just up and moved to India to do mission work for his church. 

We don't really talk anymore. He doesn't use Facebook, and I don't even have his phone number. I see random Posts from his mom and sister with updates on how he is occasionally, but that's it. I will always be grateful to Jake for teaching me about computers and I'm so glad we both survived that incredible ordeal. 

To my knowledge, Tim/Robert was never apprehended by the police. We never heard from or saw him again. I do think about him from time to time. And wherever he is out there, if he ever again tries to eat someone, I sincerely hope that sick bastard chokes on their middle finger!

Can anyone tell me about prospects for admission to reasonable quality MS in Computer Science programs (let's say top 100) after obtaining the software dev degree from WGU? I understand that the WGU degree is not a computer science degree and lacks the more theoretical math/physics content that CS degrees tend to have. Needless to say, these courses would have to be taken either separately before entering a master's program, or as part of the master's program. I do eventually want to do more theoretical, deeper-level work, which, in addition to higher pay, interests me in eventually obtaining an MS, but I have to establish a practical knowledge base first. It seems completing WGU's program and some internships could provide a much quicker route to obtaining practical experience and reasonable pay than the slow process of obtaining a CS undergrad degree at my local mediocre state university, which would probably take me 2 1/2 years starting from fall 2017 (Argh!)

Who is he? Walt Grace, a 14 year old boy

Walt Grace has two paths to take: **Average Walt** and **Entrepreneur Walt**

I wrote this as a text post, but if you would rather watch a video with visuals, it's [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7_9aK5RhM0).

-------

**Average Walt:**

He starts playing video games at 14, bought an Xbox. Realizing he has a strong passion for tech, he continues for two years playing games. Two years later, now 16 years old, he takes a Computer Science course at his High School. Another year goes by, and as he grows into his later teenage years, he sits in his room and learns some programming languages. But he does not have the strength to push his content out into the world. It’s all practice stuff that he saves locally on his little computer. His senior year of high school comes to an end, and he applies to a state college to pursue Computer Science. Throughout his time there, he mainly just gets good grades.


**Entrepreneur Walt:**

He too starts playing video games at 14, and realizes his passion for tech.He decides to start creating YouTube videos, and work for an entire YEAR almost every day editing videos.

Guess what? He FAILED. In the end, he had a mere 50 subscribers. 


The next year he taught himself programming; lots of languages like Javascript and HTML/CSS.
He loved it so much that he went to a lot of hackathons, where you stay up for 24 hours working on projects with teams. A lot of the travel was even paid for by these hackathons! But sadly, he never won any competitions at these hackathons. 

He FAILED.

Next year, now 16 years old, he signs up for a Computer Science class. Because the Comp Sci department is pretty bad a his school, he even starts a club!

At 17, he’s learned a lot of coding at this point, and makes websites to release into the world. He makes a website that allows users to upload and download game modifications. In the end, it does alright, about 300 views a week. Not a big amount of success. 

So finally, it is the end of senior year and he gets accepted into a state school. Over the next four years he joins the entrepreneurship club, the computer science club, created a startup with some students that never took off. Also works on open source software but no one ever uses it. 

Entrepreneur Walt failed almost every year since he started as a little boy at 14. But who really failed here?

Let’s let their resumes decide, as they leave college and try to get a job. 


**Average Walt:**

* State University

* Majored in Computer Science

* 1 summer internship


**Entrepreneur Walt:**

* State University

* Majored in Computer Science

* 3 Summer Internships

* Incredible video editor (portfolio attached)

* Learned digital marketing and search engine optimization

* Leadership: started CS club

* Expert in many Comp Sci Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascipt, Python, Django(framework), SQL (Database) (portfolio attached, beautiful modding site).

* Member of the board in the entrepreneurship club at college and the computer science club. 


But something even more important happened during Walt’s time at college. Joining all these clubs he met some of the greatest friends he had ever had. Had he not joined, he would have sat alone on a lot of Friday and Saturday nights. 

Average Walt got a job making 30k a year managing databases, while Entrepreneur Walt is currently making 100k a year at a very creative startup, with chances of going public. 


I see so many people scared of starting because of starting, but the real failures are those who do nothing at all.

5o84xf,1,2017-01-15,My boyfriend (20) honestly puts smoking weed ahead of any priorities.. am I wrong for saying anything?,hmw1597,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5o84xf/my_boyfriend_20_honestly_puts_smoking_weed_ahead/,"First &amp; foremost, I don't mind weed. The shitty thing is the fact that it's illegal in my state so there's always the risk of getting busted. I do mind weed when someone worries more about smoke sessions &amp; spending money on it when they are broke &amp; is not in the best place academically or have any sort of stable income.

I love my boyfriend tremendously &amp; there isn't a thing in this world I wouldn't do for him.
But... in my honest opinion, his priorities aren't entirely straight.
He is 20, I'm 19. His first year of college, he moved away. He was not expected to work under the condition he take three classes a semester. Unfortunately, he either failed or withdrew from every class he enrolled in for the entire year. One time while I was visiting, he bought a 200 dollar bag of weed. I was honestly disgruntled to see where his money that he did not work for was going, as his grandparents (who had raised him) sent him money weekly &amp; he was always broke. 
Sophomore year, he moved back home. I moved away for school. He took four classes for the entire year, failing one. Junior year, he spent the semester at home &amp; took two classes he made Cs in. We just moved back to school for the spring, as I moved home during the first semester for an internship, &amp; he will only be taking 3 classes &amp; two of which are the classes he has made Cs in. His third year of college is wrapping up, &amp; he is so far behind...
He has not earned any volunteer hours or joined any extra curriculars. He wants to get into the wildlife school at the university, but I don't think he understands the work ethic it requires.

Keep in mind, he spends more time worrying about what his friends are doing than ANYTHING. He has no idea about the rate at which he wants to take his classes nor does he even know the prerequisites for the school he is trying to attend. Not once has he sat down &amp; planned out any of the things needed for his future. I sent him this, today...

""Love.. I'm not going to sit here &amp; tell you how to live your life. But I feel I'm in the position to help you when it's appropriate.

Once school starts, I hope that you find a hobby aside from sitting with a group of people smoking. Or going out of your way to do it every single day &amp; only do that, work, &amp; school. You also need* that outside stuff to get into a good school, like extra curriculars. I hope you find something healthy to do with yourself that builds you physically or mentally. You're better than people that only do what they have to do &amp; with no intent to indulge in another craft or build another skill. You're blessed &amp; I'd hate to see that be in vain..
I'm not saying I'm not proud of you. Getting high isn't that big of a deal, but it just isn't a good thing to do every single day. Especially when you're tight on money. You haven't asked about getting your books or anything like that. I'm just being honest &amp; I know I'm not in the best position to say anything, but I'm trying to get my priorities straight. I just hope your first year of school isn't repeated with the weed. 

It kills me to see you rather get high than go run, join a group, or do something good for yourself.""

To which he sent back ""🙄""
I don't want to sound condescending. I hate that my efforts are annoying to him. Considering that I am the one who registers for his classes &amp; tries to figure these things out for him. I know I shouldn't step in with these things, but I can't stand to see him fail..

What should I do?"
5o8vzt,3,2017-01-15,In a tricky situation. I have the option to make significant changes but there are drawbacks. 20 y/o college student struggling with depression since age 13,moeabbas96,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5o8vzt/in_a_tricky_situation_i_have_the_option_to_make/,"You guys ready to hear a story? I hope so.

I am currently a 20 year old college student going to school at a well-known 4 year university. Everything looks great on paper. 3.5 GPA, tons of extra curriculars, solid social life, and just got an internship locked in place.

However...

There are underlying problems. Of course, right? I was diagnosed with depression at age 13. When I was 12, my Sudanese parents got divorced, and my dad literally packed his stuff and walked out of the house without describing any of the details to me. My little sister was 4 at the time, and according to her, she witnessed some fights between my parents. That fucked her up real good. She's now 12 and has to take numerous medications to combat her (literally) psychotic depression. I have also thought about taking medication and have tried counseling, but I try to push forward without much treatment as a way to trick myself into thinking that I'm strong. Now both me and my 12 year old sister live with my dad, and he has a very negative view towards depression. Essentially, he believes that it doesn't exist, which has put a major filter in our relationship. I'm not allowed to show negative feelings, and I sure as hell know this because every time my 12 year old sister cuts herself, he makes her feel bad for feeling bad, only making the problem worse (""THIS IS THE WRONG THING TO DO!!! ARE YOU STUPID??). In other words, it seems this guy is pretty emotionally challenged. He is very hard to communicate with, and oftentimes he'll just stare at you instead of speaking his mind. Very uncomfortable.

Now, that's just the backstory. I've explained that I go to college, still live at home, and that my sister lives with us too. Now, recently, just me and my sister decided to spend a week in Greensboro in order to see our mom. There was the usual shit-talking about dad, since mom definitely has a lot against him at this point (dad divorced her while she had no steady income, got remarried, and continued to pursue his career as a professor). Now, when we drove back to our hometown, both me and my sister were dreading how miserable it was going to be. We both hate living in that house, as we find it to be a pretty toxic environment. We drive back, park the car near the driveway, walk in, and notice that dad has a very strange look on his face. Not unusual. Weird dude. I go upstairs and unpack my things, then start reading Quora on my phone. All of a sudden, my dad yells my name and asks what my GPA is. I tell him it's a 3.5 overall, but I only got a 3.0 last semester since I ended up getting a C in one class. Shitty professor. I expected disappointment since a C isn't the greatest news in the world, but my dad looked completely furious. He gives me a stare equivalent to that of Satan's, and says ""you and I need to have a talk."" He then has his wife (my stepmom) make him some hot chocolate, and he makes me sit there and wait while he finishes his mug (plus he chugged the shit down like his tongue was made of steel... Jesus). Then, he makes me get in his car, and for about 5-10 minutes, we're driving in absolute silence and I have no idea where we're going. He parks in some random ass spot on the campus I go to, and says ""WHERE IS THE RED BAG IN THE BASEMENT?!""

Dear. Fucking. God. What's he talking about?!

My dad found out I had friends over one week while he was gone, and accused me and my friends of stealing it. Now, there is a reason he was so on edge. There was an incident in the past when something was stolen from the house while my parents were gone, and it was fairly recent too. However, we settled this personally without getting the police involved. Knew the guy pretty well... best friend in middle and high school actually. I decided to let the guy chill in my house while I go to work one day... then he trips on acid, has a terrible trip, and goes batshit nuts. Yeah. Long story.

Anyway, I knew that this time nothing was actually stolen, since I basically kept an eye on my friends during their entire visit at the house. They did spend the night, and yes, something could have happened while I was asleep, but these guys aren't anyone to take anything. My dad said he wanted to get the police involved, and once I told them that, they said ""yes, please, let's get this over with to prove that we didn't do anything."" To me, that says something about the validity of their innocence. I keep telling my dad that I had no idea what he was talking about, yet kept saying ""TELL ME RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENED"" and continued to call me stupid, unappreciative, ungrateful, defiant, and that the wiring in my brain is off. He wouldn't even tell me what the bag looked like, or when he found out it was apparently stolen. He then tells me that he doesn't trust me anymore, and once we get home, I'm at my breaking point. After talking to some relatives, I make this super emotionally charged decision to pack all my belongings and move to Greensboro. 

Obviously, this upset my dad, and he tried to guilt trip me into coming back, saying ""you don't fix a mistake by making another mistake"" and ""you must make amends and apologize to me in front of everyone in the house."" I didn't wanna deal with that. My new plan was to find a job in Greensboro, work for a semester, then come back to school off student loans, grants, and scholarships. Over time, my dad begins to feel a bit bad, calls my mom, and forces me to talk to him on the phone. I tell him we need to fix the communication aspect in our relationship, since the underlying problems that led me to make the decision to go to Greensboro came from lack of communication... since I was scared of him. He told me he agreed with me.

I still wanna move out at this point. Even though we have sort of made up, I have a feeling he's never truly going to change. I am thinking about moving out now and paying the rest of college myself through student loans. I have the option to take out a $7500 loan this semester, and have already found an apartment room. All I need to do is finalize things.

Is this a reasonable decision? Before, my dad was paying for my tuition, yet held that over my head as a way to stay in the house, because he doesn't want me to be entitled to his money. He's pretty tight about these things. If I take out the loan and continue to take out loans, I will graduate with debt on my plate... but I'll be away from my dad. I think this is what I really need. I'm thinking a certain distance in our relationship will allow things to reset, instead of complicate, which is very possible if I stay in the house.

I just want to be fucking happy... I want to feel free

Anyway, wanted to get some feedback on a situation from last semester. 

Basically, this girl I know from school texted me one night asking for help using Excel for a class project. I’ve known her about a year, not that well though, I’d say we’re friendly acquaintances. I had mentioned once that I was basically an excel grunt at my internship over the summer, so she said she figured I’d be able to help. After some back and forth texting, she asks me to come to her dorm and help her. Wasn’t sure what to expect, but at this point in my life I’m not passing when a girl invites me to her dorm, regardless of the context.

So I go over and start by trying to explain how to do what she wants. Eventually though, I end up just doing the assignment for her (it was a marketing class, so it was legit adding a few columns in a spreadsheet and moving some stuff around, took 15 minutes).  Once it’s done, we talk a bit and get to flirting and after a bit we end up hooking up. I left an hour or two later.

I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing but then got to thinking. Did I play this right? I mean I basically sprinted over there as fast as I could when she asked me to and then proceeded to do her homework for her. Feeling a bit like maybe I got used. On the other hand, I did get some action, which was the goal after all. What should I do if this comes up again this semester (hasn’t started yet)?"

I myself am a full stack web programmer, but I know someone that I think has an aptitude for the UI/UX field.  He's done a Udemy course or two, but I was hoping there might be some good advice here on how to break into this field?  

If you were just starting out right now, how would you do it?  I think if he could start landing freelance style gigs that would be ideal since location might be an issue, but I'm sure he would be open to jobs or even internships if that's the best way to go and he had the opportunity.

What would he really need to know?  Who does he approach and what exactly does he offer?  While I'm sure UI is always a part of it, are there roles that are more purely UX?  That's what I think he would probably be best at.  And doesn't this area cross over into things like market research, focus groups/surveys, that kind of work?  I'm just trying to help him break out of bullshit entry level labor, so any insight you can give into the first steps of a user experience professional and the career options would be much appreciated."
5occ7k,16,2017-01-16,"Choose Paraguard because of my bipolar disorder, ended up loving it.",mymainismythrowaway1,birthcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/5occ7k/choose_paraguard_because_of_my_bipolar_disorder/,"I love my Paraguard! I got it on Halloween at Planned Parenthood! TL;DR: it's the best thing ever.

I have bipolar 2 disorder, and take a lot of medication for it. The medication decreases efficacy of hormonal birth control and it's efficacy is decreased by hormonal bc. Also, I'm worried about mood effects of hormonal options. Therefore, my only very effective option was Paraguard. Also, I have hypomanic episodes where I am very impulsive and can be hypersexual. There is a possibility that I could decide to get pregnant on a whim and stop birth control, so I wanted something that's hard to stop and doesn't take any action to use.

I didn't want to go on the pill as I'm bad at taking pills at the same time. I take them twice a day within about a 4 hour range, every day, but that's not really good enough for the pill. I also didn't want hormones of any sort as they can effect doseing of medications and add another variable to my mood. I need effective birth control that takes no effort and is hard to stop for those hypomanic hypersexual moments. In addition, I'm on medication that can cause birth defects, am 18 and in no place to raise a child, and have decided to get an abortion if I'm pregnant(2.2% chance over 12 years) in the next few years. I've discussed this with my boyfriend and he is on board with my decision. 

I had never been to a gynecologist before my appointment, and had only ever had fingers, tampons, menstrual cups, a double ended dildo, and a ""small"" dildo from bad dragon in my vagina. I'm bisexual and was in my first sexual relationship with a guy. I also present rather butch and was nervous about going to the gyno. Turns out I had nothing to worry about. I made an appointment over the weekend, and had it either Monday or Tuesday.  

My boyfriend drove me there, we passed the protestors outside the gates (good ol' Virginia), we glared at them, we were buzzed in the first and second doors, the staff was very nice and handed me some forms from behind bulletproof glass. I handed them my insurance card and they scanned it. The forms were very LGBT friendly, asking sex, gender, and pronouns as separate boxes, and offering a few options for sexual orientation and sexual history. They buzzed me back, but did not let my boyfriend back for safety reasons (they don't want forced birth control and want to ask about abuse without extra people around). I was with a staff member without bulletproof glass for the first time at the center. They took my vitals and had me pee in a cup for a pregnancy test. They then sent me to the exam room and I saw stirrups for the first time in my life. I waited there for 10 - 15 minutes. 

Then a nurse practitioner and an intern walked in, wearing Halloween costumes. They gave me 800 mg ibuprofen, the first pain med I took that day. I was not on my period, and I don't remember where I was in my cycle. They asked me whether I knew about the side effects and I talked to them about heavier periods and cramping. They asked me about my sexual history and I said I'd never had intercourse, but had done other things. Then, they asked me why I chose Paraguard, I explained about the bipolar and hormones and the general advantages of LARC(long acting reversible contraception). They determined that I was low risk for STIs, due to my sexual history and lack of symptoms. Then they warned that my uterus might not be large enough and my cervix might not open, especially as an adolescent. They also said I could tell them to stop at any time during the procedure and they'd stop and we'd talk about other options. They asked whether I wanted to hear all the details or if I just wanted to play on my phone and distract myself. I'd read enough insertion stories to feel comfortable about what was going on, so I just went on my phone and browsed reddit. 

Then, they inserted the (extra large) speculum. It was the first speculum I'd ever seen, but it had nothing on my ""small"" bad dragon dildo. They put a little clamp on my cervix, which pinched a little, inserted the sounding thing, which felt super weird and hurt/pinched/cramped some, announced that my uterus was large enough for Paraguard (the largest IUD on the US market and the only non hormonal very effective birth control option) and that the worst was over. They then inserted the Paraguard and it hurt/pinched/cramped again, but not as badly this time. They cut the strings a little long. It was over in less than 3 minutes. The process was easy and not very painful, nothing like the horror stories I'd braced myself for. 

They gave me a little card that had the serial number, the Planned Parenthood phone number, the provider's name, and to come back in 2030 written on it. They told me to come back when I'm 21 for my first pap smear. I left and went to the bill person and I had no copay. 

I had cramping for the next 6 - 8 hours, perfectly manageable with advil. I got a little spotting for a few days, and they was it. I'd had amazing periods before, light, 4 days, maybe a half day of cramping, every 29 days. I'd used regular tampons and pads the whole time, even overnight, for years. My first period on Paraguard was still light, minimal cramping, but it lasted 7 days. My second period on Paraguard was heavier, I had to buy heavier tampons and overnight pads, but it only lasted 5 days and had no cramping. The periods are supposed to get shorter and lighter over the first six months to a year, but even if they don't, I'm fine with this.

The strings were about 2 inches long and stiff. My boyfriend complained about them attacking him, but we still had plenty of sex. I went to a private gyno to get the strings cut, the IUD checked, and to have my first gyno exam, in early January. Getting the strings cut took over ten minutes, and the NP had to leave the room multiple times to get more tools, but it didn't hurt at all. The IUD was in position. I was on my period at this appointment, and the gyno was unfazed. They also gave me a pregnancy test, which was funny. I was triple not pregnant: I have an IUD, was on my period, and passed a pregnancy test.

I'm really glad I was able to get the copper IUD, as it is the only non hormonal option that doesn't require action every time you have sex. It's a great benefit for hypomania, as I can't decide to get pregnant on a whim, and if I did get it removed, my partner would know and be able to talk me down, convince me to get EC, and pull out. 

 Sorry for the length, I just love my Paraguard so much and want other women to be aware that's it's not always a bloody nightmare."
5oce1c,1,2017-01-16,"I [26 M] with my gf [26 F] of three years (LDR) - I am going through a crisis, while she focuses only on her life.",roastedbacooon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5oce1c/i_26_m_with_my_gf_26_f_of_three_years_ldr_i_am/,"Hi there, 

I don't really know how to begin this. I am actually writing this close to tears (and I am actually that kind of guy with a thick skin). I feel so confused, unhappy and unsatisfied in every aspect of my life. Today I had one of these moments were I wished I could erase my memory completely and start as somebody else.

Maybe I should give a little details. 

We are dating now more than three years and living in a ldr for approximately 2.5 years. We both live in different countries in Europe. So seeing each other shouldn't bet that difficult, right? Well, 2016 has been hell for me. After graduating I immediately got a job-offer and work there ever since - it's been more than stressful and it still is. As my gf just started graduate school back then, I supported her in every aspect I could. Times been rough. 

I'll try to sum it up: 

I've been under a lot of stress, she decided to go abroad for an internship for eight months in Japan,  I visited her (wasn't really cheap with my current salary) and usually stayed up late at night or woke up really early in the morning to video call her when I was in my home country (didn't really work out because she either forgot or suddenly had plans with friends or was just too tired). 
She came back, continued grad school, focuses on all her projects there, goes on trips abroad with friends and family (she never asked me to join) or student organisations. When we see each other it's usually just for 4-5 days maybe every second months. She just decided to go with her sister to Brazil for a month and will be in South Africa for two months in the summer. 

OK, this might sound like complaining about first world problems. But actually it's been really tough for me to always agree with her schedule. I didn't really have a vacation last year where I could really rest actually (and health wise I have to pay the price for that right now - your body can be right ungrateful when you work all the time and constantly have stress). I spent every single day of my vacation in order to see her and occasionally payed for her flight tickets, while she always has other plans. A couple of months ago I raised this issue and she said that she could understand and she promised to make more time for me. But I currently don't feel any change (it's the opposite tbh). 

As mentioned in the title, I am going through a crisis atm. Work has been great, even though it's been more than stressful. I was promised an excellent permanent contract. But yeah things didn't really work out and for now I have to deal with an extension for another year even though I only received positive feedback from the C-level guys. Also speaking of health issues: I currently get checked for a brain tumor (another thing that causes sleepless nights) since I am dealing with strong headaches for over six months now. She barely asks questions on how work is going and such. And even less questions about my health. 

I feel like everything in her life is so much more important then what I do for her or what I am going through. She promised to look for an internship in my city so we could move in together in the summer. I asked her so many times to send me her résumé, since she wants to do an internship in the field I am currently working in. She never sent it to me and I stopped asking for it last month, because my own problems gained the upper hand. And it could be so easy actually if she only let me help her. 

I don't know...Maybe I just need a reality check. But I just feel so exhausted. I can't continue with all this anymore. But I know somehow that I still love her. I just feel so unappreciated for a couple of months now. 

I just want to know: Are my feelings justified or am I overreacting? Have you ever been in such situation and if so, how did you deal with it?

Thanks a lot in advance.

TL;DR: having a lot of stuff on my plate, gf only focuses on her stuff even though she promised to change, barely asks questions on when we see again, never makes plans with me but only for others, feeling as unhappy as never before in my life currently, don't know how to continue or how to tackle the issue.

5ocuk6,8,2017-01-16,Skils/Resources to complement Math major?,TigerLilly00,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/5ocuk6/skilsresources_to_complement_math_major/,"Hi guys, so I've been looking and applying for summer internships recently. I've been having very bad luck because I can't seem to find any internships that want math majors - and if they do, they want people who are ALSO engineers or who also code. So I've started to panic.

Even though I've taken some higher level math courses (going into my senior year now), I'm worrying that I simply don't have any desirable skills. I was hoping I'd find an internship or two that would actually teach me real-world skills, but all of them seem to want you to have those skills already.

None of my higher level math classes so far taught me MATLAB, so I figured I'd start by self-teaching that, and I've taken Intro to Programming (using C), but I simply suck at coding, and I'm not sure if that's the path I'd want to take career-wise.

I've been looking at all sorts of internships, from big data analysis to finance, and absolutely no one mentions math as a skill or as a major... I'm so panicked that I'm seriously considering changing my major and spending another year or two in school... because I don't know what I can do with a simple math degree now.

Please help :(

Thanks"

It would probably be a Friday that I would ask off. 

The reason is because of a 3-day festival that I've been to for the last two years. It's essentially the one time during the year where I get to see my friends who attend from around the world. Ideally I would like to ask for Friday and Monday off, but Friday will suffice.

Is this an awkward question to ask the recruiter?

I wasn't sober for that, but you know, whatever. I went to college. I stayed in college. It took a large percentage of my lifespan to finish college. I wasn't sober for most of that either, but I did it. I worked hard, I had nine million part time jobs, and I got pregnant. It was hard, I cried a lot, I stared at him crying in his crib for hours sometimes because I didn't think I could do it, but somehow I did. I graduated with honors, I was actually sober for that. My mom passed away just before I graduated, so my son watched me from the audience as I walked the stage and bawled because it was so hard and so bittersweet because I did it for my mom, but I finally did it. I put my son into private school while I worked soul sucking entry level post-bachelor's jobs that made me suck down xanax like tic-tacs and cry behind my closed office door every lunch break. It was hard, but I managed. For a while. Now, here I am hitting another bump in the road that I know will pass but I just want to throw my hands up in the air, climb into a blanket burrito with some xanax and netflix and never come out. My anxiety is so bad these days, I have several attacks a week with no insurance to help me see a doctor because my current employer, which was supposed to be a stepping stone, does not offer insurance, or a livable wage, or consideration, or respect. Basically, nothing that makes a job even remotely tolerable.

When I applied for this position, after leaving the soul sucking suckdom of social services, I made it very clear that I have a small school age child and no family or friends to assist me with his care. I told them the rotating shifts I could work during the weekdays, and what I could work on the weekends. I volunteered for holidays, extra shifts, and doubles to make up for the obvious lack of total flexibility. They agreed, they hired me, they scheduled me appropriately. Until I said something. I mentioned a conflict with a co-worker that I could not remedy without mediation. I feel like this particular co-worker is blatantly sexist. It made me uncomfortable. I felt beat down by this person, and was not heard by them. Literally. Some toddler level, arm crossing, huffing in the corner until they got their way not listening. They accused me of being the problem and proceeded to schedule me for shifts that I can not work. When I pointed it out the first time, they apologized and remedied the situation. The second time, I somehow took the blame. The third time, this time, and I'm just being unreasonable. Please, tell me in what world it is legal to leave a seven year old at home alone from 3am, when my dad goes to work, until 8-9am when I get off that god forsaken shift. For an added sprinkle of fun, he has to be at school before 8am, and they're truancy compliant with the city so they will call law enforcement to fine, or lovingly jail me for failure to send my child to school at all, or on time. Then, for fun, let's just get him kicked out of the ridiculously overpriced posh school that I'll still have to pay for despite him not being able to take full advantage of the program he is finally excelling in.

So, basically, I told them I would not be going to work tonight, a school night, three days ago but they did not listen and now I am 99.99% certain I will not have a job by 9am and that will cut off my access to an open internship to actually begin using my degree for something productive and helpful.

All the while, as I'm sitting in my blanket burrito under the TV writing this, my son is in the background rubbing balloons together to make that sweet screeching sound oblivious to everything, offering me literal pennies to pay bills, and all I want to do is tie him to the bookshelf and have a glass of wine. But I can't do that, so I'll just have to endure the screeching, and the rising panic, and stare longingly at the bottle of Jager I rarely reach for because in about ten minutes Mommy has to get her ass back up, cook dinner, clean the house, and start the bedtime ritual because it's not his fault mom feels like a total loser today."
5oewi5,3,2017-01-16,[M4F] Now Hiring: Director of Research and Development,MiniatureLongHorse,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5oewi5/m4f_now_hiring_director_of_research_and/,"Prepare for the wall of text necessary to introduce the Facility for Human Genetics and Fertility Research! The fun part about this setup is it lets you create your character without breaking play, and has all the options you could ever want. So, first comes my original prompt, which also contains the original promotional material.

Short Note: Read from the top down. The lower sections contain information you'll only be interested in if you like the previous stuff. If you would like to make suggestions or ask question before diving all the way in, please do! I understand that you would want to get a handle on this before committing!

Also, this is *not* a hucow prompt. It's all about genetic research and selective breeding. Women will be treated as human beings and willing test subjects, but this world does have... *relaxed* views on sexuality. Chalk it up to a near-apocalypse that drastically reduced the human population to the point things just barely got back to normal, and now it's seen as an honor to be selected for advanced breeding. Pregnancy and fertility are desirable traits in this world, so keep that in mind.

Ideally, I would prefer my partner to be the head of Research and Development and the Facility. Your job would be to design, monitor, and administer fertility treatments and gene therapy. However, this job description is up for negotiation, considering the Facility is always open to new research. As the Director of Operations, I expect you to focus on your work at first, but you could convince me to let you engage in deeper, crazier research or eventually use yourself as a test subject or breeder. Really, anything is up for grabs.

I don't mind first or third person, but I do prefer to write in paragraph or longer segments. Sorry, but text speak will not be tolerated. Grammatical or spelling errors will be cheerfully tolerated, because no one is a good editor when excited. I am looking for a writing partner, so be prepared to write a paragraph of at least five to seven complex, detailed sentences. Describe what you feel, what you do, and what you think as well as what is going on around you. The more you give me, the more I can give back.

One or two sentence replies a la ""I fucked it."" will not be tolerated. If you're looking for a quick, superficial exchange, then I am not your man. No offense, but I prefer a really good, involved story, preferably with some stupid humor mixed in.

Kinks: Breeding (no shit...), dubious and full consent, bondage, humor, bodywriting, cumplay, and a whole slew of other things made apparent later

Maybes: Futa (it would be interesting to have a subject that can both impregnate and be impregnated), military (maybe we can explore a top-secret genetics project), bestiality (combine the conventional farm with the unconventional, add some science, and I might be convinced to see where it goes), furry (maybe we go absolutely crazy with genetic research) 

Limits: Non-con (okay, I could be convinced to do a really good non-con plot, but it's gotta be good), bimbo (we want good genetics), violence, blood, toilet play

Sitting behind my wide mahogany desk, my corporate email for the Facility's directorship pings a notification that a profile had just come in from our latest recruitment effort. The Facility recently got in contact with fertility clinics and private practice doctors to offer our services to an expanded clientele base. Considering the participants in our can only be impregnated once every twelve months or so, much of our insemination equipment was sitting idle. We decided to offer the equipment to those seeking sperm donors, allowing them to pay for our services and keep the child. We also started a Bring Your Own Sperm program for couples having difficulty conceiving or just looking for a way to liven up their babymaking.

Clicking open the application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting cows strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

Okay, if you haven't noticed, I write a lot. I love detail. Simile, metaphor, hyperbole, chiasmata... These things are all my friends. I do not expect you to be able to fully match the way I write. Humble brag, but I hold awards for my SFW writing. If you can match or exceed me... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! If you want me to help you improve your writing while having some sexy fun... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! Just please, please make the effort!

So, in regards to how I want you to start, fill out the form and send it in. I will judge our compatibility based on the scene you write about flipping through the promotional materials and reacting to their contents.

Maybe you really like the technical documents displaying women becoming mothers from the machines whirring between their legs. Maybe the pictures from Live Audition with new, young test subjects caught the moment they feel their first child squirting into their wombs. Maybe you really like the diagrams of the combination breeding/milking racks, showing warm white fluid entering a woman between her legs and leaving from her chest. I don't know, so you gotta tell me. Dig through that recruitment package and find the things that make you excited! There's a reason we send out these packages!

For example, maybe you were watching ""Eighteen and Pregnant"" when the recruitment package arrived. Firing up the probe, you affix a ""For Hire"" sticker over your lower stomach and a ""Wide Loads Welcome"" to your inner thigh. Bending your back over your couch, you arch your breasts into the air, displaying the flat stomach you were applying, no begging, to have ruined. The bright stickers flash as the probe burrows into your folds. You writhe, imagining the warm metal spewing the thick, life-giving fluid into you that you could never convince a man to give up. It feels almost as good as you imagine it will when you win the Grand Prize, placed on a pedestal upon which motherhood will be pumped into you. Your walls clamp down hard as an orgasm rocks your body. The probe lights up, displaying a disturbingly high percentage, your womb sucking eagerly at the tip of the probe. That's when the camera clicks, catching your body in its full, hungry glory. Looks like we got ourselves a winner... (This was an example. Write your own!)

I wrote that part in because it's so much easier to bring someone in as the Grand Prize winner, and also a lot more fun. It lets me be excited to meet you, and not just ""Oh, boy... Another womb..."" So, give it a shot? The form is meant to be an exposition of what you want from the roleplay, and that part was good, but you gotta give me more to work with if you want the really good stuff.

What is the difference if any? Why would you want to do one over the other?
5ogakk,9,2017-01-17,Need some help on determining which program is best for my needs...,16inchsoftball,Turfmanagement,https://www.reddit.com/r/Turfmanagement/comments/5ogakk/need_some_help_on_determining_which_program_is/,"Hi everyone. This will be a long post but I'd appreciate further insight. I have asked this place for help before and I have learned a lot of interesting things in the past as well from other posts. I have a bachelors degree in a completely unrelated field (History) 

Rutgers has the two 10 week programs in either the fall or winter which is great to work around the season. I applied, sent in my letter of intent and had 2 employers send in a letter of recommendation. Just waiting to here back from them. However, I am from the Midwest so housing and other expenses like transportation there and getting to class daily is a big concern for me. It will easily cost me over for the two week session. More if I can't find a roommate at least $7,000 more. 

I was with another superintendent to study for the Illinois Pesticide tests and I told him about really wanting to further my career. Told him about my 10 week certificate from Ohio State online and he was surprised that I already had a 10 week certificate after this past year was my first full year in the industry. I mentioned to him about Rutgers and he also mentioned Penn State. That's where I'm beginning to reassess my decision in going to Rutgers. After some research the following options are from Penn State:

http://plantscience.psu.edu/majors/online

The online degree/certificate options are plentiful. They are online and they cost about 600 dollars per credit hour.
-Turfgrass certificate 15 credit hours run me about $9,000
-Turfgrass advance certificate 30 credit hours would be me about $18,000.
-Associate degree in turfgrass- Looking at 61 credit hours at just under 600 dollar a credit. Is this degree really that much better then Rutgers 2 year turf program which I'm sure acts just like a 2 year degree. It's convenient that I don't leave my house, but it will run my $30,000. Rutgers I predicted would run be at least 18,000 if I get a roommate for housing but not including transportation/food/entertainment fees.
-bachelors degree in turfgrass- I wouldn't persue this because I already have a 4 year degree.
-Masters in turfgrass- Maybe later on? But I doubt it

Ohio State- I have a certificate that was 600 dollars. It was an online certificate that lasted 10 weeks called ""golf course management"" I completed the class in less than a week with an 85% overall grade. I don't remember much, just the different types of grass and some cold/warm weather decision making on golf courses. Don't remember the names of many insects/disease patches. I do realize that you will learn mostly on the job (which I am.) However, I know most jobs require a 2-4 year degree.Ohio State also offers another 10 week online certificate called ""advance golf course management"" for 600 bucks. I was told the 2 year Rutgers program will essentially give me a leg up against other people even thought it's just a certificate because it's not in semester form. I assume Ohio state would be similar? Completing two ten week online programs could land me a job that requires a 2-4 year turf degree? At literally less than 5% of the cost Rutgers would cost me I could just get a second 10 week program online?

It's worth noting that I will be working as an assistant superintendent or superintendent on public courses for a company I work for currently. I'm working on getting hired full time, year round as either a foreman or assistant in 2018. I work for a public company that I know is really bad for superintendents in terms of budgeting for labor and just overall costs of running a golf course. However, if I stay here for at least 5 years before moving onto private/country clubs where bigger responsibilities means more money and what not I think this experience would be good on a resume and perhaps put me past for people applying to private clubs with no real experience other than summer interns.

At the end of the day my main options are:
Rutgers 2 year certificate which I heard a lot of good things from. Penn States 2 year associates, which is going to be expensive but all online (saved money on transportation/housing + more convenient for me.) Or finish Ohio States second 10 week program that I will most likely finish in a week for 600 bucks. I will then have two 10 week certificates from Ohio State and I then would apply for assistant superintendent jobs and foreman jobs within my company for the 2018 golf season. As by 2018 golf season I'll have 2 full years of experience as well as a couple months from a few years back (all under the company) The experience at the public courses I will work at might help me get a job at a bigger course because of my experience working with a smaller crew + lower budget.

Can anyone give me their own suggestion on what they would do? Also, I think I have the right idea. I won't have to do any summer interns if I just get an assistant job at a course will low budget and perform well and what not. At least that's my view point. Any help/pointers/tips is much appreciated and I'll respond to anyone else that replies in PM and on the topic."

**Julian Green ist auch knapp zwei Wochen vor dem Start in die Rückrunde mit dem sicherlich nicht einfachen Auswärtsspiel beim FC St. Pauli der einzige Neuzugang des VfB Stuttgart, was freilich nicht so bleiben muss.** Vielmehr halten die Schwaben intensiv Ausschau nach weiteren Verstärkungen, wie Sportvorstand Jan Schindelmeiser gegenüber den [Stuttgarter Nachrichten](http://ift.tt/2hML2Py) durchblicken ließ.

Wir prüfen einige Optionen ganz genau. (Jan Schindelmeiser)

_„Auch wenn es nach außen hin ruhig aussieht in Sachen Neuzugänge können sie mir glauben, dass dies intern nicht der Fall ist und wir einige Optionen ganz genau prüfen“_, so Schindelmeiser, der gemeinsam mit Trainer Hannes Wolf wohl vor allem nach einem zentralen Mittelfeldspieler fahndet.

### Trainerwechsel in Palermo?

Und möglicherweise wird der VfB auch noch einen neuen Innenverteidiger verpflichten, wenn der im Raum stehende Wechsel von [Toni Sunjic zu US Palermo](http://ift.tt/2iGLbTq) wie geplant über die Bühne geht. Beide Vereine haben sich schon auf die Eckdaten einer Ausleihe (200.000 Euro Leihgebühr plus Kaufoption über 1,7 Millionen Euro) geeinigt und auch Sunjic selbst ist mit Palermo einig, doch weil beim Tabellenachtzehnten der Serie A, der schon acht Punkte Rückstand ans rettende Ufer aufweist und der bekannt ist für seinen Trainerverschleiß, Coach Eugenio Corini wackelt, sind Transfers wohl erst einmal hinten angestellt.

**Sowohl Sunjic als auch der VfB müssen somit warten und mit dem Risiko leben, dass das Leihgeschäft doch noch platzt. In diesem Fall hätte sich wohl auch die Suche nach einem neuen Innenverteidiger erledigt.**

Schafft der VfB den direkten Wiederaufstieg? [Jetzt wetten!](http://ift.tt/2jT7Ytd)

5ojf34,2,2017-01-17,Series of why questions,athrowaway9182,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5ojf34/series_of_why_questions/,"Over the past week or two, I have been in an  existential crisis. My new years resolution was to begin NoFap, quit weed and stop hanging out with my druggie friends.  I have been pretty successful so far, in that I can say about 10/17 days have been successful with all three resolutions, and have completely ignored the druggie friends the entire time.  However I have also had suicidal thoughts since I've started, which I attribute to chemical imbalances in my brain, loneliness and stress.
      For some background, I am a computer science sophomore at a prestigious university, am currently doing an internship during my winter break, and in a few days will go back to school. I have never really stopped working for very long in some form since I started school freshman year, as I took summer courses.  When I return in a few days, I will be taking a very difficult course, where I will have very little time.  I am worried that starting in a few days, my life will have diminishing time for pleasure/relaxation, and increased stress. 
      Given that I have suffered with depression for about 7 years now, and haven't been enjoying the time I have currently very much, I can't foresee how my future, which will probably only decrease in free time, will be worth living.  I see it as my life will only decrease in net pleasure (pleasure-pain), and that I am basically currently in the negative zone. As in I have gotten to the point where I spend more time unhappy than happy. 
     Now when I am not in a suicidal thought loop, (like now as I am typing this, no need to move this to suicide watch or anything) I recognize that rationally the answer isn't death.  I am still worried about the upcoming semester but I recognize that I would've done it already after 7 years of this shit.  However I also fear the fact that this 7 year rollercoaster of ups and downs will continue.  I also don't really want anything.  I understand that if I work real hard, I can become successful, and that I have opportunity that many don't, and that I am most likely capable of success, but I wonder why. So what if I become rich, have a family, travel or whatever.  Why.  Are those things really worth it, if I have more working hours than enjoyment hours? Now I know there is the phrase pick a job you love and you'll never work, but I don't really love doing many things, let alone doing that for a living, even if a job doing that was guaranteed.  I love bike riding, but wouldn't want to race.  I love programming, but feel trapped in the classic societal 40 hour workweek for the rest of my life (will exceed 40 hours this semester...).  I have no desire for success, so whats the point.  Suicide seems like a one quick fix for all of my problems ever.  I have no consideration for those around me that might be impacted, as I won't be around.  So I am actively looking for something to live for, as the meaning of life is what I give it.  I think I'm spoiled in the fact that childhood/adolescence has given me ample time to enjoy life, and I didn't enjoy it properly (drugs/shitty friends).

My question is, why? Why do anything, when I can just give up and never have to worry about it again.
Sorry for the ultra long post."

5okg62,332,2017-01-17,Debbie Diva meets the Doctor,LadyLlamaDrama,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5okg62/debbie_diva_meets_the_doctor/,"Hey ya'll, hope everyone is doing well on this fine day. The last time I left you, we were talking about how DH was just coming home from his internship after being diagnosed with cancer. See Bitch Bot for more info. 

So. DH is home. DH is now terrified because he knows that he has cancer, but nobody really knows how bad it is yet. Debbie Diva is still not convinced that this is bad. In fact, she is annoyed that he came home instead of finishing his internship. Meanwhile, I'm trying to get DH scheduled to see a surgeon ASAP because of the numerous masses that were found during his last imaging scan. My dad recommended a few doctors at a specialty hospital near us that we should go to. So I'm calling and trying to get him in there to be seen as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Debbie talks to a friend of hers who is also a doctor. The friend says to her ""Um. This is bad... Like, I don't know what you've been told before, but this needs to be taken care of as soon as possible."" So now all of the sudden, Debbie is all gung ho about getting DH in to see a doctor as quickly as possible. **No shit sherlock. That's what I've been trying to tell you.** So she convinces her doctor friend to pull some strings and get DH in to see a doctor the next day. Alright. Cool. At least she's now on board. So we go to the appointment, and the doc is nice, but he's not a specialist. He's a general surgeon, which means he can pretty much operate on anything. Debbie is convinced that this is where DH needs to have his surgery because ""we know people here"" and ""you'll be treated like a VIP"". Ya'll. VIPs in hospitals do not exist. All patients are treated the same.

So we're having lunch following that appointment with Debbie. And she's going ON and ON about this doctor and what a nice person he was and how we're going to schedule DH's surgery right away. *Record Scratch* Hold up. No. We're going to go see the specialist that we have an appointment with in two days first. THEN if we decide to go with this doc, we can come back here. So I voice this to Debbie and she immediately gets a HUGE CBF. She looks at DH and says to him ""Oh, by the way, did I tell you that Aunt Marge called last week?"" And DH is like ""No mom, you didn't."" Meanwhile I'm sitting there wondering where the fuck she's going with this topic change and what is has to do with the price of tea in China. So DH says ""What did Aunt Marge have to say Mom?"" And Debbie looks right at me and says ""Oh, she was just wondering how you were doing. And I told her all about the little disagreements we've been having. And she said that maybe you should listen to your family instead of your dick. And that maybe you shouldn't be taking advice from people who might not be here in another few years.""

**Um. What?!**

So I'm just sitting there with my mouth hanging open because *did this bitch really just....*

Meanwhile, DH, for the first time ever, shines up his spine a teensy bit and says in this weird and cold voice ""What did you just say?""

Debbie immediately starts backpedaling. There were a lot of ""Ums"" and ""Ahs"" and ""Wells"" peppered through her bullshit excuses as she tried to make DH see that she was just ""trying to be his advocate"" and ""trying to take care of him"". I just got up from the table and walked away. DH followed, which I know **killed** Debbie inside a little bit. So at this point IDGAF,  I'm just walking away from Debbie because if I don't, I might kill her. So DH catches up to me and starts apologizing profusely, telling me that he can't believe that she said that and that he doesn't even know if his Aunt Marge said those things because that doesn't sound like something she would say... Yadda yadda yadda. So I look at DH who is practically ready to cry and I was like ""DH. I'm not upset with you. Nothing that that bitch just said has anything to do with you. This is a power struggle, don't you see that? She's trying to make you choose between me and her."" And it was like a lightbulb came on in his head. He was like ""Yeah I guess you're right Lady. I just don't know what to do with her."" Meanwhile, my inner Llama is like *Oh I know a few fucking things we can do with her* but I just looked at him and was like ""Listen, for right now, don't worry about it. We'll talk about it later. Let's just put on a united front and ignore her."" (I didn't have a super shiny spine back then either). 

So we go out to the car and wait for her (WHY did I let her drive us?!) and she finally comes out and nobody says anything to anyone. We just drive home in complete silence. So we get to my house and Debbie says ""Okay, so DH when are you going to schedule your surgery with First Doctor?"" And DH says ""Well mom, we're going to go see Second Doctor that Lady found first."" And she fucking loses her shit. She starts talking about how unnecessary she thinks this is and how she won't be going to that appointment because ""She's already taking too many days off of work for this"" and how she thinks that DH is being ungrateful to her friend and how embarrassed she is that people pulled strings for him and he was just going to throw it back in their faces. And DH, bless his heart, stood his ground and said ""I don't see why it's a big deal to seek a second opinion. That's pretty much universally recommended for any surgery, right Lady?"" And I'm just sitting in the back seat trying not to let my smug bitch face show and I'm like ""Yupp DH. Definitely recommended. The appointment is this Friday at 3:00 p.m. We're going. Thanks for the ride Debbie."" And at that I get out of the car and walk into my house.

So Friday comes and *magically* Debbie was able to get off of work to go because ""she'll do anything for DH"". Yay. So this time I absolutely refuse to ride with her because I am NOT repeating that fucking nightmare again and I drive down myself. DH chooses to drive down with me which I'm sure just added to Debbie's fanfuckingtastic mood. So we get down there and I'm just ignoring Debbie completely, because why invite trouble, ya know? So the nurse comes out to call us back and ya'll. I know the nurse. I went to school with her. So she sees me and is like ""LADY! OMG! LONG TIME NO SEE! What are you doing here?!"" So we're walking back to the exam room and my friend is just chattering away with me and DH and completely ignoring Debbie, who has by now, turned a nice shade of puce. So we get back to the exam room and my friend gets DH settled and everything and she says to DH ""Oh, wait until you meet Second Doctor. He is FANTASTIC! His patients just love him. He just got back from a mission trip where he was helping to fix cleft palates in South Africa."" I'm trying not to laugh, because Debbie is CBFing so bad that I'm afraid she might implode.

So Second Doctor comes in and examines DH and tells him exactly what he thinks needs to be done. He had very solid approach and his plan was much better than the one First Doctor was planning. Which might have something to do with him being... oh I don't know... the fucking top doctor in his field? Strange how that happens. So Debbie is sitting there with her big ole CBF on and Second Doctor says to DH ""So, do you have any questions?"" Before DH can even say a thing, Debbie hops right on in. ""Um. I have a question. How many times have you done this?"" So I'm sitting there like /Wut? Did she seriously just ask  this specialist how many times he's done this surgery? Really? Meanwhile, Second Doctor is looking confused AF. So he's like ""Um... Several thousand times. This is one of my most common surgeries."" So Debbie goes ""Well, I personally like First Doctor at Small Hospital much better."" So Second Doctor says ""Okay, well you don't have to have surgery with me, but I definitely wouldn't go to Small Hospital. DH's surgery is going to be a complicated one, and you don't want to have that done at Small Hospital."" So Debbie says ""Well I don't understand why you don't like Small Hospital that much. We just felt so much more comfortable there."" So Second Doctor says ""It's not that I have anything against Small Hospital, it's just that I don't think that they're equipped to handle DH's case."" So Debbie says ""Well I think that we're just going to go where I'm most comfortable."" So Second Doctor looks at me and I just raised my eyebrows and send him a look that I hope conveyed *she's a crazy bitch, please be on my side and convince DH how dangerous this is*.

Second Doctor looks at DH and says ""Listen. You're an adult. I'm going to give you some advice here. I don't care where you have your surgery done. It doesn't have to be here and it doesn't have to be with me. You can go to City Hospital One, City Hospital Two, or City Hospital Three. You can ask for Dr. A, Dr. B., or Dr. C. But please don't have this done at Small Hospital. Because they are not equipped to handle your surgery and I'm concerned for what could happen if you have this done there."" So Debbie starts talking and Doctor Two looks at her and says ""MA'AM. I did not ask you to come down here. YOU sought ME out for a second opinion and that is EXACTLY what I am giving you. If you don't like me, that's fine - THERE is the door. But I am telling you right now that you are putting your son's life at risk if you go to Small Hospital. Like I said, go to any of the others I named, because I trained those surgeons and I'm completely confident in their capabilities to handle your son's case."" With that, he stood up, shook DH's hand, and walked out of the room.

Debbie Diva achieved a level of CBF I didn't realize was possible and I looked at DH and said ""Well. Guess we found your surgeon."" And Debbie Diva sat there and didn't say anything... Oh wait. Of course not... But that's a story for next time. ;)"

It is my absolute top choice and even though decisions are coming in 2 weeks, I am getting extremely nervous about my chances. Would be great if you guys could provide some feedback as to where I stand.

Geography: Tennessee, Indian Male

UW GPA: 3.4 (to make this even worse, I have been on a downward trend from 9-11 and I had a C for the year in 11th Math, but I brought it up to a B in semester 1 of senior year)

W GPA: 4.07

Rigor: 5 HL courses, 1 SL course in IB Diploma Program (I have taken the most rigorous curriculum out of anyone in my school) 

Rank: School does not provide as we have a class size of 95

ACT: 36 (english-36, reading-36, science-34, math-36)

Essays: 9/10 (I put more time into the UW essays than any other and got them reviewed by 2 teachers and 2 counselors) 

Recs: I submitted three: one from physics teacher (8/10), one from english teacher (8/10), one from college professor who was my research mentor (9/10)

Interest: I visited UW-Madison in the summer (that's pretty incredible to drive all the way up there from Tennessee right???) and have kept in touch with an admissions counselor from there (emailing her on a monthly basis)

EC's: 
-Research with a college professor for 11 weeks
-Internship with IT firm
-Attended Harvard Summer School
-President of ACT/SAT preparation club with 60 members

I applied for 1st choice Biomedical Engineering 2nd Choice Computer Science // I did not apply for financial aid.

Thanks so much guys. I know it's strange for me to post a chance thread with only 2 weeks till decisions but this is my favorite school and I'm really banking on it. "

5ol87k,260,2017-01-17,My [26 M] Girlfriend [24 F] of 5 years has recently developed an irrational fear of becoming pregnant and its killing our sex life.,Throwaway13378888888,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ol87k/my_26_m_girlfriend_24_f_of_5_years_has_recently/,"I met my girlfriend in college and we both finished our degrees in august and are now doing internships in different cities about 2 hours apart. Our sex-life has been very good for both of us from the beginning on but about half a year ago it became noteably worse and much less frequent. Suddenly, she insisted on using condoms in addition to the pill, stopped initiating sex and only wanted to have sex every 2 weeks or so (previously 2-3 times a week). When we were having sex, it was very lackluster and she seemed very distracted.

I talked to her about it and she told me that she became very afraid of becoming pregnant around that time because her stepsister became pregnant at 19 and only realized it after 5 months so she had to keep the baby. Her stepsister then dropped out of school and left the father of the baby and now lives alone. She also argues a alot with her family because she doesn´t adequatly care for the baby but won´t accept any help/advice.

1 month ago, my GFs *other* stepsister got pregnant at 23 but she doesn´t want kids so she had an abortion which caused a huge fight with her husband who wanted to keep the baby.

Since then, sex has stopped completely. My GF hasn´t initiated once in 6 months and if I initiate now, it´s either migraine, tummy ache or she´s too tired. If we do have sex, she can´t orgasm anymore. She also didn´t take her birthcontrol on purpose multiple times as an excuse so that ""we can´t have sex this month"".

When I talked to her about it she told me that as soon as things get sexual, she can only think of becoming pregnant and how it will destroy her life. I can´t even go down on her or ask for a blowjob without her shutting down completely. When I asked her if she doesn´t miss the sex, she said that right now, the only thing she associates with sex is panic and immense stress and that she would rather not have sex at all at the moment.

Of course I don´t want her to feel bad (so we didn´t have sex since that talk) but I don´t see how this will get better? I love her but I don´t want to be in a relationship without sex forever. Has anyone ever experienced something similar? Are there ways of getting rid of this irrational fear?

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Both my GF´s stepsisters fucked up their lives by getting pregnant involuntarily. My GF can´t have sex since then due to her irrational fear that she will get pregnant from anything sexual despite being on the pill and using condoms. "
5olkiv,5,2017-01-17,Hunt Tips and Tricks,NinjaHedge,testsolution,https://www.reddit.com/r/testsolution/comments/5olkiv/hunt_tips_and_tricks/,"Hi, I'm Michael K.  I really liked solving with TSPI this year, and I saw a lot of questions about how other teams work, and what it takes to be competitive.  I've played on all sorts of teams, from a winning team (Luck), a competitive team that was playing for fun (Palindrome), and also Silly Hat Brigade, Galactic Trendsetters, and Death From Above.

This is my experience from a decade of hunts, if you've got any questions, I'd be glad to share some stories.  

The Hunt is a competition, at the basic level. It is very likely that you will not win.  1 team out of 80 wins every year.  But every team should have a goal, maybe something lofty, like ""Go on the Final Runaround"", ""Finish in the Top 10"", or maybe something smaller, like ""Solve A Meta"".  Whatever it is, make sure a majority of your team is in agreement.  Every couple years, a team wins the Hunt when most of their team didn't actually want to.

""Solving Puzzles"" and ""Having Fun"" aren't goals, because every team is doing that. Solving puzzles is super fun, and they're always available after the Hunt. 

You're trying to unlock things, raise your ranking, and have a sense of accomplishment as a team during a 24-80 hour period.   You've registered a team, paid for travel, and cleared your schedule, you should be trying to do your best.  

Most people think you need lots of hunters to be successful, but this isn't exactly true. Hunts are won and lost based on organization, with the occasional outlier of ridiculously enormous team, or perfect storm of geniuses.  What you really need is a constant stream of solves and an effective method of organization.  

1) Sleep

* Stay up late on Thursday night so that you wake up closer to kickoff, giving you a longer wake cycle. 
* Avoid caffeine for the week prior, then when you have that late night Coffee/Mountain Dew, it'll be more effective.
* Have some people go to bed early on Friday, so that they can wake up early Saturday and have fresh eyes to look at puzzles.  If you look at the graphs of answer submissions, most teams have two hills that reach their peaks on Friday and Saturday night, and two valleys around 3AM Friday, and 1AM Saturday.  
* Unlocking a round of fresh puzzles will always give a team a burst of energy, but if you've been banging your head against the wall on the same few puzzles, get a quick 1-2 hour nap.

2) Leadership

* Choosing one single person to make all your decisions is a really bad idea, because the Captain has to sleep/eat/go to events, and you're stuck if they're not around.  The best method is to use a group of 3-4 team members who agree to respect each others decisions.
* Every 4 hours, any available members of that Team Council check in with the team, finding out what rounds need more answers, which puzzles need fresh eyes, what items still need collecting for scavenger hunts, who is attending events, whether to use hints/free answers, etc.
* The team also needs a Mother/Nanny to take care of the team's physical needs.  Every 4 hours, this role switches to a new person.  This person is responsible for ordering food, organizing the scavenger items, updating the spreadsheets, answering the phone, and making sure the room is clean.  Their word is law for that 4-hour shift, so when they let you know you need a nap/snack, or that you should clean your space, pay attention.
* Every time a solve is made, CELEBRATE the people who made it.  This gets your Pavlovian response a-goin, and helps everyone feel useful.
* Don't focus on the progress of other teams.  I've been on two teams that were actually in the lead of a Hunt, but because of gossip and bad info, thought they were hours behind another team.  The Hunt ends when HQ tells you it does, and there's nothing you can do to stop a team from finding the coin before you.
* If you're really close to unlocking something, going on a run-around, or OMGWTFBBQ.....Winning, wake everyone up, call them at home, and have a meeting with every single person on your team, tell them what you need, and push toward the finish line. 

3) Puzzles

* This is the major area where teams make things not fun. But it's not necessary to trade fun for competitiveness. 
* SUBMIT SUBMIT SUBMIT! There is no penalty for excessive submission of answers. If HQ wants you to lay off, they will let you know. You might feel stupid for submitting countless variations of BUTTSTUFF/BUTTSTIGHT/BUTTSTOUGH, but you'll always feel stupider when it *was actually BUTTSTOUCH*
* Solving works best in small groups of 3-4.  If you're the only person working on something, get a buddy to talk things out with.  If a puzzle already has several people working on the identification or extraction part, you should probably work on something else.
* Unless a puzzle is solved, any method is potentially valid.  However, you don't have to argue or make everyone listen. If you've got a super-crazy idea, duplicate the puzzle sheet, label it ""YOURNAME"" Crazy Idea, and go to town.  If it works, share it with the main sheet.  If it doesn't, you didn't screw anything up.
* If a puzzle hasn't been solved for a while, make sure EVERYONE has taken a look at it, no matter what you think the solving method is.  You might hate cryptics, sudokus, or music ID, but that might not be what the puzzle actually is. You all might agree that this is totally a math puzzle about significant digits, until Ted the Anime Fan realizes IT'S OVER 9000!
* Finding a person who has actual knowledge about the subject will always be faster and better than doing an uneducated Google Search.  Yes, we can all find things using TinEye or Shazam, but an expert could just name those things directly, and also recognize more information or groupings that you can't.

4) Events

* Send the best possible people to events, using the information that was provided by the writing team.  Write their names and numbers down, and remind them 1 hour before an event.
* Bring paper, pen, and a laptop/tablet.  You might not be able to use them at the event, but ALWAYS bring them.
* While at events, everything is fair game.  The answers could be written on the bottom of that paper plate you're eating off of, or inside a pen you received.
* Generally, it will be very clear when you are finished with an event.  If it is unclear, DO NOT LEAVE.  Stick around and ask the organizers if you have everything you need.
* When you finish an event, you will either have an answer that you should submit immediately, or another puzzle.  If you have an answer, call your team and relay it so that they can submit it.  If you have another puzzle, tell everyone what happened at the event, so that they can better understand how to solve it.

5) Food

* Don't purchase foods that need refrigeration. That coldcut tray, yogurt, or guacamole will be smelly and toxic within 6 hours.
* If your team is going to order food in, make sure that everyone takes a little break when the food arrives to find their order, get a drink, and socialize a little.  Then get back to your puzzle.  
* Immediately after you've eaten, throw away your trash.  The smell of old food will kill your energy and make everyone cranky.
* Burritos/Chinese/Subs/Burgers = Good, because they're self-contained in wrappers or containers
* Thai/Barbecue/Wings/Taco Bars = Bad, because they require plates, sauces, and get all over everything

6) Room

* You will likely be doing a lot of things near the Infinite Corridor.  Try to reserve a room near it.
* Get a room with a lot of tables, and reorganize them into squares in the center of the room, and put some tables against the wall.
* If you've got a projector, use it to project your main spreadsheet with solves and answers.  If not, use the whiteboard or chalkboard to update those things.
* You NEED a color printer.  Going on Athena runs is a huge timewaster.  
* If you've solved a puzzle, stand up and throw away all your paper related to it.  A clean workspace is an efficient one.
* Maintenance will come around and remove your garbage if you tie it up and set it outside.  Bring extra garbage bags, paper towels, baby wipes, and air freshener.

7) Team members

* You are part of a team.  You succeed when they do.  It's awesome to solve a puzzle or a meta, but don't let your ego get in the way so that you try to solo things, or get possessive when someone cracks something you've worked on for hours.  Hey, you don't need to work on that one anymore! They saved you from even more stress of banging your head! Go do something more fun!
* You have better things to do than recap several hours of work.  Unless it's needed for a meta, the time for explaining how a puzzle was solved is at wrap-up. 
* Unless it's really important, stick to solving puzzles when you're in the room.  Reading Facebook and playing video games is something you can do literally any other weekend. 
* You're here to solve and have fun, but if the team really needs a specific puzzle/meta to move forward, drop what you're doing and make a team effort.  Then there will be more fun stuff for you to do later.
* If there's currently nothing that you feel like working on, but you're not tired, ask if anybody could use an intern, to write stuff down, Google things, or organize spreadsheets.  You don't need to understand the puzzle, just be helpful.
* Remoting can feel lonely and disconnected.  Voice/Video chats are a necessity. 
* Avoid nicknames or usernames.  Spend 15 minutes before the start of the Hunt to make sure you know everyone's name. Nametags are good, introducing yourself is better.  
* When joining a new puzzle as a remote, let people know you're taking a look at it, and ask what you can do.
* Arguments will kill a team, especially if there's a person on your team who is yelling, putting people down, or being a major bummer.  Talk to your Team Council or Mother about it.  If you're the one dealing with it, make the angry guy take a walk outside, get some fresh air and a snack and get them to apologize.

If they refuse, or keep doing it, **kick them right off your team.**

Well, that was long!  TL;DR Puzzles good! Competition good! Hunt fun! Organization more fun!"

Wheels would not move at all, but engine worked fine. Had to miss my work shift, and get the car towed to the dealership where I bought it.

Found out yesterday that it was transmission failure. $4100. I'm personally frustrated as I need a car to get to/from school and internship and only had the car for 18 months.

Service manager called and started saying how he could get me a used transmission for $2500 and will talk to the parts guys to see how cheap they can install it. I'm just waiting for another phone call to talk more about how upset I am. Right now, I'm fine with the service they gave me.

My NMom, who bought the car originally for me in the first place has been on my back about stuff. Asking constant questions I don't know the answer to. On the phone call this afternoon, she was stage whispering what I should say/talk about and asked for him to be on speaker constantly until I just gave in.

When I hung up she berated me for not saying what I was supposed to say, saying things like ""Did you get his name?!"" And ""You didn't say anything you were supposed to say!""

I'm honestly more upset at her than the car situation right now. I get she has a right to be upset about a car that she forked $6k into. I get that. But I don't like her complaining to me when I don't spout out things when I'm listening to someone else on the phone. I fucking hate interrupting people and she does it. All. The. Time.

I just want to head to my boyfriend's house, but I'm stuck here until car stuff gets fixed. I might just get a taxi to his place tomorrow as it's our anniversary and we both feel crummy."

I'm so sad, life's so difficult, and I don't want to go on. Every day of my life is a struggle with pain and much more. I met an amazing person about six months ago. I had just been bouncing around looking for a caregiver from agency to agency. This person had taken care of family and others and told us she was interested in working with me. My mom and I trained her for about a month and we hired her. We slowly got closer and closer.

She had a lot going on in her life. Brother getting out of prison, mother has lot of health issues, friends are kinda crazy, and partly because of me she separated from her 4 year relationship and starting psudeo dating me. We had bumps along the road, but as of late it's become worse. I would give her gifts, take her out, feed her pets, take her to theme parks and scuba trips and always support and listen to her when she was upset about something.

The past few weeks have been really hard on me. With completing my first semester back, just barely, and dealing with so much else I have felt so alone and discouraged. Largely because I felt I could no longer talk to my caregiver/gf. I would just shut down every time I wanted to say something because I knew she would misunderstand, or I'd get frustrated with her interrupting me and telling me everything she does for me (even though I literally pay her to be here and do a job). As soon as I showed any frustration she'd either get really rude or just walk away. 

This morning I was dejected and was going to say something but said nevermind you'd see it differently than me, which turned out to be more then true. She got really defensive and rude with her answers saying, ""oh yeah I ruined your life."" Even though all I had said is your making me feel like shit right now, because you aren't even bothering to listen to what I have to say. I went outside to cry, after a minute or two of that I decided to go for a drive. As I was getting in she threw my phone in the car. She started to walk away and I said to just leave. I had noted a few days early that I was on my last straw with her and that if she didn't want to even listen to what I had to say she didn't deserve this job. 

I fell out of the car, out of my wheelchair, and scraped my feet really bad. I yelled for help and my caregiver and housemate cane out shortly after her. I told her not to touch me and leave me alone if she wasn't going to bother listening to me. My housemate helped me in the wheelchair and she left for her internship, which I might add she had not actually been completing the 40 hours set per week of my care because of her internship, mother, and friends. 

No matter how many times I tod her to time manage, or that she can't list her job as reasons why I shouldn't be upset. She couldn't do her job and then the past few weeks she would not listen to what I had to say and would constantly walk away when I tried to convey to her that I was suicidal and felt like shit, often because of her lack of care or doing her job. 

Now my mother has to step in again to help me with my morning bathroom routine eventhough she also has a job. I've lost the only person to love me in 3 years and honestly I'll probably never find anyone to love me until I have money or power. I got her a $300 ring for Christmas, my parents gave her so many days off, given her so much of my time and heart, and in the end she couldn't just listen to what I had to say even when I was pleading. 

Obviously there's so much more to this story on both sides but I'm heart broken and scared. I haven't had motivation or hope lately. I want to keep going but at this rate I don't know how long I can keep dragging along. So many people love me, but I'm so burdened and I'm so tired of the pain and having to do so much for myself. It's not fair I didn't do anything wrong, I wasn't born with a disorder. I shouldn't have to live like this."
5onvep,1,2017-01-18,"Me [21/M] living with aunt [~45/F] and her boyfriend [~45/M]. They like to go out and drink beer. Often. I do not. Oh, he's also my boss. How to bring this up?",beerboresme,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5onvep/me_21m_living_with_aunt_45f_and_her_boyfriend_45m/,"About to go to bed, don't like paragraphs. I'll keep this in bullet point (ish) format.

Background:

- Just recently graduated from school (university) in the USA. Pretty damned good grades, decentish portfolio for my career area of interest.

- Last summer, wielded the power of nepotism to get an internship at a pretty good company in my field (really good from my perspective - great culture, great people, interesting enough day-to-day on average, better-than-average business practices for my discipline), but in a significantly higher COL area than my first 20.75 years of existence. Aunt helped me look for the jobs in the whole area, boyfriend had a major hand in getting me there to the specific one (had no prior internships).
- Last summer, and now currently post-graduation, I have been staying with both mentioned parties in their home, and not paying rent (I was not asked to pay rent - aunt is big into family-related things and is ecstatic to have another family member consistently within 50 miles let alone 50 meters for the first time in ostensibly decades) while I save up some buffer money/rainy day funds before going out ""on my own for real this time I promise"". Boyfriend is also on board with this and ""since I'm [X]'s family, I'm his family""
- I'm a) introverted and b) Really interested in my own learning and health. Example: Today after work I watched math lectures on YouTube, tomorrow I have plans to play basketball during the lunch break. Either Thursday or this weekend I'll sign back up with the gym I was using over summer. Etc.
- Did I mention in the title that I'm the nepotism hire? Well I am. That doesn't mean I'm not ""good"" - if I wasn't ""good"" I wouldn't have had a remote chance for this company/field combination, but I'm essentially within 25-30 meters of aunt's boyfriend around the clock regardless, he runs the meetings, etc.

Problem:

- They are extroverts for sure. And they like beer. A lot. Breweries almost every weekend, and was asked to tag along to another brewery's opening tomorrow. A Wednesday.
- I, however, preferred to drink once every few months even in school. Even a glass or two is usually enough to leave me groggy and with clouded thoughts most of the entire next day. I got my partying out of my system in high school.
- But, I a) want to make sure they both know how appreciative I feel and b) don't want to somehow come off as a teetotaler snob ""oh I don't like beer I prefer to read thank you very much"" especially since they have done so, so much for me. And also the thing where if aunt's boyfriend (whom I have now known the existence of for ~8.5 months) and I have a strained relationship, I worry my career starts off tragically.
- But BUT I really am trying to make healthier decisions because I'm noticing more these days that junk food/beer/lack of exercise genuinely directly affects my mental state. So far I've been a ""yes man"" and gone out for drinks 3 times in 2017, which is about even with the number of times I went out from August-December 2016.

Ultimate question I'm getting at:

- **How do I approach this subject with them? I really think for my own mental state, I can't keep saying yes to go out drinking, but I don't want to strain the relationship at all for both personal and potentially career reasons.**



  ---   
  **tl;dr**: **broke. living with aunt and her boyfriend in new unfamiliar area. her boyfriend is the only reason I will be less broke as time wears on. they like beer a lot. I am trying to get into better shape partially for my own mental health. DI not want to strain relationship, care very much about all parties involved. Aunt is lovely. Boyfriend is great guy. Situation just ""not my speed.""** "

So I've been studying law the last few years (part time). I used to have a love for the law but in the past 6 months to a year I've kind of had enough. I always had an affinity for criminal law, but these jobs are getting ever fewer and far between.

I guess I'm disenchanted with my job prospects after graduation, as nearly every uni is now pumping out law grads at a rate of knots, and the legal industry is continuing to shrink. Internships, clerkships are extremely competitive and considering my grades (only relatively average) I would be hard pressed ever landing such a position. 

So I'm kind of just over it now.

I've always been good with computers, can work my way around most systems with little training. 

I've recently been interested in learning how programs work, ""hacking"" - learning how to exploit vulnerabilities (I suppose similar to in law where you try to exploit a witness's weakness in testimony or prosecution's case) to get an outcome you desire (I've been reading up on ""penetration testing"" and the white hat hacker movement and find it fascinating). 

So I'm really finding myself more and more interested in that area of the IT arena. I have good logic, reasoning, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. Along with a tenacious attitude. 

I'm just wondering if it would be wise to transfer across? And if there is really a job market in pentetration and security testing, and how competitive it is.

Thanks guys."

I appologize, if this should not be directly connected to the festival plaza (although somehow connected due to battles, global missions and the fact thaty the gamesync npc is in the plaza).

The pokemon support agents are a bunch of incompetent interns wherefore I did not get any constructive answers. You are my last hope, Obi Wan Kenobi.

I have the following issue: I am living in Japan, bought a Japanese Nintendo 3DS (boy was I stupid... no language settings... my Japanese skills are rather limited) and a Japanese Pokemon Moon version (fortunately, the language can be changed). 
The issue: I am trying to register an account on pokemon gl but everytime when I am trying to log in, it immediately logs out (English settings). If I enter Japan as my region, the whole mess turns into Japanese. After investing a lot of time into google translating the heck out of the menue, it turns out that the menue is only related to Pokemon Go without any possibility to register or gamesync anything.

Did anyone experience the similar issues or could help me out somehow? Thanks in advance for any usefull information! Very desperated after trying to fix this since 2 months.

5opx4i,12,2017-01-18,[Update] After a really crappy year... things still aren't getting better.,oneblazeofglory,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/5opx4i/update_after_a_really_crappy_year_things_still/,"Update because someone asked me to. Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/5mulgi/after_a_really_crappy_year_if_anyone_has_the_time/

Summary: Waited 9 months for a job that I'd been formally offered, gave up our apartment during the wait believing it would come through soon and it didn't so moved last-minute, eventually job disappeared into thin air. Moved to another country with my partner, can't find a job here and only have until March to do so otherwise I'll have to return to my home country. Really heartbroken, losing faith in God, having anxiety attacks on an extremely regular basis. Had job interview last week which would have been amazing to get... 

...and, of course, I didn't get the job. Safe to say, both of us are really disappointed - the 8 hour drive down to the other side of the country for the interview cost a lot of money, half of what that we had left to live on, and considering that the only income we have is my other half's student loans, which isn't enough to cover bills, rent and food, we're really upset and feel like God has abandoned us in the midst of all of this. I really feel like I've done everything to have faith in God, put it in his hands, and believe that he'll bring us through this, but it's been over a year since all of this started and it doesn't seem to be getting any better - we're in the same situation that we were in back in my home country, except that our job situations have switched and he's gone from having a crappy retail job to a great internship and I've gone from having a great job (on paper) to looking at working at the airport as a waitress because I can't get anything else despite my experience, which is a thought that makes me really disappointed / angry / upset / everything bad. It's not that I feel like I'm somehow above that kind of job or anything like that, but it's more that I feel like I've somehow failed and that I'm going to have to fight my way up from nowhere again, having already done it once at home. I feel so abandoned and ignored by God. 

I don't really know what else to do. I probably should have applied for more jobs during this time, but I've just felt like it's all pointless because I'm having no success and that's been giving me anxiety attacks. I'm also pretty lonely here - I have barely any friends in this country, and they all live at least a half hour drive away and are students or working, so they don't have time to hang out with me while I'm unemployed. I don't understand why God brought me to this country, and put me through all the stuff from last year, and whilst I understand that there's probably a reason why he's not giving me a job that will put us back on the right track, don't understand why he isn't answering my outcry for him to just show me what to do or how to be - I feel like I'm praying to a brick wall. It's really shaking my faith in God, and whilst deep down I can't let go of my faith quite yet, the cracks are getting deeper and deeper. My other half won't be working a paid job until at least June when his internship ends, and the last thing I want him to do is give up and get a paid job because he wanted to work in this field for so long and finally he has his chance, but if the best I can get is a waitressing job we're still only *just* going to be able to afford to live at all. 

What do I do? Where is God in all of this? How do I keep going? 

Sorry that this is long and probably a bit rambly, but I decided to just type and see what came out. I don't really know what I want to ask for in this post either. I just feel really miserable and at a dead end. Thanks for reading. "

I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how I even got the those opportunities, probably faked it really, but I really am stressed out. At the time, I had some working knowledge of code, but now that I've been busy, I haven't had the time to really have fun with programming assignments. And for one of my internships, I need to relocate to SF and while it would not be a problem, I just haven't been able to relax since the beginning of the school year.

I also teach a coding class for Girls Who Code here in Santa Clara, CA and someone wanted to work on our club's idea. They're talking about creating a company off it and I would be working side by side with them with my girls. We already have sponsored by another company and they want to be a part of our idea. However, Facebook had given us our original funding and idk what that entails (our features connect to FB and they like the idea). I really hope this doesn't become some *Silicon Valley* remake because that show already gives me anxiety. 

They're looking for undergrad lab researchers at my school and I would be really interested in doing something not as intensive as a internship. Or just working at Starbucks or a coffee shop of some sort. On r/cscareerquestions, they told me to go for the internship and not to worry about not knowing enough but...

It's just not that... I'm stressed. I'm 19 with so much to worry about. I spent so much of my life rushing and trying to get ahead. Fall quarter was just internship applications and networking.

I just want to be 19. I want to be able to take care of my health instead of being depressed and sitting on a computer all day. One of the girls in my sorority told me that I was chosen because I could contribute a lot of ""publicity"" for the sorority, I wasn't top pick because I didn't take enough selfies on my Instagram. I was so embarrassed when they told me that because I was an average pick for them.

Just need a place to vent. I'm just beyond stressed and I feel like all of you are the only reason why I know I'm not the only one with these kinds of worries. Thank you for taking the time to read this all lol "

I'm a certified Unity Developer looking for **paid** work or **revenue-share** projects. I have a few ""requirements"" when it comes to revenue-share work, I will get to them at the end of this post.

My bread and butter is working with web services and gameplay features for mobile games but I'm **heavily** interested in working with console and PC games so I'm willing to do what it takes to show that I'm a good fit for your project, regardless of what it is. I have been working with mobile games professionally for two years already, but I attended a lot of game jams and worked in a few personal projects.

Requirements for **Revenue-Share** Proposals:

- My share needs to be higher or equal to 20%.
- Your project must be greenlit on Steam. The only exception is if it's a mobile game. Either case, check the next requirement.
- You need to convince me your project will make a reasonable amount of money for at least one year. 
 
These requirements serve only as a reference, to help me prioritize what projects are more interesting than others. If, however, you still think your project is outstanding, regardless of said requirements, send your proposal!

Guys, like I said before, you can contact me through PM to ask me anything you need. I will be happy to answer you."
5orckz,1,2017-01-18,Investing Graduate School Funds,PF_Hawlucha,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5orckz/investing_graduate_school_funds/,"I'm a computer science student right now, considering going to graduate school (masters in related field) after I graduate in 2019. My undergrad should be completely covered without loans, and I also have ~$46k that I plan on setting aside for grad school.
Right now I have it in a four fund portfolio at Vanguard:

* VBTLX - about 43%

* VTSAX - about 36%

* VGTSX - about 10%

* VTIBX - about 10%

Is this a decent allocation, assuming I want modest but safe returns over the next 2-3 years? I originally went for a 40-60 allocation (though that has shifted due to stock market performance), but bonds have not been doing very well since I originally set up this fund about a year ago.

What, if any, changes would you recommend to this allocation? Should I go a bit more aggressive or even more safe?

More info: I don't really plan on paying for all of my masters out of pocket, and I may not even go immediately after undergrad. I just want this money to be there when (if) I need it. This will help cover moving expenses, tuition, all that stuff, though I do hope to get at least part of it paid by teaching or doing research. I also expect to continue to intern (contributing to my Roth a good deal while I'm at it) and if I get an offer at a company I like, I may delay graduate school for a bit.

Note: Throwaway, and I asked this yesterday on the /r/investing personal advice thread."

If you would like to make suggestions or ask question before diving all the way in, please do! I understand that you would want to get a handle on this before committing!

Also, this is *not* a hucow prompt. It's all about genetic research and selective breeding. Women will be treated as human beings and willing test subjects, but this world does have... *relaxed* views on sexuality. Chalk it up to a near-apocalypse that drastically reduced the human population to the point things just barely got back to normal, and now it's seen as an honor to be selected for advanced breeding. Pregnancy and fertility are desirable traits in this world, so keep that in mind.

Ideally, I would prefer my partner to be the head of Research and Development and the Facility. Your job would be to design, monitor, and administer fertility treatments and gene therapy. However, this job description is up for negotiation, considering the Facility is always open to new research. As the Director of Operations, I expect you to focus on your work at first, but you could convince me to let you engage in deeper, crazier research or eventually use yourself as a test subject or breeder. Really, anything is up for grabs.

I don't mind first or third person, but I do prefer to write in paragraph or longer segments. Sorry, but text speak will not be tolerated. Grammatical or spelling errors will be cheerfully tolerated, because no one is a good editor when excited. I am looking for a writing partner, so be prepared to write a paragraph of at least five to seven complex, detailed sentences. Describe what you feel, what you do, and what you think as well as what is going on around you. The more you give me, the more I can give back.

One or two sentence replies a la ""I fucked it."" will not be tolerated. If you're looking for a quick, superficial exchange, then I am not your man. No offense, but I prefer a really good, involved story, preferably with some stupid humor mixed in.

Kinks: Breeding (no shit...), dubious and full consent, bondage, humor, bodywriting, cumplay, and a whole slew of other things made apparent later

Maybes: Futa (it would be interesting to have a subject that can both impregnate and be impregnated), military (maybe we can explore a top-secret genetics project), bestiality (combine the conventional farm with the unconventional, add some science, and I might be convinced to see where it goes), furry (maybe we go absolutely crazy with genetic research) 

Limits: Non-con (okay, I could be convinced to do a really good non-con plot, but it's gotta be good), bimbo (we want good genetics), violence, blood, toilet play

Sitting behind my wide mahogany desk, my corporate email for the Facility's directorship pings a notification that a profile had just come in from our latest recruitment effort. The Facility recently got in contact with fertility clinics and private practice doctors to offer our services to an expanded clientele base. Considering the participants in our can only be impregnated once every twelve months or so, much of our insemination equipment was sitting idle. We decided to offer the equipment to those seeking sperm donors, allowing them to pay for our services and keep the child. We also started a Bring Your Own Sperm program for couples having difficulty conceiving or just looking for a way to liven up their babymaking.

Clicking open the application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting cows strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

Writing all the necessary information down on a neatly lined piece of paper and signing it, you are about to place it in the enclosed envelope before seeing a very official looking packet at the bottom of the box. Inside are forms for entering the information you just so painstakingly wrote down, but you figure you should do this the right way. The contents are odd, but they are all within reason for a company attempting to isolate strings of beneficial human DNA. Even if they do get awfully personal with fertility, hey, people have to reproduce, right?

Reading the form, it is as follows:

*Dear Applicant,*

*Thank you for your inquiry about services with our Human Resources Office! We are very excited to hear about your interest in continuing your research with us, and the Facility would love to support your ambitions for innovation! All we need is some basic information to finish your application, and we can get you on your way!*

(Or insert some other office to which you are replying. Hell, maybe you got this by accident and are contacting Customer Services, which totally isn't what you think it is. Get it? Services? HAHAHAHAHA... ah, fuck me...)

DEPARTMENT APPLIED TO: (enter the project to which you applied. Feel free to make something up if it's extra sexy to you! Hell, we could make a Reproductive Pleasure department, if that's what you want.)

PROJECT APPLIED TO: (Get very, very creative with this. The more thought you put into this, the better the roleplay.)

REASON APPLIED: (Get creative! The more you write, the more I can incorporate down the road!)

EXPECTED SALARY:

NAME:

AGE:

SEXUALITY:

EYE/HAIR COLOR:

HEIGHT/WEIGHT:

MEASUREMENTS:

UNIQUE PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES: (Feel free to add interesting physical quirks that might make yourself more attractive to a genetics project!)

PREGNANCY STATUS: *If ""Yes,"" please fill out attached Father Verification Form. If ""No,"" please have fertility status verified by a certified doctor or with the included approved instrument.*
FERTILITY STATUS: *Percentage displayed on the instrument will be most accurate during or immediately following an orgasm. The instrument can accommodate this necessity.*

CURRENT MEDICATION: *Please include any and all medication, including birth control.*

RECENT SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS: (Get creative!)

JOB EXPERIENCE: (Again, creativity will be rewarded!)  *Please include any majors, minors, concentrations, and advanced degrees.*

PROPOSED AREA OF RESEARCH: 

INTERESTS: *Let the Farm know about who you are as a person! We would really like to get to know you, and anything you want to tell us will help make your experience with us more comfortable and enjoyable!*

OTHER INFORMATION: *If there's anything else you think the Farm should know, please use the provided space.*

GOLDEN GENESE PHOTO CONTEST: *As a special promotional offer, the Facility is running a photo contest! This contest is open to the general public, regardless of application intent or status, so get your friends involved! Put on the headband and collar, get creative with the temporary tattoos, and snap a pic while testing your fertility! Please make sure the display of the instrument is visible in the picture.*

*Prizes will be distributed for Sexiest Pic, Most Fertile, Best Preggo, Most Creative, Best ""In Progress"" Pic, and Freshest New Mother. These prizes consist of $1000 dollars cash and a guided tour of the Preggoridge Farms facilities.*

*A Grand Prize will be given out for Best In Show, an honor reserved for the sexiest, most fertile, most creative, and above all most breedable gene carrier that sends in a picture! This Grand Prize consists of $10,000 dollars cash, a private jet and limousine to and from the Farm, a private behind-the-scenes tour of the Farm facilities, and a private interview with the Director himself! Grand Prize Winners will also be invited to stay the night in one of our luxury suites!*

*Prizes must be accepted in full; individual components may not be turned down at the discretion of the contestant winner. Participation in the tour is not required for the cash prize. Every prize is available to the general public; application not required.* (I'm not asking for a real picture. Just tell me about how you made the picture, if you are interested. I'm just trying to get a grip on what you like. Feel free to add a real picture of some sexy little breeder, but tell me how you made it! That's how I judge whether or not we'll click!)

---------------

Okay, if you haven't noticed, I write a lot. I love detail. Simile, metaphor, hyperbole, chiasmata... These things are all my friends. I do not expect you to be able to fully match the way I write. Humble brag, but I hold awards for my SFW writing. If you can match or exceed me... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! If you want me to help you improve your writing while having some sexy fun... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER!!!!!!!! Just please, please make the effort!

So, in regards to how I want you to start, fill out the form and send it in. I will judge our compatibility based on the scene you write about flipping through the promotional materials and reacting to their contents.

Maybe you really like the technical documents displaying women becoming mothers from the machines whirring between their legs. Maybe the pictures from Live Audition with new, young test subjects caught the moment they feel their first child squirting into their wombs. Maybe you really like the diagrams of the combination breeding/milking racks, showing warm white fluid entering a woman between her legs and leaving from her chest. I don't know, so you gotta tell me. Dig through that recruitment package and find the things that make you excited! There's a reason we send out these packages!

For example, maybe you were watching ""Eighteen and Pregnant"" when the recruitment package arrived. Firing up the probe, you affix a ""For Hire"" sticker over your lower stomach and a ""Wide Loads Welcome"" to your inner thigh. Bending your back over your couch, you arch your breasts into the air, displaying the flat stomach you were applying, no begging, to have ruined. The bright stickers flash as the probe burrows into your folds. You writhe, imagining the warm metal spewing the thick, life-giving fluid into you that you could never convince a man to give up. It feels almost as good as you imagine it will when you win the Grand Prize, placed on a pedestal upon which motherhood will be pumped into you. Your walls clamp down hard as an orgasm rocks your body. The probe lights up, displaying a disturbingly high percentage, your womb sucking eagerly at the tip of the probe. That's when the camera clicks, catching your body in its full, hungry glory. Looks like we got ourselves a winner... (This was an example. Write your own!)

I wrote that part in because it's so much easier to bring someone in as the Grand Prize winner, and also a lot more fun. It lets me be excited to meet you, and not just ""Oh, boy... Another womb..."" So, give it a shot? The form is meant to be an exposition of what you want from the roleplay, and that part was good, but you gotta give me more to work with if you want the really good stuff.

*Hi everyone,*

It's that time again and with the competition getting fiercer every year, here are a few tips to benefit the most out of the TCF.

This year, the TCF is on **January 26th** and runs from 10am to 4pm.
[Facebook Event Page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1330074267058521/)

***
***

**Interested in a company?**

1. Do some research on what they do at the fair - most participants have come to the fair before with the exception of a few companies.

 For example, Nvidia and Whitepages will give out mini coding exams; brushing up on your C++/C and logic might be the key on impressing a recruiter for those companies.


2. Other than that, you should dress for the job you want (not an excuse for programmer casual) and make sure your resume is to the point. There are drop-in sessions for resume editing offered by Diane Johnson from the career and planning office.

 Remaining Sessions:
 - Fri. Jan. 20, 2:00 – 4:00 pm
 - Mon. Jan. 23, 11:00 am – 2:00 pm

    A sign up sheet will be posted on her office door by 10:00 am on each date.


3. Moreover, bring extra copies of your resume - companies are here to hire and are interested in you. There is a paytoprint station in ICICS basement and in the Cube (ICICS 021) in case you need extra copies.


4. Also look up what you're interested in at a company and bring it up when you have a chance. Recruiters want to see a fit.

 Ex: I brought up UI/UX at YouTube Gaming at the Google booth and they took my resume even though they weren't hiring undergrad interns for SDE - had a interview with them during the summer as a result. 
***
***


**Some Company Profiles From Memory**

* **Amazon**

 Basic interaction with recruiters; people that they short list will end up in large group interviews from which they weed out people even further.

* **Google**

 Unfortunately, Google doesn't hire undergrad interns (at this point of the year) but a recruiter *may* take a resume if you ask nicely. They're mostly here for grads.

* **Nvidia**

 Nvidia brings a coding challenge to the career fair; they expect you to write it in C or C++ but you can try persuading them to let you use Java if necessary. Usually one tough question and a bunch of filler to weed out the unprepared.

* **Microsoft**

 MS normally is the basic interaction with recruiters; I've heard that this year that they've overbooked intern positions so I don't know if they're hiring (but they're coming regardless).

* **Whitepages**

 Also brings a coding challenge - their challenge is centered on a seemingly impossible situation which you then have to use logic/problem solving skills to solve.

5osmhn,0,2017-01-18,A suggestion to fix 2 of WotC's biggest problems: lack of player rewards + boosters being an objectively bad purchase.,ProxyDamage,magicTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5osmhn/a_suggestion_to_fix_2_of_wotcs_biggest_problems/,"I don't think I'm being ""controversial"" when I state that Wizards of the Coast has 3 gigantic problems regarding Magic the Gathering:

#1 - There is essentially no reward for 99% of players to attend Wizards sanctioned events  

I get it that the old ""Player Reward Program"" could have gotten too costly, after all making new promo-exclusive cards all the time and individually shipping them to thousands of players around the world could quickly become too much investment for their return. However, the current ""rewards"" in place are frankly no rewards at all as the overwhelming majority of players statistically cannot ever go to a GP event - statistically, they can't, as only a very small number of people qualify. On top of that there's all the people that play Magic but have no serious aspirations of ""going pro"". It's nice that the ""tour"" exists, but for the overwhelming majority of players it's literally irrelevant. 

Thus going to events, particularly for players who don't feel like they can consistently place in the rewarding half of the bracket or are still putting together their decks, can often feel like a waste of money better spent... putting their decks together. Or just inviting their Magic-playing friends (often most of the same people they'll meet at local events) over for some drinks and MTG. Statistically, it can be hard to disagree. 

#2 - Buying card products (boosters, pre-cons, fat packs, etc) from WotC is almost always **a financially irresponsible and inefficient decision**.

Don't get me wrong, cracking packs is fun, I like doing it too once in a while... But so is any other form of gambling. The uncomfortable correlation here is that they're also both a waste of money in the overwhelming majority of the time. In fact, with the possible exception of the pre-con Commander decks, which so far have proven themselves to be a good investment both for the cards as well as for the intended use of the deck itself, ***you should never buy cards from Wizards if your purpose is to put together a deck. Ever.*** Buying singles from your LGS (if they're legitimate at least) or from a trustworthy website is ***always*** more efficient both in time and price unless you get absurdly lucky (i.e.: you win the metaphorical lottery). And it's not even close. 

At this point I think it's safe to say that it might not be ideal for WotC, a business, when the objectively best decision for most players is to simply effectively never do business with them. Instead go through secondary markets or bypass them entirely. And yes, secondary markets are great, and admittedly I'm not a business major or anything, but I would think that while a secondary market is a very healthy thing for a game like Magic, it's probably not ideal when it's also the ONLY objectively correct way for people to acquire Magic-related products unless they want to gamble. As a business, you might want your target audience to...do business with you? No? Am I crazy? But what do I know...

#3 Wizards also has the old time issue that getting into MTG can be a prohibitively expensive habit.

Standard rotates fast enough that more casual players can often feel like they JUST put their decks together when they need to start spending more money changing it or building a new deck entirely to stay competitive, and while eternal formats are more stable (bans and meta changes aside) it's also MUCH more expensive asking a new player to sink hundreds of dollars at the very least, and quite often around a cool grand or more, before you can even sit at the table with the others to play some rounds.

**But what if I told you Wizards could fix or significantly mitigate all of these issues with one simple, and nearly costless, move?**

Imagine if you will, that when you go to an event you are awarded some points - some guaranteed for just showing up, and some more depending on placement and/or event itself (bigger, more important, events granting more points). 

""You mean planeswalker or GP points or whatever they are!?""

No. Those would still be there of course, but I meant something else entirely. Let's call these **Magic Points** for now.

And let's also say that when you crack open a booster or pre-con deck you'll look at that previously useless piece of garbage advertisement card at the end (because why the fuck are you advertising to the people *already buying your product*, but different conversation entirely) and see a little code or QR code or something that you can either set into the MTG webpage or scan with a WotC official app (btw Wizards, there's a reason companies all want one of those these days) and, once again, it'll grant your account a small amount of these mysterious **Magic Points**! 

""But Proxy, what would these hypothetical Magic Points be for!?""

Thanks for asking! On the official MTG page and/or app you could then log in and, if you add enough points... 

...Wait for it...

...Brace yourself...

...

**...You could use these points to order cards directly from Wizards of the Coast.**

I know, I know, insane, but stick with me here for a moment:

* Obviously the higher the rarity the more points the card would take to order. Mythics and rares would still be rare and hard to acquire.
* The only way to get these points would be to go to Wizards sanctioned events or by buying Wizards products - i.e.: by giving Wizards money in the first place.
* The ""value"" of the points would be calibrated by WotC directly, and wouldn't even need to be particularly high. For example, imagine if after buying a display pack (you know, the ones worth nearly $100) or the equivalent amount of boosters you got enough Magic Points to order, say, a non-foil Mythic (or *GASP* maybe 2!) of your choice? Or maybe enough for a play set of rares...? Imagine if attending 10 official events (which averages what, $150?) you got enough for that same Mythic (or two!?). Maybe cracking a fatpack (approximately $35-$40) or equal amount of boosters would be enough for a playset of uncommons, maybe a rare or two. Does this sound unreasonable?
* **The player pays for shipping** - Cards don't cost much to ship, but mailing thousands of cards all over the world gets expensive. Also would discourage people from doing many small orders and instead order in bulk, which is easier to process for WotC.
* This offer could be restricted to currently printing sets, so ***if nothing else***, on a ""absolutely lowest cost/effort possible"" all this would cost Wizards is the website changes (and adding more reasons for people to visit your website should honestly pay for itself no?), cards already in printing (remember, a Mythic costs them as much to produce as a draft chaff - not much) and very minor labor costs of having an intern mail shit to people (again, we're paying for the shipping). No new cards are being made. No special art or printing line being produced. 

...and what would this accomplish? Let's see:

* Suddenly attending events becomes rewarding **for everyone** as a small fraction of the cost you're paying is going towards completing your deck or collection. Certain you won't top 8? Well, at least you get a good experience and you get 1/10th of the way closer to owning your very own Planeswalker of choice! Are you planning to top 8? Maybe even win? Hell, that might put you a 1/4th of the way there or something! I like the sound of those odds. 
* Buying MTG products, such as boosters, would perhaps not be the quickest or most efficient way to acquire a specific deck, thus not devaluing the secondary market significantly, but it would at least be a reasonable gamble - worst case scenario, if you pull only junk, you always get a little closer to the cards you really need. Can you imagine a world in which cracking packs isn't exclusively a waste of money!? You might even want to give Wizards money!? Crazy, I know.
* It suddenly becomes a little easier for new players to put together a Standard-viable deck and get into the world of Magic the Gathering we all know and love. If every official event you attend and every official product you buy gets you a little closer to a real competitive deck it takes some of the weight out of having to just dump a few hundred dollars on the secondary mark before there's any reason for them to attend an FNM and get to know people. 
* As a side effect this would allow Wizards of the Coast to keep a little bit of a leash on secondary market prices and prevent cards from becoming massively inflated (sometimes artificially) by making them more available and providing a ""ceiling"" of sorts. Is that new fancy creature everyone wants reaching $50!? Well, people will just start using their points to buy those naturally bringing the price down to a more acceptable level. An escape valve, of sorts. Better yet, given that WotC would control this valve they could easily tweak it as necessary. Too many Mythics? Just raise the ""point price"" a bit. Too few? Lower it a little bit. Like magic!

Just the simplest, most basic, and minimal cost implementation of something of this kind should immediately have an overwhelmingly positive return in the form of player interest, retention, and perhaps the most important, more people buying MTG products and attending MTG events than ever before.

But let's say Wizards of the Coast wants to put *some* extra effort into it, go above and beyond... You know what they could do? Wait for it...

Wizards could even have rotations or time limited events of special high demand cards of older formats no longer in printing, for extremely high ""point prices"", that would nonetheless function as additional escape valves for important cards now reaching extreme prices (e.g.: Tarmagoyf, an extremely important creature for most eternal formats costing **upwards of $100 dollars**) be a little more accessible (and thus causing the price to drop a little) **which would**, imagine if you can, **make their older formats a little more accessible and significantly less daunting for new players**. By keeping the ""point price"" very high (think maybe the price of 4 mythics for a single of these ""classics"") and the offer time limited, Wizards would very easily control that particular escape valve and easily prevent a flooding (and consequently devaluing) of these staples, while also letting them become significantly more affordable and attainable. It would also act as a ""point sink"" away from Standard cards as these ""Timeless classic"" cards would be severely overpriced compared to ""Standard equivalents, and you only have so many points. 

Yes, reprinting old cards could cost a little more, but I don't think it's hard to argue that making these older formats that much more accessible (and therefore vibrant and revitalized) **by making people spend money on Wizards products** would provide an immediate and significant return on investment - **particularly as it would be a return on a format that currently gives you nothing, as these players can't buy these products from you anymore**.

So Wizards, I'm giving you plenty of reasons why you should, my turn to ask: **""Why not?""**

Thoughts? 

**Edit:** Title is now wrong as I changed the body to 3 different issues instead of just 2.... Well, buy 2 get 1 free I guess!

**Edit #2: To clarify something: The point ""prices"" would be adjusted so it would still be cheaper and more efficient to buy singles as the primary form of putting a deck together. This is not about pushing secondary retailers out of the picture. This is just about making it slightly more rewarding to buy official products and attend official events with actually valuable rewards (cards you can use) that cost WotC almost nothing to create (as they're cards that already exist). The values I mentioned are just hypothetical and would obviously need adjusting.**"

I (23M) am in college, trying to get an internship, but my life does not have any major difficulties at the moment.


My boyfriend (23M) and I finished a computer technician course a year ago (this is where I met him).
Apart from odd jobs, he also got an internship at May 2016, and was very happy with it. 
He was to get a job on the same company at the beginning of 2017. However, due to budget cuts, he (and a lot of people) got laid off.


He was already pretty depressed about not getting a job before, and now he is so, so sad...
He lives with his parents and from what I gather they are pretty toxic people. They hardly speak, and tension is very high.


Anyway, due to these circumstances in his life, he's considering getting a job outside of our field of work, changing to a state where life costs are lower and there are more opportunities etc.
I thoroughly agree with this; I intend to stay with him and support him, even if I have to bear with the long distance.
However, he tells me that he is undeserving of me, is only losing time and life while I am sucessful, has no future, and that if he were to do that (change field of work or location) he would rather not speak with me until his life gets better.


While I can understand all that, I don't really comprehend it.
He'd rather separate from me if he feels he adds nothing to the relationship, even though I say constantly that he adds a lot.
He thinks I idealize him, that I'd be better of without him etcetera.


He is really dear to me. Difficult times come to everybody, I wanted to stay with him through that. I really don't get it. Does anybody have advice or went through a similar situation?


TL;DR: Boyfriend can't land a job, feels that he is undeserving of the relationship we have, and may want to leave in the near future if things don't get better.


Thank you all for reading."

I know I've posted on here a few times in the last few days but I've been feeling pretty anxious and I thought that maybe sharing my experience might help a bit. Sorry if this is long!!
So, my experience started over the summer. i was on vacation with my parents when I noticed some weird veins in my leg. Since I had just started with nuva ring I was worried it was a clot and decided to go to the doctor. We went to the only one we could find who spoke very very little english, pulled my skirt up wayyyy to high just to check out my knee, and told me that I definitely didn't have a clot. I thought no more of it. 
So I started college in August. I'm from the west coast and moved out to the east coast for college. After about a month I developed really intense pain in my lower back but I assumed I'd just pulled a muscle and didn't go get it checked out. The pain eventually went down and I assumed all was fine. 
About four days later it came back, much worse this time. I went to student health and they told me I had a kidney infection, gave me some antibiotics, told me to rest, and sent me on my way. A few days later I was feeling worse so I went back. They said I probably had a kidney stone and sent me to get some images. 
I got an MRI and was told that I didn't have a kidney stone but might have had one at some point in the past. I called my doctor at student health who told me to the go to the ER, so I did. There I was given MORE antibiotics that were stronger and (again) told to go back to my dorm and rest. 
Once again, I started feeling even worse. I went to the ER again a few days later where I had a much worse experience. I was given an extremely painful pelvic exam (I have endometriosis) in which the doctor yelled at me to stop crying and ""not act like a baby"" because I was so much pain I was sobbing. I was then told that because I was anxious about experiencing a lot of pain while being on a new coast away from home for the a long time for the first time that I was making up my symptoms due to anxiety. I was told to go home. 
Because of that I was too scared to go back to student health or the ER so when my symptoms got worse I didn't go in immediately. I had one terrible day where I had a classics test and went to class in horrible pain and could barely manage to walk back to my dorm. My legs were swelling and I couldn't walk without severe exhaustion and pain. I finally went to student health where I was taken back to the ER by ambulance. 
The same doctor who had told me that I was just anxious was there again and she, again, told me that I was exaggerating my symptoms. I was very upset at this point and snapped and asked if there was another doctor I could see. I finally got to see another doctor who looked at my MRI and told me that I had a blood clot. I was admitted to the hospital and started on a heparin drip and my mom flew out to be with me, which was nice. 
I spent quite a while in the hospital. I had extensive clotting in my vena cava and after I had left the hospital I went back to a scan where it was found that I was also clotted under my left knee. So I'm clotted from my left knee to my right hip. I elected not to have surgery to break up the clot (it was a stupid choice and I would choose differently if I had to do it again, but I was very scared at the time). I also learned that I have the factor 2 mutation and an abnormally shaped vena cava which a) made it easier for my body to form new pathways for blood to flow and b) made it unlikely that I would have  PE
I was started on lovenox and cleared to go home. (Since I had missed so much school and still could barely walk at the time I decided to take medical leave for the rest of the semester). 
My mom and I drove back home since my doctor told me flying would be a bad idea. Once home I started on Xarelto. 
Physically I've been feeling a ton better but mentally I've been feeling absolutely terrible. I was okay for the first month and a half or so but living with a huge blood clot in my body has been terrifying and over the past month or so I've completely convinced myself that I have leukemia. My anxiety has gotten so bad that it's hard for me to just exist and talk to people on a day to day basis without starting crying. I know I should go to a doctor or therapist but I'm too anxious to do either. I decided not to go back to college for the rest of the year and apply elsewhere (not bc of the anxiety, because I wasn't happy at the first one) but I'm now completely apathetic about that. I got a great internship in my local government but I'm thinking of quitting because the anxiety is so bad when I go. 
I'm sorry this is so long but I'm feeling pretty terrible and I figured it would be good to talk about it. I don't really have people irl who want to hear about it. I've been reading all your stories and they've been helping me a little!!

5otth2,1,2017-01-18,Debt crisis: Need advice from Vets on GI Bill/repaying school loans,tangothehell,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5otth2/debt_crisis_need_advice_from_vets_on_gi/,"Long story short, I completely dropped the ball on this and have no one but to blame my stupid ass self:

After finishing undergrad with ~$15,000 in school loans, I attended graduate school in 2014-2015 and took out an additional $40,000 in school loans for that year. After some health complications (unrelated to my military service), it became unfeasible to continue the graduate program after the first year. 

During that year in school, I neglected to make sure that my 9/11 GI Bill benefits were active when I signed up with the school’s veteran program — like an idiot I either assumed that they were, or that my policy had run out after I’d used it in undergrad.

Since withdrawing from my graduate program, I’ve struggled to find work and couldn’t afford to pay back my student loans from graduate school.  It’s a large sum of money and I’m struggling to get by as it is — it’s hard enough that I’m unable to go back to school to finish the program. At the moment, I’ve somehow scored an internship related to my field that pays a little over what a normal intern would receive, but nowhere near for me to start paying the full amount of my monthly payments. 

Well, it turns out that I actually had over one year left on the Post 9/11 GI Bill to use. Is there any way to use this to help pay off the loans I took out for graduate school? The GI Bill, if I can use it, would help out tremendously.

This is pretty goddamn embarrassing and I feel like complete shit. Prior to this, I never had any issues whatsoever with loans or credit — I never even used a credit card for years. Having this fucking shadow looming is a shit feeling I wish upon no one except the scummiest of scumbags. 

Thanks guys."
5otylx,4,2017-01-18,Looking for a way for our developers to 'claim' &amp; 'release' development environments using Slack,tmbridge,Slack,https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/5otylx/looking_for_a_way_for_our_developers_to_claim/,"Hi all,

We have a series of about ten development, staging, and sandbox servers that the developers on our team can choose to work on, put code up for internal/external QA, and/or delegate to other departments for whatever reason may come up.

In the past, we simply asked everyone, via meatspace or online chat, ""Is anyone using Dev1?"".  Obviously, that wasn't tenable.

We then switched to a whiteboard approach with a table containing a cell for each server.  When a developer claimed a server for their work, they would write their name in the cell.  When a developer released the server back into the 'available pool', they would erase their name from said cell.  This was better, but still untenable because off-site/remote developers would still need to contact someone in the office to determine what servers were in the 'available pool'.

We then switched to using Slack.  A new channel was created and we installed the [Stash Slack App](https://sit-it.slack.com/apps/A0SNNRTM0--stash) which allows the creation of (key, value) pairs via a /stash command. We setup a key for each server.  When a developer claimed a server for their work, they would send a command like /stash dev1 tmbridge-[JIRA issue ID]-[planned 'release datetime'].  When a developer released a server, they would delete the value from the (key,value) pair for that server.  Using a slash command, /stash list, a developer could see, at a glance, what servers were in the 'available pool'.  Using a slash command, /stash list dev1, a developer could see the (key,value) pair for a _specific_ server, if they were only interested in the status of a single server.  This worked well enough for quite a while.  

Unfortunately, it seems the Stash App is no longer functioning as the aforementioned slash commands no longer work.  We haven't even tried yet to re-install the Slack App because we think there is probably a better way to do this.

For now, as a stop-gap, we've resorted to simply saying in the #envs channel stuff like: 

Claming Dev1. 

Releasing Dev2.

Claiming Dev3.

Claiming Stage.

Releasing Stage.

Obviously, this is untenable as well since it takes time to read up through the chat history to ensure a server is available or taken.  It is also prone to mistakes because human error could cause a developer to miss a crucial claiming/releasing (this risk manifests in every solution I've mentioned so far but is much higher with this implementation).  We could whip up a quick barebones site to emulate the 'whiteboard table' method which would remove the issue for offsite/remote developers but we'd love to keep this in Slack since it's our main hub of communication.  If we did go that route, we could hook into Slack using the Incoming Webhooks App and send claims/releases to the pertinent Slack channel, as well.  That is my current plan of action if we can't find a way to do it purely in Slack (Would be a great project for our fresh intern to get his feet wet, get used to our systems, and get used to our development workflow).  We also do not want to use some kind of shared document (Google Docs, Dropbox, etc.).

So I come here asking for any advice.  Does anyone have any ideas how we can use Slack for the previously mentioned use cases?

That is:

We have a series of about ten development, staging, and sandbox servers that the developers on our team can choose to work on.  Using Slack, we'd like our developers to:

* be able to lay claim to any one of those servers,
* be able to release their claim on a server,
* see a list of all server claim statuses,
* see a list of available servers, and
* see the status for a single server specifically."

By the time I get my degree I will have completed 2 internships teaching in a music classroom, but teaching nonetheless. I have also taken a course specifically designed to address the needs of ESL students in a classroom, but it did not address how to teach English to these students.

I am planning on doing a 23-month Working Holiday visa in New Zealand starting next year (2018-2019). 

I currently work in a mid-sized Canadian museum - my contract will be expiring in December and I'm looking forward to seeing a few new corners of the world before I buckle back into any more serious commitments.

I'm hoping while I'm there that I can volunteer, intern, or maybe if I'm very, very fortunate - even work in the museum and culture field while in New Zealand.

I'd love to chat with somebody with experience in New Zealand to find out more about what the field is like for locals and what their experiences have been like. I've been doing some research on different museums, but would love an insiders take on what it's like on the ground. 

If you're willing to let me bombard you with questions, please let me know - I'd love to chat."

I've been battling with severe and chronic asthma and allergies for years. Tried so many different treatments and still just barely getting by. I've had to take several medical withdraws from school which has set my graduation date back quite a bit, which I've been having issues coming to terms with this delay as I want to be done with my degree already, I take a lot of pride in my work and grades. I recently started an internship and was equally excited and nervous. I knew that at one point I would have to deal with having an asthma exacerbation and tell my boss about being out and such, but was hoping it wouldn't be this soon in. A few weeks ago I had contacted RSV, and am still having problems bouncing back from that. I feel so defeated. I feel like I've made a bad first impression with this internship, and I'm really bummed out thinking that I'll have to keep dealing with this when I eventually get a job too. I have to stay home a lot because of how often I'm sick and how severe it gets and it gets so lonely and depressing. I'm constantly missing out on things because of my asthma. I've been on all the different medications we can try. I have a pulmonologist that I see regularly and the very good doctor from the ER I frequent. I've tried Xolair and Nucala with no success and did immunotherapy for 5 years, we can no longer continue with how unstable I am and some anaphylaxis reactions thar occurred. My insurance will not cover bronchial thermoplasty, we've appealed several times and it's always been denied. I feel so helpless. Really I am just venting.

Two exams, no internship, so I'm stuck in that grey area of over-qualified for internships mainly catered towards undergrads, but I lack the experience that would make me a competitive entry-level candidate. I've applied to, and have been successfully landing interviews for, positions that are non-actuarial but related. I have yet to land an interview for anything actuarial related. I've sent around 120+ cold emails, with responses ranging from ""we've got nothing sorry fam"" to genuine advice on how to break into the industry. Getting the feeling that the ""cold e-mail"" route is becoming saturated as well.


My question is this: what would be a better use of my time? Should I focus on studying for Exam MFE (March sitting) and continue to apply for both actuarial and non-actuarial positions? This comes with the caveat that I would not have time to focus on relevant technical skills that would make me more desirable in a data-oriented position; I'm really feeling as though I'm in something of a catch-22 situation here.

As of right now I will graduate with 138 credit hours, taking summer classes would allow me to graduate next spring with 150 and be CPA eligible. It'd be nice to have that out of the way and not worry about taking classes after I've started my career. 

I have had an internship in the past. It wasn't with an accounting firm, but I did do some accounting/financial related things so it's not like I would be applying for jobs with completely 0 experience. 

But my main thing is that financially it makes the most sense for me to stay here in my college town. I'm already paying for that 3 months of rent during the summer. Unfortunately there are not a lot of good accounting internship positions in this city, meaning I would have to relocate for the summer to intern. At that point with the cost of my living expenses and relocating I would more or less be doing an unpaid internship. 

So if I can't find a good internship here, would it make sense to take summer classes instead? "
5oxpph,2,2017-01-19,What are the best paying part-time jobs my SO with a doctorate can apply for until she gets licensed in her field?,murphyslaw86,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5oxpph/what_are_the_best_paying_parttime_jobs_my_so_with/,"My SO recently finished her doctorate in a field that requires her to complete some additional tests / coursework / hours before she receives her license (and becomes eligible for most full-time jobs). She has one part-time job in her field now, but it's only 16 hours per week and she'd like to make some extra money to help with living expenses, start paying down loans, etc.

She hasn't received any responses on applications for part-time positions yet, and we think the issue she's running into is that people see the degree / work history on her resume and assume she's going to leave as soon as she can (to be fair, that isn't too far off - she's looking for something that she can do for about 6 months).

She does have retail / office experience outside of her field, but those jobs are now 5-6 years old, because she's been in school and had internships related to her degree (but not really to much else) for the past several years, so it would be tough for her to just omit those from her resume without having a giant gap in her employment.

Any thoughts on what might be some good types of jobs for her to apply to? For reference, she's 28F, we live in Southern California, and her field is one that requires her to have a lot of 1-on-1 face time with individual clients.

I wish I was told about CodeAcademy.com in the summer before my Freshman year so that I could see basic syntax and focus on more important things in class.

2. I wish I knew that there are standard practices with writing clean code for many programming languages. You can find a few style guides [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide). I'd also recommend getting Robert Martin's *""Clean Code""*, but only after my first programming class - I feel like stumbling through it a bit can be a good thing.

3. I wish I was knew about JetBrains products, but only after a year of practice with compiling and running programs from command line. Their IDEs are **AMAZING** and free for students, but they act as a crutch if you don't know the *REAL* way the languages are interpreted.

4. I wish I was knew about the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/) so that any boring time in a summer could've been filled poking around and using the stuff in there.

5. I wish I knew that if I started becoming friends with CS Classmates earlier, I may have spent less time doing homework while getting a higher GPA. The individuals who worked together with people from the get-go seem to be much better off... If nothing else, they look as if they are. That's not to say I'm some loner - I was just late to the group, as I was hanging out with non-CS people (also a healthy thing to do).

6. I wish I knew that if I went to every single Hack-A-Thon and developer event in and around my school, I could easily become inspired to program and to succeed. I thought I was stuck in doing something for the money, but I started getting inspired by developers and technologies only after attending conferences and hack meets.

7. Look for an internship as a Freshman. Even if the requirements scare you and even if you don't think you cut it. You'll work hard to prepare for it, and even if you don't make it, the experience is valuable and it'll only be a good look on your part. Most importantly, internships can directly and indirectly lead to jobs. Either the company rehires you, somebody you made an impression on hires you elsewhere, or the experience on your resume is what gets you into an interview you knock out of the park. Any way you look at it, an internship is a good thing - the earlier you get one, the better.

I'm sure there are more things everybody else would love to share... Please feel free - I can update OP.

5oyhg8,2,2017-01-19,My life down the tube,throwitallaway833,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5oyhg8/my_life_down_the_tube/,"2012 was my year zero. I worked on the Obama campaign and made some good friends. That was my first year of college. Sorted my health out, started going to the gym, very enlightening year.

2013 was the best year of my life, probably. I turned 20 that year, traveled via plane for the first time, went to conferences, traveled overseas, got involved on campus, had a good job as a journalist and did good work. Made some good money on top of financial aid. A good year.

2014 I became boss of the newspaper. I worked ridiculous hours, with difficult people but consistently put out a good product. Didn't have time for much else, but made good money and learned a lot about bureaucracy and people management. At the time I thought I threw the whole year away but looking back, I learned a ton and made good money on top of financial aid.

2015 I was mostly unemployed but got a good paying internship near the end. Frequently had to take my dad to the ER and then got food poisoning bad, like what, 3 times? So then I went to the ER like 15 times. Did some national broadcast radio, worked with a startup, went on a a couple weeklong vacations with friends. Got a staph infection from that vacation but I had my fun. At the time I thought it was a horrible year, and it was I was sick the first 6 months badly. The ER was terrible and overflowing. But there were some bright spots. Near the end of the year I got a bad viral infection that took my voice for 2 and a half weeks, the only way to cure it was with steroids and it took about a year to heal and I still have some weirdness.

In 2016 the staph infection wouldn't go away so I had it surgically removed. The doctor on purpose left dead tissue in there despite the protests of the nurse and it never fully healed. Then the doctor overdosed me on antibiotics and I got seriously ill with intestinal bleeding. I lost my internship and could do nothing but lie in bed and eat apple sauce and potato for 3 months. The doctors to deny culpability pretended I had Crohns, which was devastating because it wouldn't heal, and when I finally got to see a gastro doctor 4 months later he told me it was the drugs and that because I'm young I should eventually heal. About 8 months in in October I began to become functional again. I finished my degree and filed for graduation, having spent the last 8 months alone, lying in bed, talking to my mom several dozen times a day. During the year, the startup I helped build became a multi-million dollar valuation, though I will never see any of that money, and the team I was on at my internship won awards. They don't want to hire me most likely because I'm not reliable because I'm sick. The startup offered me work but it's purely random and whenever they need it, nothing full time. Obama didn't even give me a Christmas card this year, he did every other year.

Now it's 2017 and I'm fucking dead. I don't have an ounce of fight left in my body. Cuts and bruises take months to heal now. I have patches on my skin that no matter how many times I reopen then can't turn anything but black. I'm trying to get new insurance but Kaiser won't let me login even though I paid my due. Out of principle I don't want to beg them for it. I've done enough begging.

I'm happy I'm not utterly disabled or dead. But I have nothing left. I'm upset that my skin won't heal. And I can't get a blood test done without jumping through 10 hoops.

I don't know if I'll ever get a job. I have no confidence left, I have other disabilities and they've flared up hard in the past year since I've been living like a dead body. I'm in pain every day, right now my shoulder is tight and hard as a rock, it's tough to move my neck. I've got nothing left Reddit. I don't want to do anything anymore.

#Sunny's Eeveelutions Bonanza! 

###A BRIEF INTRODUCTION

Hello to you! Welcome to a very special event that I'm currently hosting, as you can see from the title. 

I will be starting my internship in Feb, which means I will have much lesser time to play the 3ds or come on to reddit (sobs) SOOOOOO In lieu of that, in the spirit of the incoming Lunar New Year, I will be giving back to the great community of /r/pokemontrades by doing a special event trade *(which I consider as a semi-giveaway because of the very simple qualifying premise as further explained below)*

To make it really short, I'll be trading away **Custom-Built XXX Ball** eevees everyday till the **end of January** via ~~the GTS primarily, or~~ FC link trades! I'll be posting a different eeveelution build everyday, with a surprise on the last day, so do check for my posts!

***

**But... CUSTOM-BUILT XXX BALL EEVEE? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?**

It means that each day, I will be trading away specific builds which in my opinion, has the best **Nature**, **Ball** *(in design)* and **Egg Moves** in relation to  that specific Eeveelution. (Although if you don't agree with me, we can just agree to disagree heh)

Each eevee template is **painstakingly built from scratch** after cross-referencing from various forums as well as sites such as smogon, bulbapedia, and other subreddits. Not to forget, every eevee is bred with much love and effort (no genning involved!) through trading and smeargle-moveset/dittos-iv/everstone-nature cross breeding with ball inheritance. 

I'm sure every eevee traded away in this bonanza would be an asset to you, be it competitive breeding or adding to your Apriballs/Eggmoves collection!! :D

Oh and did I mention, they all come with its **at least 5IVs** alongside their **Hidden Ability, Anticipation?**

***

### TO QUALIFY

It's easy really, all I need is a **Pokemon in an Apricorn ball that I currently don't have, to add to my collection!** (and don't worry, I still don't have ALOT of Aprimons T.T). 

**Here's the sweet deal**: It doesn't need to have good IVs, nature or egg moves, although I will be thankful if you give me one with some of the above. Basically I'll accept anything as long as it's something I don't have, in reference to the mon in the ball.

~~All you have to do is to check with me if it's something that I'll accept before depositing it in GTS, which I will explain in details in the Instructions below. I may include a spreadsheet if things get messy.~~ [**SPREADSHEET AVAILABLE HERE!**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ruuqIuP8_v5n8DRMQcubecNUR5p3sQbdyQIw2THdwbY/edit?usp=sharing)

**I'll be doing it over LINK TRADE!!**

###TODAY'S GIVEAWAY:  
##DAY ONE: **LURE BALL VAPOREON BUILD** 


Vaporeon, oh sweet sweet vaporeon. 

**ANALYSIS**

Looking at its base stats, it's highest is in Hp, followed closely by Sp.Atk. With Hidden Ability Hydration and Wish, Vaporeon is essentially a near-invincible HP wall healer, good since it's speed stat is so poor.

Offensively, it's high Sp.Atk is impressive and should let you deal high damage easily with the right moves, even more when you use Fake Tears. It can also damage other same-type resistance water-types through Synchronoise. Defensively, you can rest easy knowing that its decent Sp.Def stat defend well against most nasty Special Attack moves, even the annoying Grass and Electric attacks. By using Captivate, you can further reduce Special Attack damage.

However it's poor defense stat alongside it's poor speed will be a concern when facing types it is special effective against: Rock Ground and Fire types, which usually have high attack stats. This can be guarded against via Charm, which can be learned via Move Relearner.


|Pokemon|Qty|Eeveelution|Ball|Nature|IV|Ability|EM1|EM2|EM3|EM4|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Eevee|~~16~~ **0**|Vaporeon|[](/lureball)|Bold|5|Anticipation|Wish|Fake Tears|Captivate|Synchronoise|

**bulk of the non-31IV is in Atk!* 

***~~AS AN ADDED BONUS, 2 of the eevees will be holding water stone!~~ The water stones eevees are sent!***

***

### Instructions
1) Propose your offer with 2 or more choices. I would prefer more choices so we don't keep going back and forth if I already have what you want to offer.

    eg. I have Love Ball Minior-V (with xxx stats/ems/ability *if you wish to state*) 
    and Fast Ball Psyduck available! (with xxx stats/ems/ability *if you wish to state*) 
    Which one will you like? 


**edit**
2) **SORRY I guess GTS is unreliable for this, so I'm switching to link trade now!** After we've come to a decision, just add my FC and post a reply!

3) I'll add you and we'll trade!

***

### Rules

1) Do not request for specifics (aka -Atk, -Spe etc Eevee, Eevee holding xxx, Male/Female Eevee). These will not be entertained. All eevees will be randomly selected.

2) Only **1** Pokemon per comment per trade, so that as many people can benefit from this. 

3) Strictly no reservations! 

Requests may be ignored and users may be blacklisted from future trades and giveaways when rules are not followed.

***

### Endnote

Planning this current trade/semi-giveaway event is thoroughly enjoyable for me. Hope you guys like it! I'll be using this as a masterpost. Do bookmark if you want to check out the trades on the other days!

I'm going to be gone for a few months, so I'd love to find someone to enjoy my fantastic LP apartment for a 6 months or longer
Great news: 
- free laundry in building (washer/dryer) 
- deck space (you can barbecue and even plant a few flowers if you're into that) 
- dishwasher 
- available February 1 - availability up for discussion 
- fully furnished 
- central air

Full disclosure: - one of the bedrooms is small and doesn't have a closet.

This apartment has tall ceilings, natural light, easy street parking (with a permit), a gorgeous Victorian style, and is really comfortable. I would never, ever leave except I have an internship on the other side of the world. It's a 2 minute walk to the Fullerton el, divvy bikes, Lincoln Ave/Halsted St nightlife, and so much more. It's 7 minutes to Lake Shore Drive and 7 minutes to the Kennedy (I-90/94).
Wondering why this is such a low price? Honestly, because I procrastinated and need to get it sublet fairly quickly. I know other places with 2 bedrooms can go for 2k+ in this neighborhood, but I just need to find someone soon, so come take a look :) Give me a call or text at the number above (click ""reply"" above to get my number) or send me an email. I'm also available on whatsapp at +962797470235.

5p0fv0,17,2017-01-19,Issues with focusing at work and understanding basic concepts,IdunnoLXG,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5p0fv0/issues_with_focusing_at_work_and_understanding/,"I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have generalized anxiety disorder. When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments. As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things.

When I went into college I suffered and things never clicked. Doing even the most simple of tasks or assignments were just so difficult for me. I began to not think clearly at all, went into internships and struggled and am now currently at a job where I struggle immensely understanding anything.

My boss will sit there explaining things to me and my mind will either drift or it just simply won't click despite how hard he tries and simplifies things for me. I always tell myself, ""it's not that hard, you're smarter than this"" then I'd think back to times of college where I did really poorly in a class or exam and how I always lagged behind while others breezed through it.

I'm seeing a psychiatrist this Saturday since as I get older things progressively get worse. I feel like I can't control my life and put myself in situations because I don't understand anything whether at work or basic things I need to do around the house.

Anyone else have troubles with this?"

As a follower of this sub and having seen some of the good advice posted I was hoping that I too could get some PF opinions for budgeting my post college life.

Basics:
I'm 27 (single w/ no dependents) and will graduate college this upcoming May and have already accepted a job offer for $82k/yr. I don't have any college debt because I've used my GI Bill to pay for tuition and housing. As a result of using my benefits, I've been able to save $20k via my internships and have approx. 6k in my IRA that I haven't contributed to since leaving the military. In addition, I will also be receiving a $20k signing bonus with my new job.

Where I need help:
I don't come from a well off family (financially) and really don't know good spending practices, and typically find myself choosing not to spend money instead of dealing with the anxiety of how much $ I should spend. I've done some basic budgeting but still not confident on how much I can afford to spend on a monthly basis and still make considerable contributions to my retirement and other savings.

Additionally:
I've been considering purchasing a new car after starting my new career and based on the research that I've done it looks like it will cost me ~$500/mo for the truck that I want including $5k down. Can I responsibly afford $500/mo? Is $500 reasonable car payment? Can I afford $1300/mo for rent? If so, I am close to my ceiling?

I appreciate any input I can get. I realize that $80k/yr a for a new grad isn't bad but I'm afraid experiencing some Chicago winters w/o basic utilities as a child has scarred me."
5p1l7q,66,2017-01-19,How Initial D has shaped my life.,SuperBruan,initiald,https://www.reddit.com/r/initiald/comments/5p1l7q/how_initial_d_has_shaped_my_life/,"I first learned of Eurobeat as a freshman in high school, through an [AMV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zu1km5DlW4) featuring Motorcity (a very good show, by the way). From there I found Initial D, and nothing was ever the same again.


I became hooked on the manga first, and then the show. I loved Shigeno's snarky footnotes/comments sprinkled in the margins, the characters, and of course, the memes. THE FUCKING MEMES.


What I enjoyed equally, if not more, was the technical depiction of racing. Tire grip, lines, braking, weight shifting, countersteering, etc. I lived in a very hilly area in Connecticut, so I used to take my road bike out and try to apply those ideas. I’d powerslide around, and got good enough to where I could pull a 180-degree turn by turning in, throwing my weight to one side, and slamming the brakes. I was burning through brake pads every two months or so and my parents were not happy.


Once I got my driver’s license, I took my family’s old, beat-up, 2001 Toyota Sienna LE, and raced my friend Jon’s 1960’s Chevy [truck](http://imgur.com/NxL3VAy) (that he restored by himself, pretty amazing) home from school on the country backroads. The funny part was that even though the truck was a 4.8 Liter V8, the engine was so degraded that it only made 120 horsepower, and in comparison my 3.0L V6 Sienna had 210. Also, his truck wasn’t geared enough to go over 45 without over-revving. 


We didn’t do any drifting or anything. My Sienna was a FF automatic, and I sure didn’t have the skill anyway. It was very fun but I had to stop when my brother entered high school and had to ride with me.


Now, kind of (exactly) like how it happened to Takumi, I began to wonder about the inner workings of the car I was driving. I knew absolutely nothing about cars, except for gas = go and brake = stop. The best explanation I could give about engines/transmissions/whatever then was, to pull a Jojo reference, “It just works”. 


So I bought used car manuals and studied them. I asked Jon to teach me the ropes. Attended car shows. Watched [Engineering Explained](https://www.youtube.com/user/EngineeringExplained) (great channel). Even my senior English research paper (topic of choice) I wrote about the rotary engine. The complexity and beauty of car design started to get to me, and I knew what I wanted to do from then on out: build race cars.


I applied to and got into Rice University, a very good engineering school, and am majoring in Mechanical Engineering currently. I hold a leadership position in the Rice Electric Vehicle (R.E.V.) team, where we design, build and race a car in Detroit for Shell’s Eco-marathon. I personally designed the [suspension setup](http://imgur.com/a/FEX5Y) while still a freshman there, and am currently working on a gearbox. I haven't even started taking dedicated Mech classes yet (still in general math, chem, and physics), but my self-study has allowed me to work on the same level as senior members who have. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/0TnX2) I am suited up in racing gear, since I'm also the one driving in the race, with my illicit street racing experience. 


I'm also hoping to intern this summer at [Krohn Racing](http://krohnracing.com/), a locally-based group that has competed in races including Grand-Am and Le Mans. They’re pretty serious, and I’m excited.


It’s almost uncanny how much Initial D has informed my choices.

**Old Cars:**
Bunta’s AE86 (a relic in the ID universe by the time Takumi drives it) vs. My 16 y/o Sienna

**Pragmatic Reasons for Racing:**
Takumi: to help with the family business vs. Me: to get home after school faster

**Interest in Cars:**
Takumi asks Iketani to teach him about engines vs. Me: self study with help from Jon

**Dedication to Cars/Racing:**
Takumi dedicates himself to become the fastest driver vs. Me: studies to build (and race) cars

**Project D:**
Takumi - Joins Ryosuke’s Project D vs. Me: hoping to join Krohn Racing 


In short, I'm well on my way to achieving my dream, one that I never would have realized without being introduced to Initial D. 

Rage your Dream, fellas. "

I've lived in San Francisco the past 5 years and now I'm completely overwhelmed with new information for a new city I've never even visited. I've read all the FAQ's and such but I'm hoping for some detailed advice.

I'm going to be working in Lawrence, and I've read enough to know that I probably don't want to live there. 

I'm 23, recently out of college so I'm looking to be able to go out and have a good time, date, drink, and explore all Boston and MA has to offer. Here are some questions I'd love to hear your thoughts!

- Should I consider getting a car?

The first thing I noticed on google maps is that anything near Boston is about an hour and a half public transit commute vs. the 20-35 minute drive. Are there any precautions I should be aware about with having a car in the area? SF is terrible with cars so I'd like to avoid a similar situation.

- Areas to live that will serve my commute to Lawrence well? 

It seems like if I choose to get a car that living in Boston isn't a great idea. I see that some people recommend Andover, or Medford, but I've read that they are slow cities without much to do. Where is a good middle ground to look that has a reasonable commute to Lawrence, and will make it easy for me to have fun and mingle with other people my age?

Any other things I should consider or advice you may have to offer would be greatly appreciated, thank you!"
5p2w4l,153,2017-01-20,"Well, that is it. I have finished the Discworld series...and I will miss them dearly.",AJNorfield,Fantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5p2w4l/well_that_is_it_i_have_finished_the_discworld/,"I’ve dreaded reading the Shepherd’s Crown (the last Discworld novel) for quite some time. Not because I thought it to be a bad book, but because—to me—it was the end of an era. I started reading the Discworld novels fifteen years ago, during one of my very first internships abroad. From that point on, no journey in my life ever took place without at least one Discworld novel in my bag. Now, with Terry Pratchett sadly taken from the world of the living and books (and his daughter confirming none will continue the series), I have no choice, but to say goodbye to one of the most marvelous—and extremely funny—series I’ve read in my life...

I wonder if it's a sign of getting ""old"". As I never really understood why people cared if an idol like Michael Jackson or Prince died. I mean, who cares...right?! But when Terry Pratchett died...I don't know, I would probably say I was in a state of shock. It made reading the last book in the series...an experience. 

To make things worse, the Shepherd's Crown is about the Witches. The ladies in pointed hats have never been a favorite of mine within the totality of the Discworld. I much rather read about the city watch, or even better the wizards—Rincewind in particular. So, the book already had a strike against it from the start. But, as I started reading, that didn’t really matter anymore. This book wasn’t a single book that tried to grab and hold my attention. This book represented an entire era coming to its end, and it greatly influenced how I perceived the book.

I do think Terry wasn’t completely done dotting all the i’s yet, when he was greeted by the man that speaks in CAPITALS. The story or dialogue often feels…short. It’s certainly not among the best in Pratchett’s series—a similar feel I had with Raising Steam—which probably has everything to do with the illness he fought to keep at bay at the end of his life.
Despite those things the book had a big impact on me. The start of the book had me nearly in tears. The events written felt like they described Terry Pratchett’s own state of being near the end of his life. I have no idea if this was intended by him or not, but, as a reader, I felt he gave me the opportunity to say goodbye to him; a man I’ve never met, but who, in a strange way, was such a large part of my life. Through the story, he showed me he got his things in order. It was like a message he left, stating that he had said many things, and would like to say many more—but it was not to be.
It took me a day or two, before I continued after those first fifty pages or so. All because I needed to reflect and ponder on this aspect of the book. I have rarely read a book intro that had such a deep impact on me.

The Discworld novels will always have a special place in my heart and on my bookshelves. I will certainly push them toward my kids, when they are at the age to appreciate the amazingly witty humor poured into these books, and I hope they will laugh like I did. 

Thanks for ""listening""...and I believe I understand those people grieving for somebody they never really knew a little bit better now.

5p36xw,14,2017-01-20,TRUMP FITNESS!! Overview + Day 1 (Week 1),Farscryer0,MYGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MYGA/comments/5p36xw/trump_fitness_overview_day_1_week_1/,"Ok, centipedes... My name is Farscryer0 and I'm also a fitness trainer in training. I'm currently saving up to test out for my CSCS and my ASCM certifications at the moment, so while I cannot do the phys-trainer job and earn money from it (legally), I can offer advice on the free. I graduated from APSU in Clarksville, TN in December of 2015 with a double B.S. in Applied Exercise Science and Kinesiology. But since is the internet (and Reddit, of course) and in the spirit of anonymity, I'm not providing my credentials in a picture format for all the world to see.

Take this for what it is, advice, and always ALWAYS research everything you read. 

Any questions on the above intro, feel free to spam my inbox. I'm willing to answer all I can, provided it doesn't break with the anonymity.

***Overview***
Okay, so after reading a thread on T_D ( link: https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ownis/mrw_i_realize_that_i_cant_compete_with_all_the/ ) I want to try helping my fellow Trump supporters out with personal fitness and nutritional information for those that want help getting started on the journey towards a healthier lifestyle and perhaps a higher physical fitness level then they previously realized. This is good for y'all and good for myself, as it may benefit y'all in the long run while helping me improve my ability to coach via an alternative medium (aka not face-to-face). I'm going to do my best to provide accurate info with links towards relevant topics with each follow on thread, along with links to each prior thread so that future users can follow along if they look for it.

For now though, three precepts before we begin in earnest:

1. This guide and its follow-on threads are based solely within the parameters of users being whole of body. What this means is that I'm typing this with those following it NOT currently suffering physical impairment or injury. Para and quadreplegia, Range of Motion issues, broken and or missing limbs, nerve damage, etc. I'm sure y'all can get the point, you're not *progressives*. That said, if y'all DO choose to follow this guide and knowingly possess one (or many) of the above physical maladies, I am not responsible for what can happen afterwards. This is my disclaimer. Y'all have been warned.

2. This guide operates solely off the basis of *personal integrity*. I'm only here to help, not to bullshit you. Likewise, I am trusting y'all that choose to follow this guide to be honest with yourselves. This is the **[CURRENT YEAR]** and y'all want to change something about yourselves. Don't be all talk, no action. It only hurts y'all, not anyone else.

3. I am making this effort in the hopes that /u/spez or other Reddit admins/mods are willing to forgo the fact that I frequent /r/The_Donald. So if for any reason that I get flak for linking this (and follow on threads) to T_D, that's basically it for cross-traffic fun and games. I'll stick to posting here and let others spread the word.

Alright, enough talk. Now time for more talk.

***Day 1 (Week 1)***
That's right, 'pedes. Open up a journal, create a new MS doc or Wordpad file, and title it as ""Day 1."" This is the start of a brand new day. Pres. Donald J Trump's taking office in a mere 10 hours (at time of typing), SWJs and progressives are losing their fucking minds, and the Alt-Media is laughing their asses off every hour that passes by. Its a brand new fucking day! Enjoy it! Live it up! Go out and do your daily routine by dedicate some time to the following and learn a bit about your body.

The human body exists co-dependently yet *independently* from YOU. You, of course, being the mind that controls your body, sitting here reading this. You make the decisions and the body follows them. That said, your body is independent of your whims due to simple chemistry and biology. What happens to you IN YOUR MIND does not necessarily translate into physical reactions within your body. Although sometimes it does, its a strange process. You can suffer rampant depression and severe stress and your body will display physical reactions. Likewise, your body can feel excellent and healthy and thus impact your psychological state, usually for the positive.

In short, you have needs and wants, and so does your body. The first and foremost is *consistency*. This applies to you and your body. Y'all like your various comforts and routines. Your body, in turn, sets itself to your routine and pumps out power and effort accordingly, adjusting its composition relative to your daily *consistent* needs. You lead an physical-active life, cool: your body will change to provide that increased demand of energy, strength, and endurance with improved cardio-pulmonary fitness, increased muscularity, and an enhanced metabolism to get all those nutrients it needs quicker. You lead a sendentary lifestyle, okay: your body will adjust its metabolic rate to demand less nutrients and more energy storage (aka fat retention) in the hope that when you need to get-up-and-go, you'll have the energy to start being active again.

Your body is kinda like a dog, in a way, and in truth, you need to treat it as such. Take your body out for walks and exercise, feed it consistently and routinely every day, and punish bad habits while rewarding good ones. All of this, over time, will teach your body to react how you need it to and perform how you want it to. Within reason, of course.

So here's the first tiny step and the summation of Day 1 ( of Week 1). Surprise! Its number-crunching. Nothing difficult or strenuous, as you'll get plenty of that latter should you choose to continue (and this thread doesn't get downvoted to Post-Hell).

Here are the basics of what comes next:

1. Calculating your Maximum Heart Rate, Heart Rate per Minute (Resting), and Breath Rate per Minute (Resting).

&gt;MHR is determined by subtracting your age from 220. For example, I am turning 30 in a few days so my MHR is 190 beats per minute (bpm). Your MHR is essentially your ""100%"" of your heart's capacity to work. If you are working at such intensity that your heart rate reaches or somehow exceeds your MHR, not only are your working *waaaaay* too hard but are likely to suffer serious injury or even death. My workout routines all operate within various fractions of your MHR, so if I say that you should run and keep your heart rate between 30% and 50% of your MHR, you should know what your MHR is.

&gt;Resting Heart Rate per Minute (HR/min) can be calculated easily and most reliably by checking your pulse at the carotid artery (side of the windpipe). Grab a stopwatch (or use an application), press a finger lightly upon the flesh over your carotid artery and count the beats for 1 minute. Breathe normally as you do this. On average for a healthy adult, the resting HR is somewhere between 60-100 bpm. For well-trained athletics, its going to be lower than 60, maybe even somewhere around 40 bpm (cardio-bunnies and gazelles, I swear).

&gt;Breath Rate at Rest is calculated in the same way as your Resting Heart Rate, only without the carotid artery. Grab a watch and breath normally for 1 minute. I mean it, *breath normally* for 1 minute. You done? Good. Normal for someone above the age of 12 is around 12-20 breaths per minute. If you hear wheezing or feel a sucking sensation, consult a doctor because something's fucked within your body. That or you smoke, in case of the wheezing. I don't judge, still do myself though I'm quitting on my birthday. Eight years is long enough at a 0.5 - 1 pack a day.

2. Calculate Your Body's Mass (kg), Your Daily Caloric Intake (kcals/day), and Your Adjusted Caloric Intake (kcals/day ± ""x"").

&gt;Okay, whiz-kids from other countries outside the USA already know what kilograms are and use them every day. Feel free to skip this section. Us burger boys and girls here in America rarely use kilograms because just about everything outside of a college campus or a laboratory (or a science subreddit) uses wizard measurements (aka the Imperial System). Pounds and miles and inches and the like. If you don't know the calculation for pounds (lbs) to kilograms (kg), use Google or this equation:

Your Weight / 2.2 = Mass

Simple, right? For example, I weigh 212 lbs and my mass is 96.364 kg. **Boom** you now have your mass.

&gt;Building off your mass, your Daily Caloric Intake (kcals/day)is calculated by the following formula:

Your Mass X 24 hours = Your DCI

For example, 96.634 kg X 24 hours = 2312.736 kcals/day

This means that I must intake 2312.736 kcals (or food calories, such as what's written on a Nutrition Label) per day in order to maintain my current mass. Now, this is the key value you'll be playing with over the next few months, adding or subtracting from it as you want. But that comes later. Small steps before bounding over miles...

&gt;But just in case you're curious, your Adjusted Daily Caloric Intake is calculated by adding or subtracting from your DCI. A word of advice, first. If you start adding to your DCI *you will gain mass*. If you start subtracting from your DCI *you will lose mass*. Therefore, if you're looking to build bulk up and your body's been conditioned for weight resistance training (aka weight-lifting), do yourself a favor and stick to adding no more than 500 kcals to your DCI.

For example: 2312.736 kcals/day + 500 kcals = 2812.736 kcals/day

This is *healthy weight gain*, provided you are knowledgeable about your body's nutritional needs. If you are, you probably don't need this guide, but feel free to fact check as you like.

For everyone else, myself included, we're going to be subtracting from our DCI to achieve our Adjusted Caloric Intake. Key word of warning here: Do not subtract more than 500 kcals from your DCI. Again, do **NOT** subtract **MORE THAN** 500 kcals from your DCI. The reason for this is that DCI - 500 = *healthy weight loss*. Seriously, if you do nothing but veg on the couch and adjust your diet using this formula, you will lose 1 pound (1 lb) per week. This is healthy though obviously it does have a limit and every person's body is different from one another. So, in closing on this section, 2312.736 kcals (day) - 500 kcals = 1812.736 kcals/day

Go over -500 kcals at your prerogative. You know your body better than I do (I hope).

3. Basic Explanation of Macro-nutrients, Helpful Nutritional Guidelines, and a Brief Explanation of Follow-on Threads.

&gt;Macro-nutrients are the key building blocks of food, full stop. They come in three primary varieties: Proteins, Carbohydrates, and Lipids (Fats). For everything else on the label of your nearest multi-vitamin, those too are essential but can primarily be found in the aforementioned three Macro-nutrients in various forms of food. Warning: Water, while unlisted, should be self-explanatory in that you need it to survive, much less remain healthy. Three liters of high quality H2O (or 3.17 US quarts) per day is a good start, though as you improve in fitness your daily water intake will rise. Everything the body does ""burns"" water, fun fact.

A.) Proteins are not just the stuff that makes muscles bigger. They are found in every part of your body, and at least 10k of various types of proteins fuel your body's chemical processes. From a basic nutritional standpoint, all you need to really know for now is that you need roughly 0.8 grams of protein per 1 kg of mass *per day*, 8 grams of protein per 1 lbs of weight per day. From a caloric standpoint, because at some point we will be talking about calorie counting, 1 gram of protein = 4 kcals. Your DCI should incorporate anywhere between 10 - 35% of protein.

B.) Carbohydrates are your body's primary source of fuel. Everything your body does while working out consumes carbs... until you inevitably burn through your body's standalone cache of stored carbs and start burning water to metabolize fat for energy. But the intricacies of the Krebs Cycle can wait for later. For now, though, recognize that *quality of carbohydrates matters a lot*. In other words, if you eat simpler forms of foods, the higher the quality of carbs you will consume. Highly-processed foods are fucking bad for you in many ways, but at the crux of the argument, highly-processed carbs are shit fuel for your body. Your body evolved from omnivore stock, meat is all well and good but grains, beans, and veggies are excellent. Your teeth and jaw are designed to chew, not simply bite. So sink your teeth into (I'll stop with the bad puns eventually) multi-grain breads, beans, and dark leafy greens. From a caloric standpoint, 1 gram of carbs = 4 kcals. Carbohydrates should be the largest source of calories in your DCI, anywhere between 45 - 65% of your DCI.

C.) Lipids are very easy yet cloaked in so much bullshit. Even more so than carbs, people get confused about what types of fat your body needs. Here's the rub: Stay the fuck away from (or at the very least, moderate) fats that are *solid at room temperature*. Butter, milk fat, tallow, suet, cream, margarine, shortening, hydrogenated or partially-hydrogenated oils, coconut oil, palm oil... I could go on for an hour on this, no joke. Instead, choose fats that are *liquid at room temperature*. Olive oil, corn oil, fish oil, canola, sunflower, soybean, and sesame. These are the sources of fats your body craves and are the stuff in which you need to be mindful most on the Nutrition Label. 

C.1) Food companies don't necessarily lie, but like most forms of ""legitimate"" fake news companies, they cloak the truth of their product's composition within buzzwords and misleading labels. Recall hydrogenated and partially-hydrogenated oils? Yeah, this is a cute buzzword that translates to ""this product contains trans fat, which is really fucking illegal in the USA because its so very bad for you."" You should NOT be eating anything that contains trans fat. At all. Again, the shit's bad for you.

C.2) Saturated fats are found in anything that is derived from animal stock. Poultry, beef, pork, and dairy. Sat fats are bad for you because they contain proteins called ""LDLs,"" which stands for Low-Density Lipoproteins. This is an acronym that is best known for its effects on the body: Cholesterol, aka plaque on the inside of your veins and arteries, aka a future heart attack or stroke given time and quantity. Another fun fact, within 15 mins of digestion (starting when you put it in your mouth), sat fat turns into fat tissue. Your body loves this stuff like a fat kid loves cake. Limit yourself to no more than 10 grams of sat fat per day.

C.3) Good fats, or ""liquid fats,"" go by a rather mystifying name on the Nutrition Label: Mono- and Poly-Unsaturated Fats. Here's the skinny on both: 

C.3.1) Mono-Unsaturated Fats are not good or bad for you. they act as kind of a full system flush, binding to LDLs (aka Cholesterol) and HDLs (High-Density Lipoproteins). You should eat foods containing some of this but more of...

C.3.2) Poly-Unsaturated Fats act as the cardio-vascular system's equivalent of Drain-O, if the stuff also strengthened the pipes in addition to burning away the crud lining the inside. These is the fat you want MOST of. Also known as High-Density Lipoproteins (HDLs), Poly-Unsat Fats are what is slowly coming to visibility on the Nutrition Label. This is the good stuff you want.

C.4) Lipids are important for your body's stored energy system. Fats sheath your body and many of its more energy-intensive sub-systems (heart, lungs, liver, the inside of long bones, between your skin and muscle tissue, etc.). From a caloric standpoint, 1 gram of lipids = 9 kcals, anywhere from 20 - 35% of your DCI. Key note, most of this range is related to sat fat. Again, try to keep to the 10 grams/day rule on that and scarf down all the liquid fats you can to make up the rest of the percentage.

&gt;Helpful Nutritional Guidelines are pretty much this: Everything in moderation, stay away from trans fats, and mind your salt intake. On that last point, unless you live in a desert environment, keep to no more than 1600 mg of sodium per day, especially if you want to lose weight. Sodium is key for your body's muscular system (among many others), but your body doesn't need *that* much. Practicing keeping your sodium at &gt;/=1600 mg is good for when you inevitably start calorie-counting.

&gt;Brief Explanation on Follow-up Threads.  Provided this thread doesn't descend to Post-Hell and people actually want more from me, I'll happily provide it. Starting with tomorrow's thread at 0200-0400 (-ish), I'll start providing the workout routine I developed for my internship. It starts off pretty simply but will build up in time. Don't worry, though, because tomorrow's workout is pretty light. Its just a core body test of your maximal bench press, squat, and dead lift weight, which will act as bench-marks for later months. Also a 1 mile run, as a test of cardio-pulmonary fitness. Pretty simple, just extra data for y'all to jot down as examples of personal growth. I hope you've been taking notes and like what you've read.

Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut/friends/online.

5p4esq,1,2017-01-20,"Currently interviewing for different jobs, getting into finals rounds and I am not sure what to do if I got an offer that wanted me to start before I finished interviewing with another company. Advice would be appreciated.",SugarFreeBrowny,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5p4esq/currently_interviewing_for_different_jobs_getting/,"Good morning everyone,

I recently withdrew from graduate school to take a break and get some experience working. I have applied to around 40 jobs. Expecting to only hear back from 1 or 2, I have had 4 that have made it last round of interviews. While I know that I won't get offers for all 4 positions, It does seem that 2 could be a possibility. This would be my first full time job that isnt an internship in the summers between college semesters. I got my Bachelor's of Science in Chemistry with American Chemical Society Certification. I never really enjoyed research as it is generally a very boring and long process but 90% of entry level positions I could find are research related. I currently have a temporary employment that pays $10.65 an hour and only need to give 2 weeks notice to leave. 

What I am trying to ask is what do I do if one offers and wants me to start as soon as possible but I haven't heard back from another about an offer that would be a better package deal?

Here are the the basic info about jobs I have made it to the last round so far:

**Option 1: Lab Specialist**

Researching in a Cancer Research lab helping with tasks that are generally performed very often in sample preparation. 

Pay: 30-35K

Benefits: Yes

Full Time

**Option 2: Lab specialist**

research in the biochemistry in vision, doing tasks that are generally performed very often for sample prep as well maintaining a mouse colony

Pay 30-35K

Temporary employee until later evaluated so no benefits at first

Full Time

**Option 3: Lab Specialist**

research in the microscopic structures of human tissue, but weren't very clear on what I would be doing

Pay 30-35K

Benefits: Yes

Full Time

**Option 4: Clinical Research Associate**

Office job mainly dealing with the paper work that must be done for clinical research and trials to be completed or move forward.

Pay: 40-42K

Benefits: Yes

Full time

Ultimately, Option 4 is the job I feel I want the most. However I know I wouldn't hear back about that one till almost the end of February and the others I would probably know by the beginning of February.

5p5hq9,6,2017-01-20,OS Discussion/SPOILERS. My theory on the season 7 that never was. Working off the ground laid during S5-S6.,MiralW,GilmoreGirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5p5hq9/os_discussionspoilers_my_theory_on_the_season_7/,"I've debated a bit on the premise of why exactly the Huntzbergers disapprove of Rory. (See previous post - https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/5n8olb/why_do_shira_and_elias_huntzberger_disapprove_so/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=GilmoreGirls

**Elias** -is a stodgy old coot. Her status as illegitimate is probably enough for him to disapprove of her. 

**Shira** - probably sees Rory as similar to the working women that Mitchum routinely beds (i.e., a threat). Rory is not a vapid socialite that Shira will enjoy shopping with and generally being vapid with. 

**Mitchum**- has been my question mark. I did not see him as caring about the above. But the question is what does Mitchum care about? What Mitchum cares about is keeping Logan on his leash. So, would Mitchum have perceived Rory a threat to Mitchum’s control of Logan? 

- Logan demonstrated that he'd blow off Mitch/work for Rory (Valentines Day). 

- Then there was the internship. Why did Mitchum give her the internship in the first place and then tell her she didn't have ""it""? Did he mean it? Was he lying? Was he being extra harsh to prove a point? Maybe he was testing her mettle. Maybe he wanted to see if his slam would break her. It did sidetrack her. But then she returned to school. Got back with Logan and they were going stronger than ever after the Costa Rica accident. 

- She called Mitchum to b*tch him out about not visiting Logan in the hospital. 

- She tried to get the NYT reporter to write a retraction on Mitchum's interview where he insinuated he gave her her ""start."" (It was never picked up again but it had to mean something. Had ASP been around in S7 it probably would've come up again. Mitchum probably would've found out and likely been pissed. ""How dare she embarrass me?!"") 

- Finally, there was Rory and Mitchum's exchange on the elevator during Partings. He says sending Logan to London had nothing to do with keeping Logan from Rory, but maybe he lied. He said it was to get Logan away from Colin and Finn. Yes, they were his playmates but were they the real threats? Logan was their ringleader. They did what he said. Not the other way around. Mitchum using the ""dopes"" as the justification was a brilliant manipulation. He knew it was something Rory couldn't disagree with. It appeased her and got her on board with London –supportive enough at least to not ask Logan to stay. 

So let’s say Mitchum knew the only one –aside from himself – who had any real influence over Logan was Rory.  And Logan asked Rory to ask him to blow off London. He probably would've stayed had she asked. Or at least delayed going. Mitchum probably knew that. Not that Logan asked Rory to tell him to stay, but that if Rory did ever tell Logan to stay, he would. (Follow?)

So that’s my theory. Mitchum perceived Rory as a threat to his ability to keep Logan under his thumb. The S7 that didn’t happen would’ve followed up on this. How far Mitchum would’ve gone to separate them would’ve been interesting to watch. The 4 words back then – under those conditions – would’ve been so, so different.

Now the way S7 played out rendered the above scenario as no longer viable. Hence, AYITL had to gloss over the Rory/Mitchum power struggle with murky, sinister ""dynastic plan"" references.  Regardless, it's fascinating to consider the season 7 that might've been."

I'm lazy, and I don't like having to do work, which is why I set up an MDT Server and automated Workstation Installation.  

Because of this, I want to learn PowerShell because I like taking months to figure out how to stop doing my job while getting my computer to start doing it for me. So I can read Reddit and stuff.

My current project is automating user creation, because I get bored clicking my mouse.

as a preface, please be aware that I have tried to do as much as possible on my own so as not to ask easily researched questions. If I've missed something and you have a link to rudely drop in my lap, please do!

So let me give you an overview of what I'm trying to accomplish and what I have been able to accomplish so far.

Basically I want to make a script which I can input a Campus, a Department, the Users Position, and their first and last names.

Example: (COMPANY is replaced by my company's initials)  


    PS C:\&gt; New-COMPANYUser -FirstName John -LastName Smith -Campus Downtown -Department RockCollector -Position PolishingAgent -AccountExpires (##/##/####, if intern)

let me outline what I have been able to do so far.  
For starters I have a script working that:  
* Takes 2 inputs. First Name, Last Name.  
* Creates the Home Directory  
* Disables Inheritence from above on the Home Directory  
* Creates the User Account in a specific OU (hardcoded OU,Password,Description,etc based on user position)  
* Sets ACL Permissions on the Home Directory  
* Sets User as the Owner of their Home Directory  


(eventually I will be setting this up to work with Exchange, and I should be able to figure that out without issue.)


Here is the code I am currently working on and what I am trying to accomplish:  

    [CmdletBinding()]
    Param
    (
    [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline=$true)]
    [string]$AccountExpires,
    [Parameter()]
    [ValidateSet('Downtown','Locaton2','Location3','Location4','Location5')]
    [string]$Campus,
    [Parameter()]
    [ValidateSet( 
    if ($Campus = 'Downtown'){ 
    'RockCollector' 
    } 
    else if ($Campus = 'Location2'){ 
    'Garbage','Water','Theguyswholiketoburnstuff'
    }
    )]
    [string]$Department,
    [Parameter()]
    [ValidateSet(
    if ($Department = 'RockCollector') {
    'PolishingAgent', 'Dunce', 'Samurai Jack'
    }
    )]
    [String]$Position,
    [string]$FirstName,
    [string]$LastName
    )

So basically I am wanting to be able to tab complete a -Campus.  
Then I want to be able to tab complete a -Department, but ONLY from the departments that are located at the specific campus I selected.  
Then I want to tab complete a Position, but ONLY from the specific department that I selected.

I still haven't figured out how I am going to take that tab completed string and use it to in a way that provides information that I want, but I figure this is the place to start!

Ideas?

5p6cw6,7,2017-01-20,Co-op vs. No Co-op (3rd Year BUCS Student),Reinswood,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/5p6cw6/coop_vs_no_coop_3rd_year_bucs_student/,"Hey guys, just looking to vent out some anxiety and ask for general career advice from other BUCS or CPSC students.

So all my peers around me seem to be involved with co-op (no really like everyone I know) and pretty much experts in their fields already. I was wondering what my chances were of getting a summer internship (or any job really) without being in co-op. I do have some career fundamental and communication skills like writing a resume and what not from Sauder, but I just feel like I'm at a clear disadvantage without any co-op resources. I can't really think of a reason why they wouldn't choose a co-op applicant over me (since only beautiful people are in co-op).

I sort of missed my timing to apply for co-op because I had to take a 2 year break from studies after my 2nd year due to military obligations (yeah life sucks). I returned this winter term as a 3rd year and currently taking CPSC 304 and 310 (already took 110, 121, 210, 213, 221). My grades were not very good in my first 2 years and that is why co-op was never really an option for me back then. That being said, my first term back as a 3rd year got me an average of around 80%.

What do you guys think about co-op? I know not all co-op students get jobs and some get offers that are not first choice. BUCS stands for ""Business and Computer Science"", a specialization in BCOM for anyone that is wondering."
5p6z68,16,2017-01-20,[HM] Trump's First Day,Joterfree,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/5p6z68/hm_trumps_first_day/,"It's a dark, stormy day at the White House. A sign reading ""Days Since Last Racist/Sexist/Discriminatory Comment"" has been newly added to the front lawn. An unpaid college intern comes out and flips the counter from ""1"" to ""0"", all while being viciously whipped by Mike Pence. He then flips the ""Record Number of Days"" sign from 0 to 1 and curls up in his nearby doghouse while Pence goes back inside.

Pence arrives back in the Oval Office to find President Trump with his hands wrapped around the neck of a woman wearing lingerie, too much makeup, and a spot of mysterious white powder on her nose. The woman is breathing normally and tells him that his hands are simply too small to crush her windpipe. He slaps her for such disrespect (she doesn't even flinch), and proceeds to rant at her about how his hands are completely normal.

Mike Pence clears his throat and apologizes for interrupting. Trump gets up and hands the woman a dirty wad of cash off the table for fulfilling his fantasy. ""Thanks, Melania"", he says as he sends her off with his customary handshake, a good ol' American pussy grab. All other ways to shake hands with women have since been outlawed.

""What's shakin', Pence-y Poo?"" Trump asked, completely unaware of how homoerotic that nickname was.

""I wanted to ask how your first day went?"", Pence-y Poo replied.

""Ah, my first day,"" Trump mused, ""I remember it like it was yesterday."" It was yesterday, but Pence didn't say that, because that wouldn't be very funny. Both men flashed back to yesterday's events. It was a bright and sunny day in the white house, with the Obama family and Joe Biden packing up to leave. Michelle Obama was holding Biden back with her enormous arms, as he screamed things like ""Not my president!"" while firing nerf guns into the air. Michelle took the guns away, but Biden pulled out another pair. They had no idea where he kept getting them from.

Meanwhile, Barack Obama took one last look at the White House and sighed, as Trump entered behind him, drinking a Coke. Oh, but not the Coke you're familiar with- the REAL Coke, that only billionaires can afford. The one with the gold flakes in it that poor people's tax dollars pay for. Finishing up, Trump threw the can on the White House lawn, where it landed at Barack's feet. He picked it up, and a single tear rolled down his face. The family watched helplessly as the Trumps took their place, with the weather above the House immediately changing from sunny to stormy as they did.

Back in the present day, the two men laughed, enjoying the memory, as they returned to their business. Trump picked up a newspaper off his desk and looked at it. ""Trump Approval Ratings Starting at Lowest of Any President"", the headline said. Trump shook his head. He'd have to go tweet the phrase ""FAKE NEWS"" in all caps again to take care of this one. After all, how is a billionaire entertainer-turned-President supposed to get enough attention if he doesn't tweet with his caps lock on six times a day?

Trump shook his head, he just couldn't understand it. Why didn't America like being pissed on? After all, Trump sure did."

5p82tg,2,2017-01-20,Question about internship salary?,barbarr,askjapan,https://www.reddit.com/r/askjapan/comments/5p82tg/question_about_internship_salary/,"I'm taking an internship at Kaneka Corp. in Takasago. They are paying for all travel expenses (US to Japan, airport to dorm, dorm to work, and back) and all housing expenses over 10 weeks. The stipend is 5000￥ per work day, and work hours are 9AM to 5:40PM from Monday to Friday. Food is available at the work site on weekdays, and is between 900-1000￥ total per day for three meals; however on the weekends I need to get my own food.

I'm going as a junior undergraduate. Most other internship offers in the US were better paying but I chose this one because I like to travel and it's in the same academic field I want to do grad school in. Does the stipend/accommodation situation sound ok? How does it compare to a typical domestic undergraduate technical internship?"

From: Marlene Chance chancesr@bellsouth.net
I am so sorry to hear about your loss.
My mother was only one of the many victims of the negligence, incompetence, and malpractice of St.
Luke's Hospital, many of it's doctors, and every single nurse who was assigned to my mother, no
exception! As a graduate of nursing from the University of the Philippines, I had the great misfortune of
witnessing first hand, the incredible lack of compassion, basic nursing care and professionalism that
nursing stands for, as well as the serious lack of basic intelligence from all the hospital's nurses that the
St. Lukes employs and tolerates.
The nursing duties and functions that were so simple and basic, and that should have all been mastered
while in nursing school prior to graduation and licensure, all turned into major disasters and
complications that could have ALL been prevented. These are only a few of the negligent and
incompetent acts: (1) bed sores on my mother's buttocks on the third day of admission, not having been
turned, moved or changed, (she was actually stuck to the soiled linen from old urine and feces) until I
arrived from the United States to change her myself...there was absolutely no reason for decubitus
ulcers on a third day, or any day for that matter, if basic nursing care is carried out. She was in a private
room on the Geriatric floor where nobody changed patient's beddings for weeks at a time, or until
forced to by the family of the patient.
(2) fecal impaction which resulted in acute rectal bleeding and anemia, and subsequent and multiple
blood transfusions, plus a stat colonoscopy that required anesthesia of course, in an already
compromised patient. I begged for the attending (Sotomayor) to check her bowels DAILY, because she
had not had a bowel movement in several days, and only on the 10th day, did I finally get an order in the
chart for an INTERN (another incompetent future doctor at the time) to disimpact my mother, which
resulted in bleeding and hemorrhage.
(3) misuse of the appropriate antibiotics, having had a urine culture done, the attending ordered Amoxil
which was not sensitive to the bacteria in her urine, and a few days later, she became septic and
gradually deteriorated from untreated Urinary Tract Infection. This is a disease that we treat in the
outpatient settings in the United States, it is basic, easy to treat, if standard care and protocols are
followed.
(4) As a Diabetic, drawing blood out of the lower extremity is an absolute CONTRAINDICATION, but the
phlebotomists continued to take blood out of her feet when nobody was looking, or intentionally at
dawn, when my mother's attendant was sleeping, and before I arrived for a visit. I posted signs all over
the wall and bed, and informed the nurses and laboratory supervisors never to allow blood drawing
from any other part of her body aside from her arm, but nobody heeded my instructions. My mother
died of a Massive Pulmonary Embolus after 45 days of admission at St. Lukes. This clot was a direct
result of drawing blood from her lower extremities, simply because the medical technologists were too
incompetent and too lazy to find any other vein elsewhere.
(5) Physical Therapist burned my mother's left arm and shoulder while applying the ultrasonic heat, and
not bothering to test before using on a patient. I found the burns myself, they were never reported. My
mother sustained first and second degree burns that again, were dismissed as ""normal and usual effects
of being a patient at St. Lukes."" That is not tolerated in the United States, would have required an
incident report, which was never completed, and would have easily been grounds for negligent action
and malpractice.
(6) Tube Feedings. Not a single RN on the floor had the basic knowledge or skill as to the proper use and
feeding process of my mother's PEG tube. They practically shoved the container of food as fast as they
could, causing abdominal discomfort, unless I stood next to her bed to watch and supervise. Nobody on
the floor even knew how to use the feeding tube machine on that Geriatric Floor. We had the
supervisor, head nurse and director of nursing in my mother's room trying to figure out how to use this
very simple machine that they should have been trained to use properly. Needless to say, because of the
delay in feedings, my mother's nutritional status was compromised even more, resulting also in
occlusion of her PEG tube, which of course required a replacement. The skills or lack of, in these nurses
were pathetic, and unacceptable.
(7) This was rather interesting. At 9 o'clock every morning, a clerk from the business office would knock
at my mother's door to hand me the hospital bill, and ask how much I was paying that particular day! It
did not matter how much of the expense these incompetent employees were costing me for their
negligent actions, all that mattered is that I made a deposit towards the multi-million peso bill that
multiplied every hour! And if I did not go down to make a payment, they would call to remind me until I
did. At the ER, the hospital refused to treat my mother until my sister made a P10,000 deposit in the
middle of the night, when the banks are closed! And on discharge, after Dr. Abraham-Lim's professional
discount (the only decent doctor my mother had), we paid a 2 Million Peso hospital bill that did not
include the pharmacy and mutiple professional fees.
I can go on and on with the numerous disasters, these are only a few that stick out in my mind and that I
will never forget!
There were clearly several instances where St. Lukes failed to meet the standard of care which directly
caused injury and subsequent death to my mother. I made every effort to litigate, but unfortunately,
there were no malpractice attorneys available in the country, and nobody was willing to take the case in
the Philippines. I tried to publish the detailed scenario of the many terrible mistakes committed that
eventually led to my mother's death, but the lawyers of this big corporate institution paid Manila Times
and other newspaper publications not to publish my article. I wrote to the Secretary of Health, but got
no response. I wrote and sent letters by certified mail, to the President and CEO of St. Lukes and to the
Director of Nursing and the Nursing Department, and again, did not get any response.
As a Filipina myself, I must say it is rather unfortunate that Filipinos and others who reside in the
Philippines, have to fall victim to the poor and negligent, but very, very expensive medical care at St.
Luke's Hospital every day. There must be a way to put a stop to this negligent care!"
5p8hlx,26,2017-01-20,Regular Show: Over Six Years of Laughs and Life Lessons,CoolVidsFTW,regularshow,https://www.reddit.com/r/regularshow/comments/5p8hlx/regular_show_over_six_years_of_laughs_and_life/,"Hi there, r/regularshow. Today I present to you a Top 10 list of my favorite *Regular Show* episodes. I wasn’t quite sure where to post this where people would care, so I hope you can take the time to read through my post and see my reasoning behind some of my choices. Just some background info: I was ten years old when this show came out, and I still remember watching *The Power* during the slot it shared with with *Adventure Time* at the time on Cartoon Network. It has been a blast growing up watching these characters evolve over time, and like the title of my post implies I did indeed laugh a lot and learn a lot from this believe it or not. Some of you may sympathize with me when I say that. So! Without further delay, let us get started!

**10. The Real Thomas: An Intern Special**
Season 6, Episode 8 (Ep. 161)

&gt; “Because my name is not Thomas. It is Nikolai. And I am Russian spy.” *dramatic pause*

Fun Fact: *Exit 9B* barely missed my Top 10 (#11) and was defeated by the episode that concluded the Thomas/Nikolai arc of *Regular Show*. During his time on the show, Thomas was always a fun character to watch in the background, doing most of the grunt work the Park’s employees would normally handle themselves. The way his character was written impresses me the most. I remember when this episode first aired and was immediately caught off guard by the fact that Thomas/Nikolai worked for the Russian govt, spying on the Park. This was one of the more “action-focused” episodes, and I consider it one of the best ones. I think because it included a storyline (unlike most other episodes), it added more reason to why I chose this episode to be my No. 10. What I'm saying is that it contained more ""substance"" and ""depth"" to it. Also, I loved the U.S. nationalism from everyone towards the end. That was quite humorous (especially for the day I'm posting this). Overall, it was a great conclusion to one of the many character arcs in *Regular Show*.

**9. New Year’s Kiss**
Season 5, Episode 14 (Ep. 113)

&gt; “Year of the Rigby, baby!”

Aka the episode that introduced CJ as a recurring character throughout the show. I really like this episode because it reintroduced CJ, who had not been in an episode since *Yes Dude Yes* (appeared briefly in a hallucination in *Survival Skills*, but I won’t count that). Anyway, Rigby is put in charge by his future self to stop Mordecai from kissing a girl at midnight. While at the end of the episode, it may have seemed like he saved the day, Mordecai ends up kissing CJ. Whether the plan by his future self was to stop the kiss between him and Tracy Hashtag or CJ is unknown, but it is an interesting thought to ponder. Did Rigby save Mordecai from an unhappy future or create a new one for him and CJ? The first half of the Margaret arc (from Season 1-4) was very entertaining to watch. My fear, at the time, was that I would lose interest if she was truly gone for good. However, and thankfully, I stuck around to watch the CJ arc begin. And at this point, I feel like Mordecai’s character development begins its evolution around this episode or the next, which to me means a lot when watching any television series.

**8. Meteor Moves**
Season 4, Episode 28 (Ep. 107)

&gt; “You know what they say? Envelopes thin, didn’t get in. Envelopes fat, school is where it’s at!”

This is one of the more memorable episodes I remember watching. I felt so happy for Mordecai at the conclusion of the episode. He finally did it! He made it out of the friendzone! From all guys around the world, we salute you, Mordecai. You have courage. But seriously, I can’t exactly relate personally, but the episode made me imagine myself in Mordecai’s position, and now that I think about it, while I type this, I’m pretty sure I actually cried at the end. Mordecai gave me hope. I think at that point on, I empathized with his character and personality more than I ever did before. A truly emotional episode for me for sure.

**7. Rigby’s Graduation Day Special**
Season 7, Episode 36 (Ep. 217)

&gt; “The greatest mistake a man can make is looking for flowers among the weeds, overlooking the fact that oftentimes the very weeds are flowers.”

This episode is meaningful because of two reasons. The first is because it marks the end of Rigby’s journey throughout high school. From *The Eileen Plan* to *Gymblonski* to *Rigby Goes to the Prom*, we all saw Rigby go through thick and thin to not just satisfy and make Eileen proud but also for his own sake, knowing he can accomplish anything. For some people, I think that message means a lot: never give up on anything you set your mind to, a classic message. The other reason is because it marks the beginning of the “Space Saga”. At first, I was very confused with what was happening and it all seemed so sudden and rushed, but in retrospect, I think this point of the show was the perfect time to introduce, essentially, the beginning of the end [of the show]. The episode, as a whole, tied up everything together and successfully transitioned into a new (concluding) storyline.

**6. Pam I Am**
Season 7, Episode 32 (Ep. 213)

&gt; “The sound from the guard post bounces off of the dome and back down to this exact spot.”

With the exception of Pops and Skips, we never typically see *Benson* in the dating world. This episode rectified that. After seven ex-girlfriends (according to the wiki), Benson finally found someone he resonates with (through the finale to add). This episode made me feel happy for the guy. I never really knew why he never had a steady girlfriend in the first place. You’d think for a guy with a hard-working work ethic, he’d probably have one by now. I guess he was just plain unlucky. I’m glad the writers for the show didn’t forget about this aspect of him. While Benson does have a short temper (among other weaknesses), he is very loyal and means well in the end. It was nice to see him be rewarded for once.

**5. Meet the Seer**
Season 8, Episode 25 (Ep. 242)

&gt; “Many universes have come and gone. It’s the natural order of things. Yours lasted longer than most, but now your universe, your lives, the Park, everything. It’s all going to end.”

Another one of my favorite story arcs of *Regular Show* was the “Format Wars”, and it was really amusing to catch all the media references throughout these episodes. Internet/Streaming makes a comeback from *Format Wars II*, the return of HD DVD, and the debut of Blu Ray, a character I really wish we saw more of. The sibling rivalry was an aspect I thoroughly enjoyed. I think the best media related pun was the fact that the planet the Park crew lands on is named “Planet Nielsen”, named after the company that measure audience ratings across television and the web. I will say, streaming is, in fact, dominating the media industry. I don’t get why people are so against it though (even in real life). But that topic is for another day. Several puns later, we’re introduced to the Seer, voiced by the same actress who played Helen on *Drake and Josh*. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think this is the point of the show where the fourth wall is broken...continuously. This is something I love to watch, and I find it very amusing to watch characters realize they play parts of someone’s imagination. But that’s just me. Overall, as a tech/media geek/enthusiast, I find this episode, and the ""Format Wars"" arc episodes, fun to watch and sprinkled with all sorts of media related puns. Good stuff.

**4. Yes Dude Yes**
Season 3, Episode 25 (Ep. 65)

&gt; “Yeah. Cloudy J?”

The episode that was the precursor to the CJ arc. We’re first introduced to CJ, and she and Mordecai hit it off really well. That is until Mordecai invites Margaret to the movies. CJ starts a storm at the coffee shop and stops when Mordecai owns up to his mistakes. After that, we never see her again until *New Year’s Kiss*. I think it’s pretty cool the writers introduced CJ this way. You would think CJ was a one-off character at this point in the show, but nah she shows up 50 episodes later to introduce a new dynamic to the second half of the show. It makes me wonder if this was planned the entire time or the writers wrote it in sometime later. Whatever the case may be, this is what started it all for the CJ arc, and I have a strong appreciation for this episode.

**3. This Is My Jam**
Season 2, Episode 13 (Ep. 25)

&gt; “You can’t touch music, but music can touch you.”

This is probably the funniest episode in my opinion, especially when the Summertime Song manifests itself into live- er - “ghost” form. The quote I mention above is one of the most memorable from the show as a whole. The montage scene was quite funny as well. But the bottom line is that the songs in the show were so incredibly catchy. Aw snap. Aw snap. Come to our macaroni party and we’ll take a nap. There’s not much else to say other than the fact this episode was freakin’ hilarious.

**2. Just Friends**
Season 7, Episode 12 (Ep. 193)

&gt; “I think it would be best if we were just friends.”

This episode. This episode, man. It provided so much closure for me. Personally, I’m more of Mordecai and Margaret type of guy, but let’s not spark too much argument. The closure was so perfect, so well-executed, and it taught all of us a valuable lesson: we’re all still young (Well, I think. Don’t want to make *too* many generalizations of the sub here.), so we should enjoy our lives while we can and save the serious stuff for later. One way or another, I’m sure some of us can relate to this episode...somehow. It just resonates me so well, and while this episode didn’t make me cry it did make my heart happy.

**1. A Regular Epic Final Battle**
Season 8, Episode 27 (Ep. 244)

&gt; “Jolly good show.”

I won’t say too much about the finale other than it truly was a “jolly good show”. First off, the throwback to *The Power* was a genius call. I didn’t watch the finale live, but it did catch me off guard for a few moments until I realized the universe (kind of) restarted itself. I think Pops’ death was necessary to end the show because I think it would end on a *too happy* note. I’m glad Mordecai ended up with someone else, glad Rigby and Eileen are happy, glad Benson married Pam, and everyone’s lives were saved thanks to his sacrifice. The reunion scene caught me in the feels, man. I’ve lived to watch these characters for almost half of my life. That. Is. Crazy. “Heroes” made it even more emotional (shoutouts to the team who gathered enough money to license that song). I don’t know what else to say. If *Regular Show* had to end eventually, I’m glad it ended in this way. It’s all bittersweet.

If you managed to get this far, thank you for reading my Top 10 list! I’m curious as to what your Top 10’s are so please feel free to let me know in the comments! I’d just like to thank J.G. Quintel for over six years of laughs and life lessons. And I also want to thank this sub for sparking discussion about the latest episodes when everyone stopped caring about the show how many years ago. It’s been a pleasure watching with you guys. Some honorable mentions for this list include: *Exit 9B*, *Real Date*, *The Power*, *Space Escape*, *Rigby Goes to the Prom*, *Guys Night 2*, *Format Wars II*, *Dumped at the Altar*, *The Dome Experiment Special*, and *The Eileen Plan*.

If you want to see my full list of favorite episodes, check out this link: http://challonge.com/7tfz6p1k/standings. I played a mock Swiss-round tournament using some *Regular Show* episodes I found entertaining. That’s how I made my list as it was way to difficult to choose on my own. Again, thank you for reading this post, and it truly has been a jolly good show.

5p8jmp,2,2017-01-20,My ex [23M] of 3 years dumped me out of the blue 3 months ago and I'm [22F] having a hard time moving on,avril15,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5p8jmp/my_ex_23m_of_3_years_dumped_me_out_of_the_blue_3/,"Three months ago I was happy. Well, stressed and confused and everything that a freshly-graduated twenty-something normally is, but in the process of figuring out how I was going to move cross-country to be with my boyfriend of 3 years.

I know that everyone who's gone through a breakup talks about how perfect the relationship was, but it was so good, you guys. He was everything that I look for in a person: smart but not too pretentious, cute but not intimidating, dedicated to his goals but not a robot about it, concerned about the world but so happy. He just radiated happiness. He wasn't a one-note person by any means, but his default state was joy and appreciation for life. I'm a person who tends to vary much more emotionally (a bit of anxiety, a bit of seasonal depression) and he brought out the best in me. And he was so funny without trying. He thought the world of me, and showed it.

We were always on the same page conversationally. It was so effortless to be sweet to each other. We were at school together so we both had challenging courseloads (and extracurriculars, and hobbies, etc) but we spent as much time together as we could. Long mornings in bed, date nights. Our friends all became friends with each other. Our lives felt combined without being codependent. Even after our honeymoon period was theoretically over, we were still growing as people and learning things about each other. The sex even got better over time. Everything that everyone talks about love being, but not in a grand way. I just had my person.

Pretty much the only thing we ever had a conflict about was what would happen long term, geographically speaking. His major almost entirely goes to a certain city, and mine to another. We did internships every summer in our respective cities, which would go okay. We figured out what a long distance relationship would look like and initially neither of us wanted that. Our senior year, we almost broke up after he interviewed for a job in my future city and got it... just to use it to negotiate a better offer in his city. We signed on offers across the country from each other two Octobers ago, and spent about a day broken up. We decided that we would rather be together through the end of the year and enjoy it. A couple months later, after he came home for Christmas with me (!), we decided that we wanted to do it long term and long distance. It's very common in my industry to move on from the first job after 1-2 years and move to (among other places) his city, so it seemed like a doable plan.

Fast forward a year later. A wonderful last semester together, the relationship deepening even further, graduation, trip to Europe with friends, starting our jobs. We saw each other almost once a month and were communicating really well; phone calls every few days and lots of texts. It wasn't the same and we sometimes had to talk through things but it felt like we were working towards a great future. Like, he would literally bring up children (not often, not even sure that either of us really wanted them, and not for another 5 or 10 years, but hey...) and we were planning Thanksgiving next month with both of our families.

In October, recruiting starts for the job-after-my-job, so I started talking to people. Not even to jobs directly, but general networking to figure out how to get hired in his city. I was hating my job, feeling the post-college blues, having a bit of a crisis about what to do next work-wise. Holding on to the idea of at least knowing where I was going next and that I would have him. And I wanted to be in his city anyway! Warmer, more friends, more interesting jobs.

Over of the course of this week or so, I talked to him a lot since I was starting to make decisions. I brought up the possibility I could move out there as early as this summer (though it probably wouldn't be until the summer after). I noticed that he started getting quieter and less enthusiastic through the week. I finally brought it up over the phone and he started telling me that he'd been having doubts... that if I moved out there it would mean something serious about the relationship and that would be too much pressure.

As calmly as possible, I told him that he had a couple of weeks to get his shit together because I needed to figure out what I was going to do with applications. He agreed and, after a very tense 6 hours, called me back while I was at a party and dumped me. ""Hardest decision I've ever made,"" ""maybe we can revisit it in a year or two,"" etc.

After a call the next day to make sure that this was actually happening, I've gone no-contact. I sent one email a few weeks later that he responded to and it was all very polite and very sad.

I'm angry that he ended it the way he did, without any hint of his feelings when I thought we had great communication. In some ways  I wish it had gone sour first so I could at least feel like I was moving on to bigger and better things; instead, it was out of the blue a couple weeks after we had just had a romantic trip driving down the coastline in a convertible, ffs. I expected it to end because of the distance, not because of me ending the distance, and we were talking and seeing each other so much that it was still going amazingly. I had never felt more secure in the relationship.

The breakup was his unilateral decision and that hurts me. I keep feeling that if he brought it up sooner, a conversation could have saved it, or at least been able to end it in a way that wouldn't have wrecked me. It feels more like I experienced a death than a breakup sometimes. I thought I was a well-adjusted person with a career, friends, and hobbies, but it was like I lost my best friend, my past, and my future all at once. It felt like my world bottomed out for a few days even though I wanted to laugh at myself for watching movies, eating ice cream, crying at work, etc.

Things are better now in a day to day sense but I feel like there is this hopelessness about my future without him. And it hurts because I know that someone who is capable of hurting me by walking away so suddenly is not someone who deserves to be in my life, but I miss him so much.

I've analyzed over and over again how things could have gone differently, blaming myself for pushing too much. I feel like I'm coming to terms with the fact that we were at different stages of commitment and that it's not my fault, but it's still so hard. Really, really hard. I still think about him every day, and though I'm not falling apart I let myself indulge in sadness for a night every week or so. It's a different thing every time (the texts! the pictures! writing about it!) so I feel like it's letting me process it, but ideally I'd like to be thinking about him a lot less.

I didn't see anyone romantically for the first month. I fell into a relationship with a good friend (also cross-country...) which has been  loving and helpful in knowing that I can still connect with people and be happy, but since it's long distance it's missing much of what I need in a relationship. I've started casually dating but realized how punishingly high my standards are (beyond ""but it isn't him!"") and it's brought up a lot of feelings.

During the relationship, I frequently wished that we had met when we were in our late twenties and had already had time to have dating adventures because that's something that we both wanted (though I felt like he was worth it to stick with). Not because of any sense of impending doom, beyond the whole geography thing, but I knew that college relationships ending is a normal thing, and we could have been so much more than that. And now I feel like he's spoiled me for future relationships, even though I know someday I will (probably) get to a similar place of connection with other people. But to me, in my short dating life, it was the best I could imagine a relationship being-- so much mutual love and support-- and everyone I meet is... just fine. No spark.

It's also hard because I still haven't figured out what my next move is yet job-wise. Without moving to his city being the primary goal (even though it's still top 3), I'm totally floundering. I'm having a tough time coming up with a future that I could love, or even tolerate. I talk to people about moving to the desert a lot. I'm taking tests for grad school, but those are backup plans. My lease is up in June and I don't know whether or not I'll be moving to another apartment or another city or staying put. I feel unmoored without him, and it's making me realize how little I had planned beyond him before.

I'm trying to figure out a way to move on without losing all of the beautiful memories that we shared. I'm trying not to hold on to pain and anger while also not trying to idolize him, because he did wrong me. I don't want to make him into the one who got away... but that's how I feel. Conversely, it's easy to pick apart the relationship and find small things that were wrong with it-- but I also know how happy we made each other. I know also that I'm confounding my time with him with my time in college, when I was flourishing, versus now, where I work all the time and am stressed and sad.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I just wanted to share my pain and feel acknowledged. Thank you for reading. I have a decent support network here and with friends across the country, but I don't feel like I can come to them when I feel sad about it all the time. Has anyone gone through something similar? How long did it take you to ""move on""?

--

tl;dr: Fulfilling, wonderful relationship ended suddenly, and I'm having a hard time moving on."
5p8poe,2,2017-01-20,Me [21 M] still letting my ex [21 F] affect me,5evermemes,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5p8poe/me_21_m_still_letting_my_ex_21_f_affect_me/,"I call this phase in my life Learning. I had accepted an internship in a new part of the country. I once again was going feet first into the unknown. I didn’t know the area, anyone around it, or even what I would really be doing. The first day went well. I met a few people I’d be working with and they seemed nice. Me and some fellow interns were living a little far away from where we were working so we all decided we would just carpool to work. It was easy to carpool as we were all living within walking distance of each other.

It was through that that I would get to know them quite well. You tend to get to know people when you’re required to spend 40 minutes each way in a car with them. Then the weekend came. I had no idea what I was going to do. I’m usually not used to being alone and I was scared that being anti-social would push me back towards my depression. I couldn’t let this happen. I needed to stay busy and that’s just what I did. The day was a Saturday – sunny and not a cloud in the sky. I woke up early and went on a nice long bikeride along the river – some 60 miles or so. After getting back I was completely exhausted. I decided I would go hit the pool and just relax and read my book. Turns out, one of the other interns was there. We got talking and started to get to know each other some more. It was at this moment that I felt my first attraction towards her. She was so unique. I’ve never met anyone quite like this. We started to hang out more and more. It didn’t take long for us to feel like we’ve known each other for a very long time. One thing lead to another and we started what I would call dating – though she wouldn’t admit it at the time. She was just getting out of what she called a very abusive, terrible relationship. 

I found it strange from the beginning that she would still talk this guy while we were “dating”. She was scared to say that we were in fact dating based on the fact we had no idea what we would do when the internship ended since we lived 5 hours apart. This guy, her ex, would text her sweet goodnight and goodmorning texts. Every. Single. Day. This made me uncomfortable. As mentioned, I already have deep trust issues and this was not helping. She said she would deal with it and that it wasn’t an issue. I was using this as an opportunity to learn and work on my issues – and that’s what I did. I left it alone and just worked on myself and my relationship skills. 
Our time spent together was amazing. I never had any issues with our relationship – when we were together. When we were apart it was problematic. She was a terrible communicator and often ignore my calls or texts. She would obviously see them, but just then ignore them. It wasn’t like I was bothering her either, some of them were even important. Because of her ignoring me, bad communication skills, and her still talking to her abusive ex-boyfriend, I was never truly happy in the relationship. However, I would still rather be in an unhappy relationship than be alone.  As the internship came to an end and we went our separate ways, it was at that moment that she wasn’t this to be a real relationship. She couldn’t see me just go. I was so happy to hear that. I thought that this would perhaps change the nature of our communication – and again, I was wrong. 

We both went back to school. We agreed we would still see each other about once a month which was perfectly ago – but the communication had to be there. I then later found out that she’s living across the street from her ex-boyfriend. This worried me greatly. I didn’t ever think she would cheat on me or anything like that. But just the fact that he abused her and she still considered him her best friend was quite concerning. The first time I visited her it went great. It was like we fell in love at that moment. The second time was good as well. But I had to bring up my trust issues and my overall concern with her inability to communicate. I honestly just felt used and like I was the only one putting effort into the relationship. She was never good at ever explaining her feelings, but she assured me it was okay – and I bought it. 

At this point, I basically felt alone. Sure we were dating but I was just unhappy. I was once again depressed and looking for some sort of sign. I suppose I got that sign when both her and I signed offers to return to the same company the next year. I thought for sure that this would be it. We’ll make it through this school year, return to the company, and happily-ever-after. 

That’s… not quite what happened. I went and visited her again and things just didn’t seem right. She didn’t seem happy – and I sure wasn’t. I tend to wake up before her and because of this I was reading a book when she woke up. She got up and for 30 straight minutes didn’t even acknowledge my existence. She then proceeded to just leave and take her dog on an hour long walk before returning and even saying “good morning” to me. I was angry. I told her that it’s bullshit she can’t even 1) say good morning when she wakes up, 2) acknowledge my existence, and 3) invite me to go along with her (or even let me know!). This lead to an argument. And that’s all it seemed like we did at that point in time was argue. Later that day I was talking to her about the nature of our relationship and why we aren’t happy. The issues I had could easily be fixed by just working on our communication skills and being more open about her friendship with her ex-boyfriend. She didn’t want to talk about that. We got into a really big argument again and ultimately she told me it was over. I asked if it was because of her ex and she said no. I didn’t believe it. 

Our argument got so heated that she felt threatened. Apparently at some point she texted her ex to come over and basically kick me out. I was trying to be reasonable and talk to them as adults but all he would say is how I have to leave. My feelings were somewhere between “fuck you” and like I was dying inside from sadness. She said she just didn’t feel safe around me anymore and that I needed to go and we would never talk again. What happened next is something that I’m not proud of. But definitely a defining moment in my life. I was gathering my things, being civil, and about to leave when her ex reached out to grab me and forcefully make me leave (something I was already doing). I didn’t really know what he was going for, but I, out of instinct grabbed my knife and told him to back the fuck off. The look on her face is something I’ll remember forever. The look of total fear. The girl I loved could no longer look at me. It hurt more than anything I’ve ever experienced. We haven't talked since and still to this day (3 months later) I miss her and think about her. 
  
  ---   
  tl;dr Got out of a relationship that I was treated very poorly in about 3 months ago. I still dream and think about her. I still have trouble meeting new girls and going on dates with them because I'm thinking of her. She treated me poorly and I'm just having trouble moving on with my life. "

Margaret (name changed) was one of the only girls I ever truly connected with during my four years of college. She laughed at my jokes, she enjoyed my company, and I enjoyed hers. We were incredibly close, almost best friends. We'd text each other non stop, we would laugh through different bullshit classes, labs, we even got internships at the same place for our senior project so we could do it together. Whenever I was with her, I was happy. And one day, I decided that I didn't want to be her friend anymore. I wanted to be her boyfriend. This was a girl who I'd connected with on a much deeper level. It wasn't that she wasn't physically attractive, she was. The difference was that I wasn't attracted to her for that reason alone, which many will agree, is a truly special kind of attraction . I decided that I would forever regret it if I didn't tell her how I felt.


And she shot me down. Twice. After the first time I told her, things got awkward between us, but we made it through and she seemed even friendlier than before. Again, I made the mistake of jumping, and again, I fell short. She told me that her Catholic beliefs / family wouldn't let her have a relationship with a non-catholic (my family is Muslim, but I'm not particularly religious). I respected that. It tore me to shreds inside, thinking that the reason we couldn't be together was as simple as religion. She broke my heart, but I didn't feel that she had done anything wrong. She stuck to her convictions and beliefs, and if anything, it was to be respected. Shame on me, for being so selfish that I wanted her to give up her faith, just to be with me. I obviously never told her that, and was incredulous that, of all the similarities we shared, she was fixated on this one difference. 


That was two summers ago, we both graduated and lost touch. Last spring, out of the blue, she added me on Snapchat, and we started talking again. I asked if she wanted to hangout, and we agreed to meet up in the city for lunch / to walk around. The morning of, she flaked on me. She said she had to go to her parents house, but she wanted to reschedule. I said sure, let me know when you can make it.


She never got back to me.


Fast forward to today. I was going through my Facebook feed, and as I was scrolling through, her profile suddenly popped up as a potential new friend (for some reason we had never added each other). At first, I didn't want to click it. This girl had broken my heart multiple times, despite the connection we had (or maybe I imagined it). She said we couldn't be together, despite how much we liked each other, no matter the connection, because her parents would never allow it, and she herself wanted to eventually marry another Catholic.


Even though it was two years ago, part of me had never gotten over it. So I opened her profile, and was only subjected to more pain. She had just gotten married, and her wedding photos were on her profile. 


The thing is.......it wasn't a Catholic wedding to another Catholic. She hadn't even married another white guy; she had married an Indian Muslim, and they had a traditional Islamic wedding with hijabs, the mosque, everything.


I don't know what to feel. Emptiness, confusion, anger, betrayal, anger at myself, but above all else, utter sadness. This was the girl of my dreams, one that I actually wanted to be with, but she stopped it from ever going anywhere, because I was Muslim and she was Catholic. Apparently, this variable didn't matter with the other guy, but it did for me.


Part of me wishes them all the best, and wants to leave it all behind and forgotten. Yet, somehow, I can't. I know if I don't, I will only experience more pain and confusion, but I just can't. I can only write my thoughts down, and pray that slowly, time will numb the pain from my wounds, and maybe, just maybe, I'll find someone new to take my mind off of her.


TL:DR: Met a girl in college a few years ago, became best friends, said she wouldn't date me because I was Muslim and she wanted to marry another Catholic. Just found her facebook, and it turns out, she married another Muslim. "

And I want to just write down my 22 year old life and how Depression factors into my life. If that's alright with anybody still reading this. It might be a long one.
I grew up a little alright up until I turned 8 (that's as far back as I can remember this stuff happening) and started realizing things my mom did that others didn't do. It wasn't an every day thing, but she would verbally and, on rare occasions, physically abuse me. If I didn't know anything, asked for help, and she couldn't help me, she'd call me an idiot and smack my head or hands hard. At one point my dad called her out on it and she didn't do it again, but the verbal stuff would still happen.
I had always been (and still am) a sensitive person so all the negative hit me harder than it should have, but I learned to smile and keep going with my life. Throughout my Jr. high and high school time I dealt with been made fun of, accused of being gay. I got in fights but that didn't help stop any of it. I couldn't get a girlfriend, and I started losing some of my closest friends towards the tail end of high school while still dealing with verbal abuse from home. And when I found something that I absolutely knew I was good at and wanted to further understand in college, my parents and two different uncles immediately tried to shoot it down.
Through much word play, I managed to convince my parents to let me pursue theater as my college major. It was in the theater department where I found some irreplaceable people and a tight knit group of folks whom I will readily call more family than my mom. And it was in one of the very first of many late nights when my mother called me just to call me gay and continued to insult me. After that, it was like some people were out to get me, because I am damn good in theater. They wanted to bring me down so I would doubt myself at auditions, question every bit of stage and costume work I did. 
But it was also here where I found someone who could sympathize with me on a level others couldn't. A great firecracker of a girl, who didn't let others bullshit her. It was my second year of community college and I knew I was going to have to come back for a third, whereas she knew she was leaving after her second year was over. And it was in the March of the second year that I knew I had fallen head over heels. 
She left to Florida for a Disney World internship, while I stayed in the home state. I made advances that where turned away slightly. Enough to let me know that the option wasn't closed off. I turned 21 and things were going great. I had more wonderful friends in my life and I was close to having a girl (let's call her Leslie) that didn't mind my faults, could empathize because of similar experiences, found me fun to be around.
Then came the birthday of one of my friends. I got lightly buzzed. We were all playing truth or dare, and before I left to go home, I was dared to kiss any girl in the room. I pecked the birthday girl and went home. The next day, I told Leslie about it because I knew one specific guy who was mouthy as all hell and I wanted to be honest. From that moment, it was like a switch inside Leslie flipped. From a peck in a game of truth or dare, she then classified me as one of THOSE guys. Our talks became less frequent, then she would just ignore my messages. And in the 5th of January in 2016, I tried to reach out again, talking about how much it was hurting me that she didn't seem to want to resolve this issue, and that I wanted to be her. On that day, she took me to task and broke me down harder than any rejection or anybody ever could. Every message she sent that day destroyed me in many ways.
I started to isolate myself, and everybody in my life could feel the difference. I had days where I didn't do anything. Days where I cried, days where I didn't feel. In late February, my mother (who had been chilling on the verbal stuff ever since my first year in college) set me up with a therapist. I don't remember much of that day but I do remember giving him permission to tell my mom what I was dealing with. The one thing that stood out to me that day was the sentence '...depression. Keep an eye on him, don't get heavy with stuff with him for now and weekly visits so I can monitor any progress.'
My spring semester of 2016 was ruled by depression. My grades suffered, some of my friendships suffered while a few strengthened or were re-established. I visited my therapist for a few more sessions before I faked getting better so my family wouldn't have to cough up $90 every week. I didn't feel enough self-worth to make my family pay money they needed for other things. Things went on a slight downhill slope for a time until April.
My mother dragged me out with the family to a place we were invited to. Problem was that it was one of my Bad Days. I didn't do anything while there (was there against my will in the first place) and I went to go pet a cat the owners had. While I was with the cat, my mother decided to tell them about my depression WITHOUT MY CONSENT.
We went home an hour afterwards, and she tells me that she and my dad had a great time despite me being an asshole. I then pointed out that you don't just share information about my depression without consulting me. She then starts an argument with me and she slings paradoxes at me while I fire back with actual logic and point out errors in her thinking before she calls me an asshole again. That night was the first time I contemplated suicide.
Things got tame after that. She stopped dragging me places. I still had Bad Days, but they were becoming less frequent, the trade off being that I started not being able to sleep. 
Then came July. My mother has never had a soft voice, her whispers aren't even whispers. She was on the phone with my dad and she called me a disappointment. I didn't want to waste my voice so I sent her a text saying that I could hear everything she was saying. It was only when night hit that she came to my room to apologize, but by then it was too late. I had already formulated a plan for my suicide. Thankfully I haven't had need for it and it's in a trash bin several miles out of town.
Throughout all of 2016, I tried to find ways to try to lessen all the bad in my life. I tried to find some casual hobbies but my mom kept shooting them down.
Books to read? You already have so many why do you read those again?
Video games? You're already 21, you should be focusing on trying to find work or a girl to date.
Gundam model kits were fun. But I only made 6 before she deemed them toys and a waste of money.
Because of my abysmal spring 2016 semester I decided to go back to college and pay for my schooling in full as opposed to in part. In November I tried to find a job so I could pay for spring 2017 but I turned up empty-handed as usual, I'm not in any classes right now and all my searching has given me nothing.
I'm down on my luck, posting something at 1:30 AM  and in tears over how shitty this week has been."

I live in an apartment with Alexa and Tom. I've been living here for one year, Alex lives here since the beginning of college (ca 3 years). Tom lives here a little longer than Alexa (2 months or so). I met Alexa during my internship in another city. Alexa is enrolled at the same college as I am. 

I really get along with Alexa. We find time to chat or play games or go out shopping and we do understand, when someone is stressed out because of tests or whatever. Sometimes, we even eat breakfast together at 7 am. (I shared apartments with many people, but that hasn't happened before, so I guess it's a good sign) Although Alexa is kind of conservative sometimes, we really get along well. She is REALLY clean and tidy. 

Tom is not so clean and tidy. Sometimes he doesn't wash his hands after the toilet. He doesn't do the/his dishes. Since I live here I've seen him changing his bedclothes maybe once? He smokes and drinks and before starting a job he was hanging out at home 24/7. (I'm sorry to say this but: when his door is open, even just a little bit, it smells really bad) He's not able to see the dirt.


I don't mean to judge anyone, I just want you to understand the difference between those two. 


So Alexa, she goes off occasionally on him. When he hasn't done (his) dishes for a while or didn't clean properly for the third time in a row. Or when he walks through the apartment with his shoes on. 


Tom is really self-focused, he just ignores her. When he feels bad (illness, gf, idk), he comes to us and groans until we ask him about it. There is no interaction with him, because he's not really interested in us (?). For example: My birthday came and went. One month went by and we were joking in the kitchen, asking Tom when our birthdays were. He didn't know. (Mine was just a couple of weeks ago and he lives with Alexa since 3 years, but maybe it's just a ""boys thing""). 
When I was hospitalized last summer, he didn't bother that much. 
He applied at the company where I work (which is kinda ok and he can do whatever he wants). He doesn't even know, where I work and didn't bother to ask me once: Hey lucielucielucielucie, where do you actually go, when you say, you're off to work? (Same with Alexa)


Alright, that's the background. The last days were really tense between Alexa and Tom. Tom was supposed to clean the apartment (everybody has to every 3 weeks), but he didn't, although he had one week to do it. I wasn't at home, but Alexa told me she finished cleaning for him. She's really upset with him. Instead of saying  sorry, Tom just continues groaning and even started ignoring her. Recently I was with Alexa in her room and we heard him stepping outside his rooms, with shoes. He went to the bathroom. Alexa opened her door, waited till he's finished and said: ""Great, now you're going to the toilet with your shoes on!"" She stared at him, he finished dressing up and left the apartment, completely ignoring her (and me).


Look, I am a very tolerant person. If someone does something I'm not ok with, I don't say anything. I mean, if it's really bothering me I'll say something. But as long as I can live it, I'll do it. Not because I'm afraid, but because I can live with compromises I guess. 
See, Tom for example, of course he's not that clean and tidy, but I can deal with it. (Although I'm wondering if I can only live with it, because Alexa deals with him). But on the other hand, Alexa is a really tidy person, I'm not that tidy, but I can live with it because I'll just adjust. 


However, Alexa is kind of upset with me too, because she feels like she's the only one telling Tom to do this and that, etc. She wants me to say something, too. But I just can't do it? When she feels like she needs to say something, I don't. 


I just don't see them living together, but that's just the way it is right now. Their standards and values are on two completely different levels. But how can I get them to talk to each other without Alexa going off on me or Tom? And how can I get Tom to say something for once? (he's just agreeing to everything because he knows we will stop talking) And: How can I get Tom to be cleaner? I mean this isn't mine or Alexa's job to teach him! But still...
And is ok for me to be in this neutral position? Do I HAVE to say something to Tom in order to please Alexa? I have to support her right? 

Thanks so much.

I'm a 20 year old college student in my Junior year studying Computer Science. I'm looking at getting a Pomeranian in mid-August after a summer internship. This summer internship is in New York and it pays over $10k a month for 3 months. I'm working in finance, and I have an additional housing stipend and breakfast and lunch are provided so I will be able to take home more than it may initially appear. I will be coming into dog ownership with hopefully at least $15k or so saved. (I am very sorry if that whole paragraph came off as one giant brag, I just want advice on my financial situation as it pertains to dog ownership in college.)

My senior year, when I'm planning to get the dog, I will have a light course load. 12 credits a semester or less, so there will be plenty of time to spend with the dog. I would most likely quit my part-time job and spend that time with the dog. In short it's looking like my only commitments are 12 hours a week. I'm very interested in enrolling it in obedience classes too.

I have never had a dog before, but I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate who has her mom's Pomeranian for the semester. This dog will go back to her mom's house in May. I help care for the dog (help with almost everything except vet trips) and she deals well with apartment life. I would get my dog from the same breeder. This breeder is very reputable and is a Breeder with Merit and a Club Member. The dogs are between $1.5k and $3k. I would get mine spayed/neutered. 

My job prospects are looking very good for the future, I still have many companies still asking me if I'm interested in internships and I always send a polite email saying ""Unfortunately I have already accepted a position, but can I keep your contact information for when I'm looking for full-time employment in Fall."" They always say yes, so I have some very good leads. Also I can return full time to one of my previous internships, so there is a 99% chance I have a job when I graduate. I believe this puts me in a good financial position to afford dog-walkers/doggy-daycare and a pet-friendly apartment when I begin full-time employment, since I will be working 8 hours a day. 

I think my full-time employment would be a worse time to get a dog because I would have much less time to bond with a puppy and train it. I probably wouldn't be able to take off significant time for at least a year after my start date.

Here is my question, I would really like to hear your opinions:

Do you think August will be a good time for me to get a dog? If not, when?


**TL;DR I have a very light course load senior year, money saved up and excellent job prospects. I think August would be the best time to get a dog. Do you think so?**"

5pasrv,7,2017-01-21,I want to throw away my college diploma,GreatDay4Hockey,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5pasrv/i_want_to_throw_away_my_college_diploma/,"I had the extreme misfortune of graduating college in 2008. I have never really been able to have a career and struggled in two jobs since graduating (not back-to-back) so was fired from both. My last job was a good paying position in my field too, and I haven't been able to find anything better, or even comparable. I now make about $500-$600 less a month at Current Job and getting by is such a struggle some weeks. Current Job is also a call center, which are their own special circles of hell. 

I had my eye on the sports management industry a while back. People were telling me I should do an internship, but I am 31 years old, single and need health insurance. Sports internships pay even less than what I make now, which means taking one is not feasible. So I had to give up on that because virtually no sports organization even looks at hiring you full time without the magical internship. It's the same thing with communications, my original field. You have to have tons of internships and do other unpaid work to even get a shot. Of course, my other problem is I am only motivated to take opportunities for ""exposure"" and ""experience"" for so long. I...kind of like being paid a reasonable wage for my efforts.

I hate that I am stuck in such a toxic situation with no prospects for escape. I have tried volunteer work and put it on my resume where applicable to positions I apply for. It doesn't increase my callbacks like all the career advice suggests it does. If it does, I get to the interview and find out the job pays $10/hour. I cannot continue to take pay cuts to get a new job or I will never get anywhere with debt and being more comfortable. OK, I could take maybe a $1 an hour pay cut but no more than that. Despite my efforts to make connections and people saying they will help me, and despite my volunteer work, I am still a phone slave. To make it worse, I am in a company where people in other departments stay for years and are generally happy, so there is no room for advancement.

Is this really all college was good for? I know I made some mistakes in building my experience, but all my hard work really only qualifies me to work in a call center and get berated all day by both customers and colleagues alike? And to only get interviews for jobs that pay even worse? It's a slap in the face, especially when I see people who do higher level work that are laughably incompetent.

I tell my mom I want to chuck my diploma in the trash and she says don't you dare; you worked so hard for that and no one can take it from you! While she is right (and she's in her 50s and getting a degree in May), I honestly wonder why I should hold on to a possession that has harmed my life more than helped it. People who didn't even go to college, or did two years at community college, have better careers than I do! If only I had known. I would kind of like to go back to school but that only means more debt.

It's so hard to hear ""Oh don't worry; you'll get a job soon!"" or ""You'll find something!"" from people who already have nice careers. I also get jealous of people my age who have job titles like director of sales, communications specialist, marketing coordinator, etc. Hell, one of the directors of operations at my company is 26 and she was sales manager at 24! When I tell people I work at a call center, it is so embarrassing.

The diploma may be a possession but to me, it is garbage.

We're good together, communicate well (except about this, clearly), watch our bazillion favorite TV shows every week, have sex a few times a week (or have bursts of sex), she loves my friends and my friends love her, and she never complains at all about my gaming habit, despite her not gaming much. We've talked about marriage, and we both have a desire to sleep with other people and accept each others desire to do so once we're married (open marriage). 

The only point of incompatibility I see, is our lives are on very different professional levels. She works retail, and I'm in college studying computers and intern for a tech company. She plans on going back to school in the near future (few months), so I have high hopes that'll change.  

With all that said, I've found myself going through periods of unhappiness regarding the relationship. This, as far as I can tell, is triggered by what I mentioned above about our lives being at different places professionally, and also seemed to crop up when I befriended a girl (21/F) at my school about 5 months ago .

This girl (call her Jane) and I hit it off immediately as friends. We started doing school work together, texting, and signed up for classes together. We have more in common than anyone I've ever met, and I do find myself having feelings for her. It's not that she's somehow objectively better than my GF, just different, and it's a different that I like. 

2 months after meeting Jane, and feeling conflicted about my relationship, I tried to break up with my girlfriend during one of these periods of unhappiness, and only lasted 8 hours before I was on the phone apologizing and crying. We were back together the next morning.  This was about 3 months ago. 

After our very, very short-lived breakup; things were better over the holidays. I didn't see Jane in person, just texting, and my relationship went back to some degree of normalcy. Then school started back, and I starting seeing Jane again, and these same periods of unhappiness started back. 

I want to leave my relationship a lot of days, but it isn't as simple as ""I want to leave GF for Jane"". Jane isn't a replacement for my GF, and I have no expectation of anything occurring beyond friendship with her regardless of my relationship status (but wouldn't stop it if it did happen). 

I can't figure out if it's simply GIGS that is motivating my thoughts, or if there's a deeper rooted issue that I need to confront or resolve. Halp.

1. He is caught sleeping with some young White House intern, declares that his personal life is his own business, and that, despite adultery laws, he will keep doing it.  Perhaps announces his divorce from Melania, and starts acquiring a new girlfriend almost every week.

2. Tries to push Great Britain to agree to some international foolishness, they refuse, he recalls the US ambassador and threatens war: ""you're either with the US or against it"".

3. Some underling sneaks some details into an executive order that Trump signs, e.g. outlawing abortion nationally as part of a clause in a health insurance interstate regulatory relaxation.  And then, of course, Trump claims he signed it intentionally and that it's law now.

4. Trump gets in a conflict with congress over the pace of some extreme proposal like the border wall, then tweets that there's nothing stopping him from removing Senators with executive orders.

5. It is revealed that Trump does not actually have the nuclear codes -- that he did not pass the Pentagon's top-secret background checks, and will not until he undergoes psychiatric evaluation, which he refuses to do.

6. California governor Jerry Brown denounces Trump's immigration policies, and Trump tries to order him removed as governor.

7. Issues an executive order based on a conspiracy theory, like ""vaccinations of children are hereby suspended in the US until someone can prove they don't cause autism"".

8. Declares that, with his initial wave of executive orders issued, and waiting for Congress to pass complex laws, that being President is not really a full-time job, that he's going to be working 50/50 on the Trump Organization again.

9. He tries his ""Arts of the Deal"" with China, saying that the US will establish a base in the South China sea unless China closes theirs, and actually puts marines onto some island.  China responds that, unless the US leaves, that a state of war will exist in 72 hours.  That should be enough time for impeachment.

What are some of the possibilities I've missed?"

# Extended Summary:

**Anna Mani Is One of India's Greatest Woman Scientists. Yet You Probably Haven't Heard Her Story**.

Anna Mani Is One of Indias Greatest Woman Scientists.

Born in 1918, she was the seventh of eight siblings..

Anna Manis father was a prosperous civil engineer who ownedlarge cardamom estatesin the region.

But little Anna Mani would have none of it.

On her eighth birthday, when she was gifted with diamond earrings- as was the custom in her family- she opted instead for a set ofEncyclopaedia Britannica.

It was during this time that Mahatma Gandhi came to Viakom to lend his support to the civil disobedience movement.

Her strong sense of nationalism also instilled in her a fierce desire for personal freedom.

Mani wanted to study medicine but when that was not possible, she decided in favor of physics because she happened to be good in the subject.

She was accepted in no less than Nobel laureateC V Ramans laboratory as a graduate student and worked on the spectroscopy of diamonds and rubies.

The experiments were long and painstaking, sometimes requiring15 to 20hours.

In August 1945 she submitted her PhD dissertation to Madras University and was awarded a government scholarship for an internship in England.

They chose to overlook that Anna Mani had graduated with honours in physics and chemistry, and had won a scholarship for graduate studies at the Indian Institute of Science on the basis of her undergraduate degree.

Fortunately, the lack of a PhD never deterred her.

WhenMani returned to independent India in 1948, she joined the Indian Meteorological Department at Pune.

Find a better way to do it! was her motto.

During the International Geophysical Year (1957-58), she set up a network of stations in India to measure solar radiation.

This enabled India to collect reliable data on the ozone layer.

In 1976, Anna Maniretired as deputy director general of the Indian Meteorological Department and subsequently returned to the Raman Research Institute as a visiting professor for three years.

A visionary, Anna Mani knew/foresaw that alternative sources of energy would have a big role to play in Indias future development.

She hoped that the instruments produced in her workshopwould help in development ofwind and solar energy in India.

However, she would recall how even a slight error made by her or other women scientist in handling instrumentation or in setting up an experiment would be immediately broadcast by some men as a sign of female incompetence.

Devoted to her studies and research, Mani never married.

In 1994, she suffered from a stroke that left her immobilised for the rest of her life.

Even in 1930, when Mani went to college, opportunities for women to pursue further studies or a career in science were very limited.

5pcj64,64,2017-01-21,"Of Adventurers, Adventures, And Their Relation, Responsibility, and Requirements: Contractual Obligations and Terms To Ensure The Efficant Transcooperation Of Associates, Employees, Contractors, and Specialists Intwixterteen And Therein Of and With The Company",Applejaxc,DnDBehindTheScreen,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/5pcj64/of_adventurers_adventures_and_their_relation/,"#OAAATRRARCOATTETETOAECASIATOAWTC

In my Scourged Aerth campaign, the party was hired for their first adventure by a down-on-his-luck businessman named Fiss. Fiss saw great potential in the untapped adventurers-for-hire market but lacked any adventuring skills of his own. The party did not have the necessary prestige or resources to, as individuals, bargain for fair wages-not that they faced that problem, as it was impossible to legally find work *at all* with the city law being so restrictive regarding the procurement of mercenary services.

This is partly world building/lore and this is partly ""Hey, this is a good alternative to the 'you meet in a tavern' that can take place in an oppressive fantasyscape that provides you with a recurring quest giver, expositor, and provides the party with a sense of identity and uniformity, as well as a believable way to replace lost party members and invest resources.""

###The OAAATRRARCOATTETETOAECASIATOAWTC 

was a contract each party member was asked to sign before Fiss would divulge adventure details, and even before that they were forced to signed Nondisclosure Agreements, which barred mention of Fiss's budding company (Acquisitions, Limited) and instructed the party to answer potential questions about him, the organization, the terms of their meeting, or the terms of their employment in specially prepared statements to avoid any incrimination. Fiss wasn't hiring them to do anything *vile*, of course, but the local constabulary was *very* opposed to letting ""mercenaries"" operate within city limits. In the case the party didn't trust him, each document was made in duplicate (so the party member and Fiss had a copy), and notarized by a member of the church of justice and law (replace with equivalent LG god of your setting). So the party knew it was relatively on the up-and-up, and if Fiss double-crossed anyone he'd get cudgeled by some vengeful lawyers.

The terms of the contract were pretty extensive, full of flowery language and subclauses and nonsense. Fiss is a legal expert and artful bamboozler. Fortunately for the party it is only his intention to con-fuddle *enemies* of the company, and his mumbojumbo is so effective it's granted advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and (Deception) checks *many* times just by a party member pulling out a 6-page document when questioned by the city watch. Who has time (or the Int score) to read the fine print?

It basically boils down to fairly simple terms, however

+ All contracts, services, and consultings arraigned by the company automatically reserves 10% of the agreed payment to be retained by the company itself
+ All subcontractors, consultants, temporary hires, interns, and other auxiliary personnel required by employees to complete an acquisition is negotiated for and paid for by the employees, out of their own reward, not the company
+ 10% of all ""extraneous acquisitions"" (loot) obtained in the course of fulfilling an acquisition is to be turned into the company at the completion of the acquisition
+ The first 50gp of equipment and service procurement required for the completion of an acquisition is reimbursed by the company (enough for 1 *potion of healing* or some tools)
+ The first 100gp of ""legal fees"" incurred in the direct pursuit of an acquisition are reimbursed per employee by the company (includes bribes, forging of documents, and other services, although the company-provided clandestine services are lower quality than what the party could pay for elsewhere and takes longer)
+ Company property is open access to employees, who are not required by pay for food or lodging (""up to the extent that is reasonable, to be examined and renegotiated as necessary"")
+ The company disowns any knowledge of, relation to, or obligation towards any subcontractor, consultant, service provider, or other personnel employed by employees without the express approval and rigorous hiring procedure conducted by the company (the party can hire as many thugs and criminals as they want, they just can't expect Fiss to bail them or their temp hires out of trouble)
+ Employees may not divulge the nature of their contracts, consultingships, projects, or other actions therein, by, to, and/or of the company except within the company and the company's auxiliary personnel and are expected to remain the most respectable standards of discretion (because *my* campaign takes place in a Lawful Evil society, this is an effective method of refusing to testify on the grounds that it will ""constitute a breech of my contractual obligations"")
+ Rewards for services, contracts, and consultings, and ""extraneous acquisitions"" are split equally between all employees involved therein, after the necessary amount has been deducted to fulfill company obligations

###In Practice

The party is giving up 10% of the reward money for anything they do, and they're on the honor system about surrendering 10% of their loot, too. That kind of sucks.

But in exchange they're given at least one place to lay low, train, rest, plan, and gather information in the company's HQ. In Scourged Aerth the HQ was an abandoned mansion haunted by the lovable ghost of the daughter of the estate's former owner, filled with all kind of strange and bizarre things. In your campaign it could be a ratty hovel or a glorious skyship. */shrug*

Fiss is also a man of his word, and very genuinely wants the best for his company and its employees. Of course what he thinks is best and what may actually be best are often divergent, and he seems to hold adventurers in near-mythic status, often overselling their abilities to garner business, arranging contracts *way* above the party's level.

It also provides a good basis for the party's continued cooperation, acquisition of new contracts, and a tongue-in-cheek means of getting around silly laws. Because they're ""Acquisition Specialists"" or ""Consultants"" or other nonsense terminology, they avoid being called ""mercenaries"" or ""criminals."" Fiss tries as hard as he can to maintain a false image of the company as a totally legal resource for helping distraught citizens acquire rare things and services, like locating healers and wizards and lost family heirlooms. In reality, especially as the company grows, the majority of ""acquisitions"" are more typical adventures: Clearing dungeons, killing bad hombres, etc.

It's also very easy to control WBL (in theory): You can promise the party huge rewards for a contract (so their adventures feel worthwhile), then immediately skim 10%, then give another % to other consultants who were necessary in fulfilling the contract (hired by the party or used by Fiss to acquire things like maps, skeleton keys, and equipment), and otherwise use the legal terms to constrain the party's actual reward. You can't do the same with loot, as most parties will probably lie about how much they did or didn't obtain.

Finally, it's great for RP. Fiss doesn't really serve as a boss to the party so much as a liaison; he's *important* to their continued prosperity relevant to the company, but they're free agents able to turn down assignments or pursue ""non-sanctioned acquisitions"" (work for someone else), although Fiss will have his feelings hurt. As the company grows in prominence, it will also grow in notoriety, and every big shot in town will have some scheme to take advantage of it. Villains may mistake the company as the front for a regular mercenary troop, and will try to hire the party to do some evil. Imagine the local mid-level politician (of squeaky clean reputation) takes the party aside, and is all ""Alright, let's drop the pretenses: I'm a bad guy, you're bad guys, let's get this coup planning started,"" only (to his surprise) to be killed (unless your party is the kind of opportunistic neutrality to immediately swear fealty...).

In Scourged Aerth, people have attempted dozens of times to take advantage of the company. Corrupt members of the city watch tried to blame a rash of fires and deaths on the party/the company in a bid to extort them to force them to go on a particular adventure. More than one member of the city council tried to get the party to move against another council member. Other adventuring companies even attempted mergers, buy-outs, and hostile takeovers! And in all of it (to my surprise and pleasure), the party's emotional (and financial) investment in the company made their arguments, negotiations, and desperate plans to keep the company afloat were some of the best experiences I've had as a DM and they've had as players.

Also, your party's favorite NPCs, redeemed villains, rescued damsels, and other characters can come work for the company or drum up repeat business, so you have a reasonable excuse to recycle a fun character.

Finally, the growth of the company gives the party a lot of clout and resources that would be difficult to obtain individually. NPC cohorts and laborers are willing to work cheaper for a company with a big reputation and long-term employment; rich snobs that fear they'll one day need reliable services are more likely to respect the party and invite them to galas and crap to garner their favor; and big-time villains are a lot more likely to actually know the party by name, deed, and tactics.

The company provides a good way to introduce new characters, too: If you have a new player, or a character dies, it's very easy to explain that so-and-so is the ""new hire."" As the company grows, it's possible there's a whole other adventuring party, or two, or three, or more suitable for oneshots or just running into at unexpected times. What happens when the party tries as hard as they can to be good, but they're fellow employees totally bungle and adventure and screw up massively? Do they let their compatriots rot in prison, or do they risk damaging the company's reputation (legally) even *more* by busting them out (improving its reputation socially and improving morale).

###Two Main Uses

In Scourged Aerth, Aq LTD exists as a creative means of operating around obtuse laws in a Lawful Evil society. Your campaign may take place in a more Venture Bros-esque world, wherein adventuring parties are so alarmingly common (and neglectfully destructive) that such companies *have* to exist to maintain the peace, and even above the company there's overarching rules that govern policies and practices to prevent a return to adventuring dark ages, wherein Heroes and BBEGs nearly destroy the multiverse once a week?


###Room for improvement

After this whole business with joining the Air Force on the 31st and learning how to disable bombs and stop crying during PT and stuff, I plan to return to Aerth in full force and revamp all 5 campaign settings (Aerth, Aerth: AD, Scourged Aerth, Sun on the Deadwight, Aerth 2099) with everything new I've learned over the last 6 months of /r/lfg and /r/DnDBehindTheScreen + Volo's Guide.

Does anyone already have a similar situation in their own campaign notes, and/or any suggestions on what other rules, stipulations, and subclauses to add to the contract? Particular adventure ideas that would be unique to this kind of campaign, that wouldn't work with random, travelling adventurers?"

My question is this: Has anyone near my situation just decided to pack up and go move somewhere for a summer (3-4 months) solo or with a few friends? It seems like an awesome opportunity to work a shitty job and just see what life is like in another place. It's a big world out there and I want to see as much of it as I can. While it most definitely won't be all glamour, I feel as if it is a positive experience to have (Last summer I worked in a local factory/warehouse). 

-Where did you go?
-Is staying in the US the best idea?
Our money would travel furthest in a place like Nepal, but is that very realistic?
-What kind of money did you have going there?
We all have about $1500 saved at the moment, how far would this take us wherever you went/live?
-How did you find a job?
Our current plan is to just beg
-Where did you live (apartment/trailer park/the streets)?
-What did you learn?
-What would you say to someone who wants to do the same thing?

5pdh7r,1,2017-01-21,50k in debt with 3 years left to go in school. Am I utterly screwed?,theSuppleLemur,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5pdh7r/50k_in_debt_with_3_years_left_to_go_in_school_am/,"Hey guys, so I'll give you a little background first. 

I was in school for 2.5 years as a biochemistry major and essentially lived off debt to pay for school, and have racked up around 50k in debt thus far (8k of that coming from a study abroad/unpaid internship in China last summer). Around 23k of that figure are parent plus loans, but my parents aren't in a position financially to afford paying that, so I fully intend on taking it on myself. 

Long story short, but after being dissatisfied with biochemistry as a major and its career choices, and starting to fall in love with teaching myself how to program, I decided to change my major to computer science. Not only am I finally doing something I enjoy, but the career prospects are much more pleasing for having simply a Bachelor's. 

This brings me to today. I moved back home so I could transfer to a nearby school while still living at home, essentially cutting my costs in half. Tuition is ~10k a year at where I will be finishing school. Assuming I didn't receive a penny in grants or scholarships (both of which I while be heavily applying for), I would graduate with 80k in debt. That is the worst case scenario. I assume the more accurate figure is going to be closer to 70k, perhaps even less if I do well enough and gain enough scholarships. Just maybe, if I play my cards right and do well enough as well as find a great job on the side, I could potentially keep that figure down to 65k. However, I'm going to overestimate here and stick with 70-75k of debt at graduation.

Taking advantage of my school's resources (something I did not do in my first few years at university), gaining internships and relevant work experience, I believe I can easily land a 60-70k job starting out of school. In other words, my starting salary will likely be as much as the amount of debt I owe, perhaps a few thousand more, perhaps a few thousand less. Not guaranteed, but I believe the odds are in favor of me if I truly bust my ass for the remainder of school. 

I realize I'm in quite the hole here. In my current state, I'm left with 50k of debt and nothing to show for. However, following through on my plan, I may add on another 15-20k to that number as well as a few years of school, but I significantly increase my earnings as well. I just can't help but look at these numbers and feel sick with regret I didn't take this plan of action in the first place (that being living at home/going to a cc, before transferring to a university to save thousands of dollars). At the same time, while it took a lot of money to do so, I've learned an enormously important lesson and am confident I can make the rest of school worth my investment. 

Maybe this post was just a way for me to get out what's been plaguing my mind for so long (I don't have many people to talk to about this), but what do you guys think. I'm not completely screwed, am I? Any advice that could help this guy along the way? "

Also, how much might I have to pay back in taxes because nothing was taken out for my contracting job?

With Lucky's 777 price and the recent bump in shard costs, a lot of people haven't been able to get the sweet doggo as have wanted. And since I recently restarted my internship, I figured that I can at least bring one more sweet pup to a campus in need. So, giveaway!

I need help.",wildwest7,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5peo7w/25yo_with_a_masters_degree_70k_in_student_loans/,"**TLDR: 25, unemployed with a masters degree and 70k in student loan debt. My options are: (1) keep working part-time and applying as I have been doing. (2) Sell what little I have and move to D.C. to better my job chances. Or (3) Bite the bullet and give up my dreams and take a low paying full-time job locally that is not in my field in order to form some semblance of responsibility and a life but make paying off debt hard or impossible.**

Hello r/PF. I've been lurking for a little while, but not long enough, so now I'm asking.  As the title says, I received my Master of International Development in May of 2016 and have yet to find a job.  I have been applying intensely at times and not-so-intensely at other times due to part-time jobs and life in general. All together I've probably sent 75-100 applications out to various non-profits, NGOs, and government contractors mainly in the D.C. and NYC area, which is where I want to end up but not where I currently live.  I've been working various part-time jobs since graduation. I moved back in with my parents due to lack of money a few months ago and currently make $9/hr.  I have about $1500 saved up so far. I think my problem can be broken into two parts: getting a job and then forming a finance plan for the student loan debt.

**First the Job:**
This is where I truly need help. I broke one of the biggest rules and went to grad school a year after finishing undergrad for no other reason than I did't make any effort to find an actual job. I hold two BA degrees in Political Science and History from undergrad but never had a plan after graduation. I was always interested in the world and traveling so I decided to get a masters in international relations which turned into international development.  I learned a lot in grad school and met a lot of great people, but I think I have two major downfalls. For one, the school did not require a foreign language or offer courses to learn one. I don't have a foreign language ability and I believe this is truly holding me back in the competitive environment. And two, I don't have any work experience besides a plethora of part-time jobs. I'm the part-time job king.  I did, however, spend two months interning in India while in grad school as well a leadership position in the school's student government. This, plus a previous internship at a non-profit after undergrad are the only other professional experiences that I have.  I feel like I am competing against others with tons more experience and language ability. 
As mentioned before, I've been applying to jobs for months.  I apply to almost all jobs that I am even remotely qualified for including many jobs that only require bachelors degrees such as administrative roles. I have had multiple phone/skype interviews but have only interviewed in person twice: one in D.C. in July and it was down to me and another and I did not get the offer even though it was an just an administrative position; two was two weeks ago in D.C. for a great opportunity but I have not heard back yet, even though they said they would let me know by last week. I am at my wits and I do not know how to proceed. I can keep working part-time and applying as I've done for the past few months unsuccessfully, or I can save for a few months and just move to D.C. to increase my chances at getting a job.  I'm also considering getting a local-full time opportunity way below my qualifications and income need, which would inhibit my ability to apply as much as I need and interview as often. And these options leave out my second biggest restriction, student load debt.

**The Debt:**
I have around $70k in student loan debt. About $30k of which was from undergrad and $40k from grad school. Every time I think of this debt I get sick to my stomach. My parents never gave me guidance on money growing up and acted like ""I can do anything I wanted,"" and ""money was not an issue,"" and ""everyone has student debt."" I was admittedly stupid and naive and, at this point, If I could go back and never go to grad school I would. But at this point I have to deal.  It feels like this massive weight just hanging on my shoulders and lurking behind me at all times and I can't get away.  I don't know what to do besides get a job with my masters degree but I am having no luck in that field. My loans are currently deferred but I need to start paying them off soon. I am crippled from this debt and it is inhibiting my ability to just get up and go and move to DC or New York to better my chances of finding a job or traveling abroad and looking or anything like that.  In my mind, getting a well-paying job is my only option because there is no other way for me to pay off this debt.  I'm afraid and discouraged and I am totally lost.

5peq7w,7,2017-01-21,Implementing a interning table?,I_shill_comrade-jim,rust,https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5peq7w/implementing_a_interning_table/,"I wish to make a Key-value data structure with an `intern` method similar to a symbol table. In this case a PathBuf, if the PathBuf is not already in the table it adds it to the able and assigns it a unique ID and returns the new ID, if the PathBuf is in the table it just returns the ID.

The problem is obviously that you run into the borrow checker, you need to first immutably borrow the table to see if it's already in there but then in the same scope also mutably borrow the table to add the new element if it's not which violates the rules. Is there any way to solve this problem?

I know HashMaps do exactly this but I'm not as much interested in a practical solution as I am in an understanding of how one would go about solving this classical problem in a language with the constraint of no further borrows after a mutable one:

for reference, a sketch (not actual code)

    fn intern ( &amp;mut self, symbol : Symbol ) -&gt; usize {
      if let Some(id) = self.look_up(symbol) { // immutable borrow occurs here
        id
      } else {
        self.add(symbol) // mutable borrow occurs here
      }
    }

5pewmg,3,2017-01-21,My Nmother-in-law [rant],unechartreusesvp,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5pewmg/my_nmotherinlaw_rant/,"I discovered this sub some time ago,  and there are so many things that ring a bell about my NMiL,  I know my husband will really laugh a lot and tell me ""that's my mom"" with so many of your situations here.

We are dealing with the recent loss of his father and although we understand the grief of his Nmother, sadly it is getting really difficult to all her family to deal with Nmil. 

One of the first times I saw her,  we told her that a neighbor was in the hospital with a cancer... And her answer to that was ""oh,  I know,  my ankles are so sore,  it's evena little bit difficult to get up in the morning... ""

So,  everytime you say something it's like she didn't quite hear you,  and she always turns it to herself.  But there are so many occasions where it's mean,  or she let's you know that she know better than anyone.

But back to the difficult situation today,  all the family is trying to help her to cope with her loss,  and we all love her,  but her attitude is sometimes so difficult that has all the family in a state of not knowing what to do. 

The doctor told us today that because of her character, and how she behaves with all of us, that it is better to intern her to a nursing home. Or else all of the family will be sick. 

I'll try to explain better to you the situation,  but yesterday I was with my husband to sleep the night look at her. And I really couldn't take it anymore at one moment how she is mean with my husband.  

The doctor complimented her at the 60 years of marriage. 
Then she asked about a granddaughter that is on her 6th year of marriage and NMom complimented her,  and when they asked about the first marriage of my husband, Nmom promptly answered that it was nothing and useless...  Well, my husband's ex was special too, but 15years of marriage and two beautiful children are something...  But well.
And there are photos of everyone, but my husband.  

well sorry of its confused...  My English its not perfect, but well I had to speak tonight..."

5pft7r,5,2017-01-22,"I'm at a crossroads about my father (sorry, long)",UrbanCowgirl79,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5pft7r/im_at_a_crossroads_about_my_father_sorry_long/,"Background: I don't think my father is an N. He divorced my N, sociopathic mother when I was 5, leaving her the house and over $200K USD, in 1984. He quickly remarried and moved to another state. He called GC brother and me briefly once per week and we had 6 weeks annual visitation time. Nmother had full custody. She trash talked him and my stepmother, claimed he didn't pay child support and didn't want to take care of us. We weren't allowed to call him or write letters, we didn't know the phone number or address. Visitation was stressful because we kids had to fly alone. I guess the change in routine was hard although life was better on visitation. He and Stepmother never hit me. He'd actually play with me in the pool. We got decent food there and they bought us nice clothes (only summer clothes, climate was different from where Nmom lived). They let us out of the house and took us to movies, restaurants, theme parks and the beach. All things we didn't have and weren't allowed to do at home with Nmom, who was well off but super cheap with us kids. They weren't parents in an emotional way, they were more like nice babysitters. They treated us the same, there was no GC or SG/Lost Child while on visitation. GC brother and I actually got along, unlike at home. But he had no involvement in our lives, all decisions were made by NM. I think he was clueless and willfully stayed that way. 

M father was never around. Nmom got all the holidays in the divorce. He was never around for my birthday. Never attended a graduation. I couldn't talk to him about things, especially with Nmom always listening in. By age 13 I guess the stress of NM's abuse and the visitation got to me. I said I didn't want to do visitation anymore or talk on the phone. Nmom, Dad, Nuncle, and WTF-Grandma were *fine* with that. Nobody attempted to ask me what was wrong, how did I feel, or what could they do to help. Like they didn't understand that I was just a kid and they were the adults here. By 17 I wanted contact again but was afraid of my father being angry and I had no idea *how* to contact him. He sent *me* a letter, that wasn't angry or mean, but read like it was from a teacher or distant relative, not a parent. 

We found a way for me to see him in Nmom and WTF-Grandma's town. He'd moved to yet another state by now. I get in the car and he and my stepmother said, ""guess what! we had a baby!"" I said, ""oh wow! congratulations!"" They asked if I wanted a piece of leftover christening cake from the event I obviously was not invited to. If there was a baby shower I wasn't invited to that either.

We resumed the short calls. I went to college mostly on grants/scholarships and lived in a dorm on an isolated campus, depressed, lonely, and miserable. I had no ID because NM hid it and only the little money I earned at my minimum wage job. Years later I found out my father had tuition money for me that he gave to NM, but she kept it and forged my signature on student loan documents instead. I had to repay the $15K in loans. My parents gave no financial support, emotional support, or guidance in college. They both told me they'd disown me if I dropped out or tried to transfer anywhere less prestigious. He pushed me to take a horrible internship where I was crying in the bathroom at age 20. I knew the job was a bad idea and ignored my intuition. I quit, went back to my minimum wage job, and he screamed that I was a ""a worthless loser who'd never amount to anything or marry an investment banker now"" and went NC with me for about 6 months. I never saw my father's house in State 2 and he lived there a decade. I was never invited. 

My stepmother became seriously ill and half brother was small. I figured that's why I didn't hear much from my father during college or the 3 years after I was stuck isolated, dependent, and wishing to die, with Nmom. I don't know if that's normal, a parent has a sick partner and small child so they don't engage with the older kids? He had totally checked out of GC brother's life as a kid too. GC had substance abuse and psychiatric problems starting as a teen, then OD'd and died. I moved out of NM's at 24. When my stepmother passed away my father moved to State 3. Maybe once a year I was invited for the afternoon. I wished I could see more of my half brother.

I was 24 when I moved out of NM's and could live a normal life. That was 2003. I met a guy, we got married in 2009, a bunch of good stuff happened. My father came to the wedding and was nice but wasn't more involved than that. A year later he got married again, to a woman with 2 daughters, one teenager at the time and one in her 20's. He was a lot more involved with my half brother's life, like a real parent, and with my younger stepsister. He started inviting my husband and me to his home 2-3x/year. We live only 2 hours drive away. I think his new wife noticed the lack of relationship and he didn't want to look bad in front of her. I recently found out he has family in a European country where he'd taken Half Brother multiple times to visit and get to know them and the culture(!) But never me apparently. I don't even know the people's names. Or about that culture.

Since discovering narcissism I've tried to talk to him about the abuse my brother and I endured from NM. I asked about what happened during those years. Like with all that money he &amp; NM had, why I was I scavenging trash food, wearing NM's old clothes, in an unheated house, and barely allowed to leave the house? His answers are usually ""I don't remember"", ""I don't know"", or ""I don't want to talk about this"". He says he paid the child support, not that I was upset when I thought he didn't. I don't want to be an asshole about it, but he's the only link I have to the answers. He never seemed sorry about any of this. He calls me maybe once per month and mainly talks about himself and his new family. I talk to my half brother all the time anyway, he's an adult now and a great guy.

I hoped that someday my father would want to get to know me and have a real parent-child relationship but it seems he doesn't. He's cordial to me when I see him but that's like 2-3x/year tops, in a group of people. I feel I have no more hope, I should let go. I don't know if that means NC or just keep the VLC. I didn't even want the VLC, I wanted more contact. My father has been VLC *with me* since I was a kid, and I'm 37 now. I apologized to him as an adult for not wanting to visit him when I was 13-17. Should I have apologized? I don't think I've been a ""Bad daughter"". I never asked for money, or for him to travel to a graduation, or for gifts, or *anything*. I have meaningful relationships and emotional support, my husband and a few good friends, and I try to focus on them.

He was raised by WTF-Grandma and has 2 Nbrothers. I don't think he's an N, just a lot of FLEAS? N's find each other and raise other N's, that's how so many relatives are N's. The only ""family"" who ever wanted a real relationship with me has been my half brother.

____________________________________________________________

**Q: How exactly do I subscribe?**

**A:** [**Click here!**](http://cowchop.roosterteeth.com/first?utm_source=youtube.com&amp;utm_campaign=Cow%20Chop%20FIRST%20Referral%20Campaign&amp;utm_medium=referral)

**Q: What are the unlockable tiers for signing up for Rooster Teeth FIRST?**

**A:** You can find the unlockable tiers [**here**](https://twitter.com/cowchop/status/820707314114166784). Also, not many people have noticed it, but for 2000 sign-ups (Gold), a golden variant of squiggly cup will be available for purchase, but only for FIRST members.
 
**Q: I'm already a FIRST member, should I cancel it and sign up with Cow Chop code?**

**A:** For now, only the new signups count, however extending current existing accounts with the referral code works and gives Cow Chop credit.

**Q: Shoot, can I support somehow else?**

**A:** Cow Chop appreciates you all in anyway you choose to support them, be it subscribing to FIRST, watching their videos or buying merch.
 
**Q: Is there a deadline?**

**A:** The lease for the house is up April 1st, Cow Chop is looking at a mid-March move. Therefor, deadline ends **mid-March**.

**Q: Is there a counter somewhere that shows what tier we are at?**

**A:** No, but Cow Chop promises to update us regarding tiers on Behind The Scenes and Twitter. We are getting closer to platinum, though.

**Q: So to clarify, there will be content on FIRST that we won't be able to watch on YouTube?**

**A:** Three shows will be exclusively FIRST shows to help it make worth for FIRST subscribers. They won't affect current regular content as all three shows will most likely be recorded in Austin and produced by Rooster Teeth. Podcasts will be uploaded to FIRST first (heh, heh), and later onto YouTube.

**Q: Wait, so why exactly did they decide to go for RT FIRST and why not Patreon or something else?**

**A:** ""We considered a Patreon, but RT offered this as a choice and we thought it would at least lead us to doing some stuff people had asked for previously (like podcasts) and would help people spend on money on something that actually has something cool for them in the future.""

5pgl9m,7,2017-01-22,"How many applicants do job vacancies in journalism, publishing and television receive? Here are some very specific numbers for you.",BeeDeeArgh,mediargh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mediargh/comments/5pgl9m/how_many_applicants_do_job_vacancies_in/,"Let's cut straight to the numbers:

***

**PAID EDITORIAL ASSISTANT INTERNSHIP @ BBC MATCH OF THE DAY MAGAZINE (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 600 

This job listing was only advertised on the Mediargh website for a grand total of three days (Friday, Saturday and Sunday) before the publisher's HR Manager hastily removed the listing very early on Monday morning. The original intent was to have the listing remain on the website for two weeks but the vacancy received 200 applications per day. In my own experience, this is definitely on the most extreme end of things.

***

**PAID INTERNSHIPS @ PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 150 - 400

Countless intern opportunities have cropped up at Penguin Random House over the years, with applicant numbers generally fluctuating between 150 - 400 for each internship position. Summer internships are especially popular. 

***

**OFFICE / EDITORIAL ADMINISTRATOR @ VICE (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 200

My beloved VICE was very recently looking for an Office Administrator / Receptionist. Roughly 200 people applied for that particular vacancy with the job advert having been live on the website for one week. 

***

**ONLINE ASSISTANT VACANCY @ CRAFT SCOTLAND (EDINBURGH)**

**Applicants:** 119

119 people applied for an Edinburgh-based Online Assistant job with a popular local arts and crafts charity. The charity felt that this was an 'overwhelming' number, and nearly double the amount who had applied for the same position two years prior. The job advert was live on the Mediargh jobs board for one month, giving plenty of time for lots of people to apply. 

***

**REPORTER VACANCY @ STRANRAER FREE PRESS (STRANRAER)**

**Applicants:** 0

Yeah... it happens sometimes. Editor was frustrated. 

***

**EDITORIAL ASSISTANT VACANCY @ FISH FARMER MAGAZINE (YORK)**

**Applicants:** 8

I understand that fish farming is a niche interest, but I was a little surprised and dismayed when the magazine's Editor informed me of the underwhelming response he had received. Luckily, the eight candidates were very strong and that's really all that matters. It's always good to hit the sweet spot between candidate quantity and quality. 

***

**PAID INTERNSHIPS IN MEDIA, ARTS &amp; CULTURE @ SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT / SCVO (SCOTLAND)**

**Applicants:** 160
 
As part of a Government initiative, a collection of 20 paid internships in the arts sector were available throughout Scotland in Summer 2013, attracting 3,200 applicants (roughly 160 applicants per internship).   

***

**VIDEO JOURNALIST VACANCY @ SHAZAM (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 100
 
'Just over' 100 applicants was what they told me, actually. Advert was live for five days and came down nine days earlier than the advertised deadline date.

***

**JOURNALISM VACANCIES @ TRINITY MIRROR (UK-WIDE)**

**Applicants:** 30 - 200 per vacancy

The Trinity Mirror were recruiting for nearly 100 different roles over the Christmas 2015 period, at all experience levels and in various locations including Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool, Cardiff and Glasgow. No specifics were given, but they received anywhere between 30 and 200 applicants for any given role. 

***

**RUNNER VACANCY @ SHINE GROUP (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 200

Advert was live for five working days.

***

**RUNNER VACANCY @ CHANNEL 5 (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 800

This vacancy was left open for the entire duration of the Christmas and New Year holiday period. 

***

**PAID INTERNSHIP @ WORKING TITLE FILMS (LONDON)**

**Applicants:** 2,600

The application window was three months, which is a ridiculously lengthy duration. They could easily get 100 solid candidates applying within a single working week, so why wait three months? 

*** 

Of course, not every employer reveals exactly how many applicants they receive (I do not ask them to provide me with this information), but I'm always willing to take an educated guess. Television Runner vacancies are often filled at lightning speed. Last month, London-based root6 emailed me, asking me to post a short-term Runner listing for them. Then, in the amount of time it took me to go and boil a kettle, they had emailed me again, asking me if I could remove the listing because they had received the desired number of promising applicants and were now formulating a shortlist.  
 
I am inclined to believe that many of the more well-known and recurring internship and trainee schemes out there (BBC, ITV, Microsoft etc.) will attract thousands of applicants each year, although I don't have access to any official numbers for those.
 
Of course, there are lots of variables at play and we have to take all of them into consideration when answering a question such as this. Namely:
 
**1.** Location. Jobs in London are more eagerly sought than jobs in rural Yorkshire.
 
**2.** Brand recognition. Most people want to work at the BBC, Channel 4 etc.
 
**3.** Entry-level roles and internships are going to attract far more applicants (hundreds) than the more senior, specialised roles out there.
 
**4.** How well written is the job description and how thorough is it? If the employer is too vague in what they are looking for then they are only encouraging unnecessary applicants, which is a waste of time for all involved. 
 
**5.** Salary. Additional allowances. Perks. Bonuses. And so on.

In terms of giving an average, blanket number, it has been stated elsewhere that any given graduate and/or entry-level job will receive anywhere between 100 - 160 applicants. As we now know, this 'average' number means very little. 
 
Ultimately, very little of what is written here will come as a surprise to many of you. As I've said before, jobs and internships with big brands in central locations get lots of applicants (into the hundreds and occasionally thousands), while smaller companies who are located in more rural areas will struggle to attract as many candidates as they would perhaps anticipate. 
 
**Where the above information came from:**
 
I deal with anywhere between ten and thirty individuals each day who are looking to post a job advert onto the [Mediargh website](http://www.mediargh.com/jobs), with nearly 7,000 jobs being listed in the past year alone. I've struck up a good working relationship with many people (primarily those who work in HR) from a diverse range of brands including IMG, NBC Universal, Endemol, VICE, STV, Greenpeace, Viacom, the Liberal Democrats, Mumsnet, Incisive Media, and so many more, including smaller regional newspaper Editors, charities and countless start-ups. They provide me with lots of material which forms the basis of many of the articles found here on Mediargh. In this case, the majority of information was gleaned from email exchanges between myself and recruiters from over the course of the last two years. Pretty simple stuff and certainly not an exact science."

* [17:07:12] &lt;Thir13en&gt; non cs?
* [17:07:39] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; for google i think 7 but remeber they took a mech guy his cg was 6
* [17:07:50] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; or 5 oint
* [17:07:52] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; point

* [17:08:01] &lt;ElderWand&gt; does high cgpa help in placements?
* [17:08:04] &lt;Thir13en&gt; he must be very good then
* [17:08:05] &lt;file==1123&gt; that was off campus
* [17:08:29] &lt;Thir13en&gt; so off campus apply karna hi better hoga?
* [17:08:32] &lt;VivaKhaPasta&gt; high cg is not very important for placeents
* [17:08:43] &lt;VivaKhaPasta&gt; you only need to clear the cut-off
* [17:08:55] &lt;ElderWand&gt; okay...thanks
* [17:08:55] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; he applied for google offcampus because bits was not allowing to him to sit but in the end no one got the job except him?
* [17:09:36] &lt;file==1123&gt; there are good coders in bits a 4th year guy has cleared gsoc twice
* [17:09:45] &lt;Thir13en&gt; bc
* [17:09:51] &lt;Thir13en&gt; _/\_
* [17:10:01] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; gsoc is not coding its a developer work
* [17:10:16] &lt;file==1123&gt; yeah i know that
* [17:10:35] &lt;file==1123&gt; but still its respectable isnt it??
* [17:10:58] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; yup it is very respectable
* [17:10:59] &lt;ElderWand&gt; it adds a lot of value to your cv
* [17:11:28] &lt;file==1123&gt; and second thing that guy is a 5 pointer dualite
* [17:11:37] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; yeah mech +bio
* [17:11:42] &lt;Thir13en&gt; then how was he allowed to give test?
* [17:11:56] &lt;file==1123&gt; gsoc is not a test
* [17:12:05] &lt;Thir13en&gt; if he didnt clear the cg cut off for google
* [17:12:08] &lt;theillusion100&gt; what if someone has no apogee project on their resume? Does it affect placement in IT?
* [17:12:09] &lt;Thir13en&gt; not gsoc
* [17:12:10] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; [17:08] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; he applied for google offcampus because bits was not allowing to him to sit but in the end no one got the job except him?
* 
* [17:12:16] &lt;Thir13en&gt; ok
* [17:12:17] &lt;Recovery&gt; theillusion100: no
* [17:13:13] &lt;theillusion100&gt; so do companies look only for knowledge and not for more things on your resume
* [17:13:16] &lt;Thir13en&gt; [17:07:47] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; for google i think 7 but remeber they took a mech guy his cg was 6
* - [17:07:58] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; or 5 oint
* - [17:08:01] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; point
* 
* [17:13:23] &lt;Thir13en&gt; ?
* [17:13:25] &lt;Dual_Lite&gt; is it a good idea to mention your core cg separately on your resume? for dualites?
* [17:13:56] &lt;file==1123&gt; no
* [17:14:12] &lt;theillusion100&gt;  so do companies look only for knowledge and not for more things on your resume
* [17:14:23] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; @Thir13en i read that in his interview with hindi press in my first year
* [17:14:29] &lt;Thir13en&gt; ok
* [17:14:46] &lt;Thir13en&gt; maybe some exceptions can be made
* [17:14:56] &lt;file==1123&gt; knowledge yes but that judgement comes after the cg part
* [17:15:13] &lt;theillusion100&gt; after the cg part???
* [17:15:19] &lt;file==1123&gt; in ur placement paper then interview
* [17:15:35] &lt;file==1123&gt; cg cutoff
* [17:15:44] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; yeah that guy was unbelievable coder he solved like thousand questions in year he said that i think there is an answer on quora 
* [17:15:57] &lt;Leth@l_Cumsh0t&gt; from one of his friend
* [17:16:42] &lt;theillusion100&gt; clear cg cutoffs, clear the apti, clear the interviews and you don't need anything else on your resme
* [17:16:49] &lt;theillusion100&gt; right?

Do's and don'ts?",dreamingdude,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/5phc8j/hey_canada_me_a_few_friends_got_accepted_into_an/,"Some more information on this.

We were accepted into the Mitacs Globalink internship and are all going to different universities to work in the lab there for three month. We have never been overseas and are curious about the time there. Of course, we also don't want to go blundering about.

So tell me anything you are willing to share :) maybe you also came to Canada at some point and can tell from experience?

Thanks in advance everyone and looking forward to Canada!

EDIT: We will be in NovaScotia, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan

EDIT2: The internship will last from mid-July to early October.

EDIT3: A good other question one brought up: What about finding a flat? Is that a major problem? Or would AirBnB or similar work for the larger cities? How are the prices there, preferably close to a Campus?

EDIT4: Thank you everyone! You have been most helpful! I am dearly looking forward to the three months and if I remember I will make a follow up post in October with some recap if you would like :) "
5phck8,3,2017-01-22,"I need some help, I'm completely lost",diver147,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5phck8/i_need_some_help_im_completely_lost/,"First of all I wanna apologize for the lengthy post, it's just that I've got a lot on mind and I need to let it all out. 

I'm a 23 year old male from Morocco, and I was recently diagnosed with GAD about 4 months ago. Although I was only diagnosed recently it is something that I've had all my life, it just skyrocketed about 4 months ago and I haven't been the same since. I have severe depression right now and I feel as though I'm about to go all nuts.

I'm at a point in my life where I don't know what I wanna do or what I should do. I recently graduated college so the rational thing would be to get a job, but I feel like I won't be able to function at any job because my head's a mess and I also feel like getting a job would make me more depressed. What I really wanna do is travel abroad to Europe or America but I don't think I would be able to get a visa to go since I'm not working and I'm not a student anymore. The fact that I can't go abroad right now is making me more depressed and more anxious, it's like a vicious circle that I can't escape. The only thing that I know would make me feel better is the chance to travel abroad, I could try to apply for a visa and there's a chance that I would get it since I've been to europe 3 times already and I've been to America too but I'm too afraid that I won't. 

If I could only find a job and hold on to it for 3 months or so then I would be able to go anywhere but I honestly don't feel like I can do it. I'm seeing a psychiatrist right now and I'm on Prozac which I think helps make my anxiety more manageable but I still feel like I'm a total mess. This going abroad thing is consuming my thoughts and I can't seem to think about anything else. I'm constantly looking for schools to apply to, internships... and I know it's not healthy but I can't seem to stop. "
5phewu,5,2017-01-22,F4M - Office Tease,JunDPP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5phewu/f4m_office_tease/,"I looked in the mirror, and smiled at what I saw. The blue silk shirt clung to my body, the outline of my nipples against the thin fabric advertising my lack of a bra beneath. My breasts weren't large, but they are a nice handful, and perky. I turned slightly, glancing over my shoulder at the matching blue thong I was wearing. My ass looked great. I smirked. I was going to drive Mike crazy.

Mike was my boss at work. I was working as an intern at the office, and he was a middle manager, our department largely unremarkable. He was a nice enough guy but just so....boring. The whole job was. The thought of working the whole semester here was so dreadfully dull that I had decided to spice things up by teasing him.

He was middle aged. Married. Average looks. Fit, but not exceptionally so. Unfailingly polite, and obviously shy. Barely would make eye contact with me. So I had decided I would catch his eye in other ways. Drive him a little crazy. I grinned as I pulled the short black skirt up past my hips, the hem just barely falling below the top of my dark thigh highs. Yeah, this would do it.

I finished the outfit with a short jacket, which when closed would let me move through the rest of the office more modestly. Picking up my purse, I headed out the door, looking forward to work for the first time in weeks.

-- 

Hey all, I'm Jun. Not sure exactly where I want this to go, but I'm thinking I wind up with more than I expected. Either I've misread Mike in some way, or perhaps in my attempt to tease him I attract someone else's attention. Regardless of what happens, I want to get taken advantage of. I might want it, I might not, but I'm going to get taken advantage of.

As far as looks go, I'm asian, petite, and fit. Shoulder length black hair. 

Let me know a rough direction you'd take this. Looking for something longer term as opposed to a single session.

Kinks: Reluctance, big (esp. thick) cocks (but not ridiculous), giving oral. 
No: Violence/injury, age play, bathroom stuff.

I'm an undergraduate student in the US looking for some guidance. A little bit about my situation:

* I have one credit card through my financial institution which I pay off once every week to two weeks.

* Parents have been paying tuition and rent while I cover all other expenses (very fortunate, I've been paying them back over time at a tune of ~1/2 total tuition per year)
* I'm in college so I have time to take risks and try some new things. I want to hear lots of recommendations about how to make the most of it.
* I'm looking for an internship and/or part time job at the moment due to bleeding funds. The internship is more for personal experience.
* Pursuing a degree in Biology with an 18 hour minor in Computer Science.
* I have experience in real estate and small business, as well as several part-time jobs with various degrees of responsibility.

What I really want is to not stagnate my funds at the mercy of inflation, but I have next to no experience in investments outside of the housing market, which is inflated and tumultuous in my current area. 

If anyone has any questions for me I'd be happy to answer just about anything!"
5piaj6,8,2017-01-22,"getting a heck of a lot better, change is good! she lost someone who loved her, I lost someone who didn't love me",AfricanAgent47,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/5piaj6/getting_a_heck_of_a_lot_better_change_is_good_she/,"I am a 20 year old male, I'm in University in my 3rd year(med school). I met this sweet little girl during my internship period in June and we became official around July. We go to the same university and we live in the same town. 

As you would Imagine, the relationship started off well, plenty of kissing, hugging, sex etc...(honemoon period) We did have our issues, but we would iron them out as soon as they would come up. Everything was...to say the least, Awesome!

She and I got back to school in September and quite honestly, we didn't have much time for each other like we used to (which was expected seeing as our schedules were crazy and I didn't have as much free time as her) but we made it work, we would spare whatever little time we had for each other during the week, we would meet up, talk, have sex, hangout, whatever. We would always make time for each other even if it was for 10 or so minutes.

All of a Sudden, in November, she went cold on me, she would hardly contact me and even if we would meet, holding a conversation with her would be like holding an interview, I confronted her about this(via text sadly because she kept declining offers for us to see each other for about three weeks) and she texted me ""I love you, but the relationship lost it's spark"", at that point I felt devastated because I had tried everything to make things better, I would plan all sort of dates, do fun stuff etc.. but ultimately it wasn't enough, all the while, she put zero effort into making the relationship exciting again. Her only solution was to go cold on me. This strategy made me feel like everything was my fault.

Ultimately, after a few more weeks of coldness from her and trying my best to reach out, I reached my limits, I decided to end things [via text because she kept avoiding me-I know  I know, it wasn't the best breakup method] in mid December, It was by far one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life, but it didn't bother her, when I ended things it seemed like it was what she wanted for quite some time. 
I loved her so so much, I literally never loved anybody before the way I loved her, I actually saw myself marrying this woman, but alas, the relationship ended. Letting go was so fucking hard!

I came to the conclusion with the help of some of my friends friends that there was probably a third party involved [still not sure], or she was just falling out of love but didn't have the guts to admit it.

I texted her some Christmas greetings and commenced full NC on 25th Dec, I deleted our Whatsapp and IG DM's this morning (A huge step for me), We still follow each other on IG though and like each others posts, but it never goes beyond that. Soon, I'll delete our text messages and our hangouts. I deleted most pictures of us and her, but I only kept two on my dropbox.

I've been frequenting the gym more often since she went cold on me and I even quit some bad habits that I won't mention here. 

Overall, I feel like I'm coping well, I know I'm not yet ready to see her in person yet, because sometimes when I find myself thinking of her, hearing her name, or seeing her picture my heart beats rapidly and palpitates, but I know I'll get there, I'm taking NC one step at a time and getting much stronger. This is a time to refine myself and build a better character. I'll probably give myself a year or two before I get into another relationship

I must admit though, the relationship made me a lot wiser, It made me more of a man, I made the mistakes that I have learned from, I carry myself differently, and for that I thank her... On to the next one!!"
5piqp0,1,2017-01-22,Should i consider full independence from my mom?,sumplicas,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5piqp0/should_i_consider_full_independence_from_my_mom/,"She is expending all her salary for mortgage, food, transport, health insurance and so on. 
She doesn't talk about her finance with me, but i think she saves around 2% with me, and that could go to 10% without.

With this 10% she can save for future investments, stabilize her finance and use in emergencies, like for when my dad can't pay my college(It happens like once every 4/5 months).

As for me, i'm stable where i work, as intern, and my boss wants to hire me by the end of the year (which means salary raise).

I made a calculation with everything that i would expend monthly and as result i'd have around 3% every month left, which is not much, but i'm working on ways to receive an extra cash. My goal is also to reach 10% in savings.

5pju6z,43,2017-01-22,[D] Research Internship interview preparation,NeuroBoss31,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/5pju6z/d_research_internship_interview_preparation/,"I'm interviewing for several companies to intern over the summer in mainly machine learning and computer vision. I'm surprised I haven't found a rich post on this question, so I decided to post it here so it could help people in the future. *Note: This is for PhD-level research intern interview and not software intern interview.

0) The general question is: How should I prepare for these interviews.

Equally important sub-questions:

1) How do the interviews change depending on the company: Ex: Google Brain, FAIR, DeepMind, OpenAI, MSR, Baidu, NVIDIA, etc... 

2) What are ""must knows"" in the interviews. Example: Knowing Logistic Regression, Explaining a Loss Function, What is Bayes Rule.

3) What are ""don't worry about its"" in the interviews. Example: I consistently hear that people will get quizzed to code depending on the company, but this rarely seems to be the case for a research intern vs software intern; Do I need to know how to implement Bubble sort? Do I need to know about DQN's and NTM's for DeepMind, or is this overkill for an internship interview? Does FAIR expect me to be highly proficient in Torch?

4) How much coding vs math was involved in your interview. Give an example of the coding problem (because I'm sure they are different from the 'traditional ones' in software intern interviews).

5) Feel free to post your internship interview experience (positive/negative)

For this job, I get no benefits and no 401k match or anything, but I still want to have the contributions to my Roth IRA be automatically deducted from my paychecks and deposited into the Roth. Is this possible?

I don't really know how to log in to the Vanguard system since my account was created through the university, or even who to call at Vanguard to talk about this. Any information would be helpful.

Thanks!"
5pkpho,3,2017-01-22,[FOR HIRE] Full Stack Developer,nrfowler,phxjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/phxjobs/comments/5pkpho/for_hire_full_stack_developer/,"I have a very nontraditional background that I find turns a lot of employers off: after college I worked for only one year at my previous employer, Epic in Verona, WI. I was basically asked to resign and have not worked for 3 years.

Epic's hiring methodology is to take people who are smart and throw them in a fast-paced software engineering environment and I could not keep up. In high school and college I was always the overachiever and not being up to snuff at Epic was a huge blow to me. I did well with my chemical engineering degree and going into Epic's Pharmacy division I thought that I would primarily be an analyst and deal with pharmacy-related issues, but as time went on it became apparent that the role was primarily software engineering. It was a combination of a negative environment, boss I didn't get along with, excessive workload, and my inability to adapt. This company has been sued sucessfully for overworking and underpaying their employees in a division which was similar to my own (QA, while I was in technical services). One case may be going to the Supreme Court soon, you can google it to find out more.

Over the next 3 years I have not done much professionally other than learn programming. I like to think of myself as having gotten an unofficial bachelors degree in Computer Science over the last 3 years. I took two semesters of college courses and contributed to a variety of open source projects. I also started to take some ""me"" time. I got my first gym membership, and started to eat a more nutritious diet. In the process of that, I realized that my unhealthy prior lifestyle was causing a lot of mood and energy issues such as anxiety which was hampering my performance at the job. What I will say if you are curious what I learned: Gary Taubes, Michael Pollan, and The Power of Full Engagement are books/authors I recommend.

It really looks horrible to have a 3 year gap on my record but I was in a bit of a bad place after being forced to resign. I know I should have gotten a part time job, but doing so after you've been paid $30 an hour is a bit difficult when you realize how valuable your time is. I also did not have to spend money on rent or food most of that time, because I lived with my parents. So in other words I was living a responsible life, but not planning well what my resume would look like.

I am finding that employers seem to treat this 3 year ""gap"" with extreme distaste. I personally think that it's their loss, seeing that most of that time was spent learning programming on my own and taking college courses. I also like to think of some of that time as my own personal ""gap year,"" which I never got to experience before.

So I am in this awkward position where I do well on programming interview tests and pass them, and even do well on the interviews when they are non-technical, until the 3 year gap and the fact that I was forced to resign is brought up. So what I really need is a job, any job, which is related to software so that I can prove that I can actually show up to a job and work. I am willing to take a lower than average salary, given my less than stellar background.

If anyone has a freelance job they need done, I am willing to do it for a reduced price. Or if they have an opening for an intern, that would work too (I don't even need to be paid if it is an internship). Any gig, no matter how small, will be a big help for me. I have gotten to the point where I can solve a wide range of high to low level problems with software. I really have no boundaries when it comes to software.

My skills are basically in Full Stack Development: Frontends (AngularJS, web design, HTML, etc.) and Backends (servers, web services, Java, C#, C++, Python, Spring MVC, etc.). While I have not gained any professional experience, I have been programming around 1-2 hours a day for at least 2 years and have developed the skill of building software and resolving technical issues. My personal portfolio is here: nrfowler.github.io

On my portfolio, you can see some of the projects I made for the 2 month bootcamp I attended at Cook Systems in Memphis. I am also in the process of finishing a Udacity Nanodegree. I am about halfway finished. I have also finished many other online trainings, such as Codeschool and Coursera. In terms of university training, I would rate myself at about a junior level of Computer Science in terms of completed coursework. When I look at most Junior Dev job postings, I can see myself meeting the requirements of the job quite easily and I have exposure to almost every technology they list.

I am currently in Des Moines, IA but I am planning on relocating to a nicer tech hub city like Austin, TX or Phoenix, AZ. I am willing to consider other cities and am also open for remote work. (Des Moines is nice but I also just want to get out of my hometown)

5pkw6w,5,2017-01-22,I'm [19M] getting bored of my BF [25M] of 4.5 months,tegillis,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5pkw6w/im_19m_getting_bored_of_my_bf_25m_of_45_months/,"So I've been with my boyfriend since the beginning of September. The second we started dating we spent as much time together as possible, and its been pretty much the same since then. Just about every night after we're done with class/work he'll come over and sleep at my place.

Because of the amount of time we spend with each other, we hardly have any friends of our own, and rarely go out with them. A large part of me feels like I'm missing out on the college experience, but I still really like him so I don't know what to do. Now that we've been in this routine for about 4 months its gotten more difficult to break out of it.

Although I'm still very attracted to him, I've found myself fantasizing about being with different people since the sex hasn't changed since we started dating. I've also started to wonder what it would be like dating a woman since I've only been with men. 

He's very good to me so whenever I even think about cheating or breaking up I feel awful. Even though in either 5 or 10 months we won't have a choice since I'm doing an internship then studying abroad.

If I'm already feeling this way this early in the relationship does that mean it's not going anywhere? If not what are ways that I can change this feeling?
NOTE: I have not told him I feel this way at all.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**:
I still like my boyfriend but the routine for the past 4 months has caused me to lose friends and get bored. Does this mean the relationship's not going anywhere? How can I change this?"
5plvaz,212,2017-01-22,I don't think I've left the edge of my seat since I started playing this game.,TupperwareLid,RimWorld,https://www.reddit.com/r/RimWorld/comments/5plvaz/i_dont_think_ive_left_the_edge_of_my_seat_since_i/,"It's the middle of a Volcanic Winter, and we're running low on supplies across the board. The local faction and tribes are hostile because of a few unfortunate misunderstandings, so we're seeing a lot of raids and no traders. And nobody's bringing neutroamine on a raid.

Still, we're holding our own. Captured a few prisoners from the latest tribal swarm, hoping to release them for some goodwill. Our guys are healing off some nasty injuries though, so it's slow going.

Among them is Kristina, my sharpshooting farmer. She's been with me since the beginning so has a plethora of skills, including being 1 of 3 people in the colony with a medicine skill over 10. She's nursing a destroyed kidney, but is otherwise healthy. Should be fine, I think! She's lived through worse.

Suddenly: Plague. Kristina, and my two capable doctors are down. We ran out of Penoxycyline a season ago.

Burning through our precious reverses of medicine, my little medical 'intern' (skill of 8) manages to stabilise everyone but poor Kristina, who just can't fight off the plague with one kidney. Even my one remaining glitterworld med doesn't do the trick. The numbers are climbing way too fast.

At this point, I'm eyeing up the small pile of Luciferium and weighing the cost-benefit in my head. She'd live for a while, sure, but where was I going to get more with the state of things? I need something a bit more permanent.

Scouring across my colony, I spot him - one lone little prisoner who had somehow managed to avoid my notice with all of the chaos. He hadn't been freed with the others, and he had two wonderful kidneys sitting right there going to waste!

Strapped a medicine bag to the intern and sent her over there to retrieve it. After a couple of failures he miraculously lived through, she returns triumphant.

(The prisoner did not survive. RIP whoever he was.)

Moment of truth. I drag one of my competent doctors out of bed to perform the surgery on Kristina and hope it doesn't accelerate the plague somehow. Intern collapses in exhaustion in the corner since I've been making her run non-stop without a rest. The surgery is tense; there's a high chance of failure now I don't have glitterworld meds, and even my best guy is only at Medicine 17. The moment passes. No failure. Kidney is in.

Sigh of relief. Her immunity starts to climb again. I force medical intern to live in the hospital so she can administer treatments immediately. (Her husband chucks a tantrum because he misses sleeping with her, and goes on a binge in the background.) The next few days are spent willing numbers to climb faster and managing a man-eating pack of mufflaos destroying my turrets.

The other two develop immunity around 85-90%, and are up and about a day later while Kristina languishes. The numbers are too close to count - immunity edges over the top at the 95% mark, but I can't relax until I see that little shield. Medical intern is back with her now alcoholic husband, and my best doctor does her final treatment.

She develops her immunity at 99%.

After a few days, Kristina is back up and about, hobbling through the gardens and dutifully getting back to work. She starts a relationship with the doctor that saved her life, and they're very happy together. My artist makes a sculpture of medical intern extracting the kidney from our unfortunate prisoner. Volcanic winter ends, and a trade ship passes overhead. The crisis is finally over, I think!

Two days later, a drop pod raid lands in the middle of my base and Kristina is shot in the head by a yayo-addict pyromaniac who also burns my barn down.

5pmpt5,2,2017-01-23,"I'm tired of being angry, of being sad, of being left behind. I want to be a new person.",C_fineman,selfesteemsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfesteemsupport/comments/5pmpt5/im_tired_of_being_angry_of_being_sad_of_being/,"I really want to reach out to someone, anyone, about this. I recently got back to school (I go to college), but over the weekend I went to take my ornery mother out grocery shopping. Some people called the house yesterday or that day, I can't remember, and I had no idea who they were. I learned after the fact that they weren't telemarketers. Nonetheless, I told her about it, prompting her to get really pissy with me about how I handled the situation. I told her I didn't know who they were, and she tells me that I ""space out"" or whatever. It seemed like she was implying I wasn't thinking or paying attention. She left the room, and I began to feel a boiling rage inside. I began to imagine all kinds of violent things I wanted to do at the moment. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. For most of the day, my hands were shaking from this pressure I felt inside. 

I then began to think about how tired I was. I have these moments whenever I get really upset where I imagine things I really want to do. I really wanted to run off crying, go to my sister one weekend (she moved out) and just cry to her about everything, or somehow go to someone who I could stay with to tell them everything and they would just give me sanctuary until I could finally get my life in order somehow. 

I know that I talk to myself alot. I have detailed analyses of films and literature with myself. But I also relive upsetting moments with myself. I don't know why. I keep replaying these moments like they're so important to me, but they shouldn't be.

This extends to so many other things. I'm currently studying computer game design, and I need to find an internship somehow. I want to create compelling stories and experiences in games, but I have almost nothing to show for that. I want to work on stuff, but I get distracted easily. I get distracted with thinking about the future and how I feel like I'll never gain any modicum of success because I feel like I have no insight or intelligence on a subject despite enthusiasm for something. I want to learn, but I have trouble sitting down and trying to learn it or even trying to work on something creatively. 

I view myself as two different people. I want so bad to be the other person. I had a hard time growing up, both at school and at home. I wasn't sexually, physically or emotionally abused, but I hated it regardless. All I think about with my past is how much I want to forget about all of it. I want to be a new person. I want to start over and escape to a new place where I can be happy. I can barely think of a time when I was happy for longer than a few days or whatever.

I just can't take it any longer. I'm tired of being strong. I'm tired of hiding my feelings. I'm tired of the pain that I can't seem to just forget about or diminish. I'm tired of all the voices of people in the past reminding me of all the bad things I can't forget. 

If anyone has any help or advice, please reply. I really want it."

5pms56,11,2017-01-23,I'm 19yo and going to school full time. Should I buy a house?,LLCoolSouder,FinancialPlanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialPlanning/comments/5pms56/im_19yo_and_going_to_school_full_time_should_i/,"I'm currently college student on a full scholarship, living at home. For fear of risking my scholarship, I don't work most of the year except for teaching high school bands in the fall and writing their music in the spring (I don't work for many schools so it's far from a full time job). Luckily, I make pretty good money when I am working, and I'm suuuuuuper cheap so whatever money I make doesn't really go anywhere besides paying for car insurance/ maintenance. 

All that being said, I've accumulated roughly $5,000 as of right now. Because my scholarship is actually too much money (since I live at home), the university pays me a refund check for about $800 every semester. My grandmother has a small college fund for all of her grandchildren. Since mine has gone untouched, I have a $2000 ""education"" fund that has to be spent on education or the bank takes 10% (but I've already found the loop hole for that so just call it $2000). The other portion of her college fund was originally invested in a mutual fund for each of us, but mine has since been taken out and put in a CD. The amount in the CD is roughly $4800. So that's a total of $6800 from granny. 

I've been looking into investing my money recently anyway, and it was brought to my attention that foreclosed houses often sell extremely cheap and I might be able to afford to buy one with a friend...sort of. (Finish reading before losing your mind.) It just so happens that I looked around for houses on sale in the area and one of them actually seems like a very good deal. 

The plan is as follows: 
I go to school for Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, so if all goes well, a summer internship should be a net profit of around $5000-6000. That should put me at about $10-11000. The house I'm looking at is $49,900, so $10,000 should cover the down payment. A 10 year mortgage (I try to assume the highest expenses) would be about $400/month. Taxes on the house have been $3800 at most, so budgeting for $4000 makes another $300/month. I've yet to look into home owners insurance rates, electricity rates for the area, or Internet services, so I can't give an estimate on those. Around my school, rent is about $500-800/month plus utilities anyway. It's a 3 bedroom house with a basement, and my friends are talking about moving out soon anyway. Ideally, over the next 4 semesters I could rent a room to 2-3 friends (depending on if the basement is liveable enough for me) for $400-500/month, I think I could more or less live for free or at most on a part time job which would be easy to find in that area, AND I'd be on my way to paying off a house. The house is in an area I wouldn't mind living for a few years too, since there are engineering jobs nearby, so I wouldn't be screwed once we all graduate and they leave. Now FINALLY we get back to my very brief mention of investing that you already forgot about. After I'm done paying off the house in a few years, I could A.) Stay there as long as I have work OR B.) Move out and rent it to the next college kid that comes along since it's right next to a rapidly growing  university.

So, now that you've read my plan, I'd love to hear some thoughts. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I need to hear what I need to hear; not what I want to believe. It just really seems like a good deal to me the more I think about it.

5pmu1v,1,2017-01-23,I'm 19yo and going to school full time. Should I buy a house?,LLCoolSouder,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5pmu1v/im_19yo_and_going_to_school_full_time_should_i/,"I'm currently college student on a full scholarship, living at home. For fear of risking my scholarship, I don't work most of the year except for teaching high school bands in the fall and writing their music in the spring (I don't work for many schools so it's far from a full time job). Luckily, I make pretty good money when I am working, and I'm suuuuuuper cheap so whatever money I make doesn't really go anywhere besides paying for car insurance/ maintenance. 

All that being said, I've accumulated roughly $5,000 as of right now. Because my scholarship is actually too much money (since I live at home), the university pays me a refund check for about $800 every semester. My grandmother has a small college fund for all of her grandchildren. Since mine has gone untouched, I have a $2000 ""education"" fund that has to be spent on education or the bank takes 10% (but I've already found the loop hole for that so just call it $2000). The other portion of her college fund was originally invested in a mutual fund for each of us, but mine has since been taken out and put in a CD. The amount in the CD is roughly $4800. So that's a total of $6800 from granny. 

I've been looking into investing my money recently anyway, and it was brought to my attention that foreclosed houses often sell extremely cheap and I might be able to afford to buy one with a friend...sort of. (Finish reading before losing your mind.) It just so happens that I looked around for houses on sale in the area and one of them actually seems like a very good deal. 

The plan is as follows: 
I go to school for Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, so if all goes well, a summer internship should be a net profit of around $5000-6000. That should put me at about $10-11000. The house I'm looking at is $49,900, so $10,000 should cover the down payment. A 10 year mortgage (I try to assume the highest expenses) would be about $400/month. Taxes on the house have been $3800 at most, so budgeting for $4000 makes another $300/month. I've yet to look into home owners insurance rates, electricity rates for the area, or Internet services, so I can't give an estimate on those. Around my school, rent is about $500-800/month plus utilities anyway. It's a 3 bedroom house with a basement, and my friends are talking about moving out soon anyway. Ideally, over the next 4 semesters I could rent a room to 2-3 friends (depending on if the basement is liveable enough for me) for $400-500/month, I think I could more or less live for free or at most on a part time job which would be easy to find in that area, AND I'd be on my way to paying off a house.

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate who started my job hunt recently.  I've have 1 phone interview back in September for a large company as a Help Desk/Voice Technician position. It was my first ever phone interview so I researched the crap out of what to expect and prepare for.  I concluded it was more of a getting to know me and my experience situation.  When the phone call came I was on the phone with 4 people for 20 minutes and they drilled me on scenarios and role play questions, which I was NOT prepared for or expecting.  
I applied through a recruiter for a similar position at the same company, but a different plant.  I'm expecting a phone interview and was wondering what I should have prepared this time?  Trying to find an entry level job that doesn't require 5 years experience is hard.  (I have my BA in CS, 4 months help desk internship at a large company, and 9 years in customer service experience.) Taking a help desk job is perfectly okay for me to get my foot in the door and gain some experience under my belt.

While we do have some sort of system in place for what goes where, inevitably some projects get stored temporarily on the wrong hard drive and months later I spend way too much time that is necessary plugging and unplugging in every drive to find a certain project folder.

Now, does anyone know of any software that could maybe allow you to plug a hard drive in, scan it and have it save a list of folders / files stored on it? We actually made a searchable spreadsheet of exactly this last year when we had an intern working with us but we've been lazy and not updated it, so its only kind of useful at this point.

5pqb56,1,2017-01-23,[M4F] Mandi's Hardship,travel_a_lot,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/5pqb56/m4f_mandis_hardship/,"Mandi knocked on the door softly—three quick raps, as instructed—and waited for the door to open. Her financial situation forced her to get her own side-hustle to support her teenage daughter's modeling aspirations as well as support her minor drug habit. Being a licensed massage therapist paid well between the hours of 9am to 5pm, but she could make so much more traveling to hotels and houses giving extra special massages. Sure, sometimes things got out of hand, but with enough cash money in her hand to pay for a bump of coke, an order of Plan B, and more photography sessions for her daughter, it all seemed worth it.

Mandi and her daughter Hope were a team ever since she was born. Hope's father was an intern on a diplomatic visa who became reassigned the day after he and Mandi met. Mandi was the tour guide of her high school when his delegation came through to learn about well funded education programs. They were both young, and sparks flew. They only had one night of passion together in a mid-range hotel funded by his internship, and after going through the trial pack of three condoms, they decided their last fuck in the shower the next morning would probably be fine without one. I mean, after so many orgasms the night before, how much semen could he produce? 

As it turns out, it was just enough. 

Mandi was 16 when she got pregnant, and 17 when she had Hope. She never told him about Hope because she was afraid that a statutory accusation would ruin his career. Mandi knew her life was going to be chaotic, but she desperately wanted to be a mom, even at an early age. She lived with her mother who was stable enough to help her out during the early years, which is what kept her off the street as a teenager. That was, until the accident. 

Mandi and Hope had been on their own for the last ten years, and the inheritance that her mother left her was nearly gone. It went mostly to a house, a reliable car, photography sessions for Hope, and maybe just a little going up her nose. Hope was tall, like her father, and had a desirable body for modeling. Mandi never went to the photography sessions and Hope never complained. She assumed Hope could take care of herself, but sometimes wondered why she looked so flushed when she came back. Mandi ignored it and assumed all must be well.

Mandi saw a shadow in the peephole and the door softly open. ""Mandi?"" called a deep voice from behind the crack in the door. ""Hi, are you Jack?"" she said softly, feeling more uncomfortable and exposed with every passing minute as she stood in the hallway.

The door opened wide enough to let her through and close behind her. As she let her eyes adjust to the dim light of the room, she saw that Jack was wearing a robe, but hadn't bothered to tie it tightly. She saw his ample cock dangling between his legs framed by equally impressive testicles that she assumed she would be getting intimate with. *So, it's one of these.*

""Thanks for coming, Mandi, especially on such short notice. I've left your donation on the table. Why don't you make yourself more comfortable. The bathroom is over there,"" Jack motioned with his eyes.

The room was large, like a suite, and Jack walked over to the chair to sit down. There was a table next to it with a half-empty bottle of whiskey and what appeared to be a small pile of cocaine, and a very expensive looking camera sitting on a tripod pointing at the couch. Jack sat down in the chair, poured himself some whiskey, and sat back making no attempt to cover himself as his robe fell to the side, his uncut cock flopping around before finally coming to rest on his leg. He sipped his whiskey then looked over to Mandi and raised his eyebrows as if to say, *Come on now, the clock is ticking.*

Good evening RPers. I'm looking for a long term RP partner (but could do this one in a short term play if you like) to play Mandi, and/or potentially Hope. We can discuss ages in a PM before getting started. I wrote this in third person, but can do first if it works. To make this more AgePlay appropriate, we can change Mandi to Hope's older sister (who had to raise her for whatever hardship reason). We can discuss more in PM.

This can go in a number of different directions. Mandi is here because she placed an ad as an erotic massage provider, and Jack called her. Perhaps you want to just turn me into a regular client or work out some kind of a financial arrangement? Or maybe you assume I am a modeling agent and want me to meet Hope, and more. Maybe you offer to make some videos for extra cash, you or you ask me for a job at my company. 

I'd prefer to discuss up front before jumping in, so PM me. We can iron out ages or other plot lines that you want.

As mentioned in the title, I am a fresh CNA with little experience. The only experience I gained was through my month-long internship at a nursing home. I chose PM shift because I want to take classes at a CC soon and wouldn't want it to conflict with my work hours as much. I'm still going through the hiring process, but I was placed on Med/Surg/Telemetry and I should be called in for my orientation soon. 

I asked my interviewer what my biggest challenge would be on my first day and she said time management and organization. She said I would be assisting many Vietnamese and Korean elderly who are very respectful. She even added that I will definitely feel frustrated; and when things feel a bit crappy, don't focus on that but instead look at the bigger picture. Seems like she's mentally preparing me for it. 

I'm eager to gain experience and to learn a lot, but in all honesty I'm fighting my paranoia of not having good coworkers and of being berated since I'm a newbie.

Is it okay to post this sale listing on reddit btw? 



Here are the details.

This is a used Wacom Drawing Tablet (Small). It comes in all of its original packaging. and its condition is like new. The serial number is pictured for authenticity. 

I used it for about 4 weeks in the latter half of my internships at a design firm, and I kept it well protected in an 11"" slim laptop case, which I will also be willing to include. It is from Amazon.


I am basically selling it because I don't need it anymore/it is inefficient (believe it or not) in my new setup. I don't draw, I only used it to edit stuff. I recently bought the new MacBook Pro with its enormous trackpad, its the exact size of the pen area of the Wacom Tablet. Anyways, I got way too used to the keyboard, key commands, and the trackpad so much that the need for the drawing tablet no longer made any sense.

We met six years ago at work when he was recently broken up with his college GF, Elizabeth (25F). We slept together pretty fast and were FWB but sometimes he would deny me, saying he missed Elizabeth too much. I understood because the breakup was recent. We both moved to different places after a few months, but kept in touch via letters, phone calls, texting and visiting. I know he visited Elizabeth at least once during this period, but after their visit he said it was over. After a year we decided to get more serious and moved in together. We fell in love and after two years of dating I proposed to him on top of a mountain. He said yes and we began planning a wedding. At one point, Elizabeth was visiting their old college town and asked him if he wanted to meet up. I told him it was up to him if we wanted to go, but that it would hurt my feelings. He decided not to go which made me feel like he truly cared for my feelings, until I read his texts with her and he had said “I can’t meet you because I’m worried I’ll be thinking about you naked the whole time”. My heart completely sank. I mean, I’m glad he didn’t go, but he clearly still harbored feelings for her at that time. We worked through it and continued on with the wedding, which was absolutely beautiful followed by a vacation in the tropics. I’ve never been so happy and forgot about her. 

Following our return from home, Steven had a facebook message from, of course, Elizabeth. She congratulated him on our marriage. At this point I feel like she is intruding. She knows hes married now, why does she keep trying to talk to him? I asked him to block her on facebook and he did. I noticed shortly after that she blocked me on facebook, which is weird because we’ve never had any interaction before. 

One year into marriage and things are going great. We bought a home, have a few farm animals and are enjoying a settled life. Then we hear from Elizabeth again. Her text says something like “Hey Steven, just thought I’d let you know that my fiancé and I will be in the Northwest for my internship and it would be great to get together if you can”. Steven didn’t respond. 

Our life has continued to be going well and I truly believe Steven is happy and we are soulmates. Our life has been Elizabeth free until last week, when I got a message on my Instagram account from Elizabeth saying something to the extent of “I got an Instagram request from Steven and I figured it was you because he has me blocked on facebook. I just wanted to say that it makes me a little uncomfortable for you both to be looking at my social media, hope you understand”. I confronted Steven and he said the request must have been an accident, which I believe because he rarely uses social media. I responded back telling her that “Steven hasn’t been on Instagram in over a year and was looking through ‘people you may know’. He asked me how private profiles work and since yours was right there I showed him the message that non-followers see. He must have accidentally clicked follow. I am sorry that makes you feel uncomfortable, we just aren’t great with tech stuff. Neither of us would like to follow you.” All true. 
She responded “Are you sure your husband didn’t purposely follow me because he was thinking of me?”

I responded “Oh sweetheart, I don’t dislike you, I have no reason to. We haven’t had to talk about you since the last time you awkwardly messaged him to visit. Move on…he did five years ago”. Then I blocked her. At this point, I’m done being nice. 
I am livid but Steven doesn’t seem to think it’s as big of a problem as me. I think she is continually intruding into our life when Steven has ignored her for years. It’s time for her to move on. How long will we have to keep dealing with this? Is there anything I can do besides block her? 

TL;DR: Husband’s ex girlfriend keeps trying to talk to him despite no response from my husband. What can we do

I almost quit today and feel like I am going to quit in the following weeks. Here's a list of reasons:
- Exhausting hours; I have to literally escape the office to find some time to eat, go to the gym, do laundry, etc;

- Salary is shit;

- I don't learn anything anymore, instead I teach others. Interns and assistants are slow learners and I have to review everything.  I told management, said I am slower because I have to keep and eye on them. Got told that I need to learn how to work with the new generation (they are at most two years younger than me);

- Manager doesn't even review my work. I have to literally explain point by point the night before we present our results to clients;

- Internal compliance is following me like a shadow. Almost everyday I am audited for expenses. They never find anything, and the only result is that my expenses are refunded at least a week later they were supposed to, due to this audit.

So, I find it hard, but maybe it's time to quit. I really like the office and I enjoyed it a lot, but for the reasons said above, I am really considering quitting."

I've been reflecting on my challenges in getting computer science co-op jobs and internships over the course of my time at UBC. Although getting interviews is hard enough itself, I know that I’ve personally struggled with really excelling during technical questions and it’s certainly been a barrier for me in getting the internships I’ve wanted.

The conclusion I’ve come to is that my skills improved the most when I spent time working through interview questions face to face with friends and explaining my thought process. That being said, I don’t think there’s currently a consistent time and place where students are encouraged to meet and practice their interview skills. 

While comp sci co-op runs occasional technical interview clinics, these aren’t open to everyone and from my experience they aren’t necessarily the most helpful. Even employers running workshops may be helpful in the short term, but they don't provide the opportunity for consistent practice and improvement in skills over time. 

All this being said, I’m currently looking into forming a group/club devoted to practicing technical interview questions (and other interview skills) on a weekly basis. What are you thoughts on this? Would you attend? Do you think you would benefit? Are there other parts of getting a co-op job or internship that you think are significant barriers? "
5pt0dn,25,2017-01-23,Career Fair Advice from an IU alumni/recruiter,iurecruiter,IndianaUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianaUniversity/comments/5pt0dn/career_fair_advice_from_an_iu_alumnirecruiter/,"Note: I'm leaving out which company I'll be representing so this doesn't break the subreddit rules of advertising, also it gives me freedom to be more honest about the process.

I graduated in 2013 with an Informatics major and will be back on campus for the **Arts &amp; Sciences Career Fair** Tuesday and **Informatics and Computer Science Career Fair** Thursday. I've made a list of what helped me during my career fair experiences as well as what I've gathered from going full circle to recruit from IU. Hope it helps!

* Career Fair:
 * Your school career fair website should list all the companies and whether they're hiring interns, full time, or both. Skip talking to companies not offering what you want unless you have extra time and want to talk to them for the future. Make a list of your favorite companies and talk to them first.
 * The most popular companies will have long lines, come early to avoid them!
 * In my experience it works best to introduce yourself and hand them your resume, them say what you're looking for e.g. full time position. Some majors are funneled into certain positions and you opening with your skill set helps the recruiter tell you if you should talk to someone else at the booth instead. The recruiter will then guide you with questions to see if you meet the minimum requirements like GPA or a work visa, and maybe ask questions like why you're interested in that company, what relevant experience you have, etc.
 * Don't make the mistake I did at first with a minute long elevator pitch about yourself. They won't remember most of it and can read your resume to get the same details. Exception - super relevant experience like applying for a consulting job when your whole family and best friend are consultants.
 * Absolutely ask questions if you want, but the super specific questions are best left to the actual interview/on site visit. Unless you're talking to the recruiter, I'm not going to be able to tell you the exact specific details of a job I haven't had besides the general information and requirements. Your first round interview and beyond are where to ask those questions, the career fair is just getting your foot in the door and considered for an interview.
 * Confirm how to apply - is giving them your resume enough? is there an online app you have to do?
 * When you leave shake their hand, smile and say thanks! If someone is very promising and then walks off with out saying goodbye that could mark them down.

* Resume:
 * Bring many paper copies, better save than sorry and paper costs a few cents a sheet
 * Spelling, grammar, formatting count! Not that I'm reading every line, just the overall experience, but if your margins are off or I see spelling mistakes that's a mark against you.
 * Get some nice paper to print them on for bonus points
 * Try to fit it on 1 page if you can

* Dress:
 * Any way you go above the minimum helps you stand out e.g. wearing a suite jacket instead of just dress pants and a dress shirt
 * General hygiene - shower, trim your nails, brush your teeth before coming, deodorant, no excessive cologne/perfume (some is ok)

* Don'ts:
 * Wear bad clothes - wrinkled, untucked, holes in it, etc. we *will* remember that and factor that into an interview offer
 * Bad hygiene
 * Argue with the recruiter - e.g. if the company doesn't hire above X GPA, the people there are not who set or change that

* What I look for:
 * Good social skills! Someone with little experience and a barely passing GPA but great social skills could be weighed as much as a 4.0 grad student who can't communicate well
 * Be respectful of our time and don't spend more than a few minutes at the booth if there's a line, we talk to hundreds of people sometimes!
 * Be yourself! Acting fake or like who you think we want you to be is obvious
 * If you meet the requirements for our hiring and seem like a decent person I'm almost always going to pass you to the main recruiter who decides first round interview offers.

Remember that some people at the booth are full time recruiters, others are regular employees, and others may be managers/HR/upper management. Some companies may have 1 recruiter make all the interview offer decisions and others may let anyone who is manning the booth pass people. Regardless treat everyone with respect and be friendly!

I can try to answer general questions here, or PM me if you don't want to post. Good luck to everyone!"
5pt4p8,24,2017-01-23,UBC Comp Sci Interview Club/Group,ubc_tech_interviews,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/5pt4p8/ubc_comp_sci_interview_clubgroup/,"Hey r/UBC

I've been reflecting on my challenges in getting computer science co-op jobs and internships over the course of my time at UBC. Although getting interviews is hard enough itself, I know that I’ve personally struggled with really excelling during technical questions and it’s certainly been a barrier for me in getting the internships I’ve wanted.

The conclusion I’ve come to is that my skills improved the most when I spent time working through interview questions face to face with friends and explaining my thought process. That being said, I don’t think there’s currently a consistent time and place where students are encouraged to meet and practice their interview skills. 

While comp sci co-op runs occasional technical interview clinics, these aren’t open to everyone and from my experience they aren’t necessarily the most helpful. Even employers running workshops may be helpful in the short term, but they don't provide the opportunity for consistent practice and improvement in skills over time. 

All this being said, I’m currently looking into forming a group/club devoted to practicing technical interview questions (and other interview skills) on a weekly basis. What are you thoughts on this? Would you attend? Do you think you would benefit? Are there other parts of getting a co-op job or internship that you think are significant barriers? "
5ptbfq,1,2017-01-23,"I moved to a new city to study, and I hate this place. I have no friends, I dislike what I'm studying and I cry myself to sleep almost every night.",RegretMyWholeLife,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5ptbfq/i_moved_to_a_new_city_to_study_and_i_hate_this/,"In august 2015 I moved to another city to get a bachelor in nursing (3 years). I had 3 good friends who lived in this city, and I was having a good time the first year, but it had it's ups and downs.

After the first year, two of my good friends moved (one because he got an internship somewhere else, the other because he wanted to get away). The third one is to busy with his girlfriends to even hang with me. I've been with him about 5 times the last year (and we used to hang every day back home).

I was hoping I would make some new friends at school when I got here, as I'm a very social guy who usually has no problem making friends. But it's pretty hard when you're the only guy in your group (20 people), and one of 5 guys in the whole class (200 people).
I've been invited by some of the girls to taco nights and stuff, but I don't really enjoy being with them, and also I've got this feeling that they kind of wish I turned down the invitation so it could only be the girls.

I've told my family I love it here. I've told them I've got some friends, and that I love what I'm studying. Those are both lies. I'm embarrassed of myself because I have no friends, and that I've lied to them. I've lied to myself too, it's only the last 2-3 months I've started to realize this. I've told myself ""It will get better"" and that I'll make new friends sooner or later, but I've started to realize that this is not going to happen.

I've got about $20k in student loan, and I'm only halfway through my studies. But I'm afraid if I stay here even a month longer it's gonna develop into a depression.

I'm *not* having suicidal thoughts, but sometimes I think about how it wouldn't be too bad to die in an accident.

I've ordered a plane ticket home for the weekend, and I'm gonna tell my mother everything. Hopefully she'll understand and forgive me, but I'm sure she's gonna be dissapointed. She's been so proud to tell all her friends that I'm following her footsteps and becoming a nurse.

Maybe I hate my studies because I hate myself right now, and maybe I'll continue studying this when I get back home. But for now, I just wanna go home.

I just wanted to rant about this, and get some support. I have nobody else to share this with right now, and I needed to get it off my chest before I'm going home.

Even though I don't wish this on my worst enemy, it would be comforting to see if anybody else is or has been through the same thing.

Thanks for reading.

The city itself looks pretty expensive, and since I don't know anyone out there I'm looking at one bedroom places, or studios if I really can't find anything else. I've found a complex (EDIT: Princeton on Back Cove) that I'm thinking of contacting, it has decent safety ratings on trulia.

Is this a good time to be looking? Or is it too early? Most of the listings I'm finding are either currently available or opening up in the next couple weeks, so I'm thinking it's a little early. 

I have a car, so driving isn't an issue. although I'd like to be within a 15-20 minute drive of Portland itself. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. :) "
5pu7ui,7,2017-01-23,The Future of Pathology and the Role of Advanced AI and Automation,Raequan7,pathology,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathology/comments/5pu7ui/the_future_of_pathology_and_the_role_of_advanced/,"Hey Everyone. I'm an Intern seriously considering pathology right now. As a matter of fact, it's probably my top pick and that's what I tell most people when they ask me what I'd like to specialize in. However, I do have one concern about the profession moving forward and that's in regards to future prospects with the onset of very advanced AI and automation.

I recently read a Stanford study that read:

""Computers trounce pathologists in predicting lung cancer type, severity""

In it they detailed how:

""Automating the analysis of slides of lung cancer tissue samples increases the accuracy of tumor classification and patient prognoses, according to a new study.""

The link is here below:

http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2016/08/computers-trounce-pathologists-in-predicting-lung-cancer-severity.html

As a medical student and now intern I looked forward to decades in the field of pathology doing service, research and teaching but I'm worried that eventually the job may be taken over by robots and fully automated.

So far I've only done the rotation during my clinical years plus a 5-week stint in my university's associated Cancer Research Unit where I did research and didn't shadow the pathologist so I can't claim to have a vault of first-hand experience and therefore know my concerns may be unfounded

As pathologists out there in the field what's your opinion on this matter and the future of pathology?

Thanks for reading."

I have been thinking of writing in scratch, with bootstrap or with angular. Mainly I am thinking of angular because my dad really thinks I should learn it because many companies want that in programmers. I have searched around and found that some people think that it is not necessary and can be overkill or make it more diffcult/longer to make for static or smaller websites. 


I do want to learn angular, but I am not sure if I should do it while creating the website. If i'm pressed on time I guess I should create them together since it shows I know angular. I am leaning towards it now bc it could be a good learning experience and could prove to make my website unique and great. I do want to be applying to internships after my website ASAP so. What do you guys think? Thanks!!"

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

5pv7gr,0,2017-01-24,Difference in Personality (M 20) G(F 20),Enonater,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/5pv7gr/difference_in_personality_m_20_gf_20/,"My Girlfriend of 8 months and I have been having incompatibility issues nearly the entirety of our relationship, and in retrospect I have been aware of this nearly from the point of meeting her. The problem I am having is that she has a very set view of how she ""deserves"" to be treated in a relationship, and I do not share these same beliefs. Additionally, she new before we started dating, because I mentioned it time and again, that I am very oriented on my studies at University currently and will be taking every opportunity to explore internships as they come to me (and as it happens the majority are out of state in my field because of our geography). She seems to be looking for complete commitment from me, to the point that she expects this relationship to last the entirety of her lifetime, and I simply do not share that view, but am not able to bring it up to her without her exploding at me and throwing a fit ( which is something that happens often in this relationship). Additionally, recently she has been unemployed (for the past 5 months) and she continues to make excuses for why she can't find a job/ still lives at her aunt's house. 
 
 I like her, don't get me wrong, but I am having trouble seeing myself with someone who is so controlling over our relationship, and who does not share my ambition for life. She acts like she's been burned so often in the past that she doesn't even take the risk of making friends, and finds it unsettling some of the ""rumors"" shes heard about me from my past (which are all true and I find no shame in which upsets her more). 
   
I guess my question is, is it worth pursuing this relationship any further if i feel like she is limiting my potential and emotionally leashing me into her own depressing world? Or should I wait around hoping things might change?
  
Tl;Dr girlfriend is clingy and unambitious, I am independent and working on college, would you make it work?"
5pvydz,1,2017-01-24,[M4A] Sex &amp; Dry Cleaning &amp; Rock'n'Roll,MattNCL,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5pvydz/m4a_sex_dry_cleaning_rocknroll/,"The wild guitars and reckless lyrics of Eat Your Peach hummed quietly from the new CD player in the dash of my beaten up old car. It’s a song that should really be played at earth-shattering volume through a tower of amps and speakers, but I’d turned it down so as not to draw too much attention to myself. I checked my watch again. 2:26 AM. Was this guy even coming? He was already almost half an hour late. This wasn’t how I’d pictured my first job out of high school - sitting in the parking lot of a closed fast-food restaurant, waiting to buy… well, who knows what, although I’d assume it was some form of drugs. 2:27 AM. I cautiously turned up the music just a little and shut my eyes, just for a moment.



Cardinal Sin had been my favourite band since I was 13 and a huge part of my life over the last five years. Sure, their particular brand of swaggering, boastful, oversexed and underwritten rock'n'roll wasn’t exactly in-vogue these days, but I loved them. One of my first acts of masturbation was in the middle of the night to the raunchy video for On The Pole with the sound turned down. I’d taken my first girlfriend to see their Seduction tour. I even lost my virginity with their album Deep &amp; Slow playing in the background. Most people loved their singer, Johnny Kill, but I had always idolised their kick-ass guitarist, Atticus Filth, not only because he actually wrote most of the songs, but because of his well known accolade of ‘the biggest cock in rock’. As an awkward, shy, but very well endowed teenager, he was my hero and made me feel like less of a freak during those uncertain and embarrassed years.



When I got my internship at the record label I was thrilled. Despite lacking any musical ability of my own, all I’d ever wanted to do was work in the music industry. When I was told that Cardinal Sin were working on a new album and I was to help Atticus write it, I almost had a panic attack. I had imagined myself knocking back beers with my hero, giving notes on his lyrics as he experimented with the new material in the studio. The reality however, had been a little different.



Mostly, I was an errand boy. I’d pick up his leather pants from the dry cleaners, go out to buy him booze or cigarettes (which was often difficult without any ID), or search through shops to indulge his every childish impulse purchase on the record label’s credit card. Other nights, like this one, I’d spend my time hanging around in sketchy parts of town waiting to pay for and collect various ‘packages’. My musical hero turned out to be a spoiled man-child and addict who was happy for me to work 18 hour days but hadn’t learnt my name in six weeks. I hadn’t even got a glimpse of the inside of his studio either, having to settle for the occasional snatch of screeching guitar noise wafting down the halls of his tacky mansion. But the most demoralising revelation of all was the one that came from his wife;


“The biggest cock in rock and roll? Ha! It’s just a bunch of socks that he rolls up and stuffs down there love.”



She was the only thing that didn't disappoint though, and often the only thing that kept my motivated through the exhaustion and tedious tasks. Penelope Filth was undeniably stunning, even as she spoke in voice like a Dickensian cockney street urchin and sucked down cigarettes with a sexy scowl. I’d had a crush on her ever since she appeared in the video for Bad Confession, swinging around a pole on an alter in a skintight latex nun’s outfit. It was a ludicrous bit of male fantasy but having now met her, I wouldn’t be surprised if she picked the outfit herself. Her daily attire seemed to exclusively consist of low cut leather pants, showy bras beneath sheer tops, spiked heels and assorted sexy PVC items. Her dress code was all black, all rock and roll, all the time. In fact the only colour she seemed to allow for, beyond her shock of blonde hair that often dyed a different colour every week, was her bright red lipstick and nail polish. She’d been my point of contact most of the time, with Atticus locked away in his home studio, as she bossed me about with a temperamental attitude that made me a little nervous. But, god did she look great. Sometimes I couldn’t help but stare at her in awe. At first she barely seemed to notice me, drifting in and out of rooms to give me orders or mundane tasks, but slowly she began to actually talk with me, clearly bored senseless with her husband locked away writing and recording day or night.


“I might as well not exist whenever he’s working on a new album” she’d once told me in that fantastically blunt and brutally honest way of hers, “Even I’m not allowed in the studio. He says I’d be too much of a distraction from his muse, but I think he just doesn’t want anyone to realise that his songs sound shit without the rest of the band”.



And so it was her that I thought about as I shut my eyes and waited in that dimly lit parking lot for some unpunctual night-owl dealer. I had thought that I was going to be living the dream, but it turns out that rock and roll isn’t that fun unless you’re the rockstar. Little did I know that later that night she’d give me an opportunity to know what feels like to be Atticus Finch. Even if I couldn’t ever stand on a stage and shout the chorus of Ten Ton Tongue to a sea of screaming fans, at least I would get a taste of what it felt like to be the real ‘biggest cock in rock’."

Prior to him moving in he had a full time job and played games after work so we could keep in touch. He moved in and did nothing for about 3 months and now school has started. He shows no interest in getting a job or internship. He wants to attend school and play games.


**Anger issues:**
When he games he is extremely angry. He games 4-6+ hours a day. We discussed it and he said he would work on it after the first time I said it was a deal breaker because he would yell and get red faced at a game, telling people to die. We talk to each other while I'm at work and last week he started going off again while playing his game. Full sentences of slurs, yelling, telling people to go hang themselves. Yelling at a computer screen while I was on the other end of the line in the office just looking dumbfounded at my phone. He gets BAD when he plays games. It caused a large argument this past weekend where I pointed out that he relapsed with his anger issues. He apologizes after and says he is working on it. Gaming continues. I told him I can't take it and he asked ""why can't you accept me for who I am?"". I've told him I don't like it and I don't want to live with it I'm not sure what else I can say. 


I suggested getting a job or internship to get out of the house and he wasn't okay with that. I suggested hobbies and he says it's too cold to golf and his bowling ball cracked 3 weeks ago so he can't bowl. There's more to do out there so I just hear more excuses. When we have these conversations he acts like I am attacking him instead of trying to help. Twists everything I say into saying that he isn't good enough. It hurts and it's frustrating. If I thought he wasn't good enough I wouldn't be trying to help him and our relationship.


He started to go off on me one day after binge gaming and I stopped him to ask why he is so worked up and he actually responded with ""I don't know"" and got quiet. Another time he started going off while he was playing and I had to hang up because he snapped at me later claiming because he was frustrated at the game. 


**Bedroom Issues**
I brought this up to him about two months ago. I was always initiating and after some time I felt unwanted because he didn't try. Later he told me he did try and claimed touching my shoulder or asking if I was on my period was trying. I explained he may need to be more direct like kissing me or touching me intimately. Well, nothing changed so I gave up. I stopped trying at all so he finally noticed because he said he was starting to feel like I did before. So now he is initiating, but his sex drive is a lot lower than mine and I'm not sure that will change.


I feel like i'm being very critical because my past few relationships ended poorly. Various reasons; cheating, mooching, etc. So now i'm paying attention to red flags and I see a ton with this guy, but I am worried I may be turning everything into a red flag. I just find it hard to be attracted to someone who does nothing but game and yell at a computer screen.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend has recurring anger issues and problems in the bedroom. We have been dating 8 months and he moved in, but I'm doubting the relationship. I feel I am being too critical because of past relationships, but some things are red flags. How should I approach it?"

Any suggestions on improvements?,mdh0025,bigseo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigseo/comments/5pxxs6/heres_how_i_structured_my_seo_audit_template_any/,"I'm currently working on developing an SEO Audit Template and maybe I'm trying to encompass too many aspects. The end goal is to set it up on Google Sheets for clients to track progress and understand exactly what I'm doing, while also showing someone (let's say an SEO intern) on how to conduct an SEO Audit.

Here's how I have it laid out by column:

- Ranking Factor (I.E. Site Speed, Crawl Errors, Structured Data, etc.)
- Priority (numbered from most to least important)
- Urgency (1 out of 5)
- Difficulty (1 out of 5)
- Time (prospective time in hours to complete)
- Status (Stories, Removed from Queue, In-Progress, etc.)
- Status Updates (SEO intern comments on the progress being made)
- Check List (Everything the SEO intern needs to check for)
- Why It Matters (Breif explanation to the client and/or SEO intern on why the Ranking Factor needs to be cared for)
- Procedure Notes / Additional Tips (telling the SEO intern where to look)
- And then 10 extra columns dedicated to listing out important videos, articles and tools to use for understanding and/or analysing the ranking factor.

I'm currently going through articles that list out the ranking factors like the one Brian Dean posted, making notes of it, and then expanding upon the content by doing further research.

Any advice on how to turn this into the best SEO Audit Template out there is much appreciated."

How do I get everything done within a 40 hr week? The partner won't let me work overtime? So I eat my hours.

The associate doesn't seem to have a lot on her list. I have more to do than she does and she leaves earlier than I do. I know it is busy season. Is it usual to give this amount of work to an intern?

5pyh6v,13,2017-01-24,"My [21/M] girlfriend [20/F] says she wants to break up if she gets her dream internship this summer, but wants to stay together if she doesn't.",pprppr,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5pyh6v/my_21m_girlfriend_20f_says_she_wants_to_break_up/,"Hey everyone. My gf and I have been together for 2 years, going to the same university but in different programs. We are both juniors, and she's been applying to internships left and right for this summer. I plan on doing research at my uni for the summer (related to my major). She recently got called back for the final round for a company that is her ""dream"" company, and I was super excited and happy for her. If she doesn't get this internship, her other option would be to stay on campus with me and work with professors.

I don't want to give much away but we both go to school in the Midwest, and her internship would be in beautiful San Francisco. She would get paid decently and get free housing with other interns, and get to work at the company HQ which looks amazing from pictures. I can see why this would be the dream internship for her. 

Yesterday, we were hanging out and I told her how proud I was for how far she's come in the interviewing process. She looked at me and took a deep breath and then told me that if she did end up getting the internship, she would break up with me. I was floored. I asked if it was the distance (the internship would be 10 weeks - we've been away for 6-7 weeks at a time and we managed it). She said no. She said that she would just be in a new environment with new people, working an internship at a really busy and cool company, and she wanted to see if there were other guys at the company she could see herself with. I honestly didn't know what to say because to me it sounded like she was breaking up with me, so I asked her (believe me I wanted to cry) if she wanted to end it. 

She looked confused and said ""no of course not, this is only if I DO get the internship. If I don't, why would I want to break up?"" I then asked her if she meant a real breakup or a ""break"" and she said ""well if I don't meet anyone I see a future with, we can get back together when I come back."" (paraphrased) I was so confused because she said she still loves me more than ever, and that she sees a future with me but just wanted to have a ""full experience"" at her internship this summer. She wasn't breaking up with me or saying she doesn't like me anymore, but at the same time I can't help but feel hurt by what she said. 

It's like I'm her second choice?? She is such a beautiful, kind, funny, and intelligent girl and never showed signs of cheating or lying. If anything, she's the one who is always critical of who I'm talking to/what I'm doing because she has this irrational fear I'll cheat on her (I won't, and I have never..)

I left her place last night after the conversation and she has acted 100% normal about it, as if we were discussing dinner date plans. I am really bad at understanding what girls mean sometime and I really don't know if I'm being oversensitive. I haven't talked to my guy friends about this because she asked me not to mention her final interview to anyone in case I ""jinx"" it. I don't know if I can trust her fully if she doesn't get the internship and we ""stay together."" Please help me reddit.

**tl;dr: girlfriend has her final round interview for her dream internship in 2 days. She told me last night that if she does get it, we would break up beacuse she wanted to date around with all the guys at the internship. I asked if she was breaking up with me or if she hated me, and she said ""ofc not! We are only breaking up if I don't get the internship, otherwise why would I break up?"" I feel hurt and don't know what to do.**"

5pyzc4,37,2017-01-24,15 Ways the Movies COULD Connect to TV,NeptuneCA,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/5pyzc4/15_ways_the_movies_could_connect_to_tv/,"We all know the reasons why they haven't. And we all have our opinions on whether they should or shouldn't. This isn't about that. I wanted to see how many ways I could come up with for the movies to reference the tv shows without having title characters appear or mentioning specific events.

1. **New York Bulletin**
PRO: Very easy. They need set dressing anyway; why not use something they already have graphics for?
CON: This would probably only show up in a Spider-Man movie, in which case they'd probably use the Daily Bugle instead.

2. **Mentioning the Kingpin**
PRO: connects the Kingpin back to Spider-Man and provides a larger look at the crime dynamic in New York
CON: arguably a waste of time if they don't plan to do anything with it, especially since they could mention Silvermane or Hammerhead instead and actually follow up on it.

3. **Phil Urich**
PRO: An intern or fresh reporter at the Bugle living in the shadow of an uncle who died for the job would be a compelling supporting character.
CON: ...if they mention it. If they don't, he's basically as good as no connection at all.

4. **TrishTalk**
PRO: A pro-superhero news voice would provide an interesting contrast to the Daily Bugle, or they could just have ads for the show as set dressing.
CON: Actually using the show would require Rachael Taylor, which would lock her in to surviving to a certain point.

5. **Patsy Walker**
PRO: easy to print a comic or poster or mention in passing
CON: no real reason to do so

6. **Judas bullets**
PRO: powerful weapon that doesn't need explanation
CON: potentially dilutes the supposed rarity of them

7. **Seagate Prison**
PRO: bad guys go to and from prisons all the time
CON: location of prison may make it unrealistic to use

8. **General Talbot**
PRO: major Hulk character; able to fill any generic military role
CON: limits what *Agents of SHIELD* can do with him

9. **Man-Thing**
PRO: could be used in a headline or supporting role; details from the show are limited so there's little to contradict
CON: not many places to use him outside of his own movie, which is unlikely to be made (although he could appear in a *Doctor Strange* sequel)

10. **Dogs of Hell Motorcycle Club**
PRO: all it takes is a costuming choice
CON: I don't see much use for a motorcycle gang in the movies

11. **Rand Corporation**
PRO: provides set dressing; it'd be nice for companies besides Stark and Roxxon to show up in the movies
CON: For all we know, Rand could be defunct by the end of *Iron Fist*

12. **Heavenly Cities**
PRO: could be a nice throwaway reference in a *Doctor Strange* sequel
CON: doesn't add much

13. **Mentioning Jarvis**
PRO: all it takes is a mention or a picture, but could be as much as a flashback; could provide a humanizing moment for Tony
CON: there may not be a place for it

14. **Older Daniel Sousa**
PRO: it'd be interesting to see what became of other SSR members; could be used in any generic government role
CON: since it'd probably be a new actor, the impact might not be the same

15. **Have Enver Gjokaj’s cop return as Sgt. Sousa**
PRO: calls back to The Avengers as well as Agent Carter; solves a casting issue; confirms a fan theory; could provide a neat supporting character for Spider-Man (pro-superhero cop)
CON: I don't see any cons; they should definitely do this."

Long time reader, first time complainer.

Me and you, we go way back. I remember sitting in my one bedroom apartment checking your site daily for updates on the rapist-in-chief President Clinton's ongoing little problem with a certain intern.

I remember the day that we broke the Internet when the Starr Report came out. All of us early Internet adopters overloaded servers trying to get our hands on it. It occurred to me then, I'm reading this report the same time the accused President was. Maybe this Internet thing was really going to stick around for a while.

Over the years, I've gotten older, news has changed but your site never has. My daily source of aggregated headlines that keep me informed. I'm some of your billion clicks.

Matt, (I feel I can call you Matt because of the years we've been together) things have changed. 2016 saw a rogue candidate flip a middle finger to the established press. Instead of admitting their bias, they doubled down. We know who the are (NY TIMES, WaPo, CNN...) 

I refuse...REFUSE to send on of my valuable clicks to their sites. Never again will I allow an advertiser on CNN to count my visit and believe they have made a smart investment getting in bed with the devil.

Here, Matt, is where we have a problem. I'm finding myself visiting your site less because I can't tell from my smart device where my click will go.

What I ask of you is simple. When you are linking the a site like New York Times, please title it as follows: NYT:.

If I visit your site and see the title ""NYT: Reports suggest Trump to abolish babies"" I will know to avoid this link. I'm afraid that without this change, I can't come back.

From one old friend to another, please don't enrich the enemy."

Dev Spectating mode, to spot cheaters (manual detection)?

    000000001D0E.07C: BETA -
    000000001D1E.07C: Custom Game (DEV ONLY) // did someone already bypass that?
This is quite interesting. This is apparently in the main menu (where you select Quick Play / Competetive / Arcade...) and there will be a special option if you have such an ""dev"" account? So you can modify the game?

    0000000018E2.07C: Beta Notification
    0000000018E3.07C: PRESS &lt;tx0C000000000044AF&gt; TO CONTINUE
    0000000018E4.07C: Overwatch is beta, pre-release software.
So you can start a few beta features when logging in with a special ""dev"" account? Maybe old HUD (which i love :P)?

    00000000230F.07C: Beta Build
This is after 0000000022D8 and 0000000022D9 which are the login strings for XBOX / PS4

    0000000045E8.07C: Beta Build
And finally this is before 0000000045FC which says ""Toggle Guardian Angel""... Maybe an ingame HUD displaying ""Beta Build""?

So is it possible to get ""beta"" / Blizzard intern Builds onto our computers?
could maybe be exploited with an memory hack... I know that you could modify the Memory with Cheat Engine back in the closed beta, maybe you could still do it?

That would be so funny if someone had ""God Mode"" in an live game and you could just make a fun out of it (closing server, changing map, ...) xD

What do you think?"

I just started an internship through my college and had a couple of questions. Our group has a general goal of collecting data about user's browsing habits and we are looking for a couple of different options before we pick one to develop. The current idea is to create extensions/add-on's for all the popular browsers and then have the user's sign in so that we can send the data generated back to a single back-end system. For right now we are focused just on the desktop environment but eventually we would like to try to develop something in the mobile sphere of things, sadly only Firefox has mobile add-on support. The data we are looking to collect is stuff like:

 * Individual Page URL's
 * User's Actions (What is possible here? i.e. clicks, selections, mouse movements)
 * Site Content and Page Content (What website is it/What is on the page)
 * Time Spent on Individual Site/Page
 * Which page is gone to (Could we generate a map of the different pages visited?)

Another idea that was floated was a standalone application on both Windows and Mac that would collect this data without browser integration but I have no idea how practical that is. What are some technologies we could use to generate and collect this data? I just have a background with front-end web development through school so how would I go about learning what it takes to set up a back-end system that would universally accept the data we want to collect from all the different systems our users would use? Thanks for any time or consideration."

I'm in kind of a pinch - I'm asthmatic, and my last rescue inhaler is nearly out (my fault, I have been using it more often than usual this month and wasn't bright enough to check the doses until two days ago). 

I only recently moved back to Gainesville after an internship, and only ever saw the school doctor, so I don't yet have a primary care doctor here. I called every doctor that is covered by my insurance, but could not find an open appointment until next week Friday at the earliest. Obviously at that point, I will be able to get a prescription filled, but until then I am kind of fucked.

I know that I could go to an urgent care center, but I am a recently cut-off college grad and that would absolutely kill my bank account. Does anyone know if there is a free clinic or something like that in Gainesville that I could go to? Or does anyone have an albuterol inhaler they aren't using? I have money, but I don't have money for an ER bill. I really suffer without it, and watching the doses tick down is starting to be scary. I figure I've got about 2-3 days left at this point.

I know it's unlikely - I'm just taking a shot in the dark to see if anyone can help out. Thanks, guys."

    - Plato 

Bob was born in a small quiet town called Middleton, Illinois. Bob's parents were right wing conservatives and raised Bob to be a good, humble Christian. Bob was vice president of Central High's student body government. He was shortstop of his baseball team, who ranked no. two in the county. Bob was well to do and extremely stable; if stable could be extreme. Bob felt secure; he knew everyone in his small town, and he'd been to every store and has had the same group of friends since he could remember. But Bob was bored. Bob was bored of his friends, of his town, the stores, people and most of all his life. 
When Bob was nine years old, he visited the city of Chicago, where he saw the tall buildings, bridges and people. The memory of that place: the sparkling lights, the grand hotel room with a standing shower and four star restaurant on the lobby floor, stayed with Bobby. In his Junior Year at Central High School, Bob applied to three Universities. All of them were out of state and in very big cities: NYU in New York, UCSD in San Diego, USC in Los Angeles and Miami State in Florida. He decided he wanted to try Los Angeles. A year later, he was on a nonstop flight to the city of LA with a couple hundred bucks in his wallet, and a father for a lawyer and a mother who taught English at the local community college, feeding his bank account. 

Richard was born at the USC Medical Hospital, just about a couple and a half months after Bob, in Los Angeles, California. Richard lived in a small suburban area in LA called Granview. Granview was a drug and gang infested neighborhood that was almost daily reported by shootings or robberies on the local news channel. Rick joined a notorious gang, the Granview Crazy Mob when he was just twelve years old. He grew up wanting to be the baddest, richest gangster on the block. He got locked up at the Los Angeles Juvenile Detention Center for grand theft auto just a couple years later. He was sentenced to a year and a half and got out a year later with a GED and good behavior. Thinking ahead was not his forte. When he got out, he had only two choices; go back to his gang or get a job. 

It was the summer of 2020, Bob had just finished his first year at USC. He had good grades and was super confident that this summer would be one of the best he's ever had. Bobby had joined the fraternity Lambda Beta Epsilon where he successfully become a pledged member. He applied and been admitted to his first internship at the Angelina Biology Lab Center. Bob had a lot to look forward to near the end of his first year at the University. 

It was early mid-July when Bob's parents received the horrifying news. Bob had been in a car accident. He was walking home one night after a party at the Lambda house when he was hit in a car accident by someone who obviously didn't give a f*ck and ran off. Bob's parents were on the first flight back to be by his side at the nearby USC Medical Center. 

Rick tried the job thing. He pushed carts at the parking lot of the local Roll-Mart. He was getting paid fifteen bucks an hour while working twenty hours a week. The rest of his time he was either getting high or playing video games or both. He was getting fed up. He was fed up with the way people talked to him at the Roll-Mart, he was fed up with the way people kept leaving their carts in the middle of the driving lane every two minutes and he was fed up with the way his boss paid him when he felt like it. One day, Rick was picking up some weed from a friend when they got a call. Supposedly, a group of them had beef with a rival gang from a neighboring block. It had started with a girlfriend of one of the gang members and had escalated into a fight where someone got stabbed. They were looking for retaliation. Rick decided to roll with his old crew. He apparently didn't know that the other gang was going to roll by that night with a fully automatic weapon and open fire. They were lucky that nobody got hit, except Rick. Rick had been hit twice; once in the shoulder and another in the chest. His friends tried to rush him to the hospital when unfortunately, the driver couldn't pay enough attention to the road. 

The light turned a blurry hazy green, maybe a bit blue, he wasn't sure, and he took a couple steps off the curb and into the street. Bob had had a few too many when he decided to walk back to his apartment just a couple blocks away. That's when the black '99 Ford Impala plowed straight into him. Bob was lucky it was a busy street because if someone hadn't called the ambulance just a few minutes earlier, he probably wouldn't have made it. 

Rick and Bob both ended up at the USC Medical Emergency Room. Though both had come from different walks of life, right now, none of that mattered. Rick and Bob looked at each other in wonder, as they stood in line. Then they both looked around. Everything was white but it was also red. It felt strangely comforting but at the same time terrifying. They both stood there, not knowing, wondering and contemplating. It did not come into their heads to look straight in front or to look back. Neither did it occur to them to ask any of the other people waiting in the line. Rick and Bob just continued to stare into each others eyes as if in a daze, then everything turned black. Rick and Bob did not know but their lives would never be the same again. 

Doctor Patterson in the emergency room had used the defibrillator to revive Rick while at the same time Doctor Hanish had also been using the same electrical shock to revive Bob. Amazingly, like an act of God, the electricity for the entire region had gone into a rolling black-out. Fortunately for Rick and Bob and everybody else in the hospital, the hospital's back-up electrical battery fired up right in time. Unfortunately, for Rick and Bob and nobody else in the hospital, their souls, which had been in a purgatory-like transcendental state, had crossed paths through the electrical current that ran through and cut off at exactly the precise moment the power blacked out. This had created a dilemma, one that nobody on earth could comprehend, that nobody in their right mind would believe. Rick and Bob's souls had been revived into their bodies at exactly the same moment through exactly the same current of energy but crossing each other at opposite electrodes to occupy each others' bodies.

5q3e7c,3,2017-01-25,Legality of university 'internship' in return for free MSc,unithrowaway90,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/5q3e7c/legality_of_university_internship_in_return_for/,"Hi, 

I'm in desperate need of any legal advice you can give to me regarding a university 'internship' advertised as a scholarship / bursary to work for 400 hours in return for the masters fees to be paid.

I have been working this 'internship' and have so far done approximately one third of the hours with great difficulty. At the beginning I made them aware of some medical conditions affecting certain roles I can do within the organisation which they have disregarded, setting me tasks I cannot complete, and as a result i'm strongly considering withdrawing but i'm worried about the financial implications.

My question really: Is this allowed to be advertised as an internship? Because we have set roles and are not doing any shadowing or anything of the such, really it is work, and should therefore be paid? Or can they advertise it as such as make 'payment' by offering the MSc in return for the work undertaken?

Since I have no working rights as an intern, I get no holiday or sickness leave, and since i'm subject to discrimination in the workplace I have no comeback?

Ideally I don't want to withdraw from the program, I just want a job role which takes into account my health difficulties and could do with some advice about how to approach the university?

Thanks"
5q3jng,55,2017-01-25,"I visited brooklyn recently, and living in Arkansas now seems so horrible in comparison. But I can't leave because I just got married.",Metronomy515,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5q3jng/i_visited_brooklyn_recently_and_living_in/,"I used to be a rural girl, hating on city people and thinking they were all snobby pricks. I could not understand why ANYONE would want to live in a major city, it was incomprehensible. 

4 months ago, I got invited to stay at my friends place in Brooklyn for 20 days. Asked my husband (married 9 months ago) and he said I could go without him but he cant because of his job. 

So I went by myself. I cant even describe how amazing it was. I have NEVER BEEN TO A PLACE LIKE THIS. I kind of assumed everyone in NYC was rich hipster liberals but this just was the opposite of the truth, people REALLY struggle here. We went from a Russian/Ukrainian neighborhood, to a jamaican/haitian neighborhood, to an orthodox jewish neighborhood, to a chinese neighborhood all in about 3 hours of walking around! It seemed like every neighborhood had such a distinct feeling to it, all the ethnic enclaves and everything was just so amazing. 

We went to warehouse parties in Bushwick, we hung out at a punk show, we went to a rave, we went to a place called Barcade, we got halal food, we took the subway everywhere instead of driving. We saw people hanging out on the streets and the stoops, we saw kids playing soccer in the street, we saw broken fire hydrants and kids playing under them. the streets felt alive. In Arkansas, NOBODY IS OUTSIDE, everyone is either in their car or at work or in their homes, there is zero street culture. In Brooklyn, just walking around a few blocks meant a plethora of interesting people and stuff to see. 

Every night was something new. Whether it was a dominican block party, or a cool underground club, or some weird warehouse venue, or even just hanging out on the streets and passing by people you knew. It felt magical, it felt like how I wanted to live in my life. The different cultures, ethnicities, the blasting booming music on street corners, the smell of pot (which i tried for the first time), the feeling of semi-lawlessness, the fact that you can just hang out on your stoop and have people hang out with you walking by, there is a warmth and excitement to it that i never really knew. 

And people here really work hard too! I stereotyped people living in cities as sort of lazy and working as social media interns and not having 'real' jobs but the people here work hard as hell! Way, way more than people back home. There are hipsters here, theres no doubt about that, but they seem immensely outnumbered by the working poor immigrants here who make up most of brooklyn. We went to williamsburg, and I quickly discovered why people dont like williamsburg in the rest of brooklyn, because it is what people from outside of Brooklyn think of brooklyn. 

Every stereotype that I had about this city has been flipped on its head honestly. I feel like all of the things I learned living in arkansas about this city, that people who live in cities are pretentious and lazy and dont work hard, and that they are all rich and dont talk to each other, and they dont go outside, blah blah blah.... i find these things more true about my old hometown. 

So I went back to my old hometown after. I went back to my husband, I went back to my parents and grandparents and neighbors. I cant even describe how depressed I am now. This place... it is not a real community. I feel like I have experienced what the city life has to offer and now i want more, i  want to go back. I feel TRAPPED here like never before. We went to the local bar/restaurant and we just sat there and talked... and i swear to god it felt like the energy was being drained out of me. They... talked about crops, and the new neighbor and what the neighbors kids was wearing, and how the school got a new paint job... I felt angst, I feel like this is not somewhere I want to be all of the sudden. The people here are so just lazy and fat and bigoted and just uncultured and ignorant!! God I sound exactly like a city person, which i would have hated a year ago, but my god its fucking true! These people are not living any form of a real life! This is so sad. 

I will never forget my time in NYC and the sheer contrast it had to my life in arkansas. The feeling of true socialization and community fun, the crazy block parties, the feeling that you could just roam brooklyn and see fun and interesting stuff, the different cultures, the vibe... everything. It is the superior way of life. I cannot see the positives to living in Arkansas unless your retired or something. Yet people here DESPISE city culture and see it in this horrible light. I am married now to my wonderful husband, we plan on having children after I turn 25 in 4 months, and so I likely wont ever leave. But holy shit, I will never erase those beautiful memories. "

We're a class in high school that works as a business repairing Chromebooks and learning business/tech related skills. The class is called Tech Service Internship but it is more commonly called TSI. One of our students decided to redesign our logo and this is what he came up with. Any constructive criticism is welcome. Keep in mind this logo will be used around the school on the website and on flyers.

He'll bully anyone for a lot of things- calls our receptionist a ""faggot"" behind closed doors, will talk shit about random people living life happily in a way he doesn't see fit (will even go as far as to say shit like, ""this guy looks like a dumbass. Then next time I see him, I'm going to slap him""). Talks about all the people he's had jumped by his friends in the day off of his command.

&amp;nbsp;

Every time I do something to better myself, he'll shoot it down. I start studying a lot, he calls me a loser. I work out, and he'll call my body terrible. He'll make fun of me for even the choice of foods I bring saying they're not even tasty. Stupid shit like that. No one has ever challenged this guy. 

&amp;nbsp;

We both speak Spanish and our coworker doesn't, and he'll talk shit about him in Spanish to me in front of his face. Anyway...

&amp;nbsp;

We're both working this crappy job to get by while we're both applying to postgraduate schools that will give us careers around $150K+/year. I've gotten in and he hasn't. He hasn't had many interviews for these programs because ironically when I tell him about the things he needed to do (internships, XYZ classes, etc.), he always said I was doing too much and that I needed to shut up.

&amp;nbsp;

Randomly he said something that irked me, and I was like, ""Alright bro. Good thing I'll be gone and you'll be in this hellhole again, so talk to the walls next year""...and he got *really* *really* **really** mad. He punched a wall, kicked a desk, and walked out. I immediately regret what I said, because I know he's not super competitive and this is like his 3rd year trying to get into this new career. Surprisingly he didn't hit me. Now he's ignoring me. 

&amp;nbsp;

3 days later, I apologized, but he said he knew based on my language that I'm an evil person at heart lol. I feel kinda bad for bullying a bully, should I? "
5q6mtl,29,2017-01-25,Sex Offender Tapping on My Window,hanasays,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/5q6mtl/sex_offender_tapping_on_my_window/,"(So, I just made a reddit today to tell this story, pls let me know if there’s any formatting errors.) I’m a senior in college. I have one roommate, who’s in her first year of a social work master’s program. We’ve been good friends since my freshman year, and this year decided to rent a small house together for a change of scenery (my first year living off campus). 


Our university is in kind of a shitty city, but it's small. The main problem is the layout—one street you’re in perfectly safe, middle-class family territory, but one wrong turn and you’re on gang turf. There’s not a lot of room to get lost safely. My roommate and I don’t live in the worst area, but I will say there’s a reason our rent is cheap and why our landlords installed super-bright motion detector lights all around our house. We’ve been super strict about keeping everything locked up, keeping valuables out of sight of windows, trying to keep the fact that we’re a couple of early-20s females living alone on the DL, and besides one small incident the first month we were there, nothing had happened and we generally felt pretty secure last semester. 


Class doesn’t start until the 30th, but I headed back this past Saturday. Roommate has also been back for a couple weeks because of her internship. This happened the night I got back, around 11:00 pm. I was just hanging in the living room, watching movies. I had bought wine and I just turned 21 before New Year’s so this was very exciting to me and I was feeling like a real adult. My roommate was sleeping over at her boyfriend’s. I started hearing this tapping noise on the window by our front door. For a little while I just ignored it, pretty sure it was just my imagination (I still get a little freaked out being home alone at night). The blinds were down so I couldn’t see anything but I was sure the motion lights would come on if someone was out there, and they weren’t so I was sure it was fine. 


As time passes by, however, I realize that no, that’s definitely tapping, and it’s moving from one window to the next, progressively getting closer to where I’m sitting. I muted the TV to listen better, and as soon as I did the tapping paused and then came back louder and much faster.  At this point I'm frozen, totally freaked out, but when the tapping moved to the window right next to my head, I grabbed my phone and slid off the couch, crawled into the kitchen where we have a glass sliding door, and peered out. It was hard to make out but thankfully the kitchen lights were off which made it a little easier to see outside (and I hope more difficult for me to be seen), and the lights coming through the living room windows combined with some light from the street lamps, just barely allowed me to see a man crouched in our garden, face pressed against the glass—and I mean smushed right up against it. He had one hand stretched way up above his head (which looked really awkward) and was tapping with a couple of fingers. 


I was just like…fuck. I think he was trying different windows because he couldn’t see inside well and didn’t know where I was sitting, except that the living room was the only room in the house with lights on. Or at least that’s what I was hoping when I crawled out of the living room, down the hall, and into my bedroom. I locked the door but kept the lights off (if he really didn’t know what part of the house I was in, I didn’t want him to figure it out) and called the police. They asked if he was actively trying to break in the house and I said no, and they said they would send someone over as quickly as possible. I was really hoping the officer would stay on the line, but they just gave me instructions to call again if things escalated and to hold tight. 


Fifteen minutes later, still no police. I wasn't sure if he was out there but I wasn't trying to find out on my own. I had been trying to call my roommate but she wasn’t answering her phone and I didn’t know who else to call. Eventually I decided to call my ex-boyfriend (we had broken up amicably right before winter break) because he had been my go-to person for the last two years and I couldn’t think of anyone else. He’s a good dude and still came over since he lives only a few minutes away. 


Around ten minutes after I called him I could tell he was there because I could hear shouting and then running. Another five minutes or so and he calls and says he’s out front and to let him in. Ex told me there was a dude with a small bag at the kitchen door, peering in and trying to force the door open. He yelled and the guy dropped the bag and started running. My ex chased him a little bit until they got to this one shitty road towards the back of my neighborhood, then he headed back. Motion lights didn’t come on this whole time. 


A few minutes later the cops came. It was only a little over a half an hour since I'd called them but it felt like so much longer. Cops searched the area, didn’t find anyone. The only thing that was in the bag was lube and a box of condoms, which makes me want to die if I think about it too hard. I didn’t have a solid description of him, having not him well, and neither did my ex. The cops said they would keep someone outside and my ex spent the night in the living room to keep an eye on me. My roommate finally called me back at like 7am going ‘what the hell happened?’ Her boyfriend has also spent the night every night since.


Honestly idk if I was just shocked or processing but the next couple days I was just kind of ‘eh’ about the whole thing, even though I knew the guy was still out there. My roommate called our landlords up and bitched at them about the lights not working. I went to my work and told my coworker about it and he was like ‘you should put it on reddit.’ But then yesterday my roommate called me as soon as she got out of her internship, freaking out, and told me she had something to tell me.


 So her internship with the social work program has her working with and occasionally leading a group of court-ordered drug addicts, which includes some sex offenders.  She told me that while she was leading group she was just not getting along with one of the members (one of the sex offenders) who was being very contrary and just acting annoyed with what she was saying. And towards the end he said something along the lines of ‘your roommate’s cute, you can tell her I like Asian girls’ (I’m Korean) and that we need to fix our front porch light (it’s out). I’m pretty sure that he didn’t have an opportunity to see my face that night so I don’t know how many times he’s been here.


 She reported him, her supervisors got in contact with the police, and he confessed easily. I guess he probably followed my roommate home one night which is terrifying to me and I’m glad he never tried to do anything to her. And he also must have known that she would report him after he said those things to her so I don’t understand his thinking there at all. It’s just today that I’m starting to feel really freaked out about the whole thing and I will probably not be spending the night alone here for a while.

5q6tux,6,2017-01-25,Bell Let's talk...I am going to try talking..,wtfman1988,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5q6tux/bell_lets_talki_am_going_to_try_talking/,"Let’s talk...

It’s a weird thing typing this out...everyone is super supportive today in regards to mental health and I just don’t know how to put “pen to paper”, I am hardly a writer. I don’t recall exactly when I became aware that I wasn’t feeling 100% right or realized that I have depression...and anxiety, it’s been over a decade at least. I’ll generally try to keep the details of my life somewhat vague. While some people know I have been dealing with depression and anxiety, no one really knows how deep it goes. It’s a lot easier to get this kind of stuff off my chest  anonymously with a whole group of non-judgemental strangers heh.

I grew up in a small town, teased a bit more when I was younger...grew up went to high school, never quite popular...wouldn’t say I was unpopular though either. I was mostly teased for having a few extra pounds, and to this day I am a bit self conscious about my weight. College was much better socially for me, I partied a lot more, made friends easier, and people were out of that bullying/teasing phase. At heart I was still an introvert who was more comfortable to catch a hockey game on the tv, play a video game, read a book, but I wanted to push myself to be outgoing, and it was fun. I still struggled with depression and anxiety though through no fault of those social experiences in college.  

I had taken a year off between high school and college to figure things out. My parents definitely gave me a push forward in that regard, they told me “go to college, get a career” – very true likely in their day, but the world has changed so much, I hold no resentment at all, they wanted what was best for me. I ended up basically throwing a dart at the wall and landed on marketing. College was frustrating regardless of social improvements. There were times I would be super down on myself for no reason. Stress and anxiety with school could often times get the best of me, there were a few times when it got bad that I did consider ending it all. I ultimately couldn’t go through with it for a couple of reasons. 1. I couldn’t do that to my parents. I absolutely love them with all of my heart and I couldn’t do anything to intentionally hurt them in any way. 2. I am actually terrified of death. Maybe it would be easy if I knew there were something on the other side? Scary philosophical conversation. 

As it turns it out upon graduation from college I found out marketing wasn’t exactly a hot field to get into. You intern for free, do door to door sales, or you magically have 10 years experience and become a marketing manager. I had aspirations of heading to university afterwards but missed the deadline to apply. I ultimately worked in a call centre for 5-6 months to pass the time between when I graduated and when I could apply next for university. I made a lot of friends at the call centre and consider a few of them my best friends.  

I ended up having to university only to find that it wasn’t much different then college except the learning style wasn’t for me and they generally try to fuck you left right and centre with extra courses that do not have much bearing on your major. Everything is incredibly expensive. I ultimately dropped out after 4 months because I did not think it was for me despite actually having some decent grades. 

I ended up getting into another call centre and rose through the ranks. It’s a pretty dysfunctional work environment, i’ve seen hundreds and hundreds of people leave. Some deserving, some not. I still astonish myself that I am still somehow working there. A lot of people are surprised I work where I work and do what I do, and that is not to put myself up on a pedestal. They say I should try to apply for this and that but my managerial experience is still limited and to be honest, my self esteem is incredibly low.

I also feel incredibly trapped with my job. I don’t want to make my life sound like it’s horrible. Not the case at all. I have a small but amazing circle of friends that I am blessed to have. I have a fiancé that I am fortunate to have, and a mostly awesome family (who doesn’t have drama in the family tree?). Trapped though, I definitely feel trapped. I worked hard for years and saved and was able to buy a condo with my fiancé. We’re mostly okay for finances each month, saving for a wedding at the same time is tough, and there is that worry if I lose my job we can’t afford the place or i’d need a job in a similar pay grade to make things work. 
The struggle there is even if I got into another role, I am not sure how passionate I really am about the call centre industry. I mean if you asked me my dream job it would probably be “NHL general manager” but I didn’t go to law school or play pro hockey in my earlier life. Likely too late for me in life to go back to school to do any law or courses to get myself into either industry.  Other passions? Gaming and animals. I always thought if I won the lottery i’d likely volunteer at an animal shelter and/or make some donations to help try to make a positive difference. 

What does help a lot is loving family, friends, and my fiancé. The Bell Let’s Talk initiative is nice and I never thought i’d actually type something out like this. You hear about people battling mental health and getting better, and I just hope there is that light at the end of the tunnel that doesn’t involve “the end” but actually getting up each day, feeling great, and going out there into the world to do something you love. I don’t want to come off as whiny or hard done by. I am probably better off than most in this world and there is guilt in that they I feel like I don’t appreciate the little things I have as much as I should. 

So while I don’t know if anything is ultimately changing any time soon for myself, the Bell Let’s Talk initiative does put a smile on my face, because you can see people care. Maybe some day i’ll talk about it a bit more openly not on the internet.

Thanks for the read.

5q6vj8,2,2017-01-25,*** Mitgliederrundbrief zum Thema Björn Höcke ***,Alternativer,Die_Alternative,https://www.reddit.com/r/Die_Alternative/comments/5q6vj8/mitgliederrundbrief_zum_thema_björn_höcke/,"Liebe Mitglieder und Förderer der Alternative für Deutschland,

fast auf den Tag genau acht Monate vor der Bundestagswahl und vier Monate vor den Landtagswahlen in Schleswig-Holstein und Nordrhein-Westfalen steht unsere junge Partei zum wiederholten Mal vor einer großen inneren Herausforderung, während wir unsere Kräfte zugleich für die sachliche Auseinandersetzung mit den politischen Gegnern bündeln müssten.

Es ist uns wichtig, Sie auf direktem Weg über die Inhalte und Interpretationen der Dresdner Rede von Herrn Höcke vom 17.01.2017 zu informieren, die für uns vor allem ernste Fragen bezüglich seines Verhältnisses zur Partei und ihren demokratischen Gremien aufwerfen. 
Darüber hinaus haben seine Äußerungen der Partei zum wiederholten Mal in der nationalen und internationalen Öffentlichkeit geschadet, weshalb der Bundesvorstand mit großer Mehrheit Parteiordnungsmaßnahmen für erforderlich hält. 
Es ist aus unserer Sicht nicht hilfreich, die Verantwortung für diesen Schaden bei verkürzten oder verfälschten Zitaten der Medien zu suchen, die wir gleichwohl scharf kritisieren.

Zu einer politisch reifenden Partei wie der AfD, die von wachsenden Wählergruppen ernst genommen werden will, gehört auch die bittere Erkenntnis, dass in dieser Rede nicht nur Sprengpotential für die Einheit der Partei, sondern insbesondere auch für das Demokratieverständnis der AfD enthalten ist. 
Diese Probleme nicht zu verschleppen, sondern zeitnah zu klären, halten wir als Bundesvorstand für unvermeidlich.

Da uns viele Bitten erreichen, die Sicht des Bundesvorstandes genauer zu erläutern, werden wir in diesem Schreiben mit wenigen Beispielen problematische Passagen der Rede vorstellen und Ihnen außerdem ein Transkript der Rede zur Verfügung stellen, damit Sie sich selbst ein eigenes und umfassenderes Bild machen können.
Den vollständigen Wortlaut der Rede und eine kommentierte Kurzfassung finden Sie auf unserer Webseite unter folgender Adresse (Kennwort: afd2017):

**1 . Einheit der Partei, Parlamentarische Arbeit**

Erinnern wir uns: Spätestens seit Anfang des Jahres 2015 hat die Partei leidvoll erfahren, wie damals wichtige Protagonisten versuchten, die Mehrheit der Partei inhaltlich zu verengen. 
In monatelangen Auseinandersetzungen wurden viele Mitglieder und innerparteiliche Konkurrenten bis tief hinein in die Privatsphäre beschädigt. 
Die inhaltliche Debatte aus dem Wahlprogramm 2013 blieb dabei auf der Strecke, der innerparteiliche Streit eskalierte, die Zustimmung laut Umfragen sank bis auf 3%.

Heute, im Januar 2017, sind wir in zehn Landesparlamenten plus dem EU-Parlament vertreten, es gibt zahlreiche Gesetzesentwürfe und Anträge zu Landes-, Bundes- und Europathemen, die teilweise Eingang in Regierungshandeln gefunden haben. 
Zwar hat die Intensität der Ablehnung des politischen Establishments mit den AfD-Wahlerfolgen dramatisch zugenommen, allmählich wandelt sich jedoch die Berichterstattung zu politischen Inhalten, extern verstärkt durch vergleichbare Entwicklungen in ganz Europa und den Vereinigten Staaten. 
Die Umfragewerte im Vorfeld der Wahlen stehen bei bis zu 16%.

Innerparteilich stand B. Höcke bereits mehrfach im Fokus der Kritik. Obwohl der neu gewählte Bundesvorstand 2015 das Verfahren auf Amtsenthebung im Landesverband Thüringen aufgehoben und damit einen konstruktiven Neuanfang markiert hatte, führten Vorfälle wie sein Auftritt in der Jauch-Talkshow im Oktober 2015 und eine höchst problematische Rede über das angeblich genetisch bestimmte Fortpflanzungsverhalten der Afrikaner im Dezember 2015 zu Hunderten von Parteiaustritten und Zerreißproben auf verschiedenen Parteiebenen und einer einhellig beschlossenen „gelben Karte“ seitens des Bundesvorstands. Als Partei haben wir nach all diesen Auftritten dutzende Veranstaltungsorte, Unterstützer und Spender verloren, auch der AfD wohlgesonnene Verbände ziehen sich zurück, und die Verankerung in der Gesellschaft wird dadurch immer schwieriger.

Die Beteiligung B. Höckes an einem Hintergrundgespräch mit der Hauptstadtpresse in Berlin im Juni 2016, die dort vorgetragene, medial wirksame Diskreditierung der Parteispitze als „moralisch ungeeignet“ und zuletzt eine Presserklärung über angebliche Tricksereien auf einem Parteitag in NRW hatten am 7. Januar 2017 zu einer Befassung des Konvents mit seiner Einmischung in Angelegenheiten eines anderen Landesverbandes geführt. 
Durch einen mit breiter Mehrheit gefassten Beschluss wurde B. Höcke zur nächsten Konventssitzung vorgeladen. 
Dies hat seinen Grund auch darin, dass im August 2016 der Konvent klare Verhaltensregeln für Funktionsträger beschlossen hatte, nach welchen solche innerparteilichen Übergriffe zum „Tabu“ erklärt worden waren.

Nachfolgend ein erstes markantes Zitat aus Höckes Rede:
„Wir müssen immer bedenken, mit Bernd Lucke sind nicht alle die gegangen, die ihren Frieden mit der Rolle eines Junior-Partners in einer zukünftigen Koalition mit einer Altpartei gemacht haben. 
Manche von ihnen, manche von diesen Luckisten sind geblieben. 
Es sind die, die keine innere Haltung besitzen, die Establishment sind und Establishment bleiben wollen oder so schnell wie möglich zum Establishment gehören wollen. 
Und liebe Freunde - nicht wenige von diesen Typen, nicht wenige von diesen Typen drängen jetzt gerade in diesen Wochen und Monaten als Bundestagskandidaten auf die Listen, oder als Direktkandidat in den Wahlkreisen entsprechend nach vorne.“

Hier werden pauschal AfD-Listenkandidaten in allen Landesverbänden und fast 300 Direktkandidaten unter Generalverdacht gestellt, entweder „Luckisten“ oder rückgratlose Karrieristen zu sein. 
Aus dem Mund eines Vollzeitparlamentariers (mit Dienstwagen und Chauffeur) ist dies eine Respektlosigkeit gegenüber den zumeist aussichtslosen Direktkandidaten und den tausenden ehrenamtlich engagierten Parteimitgliedern, die für ihre Leute vor Ort kämpfen.

Fortsetzung Zitat:
„Nicht wenige werden – das muss man leider annehmen - nicht wenige werden ganz schnell vom parlamentarischen Glanz und Glamour der Hauptstadt fasziniert werden. 
Und nicht wenige werden sich ganz schnell sehr wohl fühlen bei den Freifressen- und Freisaufen-Veranstaltungen der Lobbyisten.“

Dutzende Parlamentarier in den Landtagen beweisen tagtäglich durch inhaltliche Arbeit im Parlament und durch Arbeit in Bürgerbüros und bei zahlreichen Veranstaltungen, dass dieser Vorwurf haltlos ist. 
Parlamentsabgeordnete, die sich Tag für Tag der oft zähen Arbeit an den Sachthemen stellen, verdienen die volle Rückendeckung der Partei, keine Abqualifizierung als „Karrieristen“, insbesondere, weil sie nicht nur ihren eigenen Kopf, sondern auch die Reputation ihrer Familien und Freunde dafür hergeben, dass die Programmatik der Partei weiterhin mit klarer Kante vertreten werden kann.

**2 . Differenzierte Geschichtsbetrachtung statt „180°-Wende“**

Ein Zitat zum Umgang der herrschenden Politik mit der Nationalgeschichte Deutschlands:
„Und diese dämliche Bewältigungspolitik, die lähmt uns heute noch viel mehr als zu Franz Josef Strauß’ Zeiten. Wir brauchen nichts anderes als eine erinnerungspolitische Wende um 180 Grad! 
Wir brauchen so dringend wie niemals zuvor diese erinnerungspolitische Wende um 180 Grad, liebe Freunde. 
Wir brauchen keine toten Riten mehr in diesem Land.“
Wir alle verurteilen den Missbrauch von problematischen Teilen unserer Nationalgeschichte für die Zwecke gegenwärtiger Politik. 
Dabei handelt es sich um eine pseudomoralische und pseudopädagogische Instrumentalisierung der Geschichte zur Verhinderung einer vitalen und interessenwahrenden gegenwärtigen deutschen Politik. 
Eine solche Instrumentalisierung soll die Bildung eines unverkrampften Nationalbewusstseins unmöglich machen, das jeder gut funktionierende Staat benötigt.

Es braucht jedoch keine „180° - Wende“ der heutigen Selektion der deutschen Geschichte mit umgekehrter Verengung des Blickwinkels. 
Wir fordern stattdessen eine offene und allseits kritische Befassung mit der Universalgeschichte, in welche die deutsche Geschichte als eine von vielen Nationalgeschichten eingebettet ist. 
Unsere Geschichte ist in weiten Teilen ohnehin nur aus der Interaktion mit anderen Völkern, Staaten und deren Kulturen zu verstehen und gegebenenfalls zu bewerten.

**3 . „Das Denkmal der Schande“**

Diese Passage der Rede hat in der medialen Öffentlichkeit erwartungsgemäß ein großes Echo ausgelöst. 
Teilweise wurde von Zeitungen unvollständig oder gar verfälschend zitiert und anschließend auch korrigiert (FAZ). 
Für den Bundesvorstand ist diese Redepassage zwar ebenfalls problematisch, gravierender ist jedoch B. Höckes Umgang mit seiner Aussage. 
Denn er veröffentlichte am Tag nach der Rede dazu die folgende Erklärung:

„Wörtlich habe ich gesagt: ´Wir Deutschen sind das einzige Volk, das sich ein Denkmal der Schande in das Herz seiner Hauptstadt gepflanzt hat. 
Das heißt, ich habe den Holocaust, also den von Deutschen verübten Völkermord an den Juden, als Schande für unser Volk bezeichnet. 
Und ich habe gesagt, dass wir Deutsche diesem auch heute noch unfassbaren Verbrechen, also diese Schuld und damit verbundene Schande mitten in Berlin, ein Denkmal gesetzt haben. 
Was ist daran falsch? Was ist an dieser Feststellung zu kritisieren? Gar nichts!“

Tatsächlich hat B. Höcke am 17.01.2017 in seiner Rede etwas anderes formuliert und versucht nunmehr, mit einer nachträglichen Erklärung die Öffentlichkeit zu täuschen. 
Denn auch er zitiert sich selbst verfälschend:

Hier das Transkript der gesprochenen Rede vom 17.01.2017:
„Wir Deutschen –und ich rede jetzt nicht von Euch Patrioten, die sich hier heute versammelt haben- wir Deutschen, also unser Volk, sind das einzige Volk der Welt, das sich ein Denkmal der Schande in das Herz seiner Hauptstadt gepflanzt hat.“

Höcke nimmt am 17.01.2017 die anwesenden „Patrioten“ ausdrücklich aus der Gruppe der Deutschen heraus, die das „Denkmal der Schande in das Herz der Hauptstadt gepflanzt haben“. 
Anders gesagt, dieses Denkmal ist nach Höckes Worten eben gerade kein Denkmal der Patrioten. 
Er charakterisiert die Errichtung des Denkmals auf diese Weise als unpatriotisch. 
Unabhängig von der Bewertung einer solchen Aussage sollte man als aufrechter und ehrlicher Mann dazu auch einen Tag später noch stehen.

Ganz abgesehen von diesem Geschehnisablauf bleibt die Frage, warum wir uns als AfD in dieser Zeit vor vier wichtigen Wahlen in dieser Form mit diesem Thema „Holocaust-Denkmal“ öffentlichkeitswirksam beschäftigen, statt unsere politische Programmatik mit Leidenschaft und Fleiß zu betreiben. 
Denn unsere Wahlergebnisse werden in hohem Maße davon abhängen, was wir den Wählern an politischen Inhalten zu bieten haben.

**4 . Das Demokratieverständnis der AfD und seine Vermittlung für die Öffentlichkeit**

Wir lenken Ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf folgende Passage der Dresdner Rede:
„Ich möchte, dass Ihr Euch im Dienst verzehrt…Ja, liebe Freunde, ich weise Euch einen langen…und entbehrungsreichen Weg. 
Ich weise dieser Partei einen langen und entbehrungsreichen Weg. 
Aber es ist der einzige Weg, der zu einem vollständigen Sieg führt, und dieses Land braucht einen vollständigen Sieg der AfD und deshalb will ich diesen Weg –und nur diesen Weg- mit Euch gehen, liebe Freunde!“

Die AfD hat einen Gründungsmythos, der mit dem Gedanken der Erneuerung der Demokratie in Deutschland zu tun hat. Darüber reden wir viel, bemühen dieses Prinzip – manchmal auch etwas schlagwortartig als „Basisdemokratie“ – und haben einiges dazu in unser Grundsatzprogramm geschrieben. 
Fest steht, dass wir uns am stärksten von allen Parteien in Deutschland darum bemühen, die Mitglieder in Programm- und andere Prozesse einzubinden. 
Versuchen Sie, diese uns so wichtige Grundhaltung in Verbindung zu bringen mit dem hier abgedruckten Zitat. 
Versuchen Sie sich vorzustellen, welche Gedanken sich Bürger von außerhalb unserer Partei dazu machen, wenn sie diese Passage lesen und Ansatzpunkte suchen, um uns fundamental politisch und juristisch anzugreifen. 
Einen weiteren Kommentar zu dieser delikaten Frage wollen wir uns ersparen.

Die vorgenannten und weitere hier nicht zitierte Passsagen aus der Dresdner Rede vom 17.01.2017 in der Gesamtschau mit vorangegangen Äußerungen seit 2015 haben den Bundesvorstand am 23.01.2017 veranlasst, sich mit der Einleitung von Ordnungsmaßnahmen gegen B. Höcke zu befassen.
Das komplette Redetranskript als auch eine Version der Rede mit Kommentaren und Fragen finden Sie - wie oben schon ausgeführt - auf unserer Webseite unter der Adresse: https://www.alternativefuer.de/dokumente-zum-rundbrief-januar-2017/ (Kennwort: afd2017).
Es ist uns bewusst, dass die Befassung mit den aufgeworfenen Fragen ein für die Partei schmerzlicher Prozess ist. 
Unsere Verantwortung als Bundesvorstand für alle AfD-Mitglieder und die vielen hoffnungsvollen Wähler in Deutschland sowie politische Partner im Ausland gebietet uns jedoch, eine offene und ehrliche Debatte über die Natur und Ausrichtung der AfD als parlamentarische Partei oder als „Bewegungspartei nach B. Höcke“ zu führen. 
Dazu gehört auch festzustellen, wie wir intern mit unseren selbst gewählten demokratischen Gremien umgehen und welche politischen Themen wir in der Öffentlichkeit präsentieren wollen.

Die öffentliche Debatte über das Verhältnis der AfD zur historischen Betrachtung des „dritten Reiches“ der Nationalsozialisten ist keine demokratische Entscheidung der Basis, sondern wurde ihr durch B. Höcke zum wiederholten Mal aufgezwungen. 
Nicht, weil medial berichtet und skandalisiert wurde, sondern weil B. Höcke ausdrücklich für sich in Anspruch nimmt, den besten Weg zum Erfolg für die AfD zu kennen und umzusetzen. 
Er zelebriert sein Geschichtsverständnis und verleiht ihm seine Sprache. Damit zwingt er die ganze Partei ohne Not, sich damit – eben auch öffentlich – zu beschäftigen, wann und wie er es möchte. 
Der demokratische Entscheidungsweg wäre, zu solchen schwierigen Themen die innerparteiliche Meinungsbildung zu suchen und sich dort Mehrheiten zu verschaffen. 
Eine öffentliche Kommunikation kann eben erst dann stattfinden, wenn sich eine Parteimeinung gebildet hat. 
So funktionieren demokratische Parteien!

Der Bundesvorstand ist sich bewusst, dass die Medien kurzfristig den Streit zu Lasten der AfD in ihrer Berichterstattung nutzen werden. 
Gleichwohl halten wir die Frage der Ausrichtung der AfD als realistische parlamentarische Alternative mit einem klarem Bekenntnis zu Deutschland in all seinen Facetten einschließlich der Verbrechen des „dritten Reiches“ für geboten und den durch Björn Höcke aufgezeigten Weg einer 180°-Wende in der Geschichtsbetrachtung, sowie die Verächtlichmachung des Parlamentarismus und seiner Vertreter für einen Irrweg, der die AfD von einer Partei zu einer „Bewegung“ (ein Begriff, den B. Höcke wiederholt verwendet, jedoch nirgends definiert) umformen würde, die ihren Anspruch, demokratische Mehrheiten zu generieren, aufgäbe. 
Dieser Weg würde die AfD als Partei nicht nur unglaubwürdig machen, sondern mittelfristig auch ihrer demokratischen Legitimation berauben. 
Es ist also inhaltlicher Dissens in einer substanziellen Frage der Alternative für Deutschland, die uns zu diesem Schritt veranlasst.

In gemeinsamer Sorge um die Partei grüßt Sie ganz herzlich
Frauke Petry im Namen des AfD-Bundesvorstands

I finished with a 2.93 GPA and no internships (even though I applied every year). I did the whole job search thing for about 3 months after graduation and wasn't getting anywhere, so my brother offered to help me get a job at the insurance company he works for so I can make some money. I took it in August 2015 and have been stuck there since, hating every minute of it, but I figured I at least have something to pay off my loans. In the meantime I've been applying at nights and on weekends and haven't gotten anywhere in all that time.  I know others have gotten jobs with sub 3.0 GPAs and no internships but it just seems impossible. I live with my parents so I have no living expenses and have saved up enough to pay off my loans for quite a while. I don't necessarily want to quit my job as I don't want a gap in my resume but I also can't focus on obtaining the job I want, not to mention I hate my current job. Just seeing if anyone here has been in a similar situation. Would it be better to quit my current job so I can focus on what I need to do to obtain my dream job? Do gaps in resumes matter that much to people hiring ChemEs? Has anyone had any luck with obtaining a lower position (like a plant operator) and worked their way up to engineer? Sorry for the long post but I just didn't know where else to turn. "

Obviously we can all see now that he is definitely the joker in every sense. So how can they move forward on season 3. 

My current thoughts are that he will trigger Bruce into following the batman path and intensifying training. During the encounter next week Bruce will beat jerome almost to death but stop last second instilling his no killing rule into himself. Jerome will then be taken to Arkham. It wouldn't surprise me to see harleen quinzel at the end of the next episode as a young Arkham intern his last scene of thessentially 3 possibly being him turning to her saying something along the lines of 'have you ever had a really bad day' this could possibly lead to her becoming harley at the end of s3 instigating Jerome's breakout for an inevitable season 4 return.  

I personally think it's a bit early for Harley right now but we know she is coming this season and a mad love homage could be an interesting side story. 

Where do you guys see the story heading?"

5q7ytl,59,2017-01-25,[NeedAdvice] 20 year-old and feeling like nothing is ever going to change,11006985,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/5q7ytl/needadvice_20_yearold_and_feeling_like_nothing_is/,"Hi guys, I am currently a 20 year old university student in my last year, with barely passing grades, no job experiences/internships, no friends or networking experience and barely do anything every day. I am always on the computer and in my room for the days that I don't have classes. I procrastinate on all my work until the night before, I even procrastinate eating and showering. I feel like I have lost all control of my life. This has been going on for two years now, and every time I make progress in getting out of this rut (e.g. going to the library to study for a day), something knocks me back down even further.

I've come to the point where I realize all the things I did wrong and all the missed opportunities and bad decisions I made, but I'm too far gone. Just today, I played Skyrim from 3 pm to 8 pm. Now its almost 3 am and I am watching the Namek Saga from Dragonball Z.

I wasn't always like this. I used to prioritise work and studies. I used to socialize with others but I just gave up when I entered university. Everything was moving at such a fast pace and I felt left behind, and decided not to even bother trying. I know not trying was a mistake, but the effects of not trying feel irreversible, especially two years down the line.

How do you get out of a rut like this. Every day feels like a battle that I'm always going to lose. I get anxious over thinking about my future so I don't think about it anymore. What are some concrete steps I can take to make sure I start doing things again.
Thanks for reading this far. Here are a few bullet points of me trying to explain my thoughts and feelings:

- The future is stressful to think about. My grades are shit so I am not going to get a job. Even opening application forms for internships give me this feeling of stress and anxiety.

- I have always been scared to fail. I prefer to not try and fail then to try at all. Because trying and failing would mean that even my best is not good enough and I can't accept that.

- I feel inferior to others around me, especially students. I think this was brought on by my performance in school. I associate my self-worth with my grades, like a lot of students do, and when I didn't have that, I didn't have anything. It also doesn't help that I don't have a hobby or passion in anything.

- I constantly feel like everyone is judging me, and even though the rational side of me is telling me that everyone is too busy with their own stuff to do something like that, once I get to one of those moods, my thought process becomes warped and stupid and I believe my false thoughts again.

- I feel that i am scared of a lot of things. I am too afraid to open my e-mail because I am anxious over e-mails from my university or professors. Its hard for me to look at people in the eye, I can't seem to do it (but I could before).

- I keep trying to find a ""miracle pill"" - one thing I can do to make everything better and good again. For a while, it was NoFap. And then it was changing the lights on my desk to a darker color rather than a neon lamp so I can focus. And I actually and genuinely believe that these things were my only hope. That doing one thing is going to miraculously make things better. Right now, as I am typing this, I know it isn't but when I feel hopeless, I will start looking for those things again.

- Everything I need to do feels like a chore. Washing the dishes, eating, going to school. If I can avoid something, I will postpone doing it. I don't wash the dishes until the next day. I don't eat until I feel my stomach rumble.

This isn't my last straw. I have gotten so used to living this way that I will probably just continue existing like this. Its a sad life, but what else can I do. Nothing pushes me to do better or improve anymore. Failing exams, getting lectured by concerned parents, seeing my mom cry. I have learnt to tolerate all this so that I don't have to face my fears. I am tired, honestly I am, but not tired enough to change. And I feel that I will never ever change. Its horrible."
5q81e6,7,2017-01-25,I'm an adult male getting emotional over a car,batting_1000,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5q81e6/im_an_adult_male_getting_emotional_over_a_car/,"It seems very silly, I know. There's really no way to sugar-coat it. I'm a grown-ass 31 year old man, and I'm getting ridiculously emotional over getting rid of my car.

In December, my Dad passed away, and I'm honestly still dealing with that. It's one of the more difficult things I've dealt with. In fact, that may be a contributing factor to what I'm about to talk about. But my Dad, about three days before he passed, told my stepmom that if he died (he was not doing well and was on his way to the hospital), he wanted me to have their car. It's a very nice vehicle, and I really don't deserve it.

Anyway, I don't need two cars so I took the insurance money and paid off my 2009 Impala, and decided I want to give it to my older brother. He has a large family, including my nephew who turns 16 this year. Their second car recently took a shit, so they need it more than me.

But it seems I'm having almost as much trouble with the idea of getting rid of this car as I am with dealing with my Dad's death. I bought this car in 2013, and it has been with me through the most turbulent years of my life. A couple depressing jobs, my last two years of college, a nearly year-long relationship, an out of state internship, a couple moves, many adventures, a major slump in life, and many other highs and lows. I even taught one of my college friends how to drive in that car.

So after 3.5 years, and 94,000 miles, I'm giving this car up. I don't know why I'm having such a hard time with this. Maybe it is because it was there during all the crazy events that have taken place in my life since I got it. I've changed so much, and it has been with me through so much.

I really want to keep it, but I'm single and not married, and I just don't need two cars. My brother's family needs it more than me. It's just going to be a hard time signing that title over and seeing it and all the memories I have with it drive away.

It feels ridiculous talking about it because when it comes down to it, it's just a car. But it's more than that to me.

Am I being ridiculous?"
5q85nn,2,2017-01-25,"Me [28 M] broke up with my ex [24F] [2yrs], dating someone new already but..",thr0wnround,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5q85nn/me_28_m_broke_up_with_my_ex_24f_2yrs_dating/,"Two months ago, I broke up with my partner of almost 2 years.  I was dealing with a lot of mental health issues and I was in a very horrible space. I was feeling very suicidal but I learned a long time ago that I could never cause the people I love more pain just because I feel like I can't handle mine. Anyway, I started self-medicating with alcohol and drugs and even had a few moments of drunk driving. I've struggled with some alcohol abuse but this just really went over the edge.  Everything just felt dark and scary, and my partner was definitely a guiding light for me but I realized I couldn't be there for her if I wasn't able to help myself but I didn't know how to do that and kept slipping further.  I started feeling like things had to end so I could focus on myself but I didn't want to lose her because I still love her. Well, one night I got extremely fucked up on an excessive amount of booze, smoked some weed and did a few lines of cocaine. I ended up at a house with some folks I know but I didn't know where I was and my ride had fallen asleep and my phone had died. Someone I didn't know had made a move on me and I didn't really stop it from happening. I know this is on me, and I felt like destroying everything around me was the answer including my relationship.  I had made a huge mistake. I felt like I had dreamt the experience, but knew I hadn't.  It was real and I couldn't handle it. I've never done anything like that. It ate me up for a few days and I broke up with my partner that weekend. I did not tell her I had slept with someone else. I panicked, pushed her away, and responded by doing more drinking and a lot more drugs and stopped sleeping. I realized how much I was hurting myself when I hurt her. I asked if she would meet up the next weekend after we broke up, as I wanted to be fully honest with her because I really wanted to fix things between us and get back together if possible, and at the very least, wanted us to have an honest friendship if that was an option too. I told her that I had slept with someone else then. I believe that I don't get to make that decision of how she feels for her, if I hadn't told her. We talked the next week and she was rightfully very mad about everything. She had known about my drinking and we were both worried, but she had no idea about the drugs.  Anyway, she invites me to come over to her place after our conversation.  I really, really wanted to go but if sex was even on the table, it was too early for me to get tested for any stds and I refuse to compromise her sexual health for my selfishness. 

Anyway, we send some decent texts to each other in attempts to start creating some closure, I suppose, and stay cordial. About a week and a half after our conversation, I see a snapstory of a random new person. I naturally wonder who the fuck that is but didn't really think too much more of it. More time goes by, and I am trying to check in on her because I realized I was ready to trust myself and tell her I know I am capable of doing all the work to make amends, if I could get another chance.  I quit my job that was fueling my depression to spiral into excessive binge drinking and really trying to focus on healing myself from all the damage I had done to myself, as well.  She is confused as to why I'm texting her more often than I did in our relationship (not necessarily true, we saw each other almost every day so there was less need to text that often...) and I tell her that I would love to talk about that in person.  She tells me she is unavailable to do that and doesn't know when she will be but sure.  My gut says something is very off about this. I didn't expect her to drop what she was doing but I know her schedule and it was winter break. No school, no internship, etc. 
I get this sinking feeling that maybe she's seeing someone else when I see only one new friend on facebook.  I click on this person and I could totally see my ex being attracted to this person.  I have no proof until a few days later. I am hanging out with mutual friends--we moved here together for her to go to school so we built a lot of friendships together--and we're just catchin up. I start talking about how I want to really fix things and what my plan is for myself and how I really want to let her know that I want to fix things and they seem super supportive of this but they have to tell me something...She's been seeing someone. 

Anyway, a lot of our mutual friends would love to see us work on things and are in support of it. They also know that she's just tryin to have some fun and explore some things and don't think this will last. To make it worse, almost all the people I know who have met this person have said some not kind things. I will go into this later. 

I've been left for other people in break ups, and I've dabbled in non-exclusive relationships, so I have a pretty healthy relationship with jealousy. I definitely feel it but it's not consuming. I feel very lucky for that.  I send my ex a letter saying how I really want to work on things and that it would mean the world to me if she would consider it but I know that it would take a lot of time on her end to forgive me. I also let her know that I know she's seeing someone else and that I want her to be happy. (I had only heard one story about this person so far; it was still unfavorable but I didn't have much else) We start texting and she thinks that I'm only saying all the things about wanting to fix things because I'm reacting to the consequences and also because she's seeing someone new. I disagreed with her; that's why I had been keeping contact and no longer pushing her away like I did the first week our break up. We did not otherwise talk about the person she's been seeing.

Well, now it's been almost 2 months since our break up.  A few weeks ago, I was on instagram and stumbled across a picture of her that this new person had put on the internet.  It was waxing poetic about their connection. At this point, they had known each other for a month at most. (I do not know all the details of their interactions but it's pretty easy to put the pieces together). I cringe, because I think putting your new relationship on blast on the internet is kind of gross especially so quickly. But of course, I get obsessed with checking in and accidentally like one of this new persons other pictures.  A few hours later, there's one of my ex sleeping in bed with more dreamy words.  I feel so grossed out by this point and realize that checking in on this is very unhealthy for me, so I block them both. 

So the things I have heard about this person are starting to seem more and more true.  The first story I heard was about this new person laughing hysterically at a friend who had fallen down the stairs, and not in a nervous laughter.  Second I heard was that this person is just young, aka immature. This was the nicest thing I had heard.  Third, goes into some territory that makes me very uncomfortable and very nervous.  I ran into a friend who does not know my ex, as we were work friends and never really ran into each other when my ex and I were together.  I'm catching up with her about a job interview I have that I'm really excited about and just really doing the things I need to do for myself while I heal from my actions and this breakup. She realizes that she actually met my ex the other night and the new person she's seeing.  Within moments of meeting my ex's new someone, my friend starts getting grilled over grabbing the last slice of pizza she was offered.  She was being gaslighted over a slice of pizza and it's relentless. I ask if maybe she thought the person was trying to be funny, and we both sort of realize that it doesn't matter because gaslighting is not funny. She tells me how uncomfortable it made her from someone she didn't even know. She had not context or bias to tell me this story, but started saying how nervous she is for my ex because this person is going to build her up and then really tear her down. Super charming at first, seemingly smart but throughout the night, my friend realized how much this person seems to put on.  Another friend tells me whenever she sees this person that they are always smarmy, curated, and creepy. 

With everything that I've heard and everything that I feel, I think this person might be a complete malignant narcissist.  Moving so quickly with someone freshly out of a 2 year relationship was my first sign that I don't trust this persons intentions and then just everything else that followed. Friends say it's none of my business and that my ex has to figure these things out for herself.  It's killing my conscience to not say anything because I have dated some not great people for me and friends didn't tell me how awful they thought they were until after we broke up. I know I can't say anything though, because my ex is definitely not thinking clearly (accused me of breaking into her house to drop off something--i never had a key to begin with?) and would think that I was trying to smear this person so we could get back together.  I think that would drive her more into this person's life and really fall more into the grips of what could be a very dangerous relationship.

I'm really trying to move forward but I'm having a hard time not getting upset at the situation.  I know that by living better, I am doing the right thing for myself even if there were ""no promises"" made about getting back together or not. I've finally implemented no contact, because I said what I needed to say and I guess we've both said all we need to say until some time goes by.  I just don't know how people can move on like this so quickly and I feel like our whole relationship meant nothing, and that moving on is the only thing I can do but damn. this sucks.





  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Broke up with my ex two months ago to take care of myself and my mental health.  Ex met someone new within 2 weeks. I've heard real bad things about this new person. We also haven't fully resolved our relationship and what happens next, whether it is friendship or more or nothing.  I think she's falling victim to classic Narcissistic, possibly malignant, behavior. A friend of mine was gaslighted by them. How do I stop thinking about how shitty this person is and stop worrying about my ex being with them? "

Hostels, hotels, woofing, etc.",mpf315,ecuador,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecuador/comments/5q8cvb/how_to_plan_while_traveling_hostels_hotels/,"I've decided to visit an animal sanctuary called Merazonia. I've read that I must fly to Quito, take a bus, then take a bus into the sanctuary. I can get from New York to Merazonia, but I feel since this is likely to be once in a lifetime travel opportunity, I hope to be able to visit many more places. I was wondering how to book hotels, hostels, flights, and WWoofing stays. However, I am unsure if I bring a computer or will even have access to the internet during my stay. I've been so reliant on the internet at home to plan whenever I want and my phone for directions. Would one recommend that I should plan everything in advance or can somebody offer insight to help me figure out how to book and travel with very limited access to the internet?

As for myself, I've traveled often in America and other countries, but I've always had either my car, my phone/internet, or friends to offer a solution. I don't speak Spanish well but I am picking it up at an okay pace.  I am traveling alone so there's no help there.  I am Korean but I really doubt I'd run into any issues of that sort but I am starting to worry standing out as an obvious American, and after the election, I'm unsure how that will affect how I'm viewed.  I have never Woofed but I'd give it a chance if it allows me to see a new place and a roof over my head.  I would ideally love to feel comfortable and confident enough so that I could rent a motorcycle and just explore the towns as I have in America. I'd love to make this a reality. 

EDIT - 1.26.17 - 8:06
I think I'll unlock my phone to save maps, look up places to stay, figure out bus schedules, etc. Since I think I am not bringing a computer, does anybody know how to store photos? Usually I dump my card every night onto the laptop, but now I'll be unable to. I don't know if I can upload to a cloud either if I only have my phone and my camera. FWIW, I own a Fuji XT1 and want to shoot a lot of nature to broaden my professional opportunities in the future. I really wanted to go intern for nature photographers, but I can't justify the money if there's no diploma or any leads towards that career through the program."
5q9etv,0,2017-01-26,9 Y/O Mixed/Domestic Breed Cat,antigroove,AskVet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/5q9etv/9_yo_mixeddomestic_breed_cat/,"Hello, my 9 year old short-hair domestic, mixed breed cat was recently diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma. Unfortunately there seems to be some confusion/consternation among the vets we've spoken with given the history, what's happening with him now, and the specific diagnosis. I'm hoping someone might help make sense of all this and provide some insight on treatment options.

The main points are follows (detailed history at bottom of post):

* We've been struggling with an area of apparently necrotic tissue since April, first in the mouth, now the nose; continuing despite maxillectomy procedure in December.
* Tested negative for cancer in late May.
* Tested positive for cancer in December.
* No obvious tumor or evidence of metastasis, rather localized necrotizing tissue.
* He has had a milky-white eye since he was a kitten. Tested negative for FIV and FeLV; but family history of FIP, with one female sibling having a similar trait of one milky-white eye dying of accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (we suspect effusive FIP).
* Consternation by local vet, oncology consult intern, and oncology radiation tech about the diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma given how rare that is in cats and that it has manifested in the mouth followed by the nose. Also given that we've been fighting *something* since May, and it hasn't progressed to a point of being life-threatening (yet, although I suspect we're on the cusp now).

I suspect it's a cutaneous lymphoma, but that's based on 0 medical training and just hours of Google-Fu. So first I'd like to get a little more confidence about what we're facing.

From my discussions with the various vet folks, it sounds like treatment would be a tossup of radiation (~$6k sans travel) or chemotherapy ($5,500). Since I'd have to drive a considerable distance for radiation and the cost would be all at once, I'm leaning towards chemo (CHOP). But wow, that price tag, when the average I'm finding around the web is closer to $1,500-$3,000. Apparently we don't have anywhere local who can do the... mixing? dosing ... of the drugs, and our vet is looking to use Oncure, which apparently bumps the price considerably.

What are your thoughts on my cat's situation? Does the diagnosis seem logical? If so, what should I expect in terms of prognosis, and do either of the treatment options change that? Are there alternative treatment options I should explore?

I feel like I've just vomited info all over the place, so please forgive me. I'm alternating between dark despair and unspeakable hope. I just want enough knowledge to feel like I'm making a well-informed and reasoned decision.

Thank you.

History of events as follows:

* 04/11/16: Semi-regular teeth cleaning resulted in tooth extraction for top-left canine. Everything else looked normal, and vet was shocked by the level of apparent tissue rot in the gum there.

* 05/10/16: Cleaned out wound. Dental and flushed abscess.

* 05/27/16: Another cleaning procedure and also took first sample for histogram from hard palette. Came back positive for osteomyelitis, negative for cancer.

* 07/08/16: Performed bone graft / flap procedure. Vet wanted to wait 3mo or more to give it a chance to heal.

* 10/25/16: Still not healing properly. Vet attempted another bone graft but was unsuccessful due to lack of healthy tissue/bone.

* 12/13/16: Maxillectomy performed on the upper-left part of his jawbone to stop spread of infection throughout the rest of the jaw. Procedure went well, and all seemed OK apart from a small bump on his nose which we attributed to the surgery. Second sample taken during surgery for biopsy. No indication of masses in abdominal/chest X-ray. Mandibular lymph node not noticeably enlarged.

* 12/22/16: Biopsy came back positive for round-cell neoplasia. We requested immunohistochemistry stains to differentiate it.

* 12/27/16: The bump on his nose became a sort of black scab.

* 01/05/17: Additional scabbing occurred on nose itself, growing to encompass the majority of the left side of his nose.

* 01/17/17: Received results from staining:

CD3: The neoplastic cell population exhibits diffuse, moderate to strong immunopositivity.    

CD20: The neoplastic cells are diffusely negative.

INTERPRETATION, COMMENTS: 
These findings suggest the neoplastic cells are of T-cell origin and support a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma.

* 01/18/17: Tested for FIV and FeLV - both came back negative. The large area of scabbing on his nose fell away, attached only by a small patch of tissue, resulting in a large cavity.

5q9mim,11,2017-01-26,*** Mitgliederrundbrief zum Thema Björn Höcke ***,Alternativer,the_frauke,https://www.reddit.com/r/the_frauke/comments/5q9mim/mitgliederrundbrief_zum_thema_björn_höcke/,"Liebe Mitglieder und Förderer der Alternative für Deutschland,

fast auf den Tag genau acht Monate vor der Bundestagswahl und vier Monate vor den Landtagswahlen in Schleswig-Holstein und Nordrhein-Westfalen steht unsere junge Partei zum wiederholten Mal vor einer großen inneren Herausforderung, während wir unsere Kräfte zugleich für die sachliche Auseinandersetzung mit den politischen Gegnern bündeln müssten.

Es ist uns wichtig, Sie auf direktem Weg über die Inhalte und Interpretationen der Dresdner Rede von Herrn Höcke vom 17.01.2017 zu informieren, die für uns vor allem ernste Fragen bezüglich seines Verhältnisses zur Partei und ihren demokratischen Gremien aufwerfen. 
Darüber hinaus haben seine Äußerungen der Partei zum wiederholten Mal in der nationalen und internationalen Öffentlichkeit geschadet, weshalb der Bundesvorstand mit großer Mehrheit Parteiordnungsmaßnahmen für erforderlich hält. 
Es ist aus unserer Sicht nicht hilfreich, die Verantwortung für diesen Schaden bei verkürzten oder verfälschten Zitaten der Medien zu suchen, die wir gleichwohl scharf kritisieren.

Zu einer politisch reifenden Partei wie der AfD, die von wachsenden Wählergruppen ernst genommen werden will, gehört auch die bittere Erkenntnis, dass in dieser Rede nicht nur Sprengpotential für die Einheit der Partei, sondern insbesondere auch für das Demokratieverständnis der AfD enthalten ist. 
Diese Probleme nicht zu verschleppen, sondern zeitnah zu klären, halten wir als Bundesvorstand für unvermeidlich.

Da uns viele Bitten erreichen, die Sicht des Bundesvorstandes genauer zu erläutern, werden wir in diesem Schreiben mit wenigen Beispielen problematische Passagen der Rede vorstellen und Ihnen außerdem ein Transkript der Rede zur Verfügung stellen, damit Sie sich selbst ein eigenes und umfassenderes Bild machen können.
Den vollständigen Wortlaut der Rede und eine kommentierte Kurzfassung finden Sie auf unserer Webseite unter folgender Adresse (Kennwort: afd2017):
https://www.alternativefuer.de/dokumente-zum-rundbrief-januar-2017/

**1 . Einheit der Partei, Parlamentarische Arbeit**

Erinnern wir uns: Spätestens seit Anfang des Jahres 2015 hat die Partei leidvoll erfahren, wie damals wichtige Protagonisten versuchten, die Mehrheit der Partei inhaltlich zu verengen. 
In monatelangen Auseinandersetzungen wurden viele Mitglieder und innerparteiliche Konkurrenten bis tief hinein in die Privatsphäre beschädigt. 
Die inhaltliche Debatte aus dem Wahlprogramm 2013 blieb dabei auf der Strecke, der innerparteiliche Streit eskalierte, die Zustimmung laut Umfragen sank bis auf 3%.

Heute, im Januar 2017, sind wir in zehn Landesparlamenten plus dem EU-Parlament vertreten, es gibt zahlreiche Gesetzesentwürfe und Anträge zu Landes-, Bundes- und Europathemen, die teilweise Eingang in Regierungshandeln gefunden haben. 
Zwar hat die Intensität der Ablehnung des politischen Establishments mit den AfD-Wahlerfolgen dramatisch zugenommen, allmählich wandelt sich jedoch die Berichterstattung zu politischen Inhalten, extern verstärkt durch vergleichbare Entwicklungen in ganz Europa und den Vereinigten Staaten. 
Die Umfragewerte im Vorfeld der Wahlen stehen bei bis zu 16%.

Innerparteilich stand B. Höcke bereits mehrfach im Fokus der Kritik. Obwohl der neu gewählte Bundesvorstand 2015 das Verfahren auf Amtsenthebung im Landesverband Thüringen aufgehoben und damit einen konstruktiven Neuanfang markiert hatte, führten Vorfälle wie sein Auftritt in der Jauch-Talkshow im Oktober 2015 und eine höchst problematische Rede über das angeblich genetisch bestimmte Fortpflanzungsverhalten der Afrikaner im Dezember 2015 zu Hunderten von Parteiaustritten und Zerreißproben auf verschiedenen Parteiebenen und einer einhellig beschlossenen „gelben Karte“ seitens des Bundesvorstands. Als Partei haben wir nach all diesen Auftritten dutzende Veranstaltungsorte, Unterstützer und Spender verloren, auch der AfD wohlgesonnene Verbände ziehen sich zurück, und die Verankerung in der Gesellschaft wird dadurch immer schwieriger.

Die Beteiligung B. Höckes an einem Hintergrundgespräch mit der Hauptstadtpresse in Berlin im Juni 2016, die dort vorgetragene, medial wirksame Diskreditierung der Parteispitze als „moralisch ungeeignet“ und zuletzt eine Presserklärung über angebliche Tricksereien auf einem Parteitag in NRW hatten am 7. Januar 2017 zu einer Befassung des Konvents mit seiner Einmischung in Angelegenheiten eines anderen Landesverbandes geführt. 
Durch einen mit breiter Mehrheit gefassten Beschluss wurde B. Höcke zur nächsten Konventssitzung vorgeladen. 
Dies hat seinen Grund auch darin, dass im August 2016 der Konvent klare Verhaltensregeln für Funktionsträger beschlossen hatte, nach welchen solche innerparteilichen Übergriffe zum „Tabu“ erklärt worden waren.

Nachfolgend ein erstes markantes Zitat aus Höckes Rede:
„Wir müssen immer bedenken, mit Bernd Lucke sind nicht alle die gegangen, die ihren Frieden mit der Rolle eines Junior-Partners in einer zukünftigen Koalition mit einer Altpartei gemacht haben. 
Manche von ihnen, manche von diesen Luckisten sind geblieben. 
Es sind die, die keine innere Haltung besitzen, die Establishment sind und Establishment bleiben wollen oder so schnell wie möglich zum Establishment gehören wollen. 
Und liebe Freunde - nicht wenige von diesen Typen, nicht wenige von diesen Typen drängen jetzt gerade in diesen Wochen und Monaten als Bundestagskandidaten auf die Listen, oder als Direktkandidat in den Wahlkreisen entsprechend nach vorne.“

Hier werden pauschal AfD-Listenkandidaten in allen Landesverbänden und fast 300 Direktkandidaten unter Generalverdacht gestellt, entweder „Luckisten“ oder rückgratlose Karrieristen zu sein. 
Aus dem Mund eines Vollzeitparlamentariers (mit Dienstwagen und Chauffeur) ist dies eine Respektlosigkeit gegenüber den zumeist aussichtslosen Direktkandidaten und den tausenden ehrenamtlich engagierten Parteimitgliedern, die für ihre Leute vor Ort kämpfen.

Fortsetzung Zitat:
„Nicht wenige werden – das muss man leider annehmen - nicht wenige werden ganz schnell vom parlamentarischen Glanz und Glamour der Hauptstadt fasziniert werden. 
Und nicht wenige werden sich ganz schnell sehr wohl fühlen bei den Freifressen- und Freisaufen-Veranstaltungen der Lobbyisten.“

Dutzende Parlamentarier in den Landtagen beweisen tagtäglich durch inhaltliche Arbeit im Parlament und durch Arbeit in Bürgerbüros und bei zahlreichen Veranstaltungen, dass dieser Vorwurf haltlos ist. 
Parlamentsabgeordnete, die sich Tag für Tag der oft zähen Arbeit an den Sachthemen stellen, verdienen die volle Rückendeckung der Partei, keine Abqualifizierung als „Karrieristen“, insbesondere, weil sie nicht nur ihren eigenen Kopf, sondern auch die Reputation ihrer Familien und Freunde dafür hergeben, dass die Programmatik der Partei weiterhin mit klarer Kante vertreten werden kann.

**2 . Differenzierte Geschichtsbetrachtung statt „180°-Wende“**

Ein Zitat zum Umgang der herrschenden Politik mit der Nationalgeschichte Deutschlands:
„Und diese dämliche Bewältigungspolitik, die lähmt uns heute noch viel mehr als zu Franz Josef Strauß’ Zeiten. Wir brauchen nichts anderes als eine erinnerungspolitische Wende um 180 Grad! 
Wir brauchen so dringend wie niemals zuvor diese erinnerungspolitische Wende um 180 Grad, liebe Freunde. 
Wir brauchen keine toten Riten mehr in diesem Land.“
Wir alle verurteilen den Missbrauch von problematischen Teilen unserer Nationalgeschichte für die Zwecke gegenwärtiger Politik. 
Dabei handelt es sich um eine pseudomoralische und pseudopädagogische Instrumentalisierung der Geschichte zur Verhinderung einer vitalen und interessenwahrenden gegenwärtigen deutschen Politik. 
Eine solche Instrumentalisierung soll die Bildung eines unverkrampften Nationalbewusstseins unmöglich machen, das jeder gut funktionierende Staat benötigt.

Es braucht jedoch keine „180° - Wende“ der heutigen Selektion der deutschen Geschichte mit umgekehrter Verengung des Blickwinkels. 
Wir fordern stattdessen eine offene und allseits kritische Befassung mit der Universalgeschichte, in welche die deutsche Geschichte als eine von vielen Nationalgeschichten eingebettet ist. 
Unsere Geschichte ist in weiten Teilen ohnehin nur aus der Interaktion mit anderen Völkern, Staaten und deren Kulturen zu verstehen und gegebenenfalls zu bewerten.

**3 . „Das Denkmal der Schande“**

Diese Passage der Rede hat in der medialen Öffentlichkeit erwartungsgemäß ein großes Echo ausgelöst. 
Teilweise wurde von Zeitungen unvollständig oder gar verfälschend zitiert und anschließend auch korrigiert (FAZ). 
Für den Bundesvorstand ist diese Redepassage zwar ebenfalls problematisch, gravierender ist jedoch B. Höckes Umgang mit seiner Aussage. 
Denn er veröffentlichte am Tag nach der Rede dazu die folgende Erklärung:

„Wörtlich habe ich gesagt: ´Wir Deutschen sind das einzige Volk, das sich ein Denkmal der Schande in das Herz seiner Hauptstadt gepflanzt hat. 
Das heißt, ich habe den Holocaust, also den von Deutschen verübten Völkermord an den Juden, als Schande für unser Volk bezeichnet. 
Und ich habe gesagt, dass wir Deutsche diesem auch heute noch unfassbaren Verbrechen, also diese Schuld und damit verbundene Schande mitten in Berlin, ein Denkmal gesetzt haben. 
Was ist daran falsch? Was ist an dieser Feststellung zu kritisieren? Gar nichts!“

Tatsächlich hat B. Höcke am 17.01.2017 in seiner Rede etwas anderes formuliert und versucht nunmehr, mit einer nachträglichen Erklärung die Öffentlichkeit zu täuschen. 
Denn auch er zitiert sich selbst verfälschend:

Hier das Transkript der gesprochenen Rede vom 17.01.2017:
„Wir Deutschen –und ich rede jetzt nicht von Euch Patrioten, die sich hier heute versammelt haben- wir Deutschen, also unser Volk, sind das einzige Volk der Welt, das sich ein Denkmal der Schande in das Herz seiner Hauptstadt gepflanzt hat.“

Höcke nimmt am 17.01.2017 die anwesenden „Patrioten“ ausdrücklich aus der Gruppe der Deutschen heraus, die das „Denkmal der Schande in das Herz der Hauptstadt gepflanzt haben“. 
Anders gesagt, dieses Denkmal ist nach Höckes Worten eben gerade kein Denkmal der Patrioten. 
Er charakterisiert die Errichtung des Denkmals auf diese Weise als unpatriotisch. 
Unabhängig von der Bewertung einer solchen Aussage sollte man als aufrechter und ehrlicher Mann dazu auch einen Tag später noch stehen.

Ganz abgesehen von diesem Geschehnisablauf bleibt die Frage, warum wir uns als AfD in dieser Zeit vor vier wichtigen Wahlen in dieser Form mit diesem Thema „Holocaust-Denkmal“ öffentlichkeitswirksam beschäftigen, statt unsere politische Programmatik mit Leidenschaft und Fleiß zu betreiben. 
Denn unsere Wahlergebnisse werden in hohem Maße davon abhängen, was wir den Wählern an politischen Inhalten zu bieten haben.

**4 . Das Demokratieverständnis der AfD und seine Vermittlung für die Öffentlichkeit**

Wir lenken Ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf folgende Passage der Dresdner Rede:
„Ich möchte, dass Ihr Euch im Dienst verzehrt…Ja, liebe Freunde, ich weise Euch einen langen…und entbehrungsreichen Weg. 
Ich weise dieser Partei einen langen und entbehrungsreichen Weg. 
Aber es ist der einzige Weg, der zu einem vollständigen Sieg führt, und dieses Land braucht einen vollständigen Sieg der AfD und deshalb will ich diesen Weg –und nur diesen Weg- mit Euch gehen, liebe Freunde!“

Die AfD hat einen Gründungsmythos, der mit dem Gedanken der Erneuerung der Demokratie in Deutschland zu tun hat. Darüber reden wir viel, bemühen dieses Prinzip – manchmal auch etwas schlagwortartig als „Basisdemokratie“ – und haben einiges dazu in unser Grundsatzprogramm geschrieben. 
Fest steht, dass wir uns am stärksten von allen Parteien in Deutschland darum bemühen, die Mitglieder in Programm- und andere Prozesse einzubinden. 
Versuchen Sie, diese uns so wichtige Grundhaltung in Verbindung zu bringen mit dem hier abgedruckten Zitat. 
Versuchen Sie sich vorzustellen, welche Gedanken sich Bürger von außerhalb unserer Partei dazu machen, wenn sie diese Passage lesen und Ansatzpunkte suchen, um uns fundamental politisch und juristisch anzugreifen. 
Einen weiteren Kommentar zu dieser delikaten Frage wollen wir uns ersparen.

Die vorgenannten und weitere hier nicht zitierte Passsagen aus der Dresdner Rede vom 17.01.2017 in der Gesamtschau mit vorangegangen Äußerungen seit 2015 haben den Bundesvorstand am 23.01.2017 veranlasst, sich mit der Einleitung von Ordnungsmaßnahmen gegen B. Höcke zu befassen.
Das komplette Redetranskript als auch eine Version der Rede mit Kommentaren und Fragen finden Sie - wie oben schon ausgeführt - auf unserer Webseite unter der Adresse: https://www.alternativefuer.de/dokumente-zum-rundbrief-januar-2017/ (Kennwort: afd2017).
Es ist uns bewusst, dass die Befassung mit den aufgeworfenen Fragen ein für die Partei schmerzlicher Prozess ist. 
Unsere Verantwortung als Bundesvorstand für alle AfD-Mitglieder und die vielen hoffnungsvollen Wähler in Deutschland sowie politische Partner im Ausland gebietet uns jedoch, eine offene und ehrliche Debatte über die Natur und Ausrichtung der AfD als parlamentarische Partei oder als „Bewegungspartei nach B. Höcke“ zu führen. 
Dazu gehört auch festzustellen, wie wir intern mit unseren selbst gewählten demokratischen Gremien umgehen und welche politischen Themen wir in der Öffentlichkeit präsentieren wollen.

Die öffentliche Debatte über das Verhältnis der AfD zur historischen Betrachtung des „dritten Reiches“ der Nationalsozialisten ist keine demokratische Entscheidung der Basis, sondern wurde ihr durch B. Höcke zum wiederholten Mal aufgezwungen. 
Nicht, weil medial berichtet und skandalisiert wurde, sondern weil B. Höcke ausdrücklich für sich in Anspruch nimmt, den besten Weg zum Erfolg für die AfD zu kennen und umzusetzen. 
Er zelebriert sein Geschichtsverständnis und verleiht ihm seine Sprache. Damit zwingt er die ganze Partei ohne Not, sich damit – eben auch öffentlich – zu beschäftigen, wann und wie er es möchte. 
Der demokratische Entscheidungsweg wäre, zu solchen schwierigen Themen die innerparteiliche Meinungsbildung zu suchen und sich dort Mehrheiten zu verschaffen. 
Eine öffentliche Kommunikation kann eben erst dann stattfinden, wenn sich eine Parteimeinung gebildet hat. 
So funktionieren demokratische Parteien!

Der Bundesvorstand ist sich bewusst, dass die Medien kurzfristig den Streit zu Lasten der AfD in ihrer Berichterstattung nutzen werden. 
Gleichwohl halten wir die Frage der Ausrichtung der AfD als realistische parlamentarische Alternative mit einem klarem Bekenntnis zu Deutschland in all seinen Facetten einschließlich der Verbrechen des „dritten Reiches“ für geboten und den durch Björn Höcke aufgezeigten Weg einer 180°-Wende in der Geschichtsbetrachtung, sowie die Verächtlichmachung des Parlamentarismus und seiner Vertreter für einen Irrweg, der die AfD von einer Partei zu einer „Bewegung“ (ein Begriff, den B. Höcke wiederholt verwendet, jedoch nirgends definiert) umformen würde, die ihren Anspruch, demokratische Mehrheiten zu generieren, aufgäbe. 
Dieser Weg würde die AfD als Partei nicht nur unglaubwürdig machen, sondern mittelfristig auch ihrer demokratischen Legitimation berauben. 
Es ist also inhaltlicher Dissens in einer substanziellen Frage der Alternative für Deutschland, die uns zu diesem Schritt veranlasst.

In gemeinsamer Sorge um die Partei grüßt Sie ganz herzlich
Frauke Petry im Namen des AfD-Bundesvorstands

5q9ot5,0,2017-01-26,Should I work during this summer? (CS related),pompom_123,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/5q9ot5/should_i_work_during_this_summer_cs_related/,"Hi guys, I am currently 3rd year UBC student majoring in CPSC. I know tomorrow is the technical career fair and quite a few of co-op jobs are available on scope but I'm not sure if I want to work at any of the companies that are listed on the scope. During the winter holidays and up to few days ago, I had interviews from all of the big four companies but I was not able to qualify for the SDE intern position from all of them at the final round. 

As there aren't that many 4 month work term for co-op, should I just take summer courses and re-apply to these companies in July so I can prepare myself for those interviews? Recruiters from all of four companies have encouraged me to get in touch with them if I want to do the interview for Jan 2018 internships. My only concern is the ""gap"" between May to July. I do want to do a personal project that is quite ""huge"" but obviously from recruiter's perspective, it might seem like there weren't any improvements after the initial rejection. What do you guys suggest? I was thinking of maybe seeking for research positions related to CS during the summer but I'm not sure if that even exists. 

tldr; am I better off prepping for those interviews on my own again until July? Or work in May~Dec(Possibly Aug)? 
Would love to hear some suggestions, thanks in advance!"
5qa5so,3,2017-01-26,"I was viciously emotionally abused by my mother, who uses playground bully antics for everything.",wolvenreign,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5qa5so/i_was_viciously_emotionally_abused_by_my_mother/,"Before I start, i want to thank you for reading this. Really, really truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for taking the time to read my story, whereas so many are unwilling to hear it at all. Not my Dad, not a good chunk of my friends, not my family, not even the police. Thank you.

Let me introduce myself. I'm 28, male, and I was born in Orange County Hospital in Orange, CA. My Mom was 45 at the time she adopted me, having already had 3 girls of her own by my Dad, who is a year younger than her. We moved out of California to Indiana when I was 2 years old, for my Dad's job as an electrical engineer.

I grew up in a small Indiana town called Zionsville. As a child, my life was completely miserable. My allergies were so bad that I could barely breathe outside, despite my parents calling it ""fresh air"". At school, even starting from Kindergarten, I was relentlessly bullied. No kid would even give me the time of day, except for one that I became close friends with. I was so socially ostracized that, despite knowing the answers just about any time our teacher would ask, I was relegated to the special education room, known as the ""resource room"". Even though I kept being nice to everyone I met, they would only look at me in scorn and insult me. It's no wonder I had bad grades; school was a nightmare that I just wanted to be over. 

Of course, the nightmare didn't really end at school. It just meant that I had to deal with one bully as opposed to 20. When I went home, there she was; my Mom, waiting to taunt me relentlessly over any little mistake I made. If I misspelled something or if my shoes were untied, she would immediately scream at me. Usually it was, ""WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?! ARE YOU RETARDED OR SOMETHING?!"". Something I found out would be a recurring theme. From that point even to this day, she has had this compulsion where she can't just correct you on something, she has to compound it with an insult. ""ARE YOU RETARDED?! YOUR KEYS ARE RIGHT FUCKING THERE!"", if you're looking for your keys. (This is something she does to both me and my Dad, by the way. No one else, though.)

If I ever got hurt and started crying, she'd look at me and do the mocking gesture for crying. ""BOOHOO! GROW UP! YOU'RE 5 YEARS OLD ALREADY!"" or however old I was at the time. If I was sick, she'd insist that I was faking it to get off of school, sending me to my room and not even pretending to care. Although, admittedly, I would do that too, but considering school was an absolute hellhole, I think I might have been justified about that.

Oh, last thing about my school before we move on. I was so tortured by all of the kids in class (which the teachers would never believe me about) that in the fourth grade, I went absolutely psychotic. I took my recorder (the instrument) to class that day and tried conquering my fear of heights on the jungle gym. But I was overweight and I slipped and fell, right on my face. My class was gathered around and they laughed at me, not even stopping to see if I was okay. I snapped and chased after them with the recorder, catching all 13 of them and smacking them across the face with the recorder before being caught by the faculty. I was suspended for two days from school, during which I was grounded.

(That was, however, the last violent incident I ever caused in my life. And I still don't entirely excuse it or say that it wasn't my fault at all, just that it was what brought me to that point.)

After the fifth grade, I was home schooled because of how much the constant bullying was distracting me from my schoolwork. I barely avoided flunking in 5th.

Anyway, back to my mother. She would often shove me growing up if I ever spoke back to her when she insulted me, even if I just politely asked her to stop calling me stupid. She'd frequently talk about my Dad behind his back, which is apparently something she'd done even when my much older sisters (who had moved out at that point) were growing up. They'd argue all the time, my Dad's meekness constantly giving in to my Mom's insanely aggressive, freakishly bullying demeanor. She'd just start picking fights with him over small stuff, like dishes or how he would refuse to buy her something she wanted. If something was the tiniest bit out of place because of my Dad, she'd launch into a tirade about how he never does anything right and how he's a stupid, ignorant man. For the record, I always thought my Dad was cool, if a bit spineless. He was very intelligent and taught me how to use a command line from the time I was only 2 years old. It always made me sad to see him pushed around for no good reason. The weirder part is that we were a Christian family, and our church always talked about how the man is the head of the household. (I'm an atheist now and I no longer believe that, just as an aside. No, it doesn't have anything to do with my family situation, it has to do with reason, but I won't get into that right now.) It didn't seem to matter to them, though; despite how religiously dogmatic they were, that was one rule they were content to leave broken.


When I got a bit older, around 14 or so, my Dad lost his previous job and signed up to work for Basement Beautiful, an Owens Corning division that installed this specialized basement finishing system. He wanted me to work with him, and I did. In fact, throughout all of my high school years, even when I wanted to leave the job and try high school again (though I had thought it would be a nightmare just like elementary school), he wouldn't let me and said he needed me to work with him or else our family would go broke. (Oh, one time when I was 12 he forced me to climb Iron Mountain in San Diego, CA...with no water and starting at 4 o clock in the morning, racing me up there before the sun rose and figuratively pushing me back down when I collapsed multiple times. But he just told me ""I'd get over it."" I guess that was the one weird time he was really uncool.)

Anyway, around the Basement Beautiful era is when my Mom truly went insane. She kept demanding that we move from Indiana to Hawaii, even when we came home dog tired from working from 8 o clock in the morning to 2 o clock the next morning. She'd wake up and tell us how stupid we are and how we should just move to Hawaii. My Dad would meekly tell her that we couldn't afford it, and her only response was, ""WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! GOD WILL SORT IT OUT! IT'S WHAT GOD WANTS! HE SPOKE TO ME!"". This would be the conversation they would have every day, no matter how long or hard Dad and I worked when we got home. No appreciation, no love, just more screaming about moving to Hawaii and more insulting us.

The other daily conversation was about the hardwood floor that my Dad had started to put in for my Mom's birthday and didn't have the time to finish. Every day, she'd scream, ""DAVIT! WHY HAVEN'T YOU FINISHED MY FLOOR YET?! WHY?!"", right into his face as loud as she could. She'd break into tears and keep yelling. My Dad's only reaction was to meekly apologize.

Whenever I asked her why she'd do that, her response would be something along the lines of, ""He owes it to me! He gave it to me for my birthday and he never finished it!"". I'd bring up that he's a 58-year-old man who was busting his butt at a physically intensive job, and she'd say, ""So what?! He gave it to me for my birthday and he DIDN'T FINISH IT! That's what matters!"".

Anyway, the company melted after the 2008 housing crash, and me and my Dad found ourselves out of a job. I was done with home school at that point and got my GED to back up my home high school diploma. I started college at DeVry, but quickly dropped out when I realized what a scam that school is and what a sucker I was taken for. In the meantime, my Dad had to desperately look for another job. When he found a really good paying one, he took it, but it was in Indiana. When my Mom found out that my Dad took a job that wasn't in Hawaii, she was furious (what else is new?). She went into a tirade and yelled and screamed even louder than I thought was possible for her. ""WE WERE SUPPOSED TO MOVE TO HAWAII! WE AGREED TO MOVE TO HAWAII!"", she said over and over and over again. I had just about had it, and I stood up for my Dad. Or, at least, I tried. When I started matching her volume, yelling at her about how ungrateful she was (quick note, she doesn't work. Ever.) and how she's crazy to think that we can just move to Hawaii and everything will work itself out. Of course, then I got scolded for that from my Dad. Sigh.

Things didn't get a lot better from that point on. I struggled to find a job, only getting into internships occasionally for computer places. My Mom would relentlessly torture me about it, too, and does even to this day because I'm still struggling to find permanent employment (although things have changed well enough in very recent history, so that's good). She'd scream at me everyday, ""WHY CAN'T YOU FIND A JOB?! EVERYONE HAS A JOB, IT'S EASY!"", despite never being able to hold a job herself, EVER.

Here's a pretty good example of our interactions. I'd try a way to make money online, and being enthusiastic about it, I'd occasionally tell her about it and what I'm trying. (My mistake, I guess...) She would constantly interrupt me and say, ""Well, if it's such a good idea, where's the money?!"" Obviously it was still in process and I hadn't managed to make it happen yet, but she would still shriek it at me in her insanely shrill, witchy, angry voice. She put her fingers in her palm and squirmed them around to signify money and put that gesture right in my face, as if to annoy me on purpose. I got so frustrated that I knocked some of her books over. She then acted incredibly shocked. ""HOW DARE YOU! HOW DARE YOU KNOCK OVER MY BOOKS JUST BECAUSE OF YOUR LITTLE HISSY FIT!"" I tried to apologize, but then she said something she's said since I was a little kid; ""SORRY ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH!"", which got me incredibly agitated and I started yelling at her again. About a week later, I tried apologizing again, and gently tried to explain how frustrating the particular gesture she used was. I said to her clearly that I was just demonstrating it, but she immediately got so upset that she pointed a knife at me.

So to recap; getting angry enough to knock some books over at her gesturing X is unforgivable, but me doing EXACTLY the same thing to her, not even genuinely meaning it, but trying to demonstrate how agitating it is, means that she gets to point a knife at me.

My Dad refuses to listen, despite being a victim of the same bullying behavior. He just says that I should never raise my voice at her, and threatens to kick me out of the house if I ever yell back at her after she yells at me. Even when she shoves me or grabs me by my throat. I have been deeply tempted to slap her, but I have never raised my hand against her, no matter how violent or insulting she is towards me.

Things came to a head recently. She started screaming in my ear about some dishes, and I yelled back, mostly out of surprise because it came out of the blue. So she did something I thought even she wouldn't do; she went to go find my Dad's revolver so she could point it at me. Yes, that's right...she went to find a GUN. Thankfully she never found it, but I heard her looking for it and got scared enough to call the police.

Of course, the cop that showed up was much more obsessed with me being 28 and without a job, so he immediately took my psycho mother's side. He actually told me that even if he found me unconscious on the ground and bleeding if my Mom had hit me with a frying pan, he'd still want to take me to jail. ""Because your Mom is your Mom, and she could make you pay rent if she wanted."" Dumbass hick cop probably couldn't tell his ass from his elbow, not unlike my own mother.

And make no mistake, she IS incredibly stupid, though I never insult her to her face. She's a 7th grade dropout, for fuck's sake! She can barely figure out how to open her E-mail, and she loses things all the time. When she loses her keys and I see them, I just calmly point to where they are, despite deeply wanting to scream at her the same way she does to us. ""WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?! ARE YOU STUPID?!"", she'll say with a sneering look on her face. ""YOUR KEYS ARE RIGHT THERE!"". When I ask her about this behavior, she says, ""I didn't call you stupid! I just asked if you ARE stupid!"" And she really thinks that is a legitimate excuse. She thinks insulting people in this way is okay and normal. That's how dumb she really is!

Oh, and she LOVES to gaslight me. She'll say, ""FUCK YOU!"" over and over again, and then later she'll deny it. ""I never said that! You're just making that up!"" again in her ridiculous, sing-songy, childlike tone.

I don't know what to do. I have tried deep introspection, and I am always thinking about what I can do to make our relationship better, but nothing works. I try to change my habits, but she'll always find some small slip-up to scream at me about. Yelling back, even just to show her how incredibly provoking it is, doesn't work either, because I'll always be seen as the bad guy by everyone else involved, especially my Dad. Her hypocrisy never ends, and I'm constantly drowning in it.

Because of her, the idea of having a relationship is completely poisoned for me. The first time my girlfriend would yell at me, I would immediately want to break up with her and never speak to her again, which is obviously unreasonable. For that reason, I try to find relationships with strictly submissive women who wouldn't even think of raising their voices at me, but I never find any. But maybe I'm too emotionally damaged to even inflict that kind of relationship on someone else. Why should my girlfriend have to pay for the emotional baggage that my mother relentlessly heaped on me? As painful as the idea is, it really is best for me just to stay alone for good. Not that any woman has ever been interested in me, mind you. I want to be happy with that, but a part of me won't let me. Yet, the part of me that won't let hope die is also likely the part of me that will just make some undeserving woman's life complete hell. No one deserves that...

Sigh...I guess I'm finally done. Sorry, I know that was super long, and I'd be really surprised if anyone read it all...it's just left such a deep scar. I don't even really think that getting all of this off of my chest will really cure it, but maybe it'll let me sleep tonight."

As I've never been to Scandinavia and Stockhold really interests me an internship in Stockholm would be absolutely perfect. I am looking for a company related to my field of interest that is Tech/IT. Do you know a company that can use an motivated intern? Please, help me get in contact with them! I have a programming background if you're wondering.

I hope you enjoy it. :)

******

The medics carry off a bloodied Junkrat into the backstage as the two towering LED screens flashed into a clip: a fat, plump man, with his hairy stomach out, was swaggering to the camera, with his one hand beating his chest, the other firmly gripped onto his large, golden trophy.

It was finally the day he has been waiting for. It was the Royal Rumble.

Reinhardt was finally broken from his trance when he heard the referee shout at the top of his lungs: ""Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelcome to the Royal Rumbleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!""

""Standing in the ring at 7 feet, 4 inches tall, weighing in at 754 pounds, from Stuttgart, Germany.... Reinhardt!""

The crowd went wild, and shouted ""Reinhardt! Reinhardt!"" While the armored German bowed to the audience.

""Bring it on! I LIVE for this!"" 

The noise abruptly ended when the entire coliseum went dark, smoke seemingly slowly creeping up on the stage and even the front row seats, as a dark hooded figure suddenly appears beside Reinhardt, and then spins out of control, taking the tank by surprise.

""Ah, Reaper! I should have known it was you."" Reinhardt says with a heavy accent.

Reaper does not say a word, and immediately goes in for a Shadow Step. This time though, his motion was met with a heavy swing which sends him flying off the ring, and out of the competition.

The watchers on the sidelines chant ""Justice! Justice! Justice!"" while he howls ""Justice will be done!"" 

But just before he could celebrate his knock out, a piercing zing and a zap bolted from the backstage -- the next thing Reinhardt knew, a large bomb was lobbed at him and explodes, sending him to the clothesline.

Tracer congratulates herself, as she stalks the bulky piece of armor, looking for an opening. ""Right on target!"" she voices, when a rapid barrage of mini-rockets poured from overhead. 

""Justice rains for above!"" Pharah screams, as she follows up her signature move with a sneaky wrist rocket that knocks the Englishwoman into the sidelines.

Audible disappointment could be heard from Tracer's elimination, but she beamed a large smile at the audience. ""This one's for you, Emily!"" which sends droves of men and women swooning.

With Reinhardt gaining some footing -- thanks to his barrier, which shielded most of Pahrah's shots -- a new challenger calmly walked onto the stage, throwing a flashbang so he could not be preemptively knocked over.

McCree aims his revolver onto Reinhardt, and looks at Pharah. ""Now, hold on. We both want this guy out, right? Now, let me do my darn work.""

Too late -- in a split of a second, Reinhardt was charging like a mad bull onto the bounty hunter. He effortlessly rolls to safety, but the whole ring is now thrown into utter chaos.

""I tried being reasonable, didn't take to it,"" McCree taunts, his face turning red. He fires a whole round from his trusty revolver, Peacekeper, and nimbly dodges all of Reinhardt's failed charges. 

While the two were in a brawl, the sniper distances herself from the fight, doing her best to line up an aerial killing blow on to both of them, when suddenly, a chain hook pulls her off the stage, and out of the competition. ""Grounded!"" he roars among a booing crowd, while he himself slowly climbs on stage.

He boldly declared ""Roadhog time!"", as he carelessly throws his trophy on to the commentators.

With both McCree and Reinhardt significantly weakened and weary, the one-man apocalypse props his Scrap Gun, and lets loose blazing hot pellets which pushes back the two aspirants as they helplessly crumble to the steady stream of shrapnel.

Both competitors down and Roadhog unscathed, he arrogantly bellows ""No pain, no gain, boys. This is why *I* am the champion here. Violence is usually the answer."" The crowd boos yet again, hurling insults and 

Suddenly, the limp and worn out McCree rolls to Roadhog's side. He shifts his gaze to McCree's direction, and Reinhardt took the chance to sneak in a huge Earthshatter, which destabilized the current champion.  As if the world slowed down for Roadhog, who was down on his knees, McCree then flashes a weary smile to the camera, mutters ""It's high noon,"" and mercilessly fires his killshot onto Roadhog.

""I heard there's a nice reward for bringing you fellas in,"" he says as he blows the smoke off his gun.

But his penchant for flair likewise got him into trouble, as the heavily armored man bashed through McCree's body, pinning him to the corner 

""Back, and ready for more!"" he shouts, as he swipes his hammer to propel the bounty hunter off stage.

Ding ding ding!

Reinhardt has just won. The crowd was cheering him on. There was no greater feeling.

The referee went on stage, holding what was once Roadhog's prized possession, and lifted Reinhardt's hard -- or at least, up to where the referee's arms could reach.

""Ladies and gentlemeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen, your NEW, Overwatch Wrestling Champion --""

**Thud.**

A brief case plopped down on stage, and opened to reveal a huge sum of literal cash -- the fabled Payload in the Bank. The owner was cashing in on the opportunity to take down the now-dead-beat-and-drained Reinhardt.

The camera pans to a 19 year-old to the sidelines, in her easily recognizable uniform of predominantly purple, with countless advertisements fighting for space.

""Annyeong!"" D.Va perkily greets, as an imposing machine descends from the ceiling. She hops on the mech, capitalizing on the utter shock of Reinhardt, the referee, the commentators, and the bystanders, to prep herself for the inevitable battle ahead. ""MEKA activated!"" she cheers, as she uses her boosters to jump on the stage and start firing on to the poor supposed-to-be champion.

Reinhardt braces himself for another huge hammer shot, enduring the pings from D.Va's mecha, and successfully breaks through her Defense Matrix -- her shield of sorts -- and manages to destroy the machine.

D.Va ejects, visibly shaken, but Reinhardt was, alas, too spent. The Korean pop culture icon readies her Light Gun, amidst cheering fanboys and even *sasaengs* -- who waited in bated breath for her to finally cash in. She launches a continuous chain of projectiles on the helpless Reinhardt, until he was completely shoved off stage.

The lady looks around, wary for retaliation, but when the crowd finally chanted D.Va's name over and over again, she knew she had finally won the championship title. 

""Viewers from all over the world, we have just experienced a *shocker* of an ending to this year's Royal Rumble. Your *new* Overwatch Wrestling Champion, The 16-Bit Hero, D.Va!""

She excitedly snatches the microphone from the referee, and jumps around the stage, as she greeted everyone with her victory cry: ""*Geim-eul hamyeon igyeoyaji*. (I play to win!)""

**About me**

Hello, /r/GiftOfGames, I'm kennish from the Philippines, 21 years old. I am fairly new to computer gaming. My interest was rekindled last December, when I gifted my girlfriend a copy of The Sims 3, plus Pets, because I remember her telling me stories of how much she has wanted to play Sims ever since. She couldn't find a download anywhere. But during the Steam Winter Sale, I chanced upon the discount, and immediately grabbed it for her. This led me to exploring more of Steam.


During a Christmas party where we stayed over my friend's place, he offered to let me play on his Overwatch account, and I was immediately hooked. Being the KPop and KDrama fan that I am, I opted for D.Va, with my friends making remarks such as ""That's no surprise,"" and ""Of course you'd pick the Korean!"" I hosted some board games that night, and a session of DnD, and played whenever we would take a break, or when they dozed off to sleep.


Since that day, I've really wanted the game, and have followed content, memes and news about it.


**What is Overwatch?**

Overwatch is one of the most-requested game in this sub, according to what I've read. Produced by Blizzard Entertainment, the same makers of Starcraft, Hearthstone, and WoW. It's a team-based first-person shooter game, but instead of rigid roles, there are various heroes with abilities and designs which separate the game from other shooters -- and it definitely lives up to the hype.

Each team is divided into six players, with each team trying to secure a certain objective on the map. And speaking of maps, there are various locations in the game, which makes it all the more immersive.

**What do I like about the game?**

I firmly believe that if you ask any Overwatch players what they like most about the game, they will answer the heroes. They bring a certain quirk to the game, which many other games do not bring. In a manner of speaking, it's like a MOBA game, since each character has his or her (or its) own strengths and weaknesses, and the other team must consider these while engaging.

Okay, I still need to gush some more about character design. Overwatch, not just a game, but rather as a pop culture phenomenon, has made waves throughout the world. Each hero has a backstory which some people may relate to, and Blizzard even follows up the content with comics and cinematics. I've definitely developed a certain attachment to some of the characters, and it's one of the most persistent reasons why I want the game.

**My background**

I hate to leave a sob story here, but aside from my short story, I'll expound a bit. I've always wanted to play computer games (played DotA2 during my internship breaks with my boss), but couldn't due to financial restrictions when I as a student while I balanced some part time work so I wouldn't be much of a bother to my mom. Now that I'm working, life hasn't been the best, but it's improving little by little. I still have two part time jobs, but sneak in gaming during my breaks and weekends, when I have some time to unwind. Our country isn't the most well-off either, so what I earn is usually funneled into living expenses for my mom, sister, and I.


**What spurred me to make this post?**

I would really love to be the most patient gamer, and slowly save up for Overwatch. However, Blizzard has revealed the Chinese New Year event, which comes with some exclusive skins. All my friends immediately tagged me in their D.Va posts. The D.Va skin was really what captured my attention, and now I really cannot shake it off my mind.

Encourage them to share relevant climate science/historical facts on their social media.",Sarcastyx,Political_Revolution,https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/5qb157/if_you_get_tired_of_calling_your_representatives/,"In response to the Trump Administration's anti-scientific suppression of facts, there have been national parks sharing scientific information via social media in order to protest. Badlands NPS, Golden Gate NPS, and Death Valley NPS are such parks.

Call your state's National Parks, and ask to be connected to the social media manager. Tell them that you are a state resident who regularly uses the park, and that you are worried about Trump's fascist suppression of scientific facts. Tell them that you approve of the Badland/Golden Gate/Death Valley twitter trend, and that they should do the same. Offer to do research for them. If they're a natural park, then offer to link them to a couple of climate change studies. If they're a historical monument, offer to look up the average temperatures during the year the monument memorializes, and compare that to the last three years.

This will be effective for multiple reasons:

* Social media managers are almost exclusively millennials or interns, who will most likely be willing to contribute to the cause.
* There is a great level of autonomy afforded to national parks. This can cause them to be able to post scientific facts over social media for an extended period of time before the administration demands removal.
* Few, if any, people call national parks regularly. If there is an inundation of calls, the individual park will be more likely to take them seriously/respond.
* Trump has unintentionally hyper-legitimized social media. By de-legitimizing the regular media and posting almost exclusively on twitter, he's shifted power **heavily** towards social media.

This can happen. Look at the attention that those three parks have gotten. We can literally make a change with this.


If you google ""List of (your state's) National Parks"", you will probably be presented with a list, with the contact info of each park just a click away.

5qce41,8,2017-01-26,[Rant/Vent] FREEDOM IS BEAUTIFUL,WynterTwylight,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5qce41/rantvent_freedom_is_beautiful/,"I've posted in here once, and commented a little, and generally found a lot of support here. 

First, I've got a question: do you all find that you attract Ns as SOs? 

Basically I found this awesome girl. She agreed with me on almost anything and we shared a lot of the same hobbies. After a bunch of deep conversations (we were friends for nearly 2 years before we started dating) I quickly realized she was the closest thing to perfect I thought I could find. She even got along with my shitty N family and all of that. So we started dating. I fell in love. She claimed that she was always in love, and everything was wonderful... until it wasn't. 

Most of you know the story. You basically wake up one day and something doesn't seem right. They're too agreeable. Or a story doesn't make sense. Things like YOU WERE THERE and the story is different now. They copy you, and you start realizing that everything they say is just what you want to hear, and it all suddenly feels fake. 

Basically, I realized quickly (thanks to my Dad--who divorced Nmom and took me with him) that she was totally an N and I felt duped. Like I'd given up a lot of my friends because hers were so much better, and the attention she gave me was so easy to fall into. But I FIGURED IT OUT. So enter the breakup (she broke up with me because I ""wasn't giving her the emotional attention she needed"" and she ""needs twice as much attention than what I can give"". I'm not an emotionally distant person, but geez red flag army appeared again and again. I made the mistake of trying to be friends (she suggested it, so it couldn't be that bad) and that was an awful choice. Enter the whole everytime-things-are-fine-they're-suddenly-awful phase. Last Friday I was at a social gathering with her, and I didn't know anyone but one person besides her there, and she wouldn't stop talking to the one person I did know the whole time amongst putting me down in front of the people I befriended and generally making me feel like shit. 

Now, N-ex had gotten me into writing fanfiction, and used to look over my stuff before I posted it, and I got it in my head that I couldn't post something without her seeing it first. So I quit letting het see my stuff because I didn't want the criticism (it was getting worse towards the end and it wasn't fun to write anymore). By the time she left me, I'd broken away from needing her to edit, and didn't have any negativity from it and actually nothing but good reviews. 

But I went home after that party and did see a harsh review, and the first thing that popped in my head was N-ex's voice telling me (in that creepy, flat tone) ""this is what happens when you don't have an editor"" and I made the decision to go NC because she was in too deep. Like f*** that. No way that's any way to live. 

I'd never done NC before though. Not with my Nmom or her family, because I needed their financial support for college. But N-ex... I blocked her on everything. Snapchat, Facebook, my phone, Tumblr (that's the big one), etc... basically everything but real life. And it was SCARY. 

But geez, I saw her the next day, and just turned around and walked away. She tried to get my attention, but I ignored her for the first time ever and I felt so GOOD after that. Like I'd sprouted wings and was flying. I'd been so depressed about all of this for so long... and now that she's gone I feel like I am my own person again. The best part of running into her was that I could walk away and she could never contact me. I'll still see her around campus, but she graduates in May and got an internship on the other side of the country :)

But through all this, I figured out something interesting. I hate my Nmom for just being awful to me and abusing me growing up, but my dad always told me he didn't hate her, he just pitied her. I wondered why, and I didn't get it until I dated an N, and it's weird. Like, I really don't approve of what my N-ex did, at all. I won't forgive her because she tried to get away with all her crap. But I don't hate her. I just want her gone, and I have that now. 

Inevitably she will try to come back and be all nice and such, but I won't fall for it. Nope. I've got my friends and my good family to make sure I don't too :) 

BUT GUYS I'M FREE AND MYSELF AGAIN AND I FREAKING LOVE THE WORLD AND WAKING UP AND NOT HATING MYSELF!!!!!! 

I'm now on Day 5, and she's tagging me in posts on various social media websites, but since I blocked her they're just empty usernames with no links. My good friends told me about this, and how it makes her look like an idiot. 

AND I DIDN'T EVEN CARE. LIKE SHE CAN DO WHAT SHE WANTS AND HAS NO CONTROL OVER ME!!! 

And no one ever will again :)

TL;DR - Dated a Narc. Finally went NC with them. Best decision I've made in years."

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

Is this reasonable or am I shooting myself in the foot?",SapphoTalk,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5qcz5r/1745_a_month_in_rent_making_72k_before_tax_is/,"I'm a software dev in silicon valley. My salary is low for the average out here, as I didn't sweep any great internships or come from a great school. I'm not sure if I have the potential to move up significantly in salary. 

I don't own a car, so my only fixed monthly expense is my student loan debt, $300 a month. This studio is a great deal for the area, and biking distance to my work. The $1745 includes utilities. I've been searching for a place with roommates, but it is difficult to find anything that's clean, close by, and in my price range. 

Is this too high for me?

My current company is a large government contractor. I work 40 hours a week, have 5 weeks of PTO (3 weeks vacation, 2 weeks holiday) and can adjust my schedule fairly easily. The new position is at a small startup. The work is about 25% on-site and 75% WFH with ""unlimited"" PTO. Can you guys give me your opinions?  

**Current Job**  
* Base Salary: $100,000  
* Bonus: $15,000 (expected, but not guaranteed, based on past performance)  
* 401k Contribution: $11,500

**Job Offer**  
* Base Salary: $120,000  
* Bonus: $0 - $10,000 (no idea how they will do this)  
* Total Compensation: $120,000 - $130,000  

I'm going to reply with a counter-offer, I have a few ideas. I am contemplating just asking for $125,000 base with $10k bonuses, or keeping the $120,000 base with $15,000 in bonuses, but $5,000 paid out as a sign-on. What do you think? Thanks!

**Edit2**: I'm a 26-year old male with a Computer Science degree (Bachelors and Masters) from a top 10 university. I am currently at my first job out of college, with 3.5 years experience there. I also have 4 summers worth of internship experience working for NASA. I've brought in about $2 million to my current employer every year. I do business development (engage with customers, write white papers and proposals) and also execute technical tasks that cover software and hardware, most closely related to ""DevOps"". I am currently based in Washington, DC and commute to Maryland. With my current company, I have to stay in Maryland. With the startup, I will be able to move wherever I want. The startup is offering healthcare (price unknown), dental (unknown), vision (unknown), 401k (unknown how good the options are), and unlimited sick time. Parking at the startup is about $6 a day that I need to cover. There is no relocation bonus. I have a fiance that runs an online business so she can move wherever. The startups proposed bonuses are completely set at the owners discretion. No equity/stock/options."
5qd80o,1,2017-01-26,Whats the point??,cyberdioxin,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5qd80o/whats_the_point/,"First of all, im 23. I havent been diagnosed with depression and google isnt the most reliable source for questions like ""do i have depression"". Im thinking of finally going to a phychologist though cause maybe it will help me a bit. My story goes like this: i was bullied during elementary school nothing that extreme as ive read or heard but i wanted to suicide so badly when i was about 10yrs old, i tried to hang myself but i miserably failed cause i couldnt even do that, im that useless..soo i was crying every single day back then. In middle school i was like a ghost, these were 3yrs of my life that i decided to study hard but i was always mediocre or bad no matter how much time and effort i had put in, i just couldnt understand so many things. High school,, i met my bf when i was 16, he brought light into my life, i didnt have suicidal thoughts since elementary school and when i met him i felt blessed i didnt do it back then. And about that time my problem begins. The educational system in my country sucks but i wont go into details, the thing is that we are paying extra tutorings schools after school to get prepared for the final exams that will place us in some university. And at that last year i just broke, overworked so much and at the last 2 months i couldnt even study, i got 11/20 (i just felt again so shitty for myself), i passed to a uni at a different city, i went there, the first year was the best year of my life, i liked it even though it wasnt my option, not that i had any dreams, i have no dreams and i hate that. Around these 3 yrs i was there, i developed thanatophobia, i couldnt sleep, i have insomnia since i was 17, i was crying and kinda screaming when i was thinking about death and i would sit down and move back and forth to relax. And on the 4th year of uni, i went back to my city, my family home, u see i could stay back there but since i was done with all of my classes, i decided to go back earlier and save more money for my master (i believe a master will make me feel smart cause im just so stupud).Aaaand was the worst decision, i havent regretted anything that much. My mother divorced my father and went to live with her 10year younger bf she had the past 7 yrs, so basically the whole ""family"" that wasnt even a family proved to be absolutely fake, my dad was like shit and a piece in me died seeing him like this, but i also feel my mother cause its just bad being with someone u dont love anymore. So, my mother had to spend some money for her new life and at that time (1 year ago) i basically spend almost all of the money i had aside (the irony) my dad also needed money for me and my sis so i couldnt ask him or my mother for more. I spend 6 months lookin for an internship, i was like shit at that time cause i was doing noooothiiing! And here i am today, im doing my internship in a really cool place (i wanted to go abroad but i also failed to do that) i dont even deserve to be. I dont have money for my master, i still dont feel happy with the things that used to make me happy, i just wanna cry everyday again, thanatophobia + suicidal thoughts, mediocre and stupid, havent achieved anything special for my standards at least,insomnia, i hate that i dont live alone anymore, i wanna get the hell out of this house and my country. The only good thing in my life is my bf i met when i was 16 and i havent told him how i feel inside cause i dont wanna make him sad. And lately im like, whats the point?all the struggle??for what??mediocrity?still not achieving anything??being empty inside??i dont rly know anymorr why do i wake up every morning .."

5qdeds,0,2017-01-26,My road to financial freedom - day 1,gkmagic,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5qdeds/my_road_to_financial_freedom_day_1/,"Day 1

Let me tell you a story. A story that begun many years ago but its most important part starts right now. A story that answers the question - how to be free?

I guess the beginning of this tale should be placed when I was a kid but I'll skip the boring stuff and go straight to the point when I'm finishing my BE in Economics and thinking what do I want to do in my life. After finishing my high school I was so full of life, so happy to learn new things that can help me become a successful person. I didn't know what I want to do but I wanted to be somebody. So I went to a university. I saw all those ambitious students talking about internships in multinational companies, sharing their experience about their projects and stuff. That looked promising. The next day I applied for a job in one of those multibillion dollar enterprises. A corporate. A job for people in suits. At first I was quite excited to learn how that kind of company works. You know, employees sitting in a big office at their desks from 9 to 5. They looked happy so I was happy too. At least I looked like I was. That was the first time that I asked myself - is this who I want to be? Do I want to spend next 20 years sitting at this very desk and considering moving to an office as the biggest achievement of my life?

So I quit. I went on a job interview and got a job in startup. Didn't know a thing about programming but everyday after work in the corporate I sat on my laptop and learned what I needed for an internship. I guess it was enough because I still work there. Of course, now after almost 2 years I got quite experienced but I wouldn't call myself an expert. I still strive to be one. But do I?

I dropped my university thinking that I have no time for learning things that I will never use. It turns out that school doesn't they don't teach you how to be a successful entrepreneur. They want you to be a great worker. Kind of 'Rolling Stones' style. I wanted to learn something that would be valuable in my life. So it's high time to officially start the Financial Freedom Project.

From now one, till the last day of 2017 my goal is to quit my job. Well, I know, I can quit it anytime but you know what I mean. I want to have financial freedom.

How can I do it? It's easy. Sort of. Not really. No.

A change like that is never easy but no one told me that it will. I'm prepared for what's to come.

You'd say - hey, dude, you should have a plan before starting that kind of project. Indeed I do.

Fortunately it's not only me in this project. One of my best friends also realized that working for somebody else is not an answer if you have dreams. He asked me once - where did our dreams disappear? I want to see the world but how could I if my office is the place where I spend most of my life? We need to change it.

So now we take the matter into our own hands.

Let me take you on this journey from starting a company to quitting a job by the end of the year being able to live without the need to work.

Soon I will let you know what will be the first step but now let me get some sleep before heading out to work tomorrow morning. Again. Just like everyday. But, hey, it's about to change, isn't it?

If you already did it, please let me know, any help will be much appreciated.

If my topic doesn't seem right in r/personalfinance, give me a call where should I post i.t"

I'm a 21 male, and I just now got help.  I dealt with a lot of bullying growing up and I have a hard time truly connecting with people.  I have been in a couple of long term relationships that ultimately ended due to the struggles I have with my depression.  Two months ago I met someone that I actually connected with.  It was going really well til I got really depressed again.  At this point, I'm not sure what to do.  I can't keep dating like this but the loneliness is overwhelming.  I can't bring myself to go out with people I've been friends with for years because I don't connect with them in the same way.  On top of all of this the internship that I have that was going really well, moving me into a $65k/yr position has also gone downhill.  I hate where I live, I hate where I am in life, and I have no outlet to meet new people.  I just feel lost in my life.  Hopefully things will turn around but it's hard to see if it will."
5qfliw,2,2017-01-27,23F4A Very horny lady tonight,Naughtybimbo,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/5qfliw/23f4a_very_horny_lady_tonight/,"Hey there everyone, I have a few ideas for some RPs today. First I was thinking of an RP where I fuck daddy while mommy is in the same room (or mommy while daddy is in the same room) so we have to be quiet and secretive about it.

Maybe a scenario where I am a business woman, or supervisor of an office, or something similar. You could be they young intern, or new hire, or an employees child on take your child to work day. Either way we do it things can get very naughty very fast.

If you want we could do something different, maybe I am a housewife in your neighborhood and you've always been attracted to me, and today you finally decide to make a move. I could be your best friends mom.

One idea is that I am an equestrian or a jockey of some sort and I sleep with the horses or am raped by them or something like that.

Another Idea would be a teacher being fucked by her student, willingly or unwillingly. I kind of like adding the idea that she has a fiance and the student gets her pregnant.

Another would be me as a slave master's daughter and you play the slave with a very very large cock. I am in love with you and your cock, but we can't let anyone know how you dominate me when no one else is around

Another would be a bimbofication RP. Maybe taking me from a nerdy or petite and boring girl and turning me into a bimbo who only lives for cock.

Another is where I would play a fairy or pixie or some other variation of very small girl. Where we go from there is up to you. Maybe I am a girl who finds some kind of bug or plant or alien creature and it lays its eggs inside my fertile body.

Another is a scenario in which I play a young woman who maybe is going around selling cookies, maybe as a girl scout and you invite me in so I can tell you more, but that's not exactly what you had in mind

Another still I could be a girl who either you slip drugs into my drink or in some other way force me to take drugs until I am addicted to them. Potentially you could somehow associate the drugs with sex and therefore get me addicted to sex or cock or cum as well.

one scenario that might be fun that fits with this is if you were to play a character with powers like Kilgrave from Jessica Jones, just imagine how much fun you could have with a girl who never says no, even when she doesn't really want it.

Maybe one that features some bondage. Maybe you keep my tied up and have a machine fuck me until I'm raw.

Maybe one where a girl accidentally (or maybe on purpose) summons an eldritch horror and has to worship it for the rest of her life.

Maybe one where I'm a babysitter and things get a little messy, either with the kids or with the parents ;)

Maybe a Rule 34 scenario if you are interested

Any of these RPs would be awesome to play, but feel free to come up with your own RP scenario as well. All of these could be played as consensual or rape as well as adding in whatever kinks you would like. Maybe some raceplay added in as well, maybe some foot stuff. I've had footjobs on the mind for a while. One example that sounds good to me might be beastiality ;) I have a kink list [here](https://i.imgur.com/EsQ0fWk.png) If you would like to look at it. Keep in mind that I have almost no limits so feel free to add whatever you would like ;) in fact the more fucked up and dark the better. I am really in the mood for some very naughty kinky shit. Maybe some extreme bondage ;) I can't wait to hear from you ladies and gentlemen. send me that little orange letter ;)

**P.S. Tonight I am really in the mood to get very fucked up and potentially very violent and gross. I understand that isn't everyones thing so please don't be scared away, but if that is something you are interested in let me know ;)**"
5qfr8j,11,2017-01-27,What got you interested in your field of study?,lalliesaurus,girlsgonewired,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/comments/5qfr8j/what_got_you_interested_in_your_field_of_study/,"When did you firmly decide that your field of study was right for you? 

I always shied away from programming and computer science for the longest time because I felt like it wasn't something I could be good at. I was struggled with math a lot.

I also felt alienated by my lack of experience in comparison to the other students in my introductory courses. Most, if not all of of the male students had taken AP Computer Science or some other course than had exposed them to programming in high school - or they had parents who helped them. I always felt like I was ten steps behind. 

I'm trying to get back into it now, after pursuing a different major for a while, but since I'm a junior in university, I feel like I'm so many steps behind. I only started looking for internships now, and it's been so long since I took those introductory courses that I feel like I'll never be good enough because I'll always be playing catchup."
5qfsaa,6,2017-01-27,"Suicidal, depressed and reaching my limit.",Queenteen94,depression_help,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/5qfsaa/suicidal_depressed_and_reaching_my_limit/,"I graduated from a creative degree last year and have been working in jobs that don't fulfill my needs in the slightest- why do I do these jobs? Because I need to live. I have no outside help.

I did all the right things; internships, unpaid placements, tailored my applications to each job posting and ive received nothing.  This in turn has lowered my self esteem and prospects.

I've had an awful upbringing, an abusive father and step mother. I was anorexic for 3ish years and was never let out of the house except to go to school. When I moved out to my moms she never let us go and explore the world or care about my education. Don't get me wrong, she loved us and is amazing in so many ways, she lost our house due to a failed business and a part of me resents her for this among with other things in the past.

Because of my childhood I've found it incredibly difficult to build relationships with others, and when I do, I come home drained of energy and feel incredibly low. I have tried to pursue my own creative ventures that have just failed because my anxiety kicks in and holds me in my tracks. I just feel completely trapped.

I have a boyfriend who is loving and I'm happy with him. However we have had some serious things happen in the past that constantly puts me on edge and when I do move on from them, something else happens.  Since I've been with him I barely ever see my friends or have time to myself. He stays over all the time which a part of me loves but it means i cant work on my own things, my room is tiny, and when ive brought up the subject he says he will give me my own space but then i feel an awful sense of abandonment. It's a never ending cycle. When I say I meeting someone I feel like he thinks I'm going to cheat (he's been cheated on 4 times, so I can understand his paranoia). We argue all the time because I feel like he's trying to hurt me like the rest. We argue almost all the time and each time breaks my heart and i break down crying. We are barely intimate - he used to shower me with love in the beginning then he just stopped. Thinking back - he has never deliberately done so, and has been the most supportive of how I'm feeling at the moment. 

For the past 3-4 months I've contemplated suicide to the point where I have actually been googling effective ways to do so. I sit in my boyfriends car and barely speak and feel incredibly numb almost all the time. I cry newrly everyday and quite frankly I just want this to end. I want to be happy again even if it's just in one avenue of my life.

I have tried to arrange to see a doctor but it's been incredibly difficult, either something comes up, I'm bed bound and scared or appointments are weeks away. I physically can't afford to pay for a private therapist as I'm learning to drive for my job and that in itself is expensive. I have no support and when I talk to my family about how I feel they never understand. I'm told I'm overreacting which infuriates me. I cry all the time, stare into space for ages, lose focus on my job and the things i want to achieve. I genuinely don't know what I'm gonna do to myself at some point and I could really do with some of you to relate?"

I have BA degrees in International Studies and French but have since abandoned paths related to that to pursue engineering, where I'm around the junior level in my studies. Besides the standard classes for mechanical engineering (CAD, Dynamics, etc) I have a decent amount of internship experience programming in Python, Java, C++ and enjoy working with Linux. My past work experience includes social work and teaching - but I use that as a guideline for what NOT to do since I'm very much an introvert and these kinds of jobs were very difficult for me to do. I may be interested in going outside of the US if there is a need for my skill-set, but as of right now I don't have the engineering/programming degree yet so I'm worried I won't find a job related to that.

5qg5c2,9,2017-01-27,I [21F] am struggling with self hatred due to past and present relationships and having a hard time coming up with reasons to try to love myself anymore.,Iovemepls,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5qg5c2/i_21f_am_struggling_with_self_hatred_due_to_past/,"I apologize in advance for the long post, I'm just really at a loss here. I guess to some extent this is just an outlet for myself, but any advice would be welcome as I’m not sure how to move forward from different events that have happened in my life, as every time I try they seem to repeat.


I was a confident and overzealous kid, surrounding by supportive friends and family. I had so much love in my heart for everything and everyone, and I wasn't afraid of anything.


That person seems so far away now. 


At the age of 16, I got into my first serious relationship...and I fell hard. M was an artist with words and to date the most talented musician I’ve ever met. He was also deeply emotionally disturbed and depressed. I had never been exposed to this before, and a person that I cared about was hurting. I wanted nothing more than to make him happy in any way that I could.


M used to tell me about his past, about his cutting and suicidal thoughts. He assured me that that it was over, that I had made it all better. He put me on this pedestal as his savior and one true love. So when he started to message me in the middle of the night that everything was wrong, that he hated himself and he wanted to die, my teenage brain decided that I was no longer good enough and I had to change to become the medicine he needed again. I spiraled downward into this self-conscious mess that jumped at whatever opportunity they could to patch up another leak in the dam.


This begin to manifest in all sorts of aspects of our relationship, primarily our sexual relationship. We grew up in the bible belt - and premarital sex came bundled with excitement, fear, and true Southern guilt. What started as a frequent endeavor turned into constant rejections on his part. As a horny teenager this was frustrating, but I attributed it to a lowering sex drive due to his depression. Until he confided in me that he was using porn to get off, frequently. My self esteem plummeted, and M noticed. He attempted to remedy or solidify this (I’m still not sure) by initiating, then would deny me once I was hopeful enough to actually ask for it or make a solid attempt at having sex.


M broke up with me after a year of long distance in college (3 years total together), by telling me that he needed to get away from the things that hurt him.


I spent 2 years single in college, without even attempting to date. I struggled with bad depression and anxiety, and had trouble getting myself to leave the house.


Then I did I very stupid thing. In an attempt to overcome my fears of sex and rejection, I decided to form a FWB situation with C. C was a random guy off of Tinder that was the first person that really listened to me. He shared how excited he felt about me, and was also broken from a (much more recent) relationship and I naively decided to trust him. There’s not much to say here - C was a manipulative asshole who was well aware of (and agreed to respect ahead of time) my issues and instead used them to his advantage. He would alternate telling me how deeply he felt about me and it scared him, to telling me he never wanted to see me again and didn’t care for me at all, to trying to convince me to come over for easy sex. 


Now, I’m with T. T is older, established on his own, and more mature. He has let me open up in ways that I’ve never been able to before, and I think I’ve been able to do the same for him. I honestly thought he was a good guy that loved and cared about me, but was practical, not dramatic. He balances me in some very good ways, we have tons of similar interests and hobbies, and he can make me laugh like no one else. I could very easily see us working well not only as a couple, but as a partnership.


T and I met during a summer I spent at an internship. At early stages of our relationship, we’ve had to go through a lot of things that might break up a lot more established couples. Due to me finishing school, being financially dependent on my parents (and them holding that over my head), and dealing with planning my future, we’ve faced a lot of strain. He took a break from work and moved to be with me, but I dealt with more depression and heavy self-deprecation my final semester of school and it was rough on both of us. I ended up graduating a semester early, and am moving back to the same city as before in a couple of weeks. In the meantime, I am at home with my parents while T is already in the city. We’ve signed an apartment lease together and I’ve made a bunch of steps to take better care of myself and my mental state. I’ve started eating better and going to the gym, managing my stress levels, and pursuing things that I enjoy. 


Now that I’m “doing better”, T has begun to share reservations and issues he had during my final semester of college. He felt that it was drastically different than the summer (it was), that he couldn’t talk to me anymore and that I was just an accessory to him, that he was frustrated by our situation, and finally that he was having a bunch of issues about being sexually attracted to me. I gained a fair amount of weight that semester and was / am having an even harder time with my self-image. He says he thinks he has trouble seeing his partners as sexual partners, and that he wants attention from other people. He doesn’t understand it, because objectively he “knows these women are less attractive than me”, but he desires their attention more. He thinks it stems from his last relationship that was largely sexless and broken, and is compounded by the fact that I cannot get off from sex, only oral.


He finally has admitted this is a problem, as he one night flirted heavily with a mutual friend in a game we play online and discussing various sexual things with her in a joking manner, as well as polyamory. She afterwards told me very vaguely about it, and I become upset and confronted him about it. He then got very defensive and told me that he didn’t really do anything wrong, that it happened because he was unhappy with us (see above reservations / issues), that I was choosing to hold on to something just to be dramatic and I needed to let go (approximately 4 hours after I’d learned about this, granted I was still asking for details as they were coming out very slowly), that he really needed a partner that would just trust him (I’ve never to my knowledge displayed any mistrust before this event). He concluded all of this by getting really dark and saying cryptic things, and somehow the night ended with me consoling him and begging him not to leave me. 


Despite this, I somehow still really desire for things to work out with T. I feel like we’ve dealt with an incredible amount of stress that, while it doesn’t excuse this, definitely brought situations that were abnormal and not fair to him. I feel like me finally having a steady place to live, independent of my controlling parents (another, entirely different story that contributed a lot to T’s and my issues) will finally give us the fair shake we never really got.


I am moving, in three weeks, to live with T across the country from everyone I know. I am terrified of what my life is going to be like if we stay together and this continues to get worse. But I am even more scared of managing my life alone in this unstable state.


And I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so broken, unwanted, and useless. I know I’m supposed to find value in myself, but how can I, when 3 very different people have wholeheartedly rejected me not only as a person, but sexually as well. I really wanted to get better, to like myself and be happy, but everything in me is screaming I must be the problem. Nobody is this unlucky, just fucked up. Nobody will ever like me as a person. Nobody will ever find me sexually attractive.


I’m grasping at straws, now, to find reasons to keep trying. What can I do to overcome this and start seeing myself as a valuable person, or should I just give up on ever liking myself?

---
tl;dr: Struggling to find reasons to continue to try to like myself due to repeated emotional and sexual rejections in long-term relationships."
5qh4lb,6,2017-01-27,Guy outside my apartment,Whiskey_neatPlease,creepstory,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepstory/comments/5qh4lb/guy_outside_my_apartment/,"So last summer I landed a paid internship in a small town in michigan. My dad drove me out there with all of my things to live on my own for the summer. I would be living alone and would have only my bike for transportation. This was actually fine because work was 3 miles away, a quaint little downtown area was about 2 miles in a different direction, and I could walk to the grocery store. There were bike paths everywhere too. I had hit the jackpot. 

I am a 5'1"" girl, and even though I lift a lot and am strong, I'm still small and could easily be taken advantage of. My dad is a police officer and was not thrilled that I would be living on my own, but he looked up the crime rate of the city and it was non existent so he felt safer. 

Anyways, I rode my bike to work the same time every morning, went to the gym attached to my work after work ended, then rode home and brought my bike inside so no one would steal it. On Sunday's I would walk to the grocery store literally .1 miles from my apt, and get food for the week. One day, in july, I was walking down the path of my complex to my building after grocery shopping. My door opened to the outside and was on the ground floor. I noticed a guy, about mid thirties, well dressed, with a veteran marines hat on standing in front on the path to my section, looking at the building. When he saw me, he stared at me the whole way. When I reached him I tried to step around but he wouldn't let me. Immediately i got a weird vibe from him. He stuck out his hand and introduced himself, saying he saw me walking and wanted to give me a ride, but instead he drove past me and waited outside my building. He said he had been watching me and knew I didn't have a car because I rode my bike everywhere or walked. I was like yeah I like being outside so I enjoy it, and started going towards my door when I realized he knew what section I lived in, but maybe not what room. I didn't want to go to my door and let him see which room I lived in. I kept trying to say well, have a nice day, bye, stuff like that to see if he'd leave, which he didnt. He got closer and closer to me until I was like screw it im going inside my apartment. As I was unlocking my door he was like, I live upstairs in room 412 or whatever it was, so come to me if you need a ride or help or something. I was like yeah sure, ok.

Next week, I take the company car home because I had a hair appointment and didn't want to be sweaty. This means I didn't go to the gym. I went to my apartment for about a half hour, then walked to my car parked across from my window. I hear legit sprinting behind me as I'm getting into the car. I thought I was going to die, and I turn around and its him, being like where did you get this car? I thought you only had a bike?? I told him I usually left my car at work because I liked riding my bike so much. He shook my hand again for a really long time and tried to talk to me more, and I noped out of there. 

A week later, my bf came to visit me. We got to my apartment from the airport with groceries, and who's sitting on their idling car but this guy, facing the window of my apartment, again around the time I should have been coming home from work. He gets out when he sees me and starts approaching, but then my bf comes around the side of the car and this guy gets in his car and drives away. I never saw him after that. In between all of these events I would see him multiple times in the week coming down the stairs when I would leave my apartment and stuff when I had been there for TWO MONTHS and had never seen him before, and after he saw my bf, I never saw him again. How did he know all this stuff about my every movement and I had never seen him before? Ugh creepy."

This has always been in reference to somebody who has graduated from college or left college.  I'm two years in to my computer engineering degree and currently have 22k of debt between unsubsidized loans and parent plus loans and 3 years of school left at approximately 11k per year.  Since I'm still in school I don't currently HAVE to pay my loans back, but most of my friends do with the money they earn from college jobs and internships.  Should I be sending money I earn rght now back to the loans or investing it elsewhere?"
5qhcmr,1,2017-01-27,"Me [24 M] have had a huge crush on a very good friend [22 F] for a few months now. We have talked about it before and she wasn't looking for a relationship, which I was fine with. Feelings are coming back and I don't know what to do.",ineedathrowawaynowww,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5qhcmr/me_24_m_have_had_a_huge_crush_on_a_very_good/,"I'm a final year student in a Finance course, which is where I met my friend (let's call her Sally) a couple years ago. We very quickly hit it off, and although I noticed she was very attractive and quite the type of girl that I am usually into, I also knew she had a boyfriend of 5-6 years, so I didn't think much of it and moved on with my life.

The next year was a gap year in my curriculum, she went to another country while I stayed in France doing internships, and although we still talked regularly, we kind of drifted a bit for a while.

Fastforward to the start of this term last September. We had started talking again in anticipation, even debating being roommates with a bunch of other friends, but it didn't pan out. We saw each other on the first day back, just the two of us for a couple hours before other people joined us.

From that point on, we saw each other a lot, sometimes in a group, sometimes a lot. We messaged each other constantly, talking about random stuff and whatnot. I don't know what changed during that time, but I started seeing her in an other light. I had heard she had broken up with her boyfriend during the gap year, so I tried to send signals and see if there could be something there. And it really felt like there was. Some of my friends even though we were secretly dating.

After a while I decided to go all in and ask her out. That's when things started to get confusing for me. She told me she did not want to date anyone right now, during the year we were apart she had a rough life crisis (wouldn't tell me the details) which was the reason she broke up with her previous boyfriend, because he could not handle the situation. She was now ""sort of dating"" a guy who had been there during that hard time, but they never saw each other or talked to each other, she told me he was ""a placeholder"" of sorts. She said she was sorry because she could see there was obviously something between us, but did not want to explore it.

It was hard to hear but there wasn't really anything I could do, so I respected her decision and situation and did not push on the subject. We went back to being friends quickly as I thought I could handle it. We kept talking and seeing each other a lot, in the same way as before really, little flirty at times and such.

Now it's been almost three months and I have gone back into full crush mode, and I don't know what to do. I am not expecting anything from her, I don't want to turn into a ""NiceGuy"" and behave like an ass.

It feels like we have reached the same point as before where it feels like there is something between us, but I don't know how to brush the subject. I told her I respected her wishes and I'm afraid talking about it would break that. But at the same time I don't think I can keep going as is, maybe I need to back away for a while.

Also in 5 months school will be out for good, people will go their separate ways, and I'm afraid if I back away now I will lose her for ever, both as a potential love interest and as a friend.

So basically I'm looking for opinions on what I should do, if anything.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: former crush has redeveloped with someone who told me three months ago she did not want to date anyone, I want to find out if the door is still closed as I don't think I can keep being just her friend right now, way too into her."

5qimdo,2,2017-01-27,Mandatory ZTI OSD in school lab question,scrai,SCCM,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCCM/comments/5qimdo/mandatory_zti_osd_in_school_lab_question/,"I am having a semi school environment specific issue with OSD. During the Summer or at other times during the year we need to image an entire workstation lab of machines. I would love to move this ability from our interns and workstation technicians from PXE booting to me deploying a mandatory OSD Task Sequence and doing ZTIs. 

What appears to be happening though, is that any OSD Task Sequence that deployed to a machine before and succeeded will not rerun again.

I have created a Collection for reimaging that is set to ""As soon as possible"" deploy the OSD task sequence to all workstations in that collection. The Rerun Behavior is set to ""Always Rerun"". This does not appear to be working, the machines will image fine the first time but they will not rerun if they already imaged successfully sometime in the past. The Software Center on the workstation will say ""Installed"" and will never run.

Even if I create a new deployment and deploy the OSD Task Sequence to the lab's Device Collection itself it will not rerun if the machine has already been imaged sometime in the past.

Do any other school techs have a setup for how they do lab ZTI OSD for Summer or general refreshes?"
5qixsg,47,2017-01-27,Postpartum Advice – My Breastmilk Pumping Experience and Setup,k_tiara_von_lobster,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/5qixsg/postpartum_advice_my_breastmilk_pumping/,"**Gear**

* **[Spectra S2 pump](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBKFFJM/)** – A friend who just weaned her second baby gave me her Avent pump, but it stopped working one month after the warranty expired. I picked the Spectra up when it was miraculously under $200 on Amazon, and I love it. It’s quiet, and I like the two modes (quick and gentle to get letdown going, slow and strong after letdown). It can be plugged in, but the battery lasts me all week, so I only have to plug it in on weekends. 
* **Avent-style [flanges](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017CYL6YA/) and [comfort breast cushions](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N4R4C46/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)** - I really like the Avent comfort cushions. I got them to sort of work with the Spectra flanges that came with my pump, but they’d pop out and get milk between the cushion and flange. I’m going to be doing this for a year, so I didn’t feel bad about trying out a couple different flanges and setups until I found one that feels good: no pinching, fits my nipples comfortably without getting any areola, makes me look like Xena.
* **4-ounce Avent bottles** – Same friend gave me a ton of bottles. 
* **Pump Bag** – The Spectra oddly doesn’t come with a bag, so I use the one from my friend’s old Avent pump.
* **[Lansinoh breastmilk storage bags](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006XISCNA/)** – I like these better than the Medela ones because they’re much easier to zip and they hold 6 as opposed to 5 ounces. The Medelas have holes at the top so you can hang them from the pump and pump directly into the bags, but the holes make it easy to spill when you pour milk into/out of them.
* **Sharpies** for labeling bags
* **Tide pen** for any spills/splashes on my clothes
* **[Nursing bra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FNJ0CBO/)** – Underwire is not your friend while nursing. These are comfortable, fit great, and have removable lining. [These](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J27DGMU/) are my favorite for overnight.
* **[Hands-free pumping bra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00295MQLU/)** – Take some time to adjust the velcro on the back to the right size, and add the zipper panel in the middle if it helps the holes line up with your nips. I don’t use the straps, which makes it tricky to put on the right side up. I remember the Label is on the Left so I put it on the right way.
* **Nursing pads** – During the first 6 weeks I had oversupply, so I wore [Lansinoh stay dry pads]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TLU5JO/) during the day and [Lansinoh ultimate protection pads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0179BQBP0/) overnight. Now that my production has settled down a bit I wear [Dr. Brown’s pads]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00363M7GI/) during the day and the Lansinoh stay dries at night. The Dr. Brown’s don’t get much love on Amazon, but I prefer them to [Bamboobies]( https://www.amazon.com/Bamboobies-Super-Washable-Nursing-Sample/dp/B01LXD0GFO/). You know that feeling when you rub velvet the wrong way? Imagine that on your nipples. No thanks, Bamboobies.
* **Nipple cream** – In my experience [lanolin]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FNZQHJA/) is like duct tape: it’s great as lip balm or to moisturize cuticles, basically everything except its advertised purpose. I vastly prefer [Earth Mama Angel Baby Butter Natural Nipple Butter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YB62ES0/), also available at Target. Lanolin is like putting butter straight out of the fridge on your nipples; Earth Mama is like room-temperature butter. Much more gentle for your potentially sore nips.
* **Muslin receiving blanket** – Protects my clothes and desk from spills, helps clean up spills, and reminds me of the adorable little baby I’m doing all this for. (Did you just tear up reading that? You might be pregnant.)
* **Book** – I’m reading [Mists of Avalon](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402045.The_Mists_of_Avalon) on my Kindle. It’s the same book I read while nursing her on maternity leave, so I associate it with nursing. It works out really well as a nursing book because it’s long, it’s easy to drop off/pick up at any point, and there are lots of mentions of pregnancy/nursing/motherhood.
* **Mini Fridge** - You’ll probably find a ton of them on Craigslist. If you live in a college town, there will probably be even more available after the spring semester. I waited until after baby was born to get ours, so we bought one online that was shipped to our door to avoid the hour-long voyage to pick up a Craigslist fridge.
* **Gallon-size Ziploc bags** - For bringing bottle assemblies home. I was bringing in a bag each day, but now I keep a box at the office.




**My Pumping Process** 

*Don't be put off by the 20 steps. I'm being very thorough here.*


1. **Put up a sign** on my door that says “Pumping – Back at &lt;20 minutes from now&gt;” *It usually only takes 15 minutes, but this way I’m not rushed, and it’s better to under promise and over deliver*
2. **Refill my water bottle** if it’s low. *Previously I’d put up “Back in 5 minutes” while I got water and switch it to “Pumping” when I got back, but once there was someone waiting for me when I came back with water. It had been 3 hours and I really needed to pump.*
3. **Close and deadbolt the door** *IT intern started unlocking my door while I was pumping once despite the sign. Not cool, dude. Wait the two minutes, come back later, or at least knock.*
4. **Get out pump**
5. **Put together bottle assembly** if it’s the first pump of the day or pull it out of the mini fridge
6. **Put receiving blanket in lap**
7. **Pull down nursing bra flaps** and put on pumping bra over clothes
8. **Apply flanges to breasts**, secure with pumping bra flaps
9. **Start pumping** for a minute or two on the quick and gentle mode to get letdown. Lean my head back, feel my body relax, think about my daughter, and think about the sensation in the nipples to encourage letdown. *When I first started it helped to look at photos/videos of her, but now that I’m used to it and have a comfortable setup I generally get letdown more easily in a minute or so.*
10. **Switch to the slow and strong mode** after letdown
11. **Read while pumping** – I go for a few minutes after the milk stops flowing, which is usually about 10 minutes.
12. **Carefully remove flange**s, using receiving blanket to wipe up any milk on the cushions/flanges
13. **Take off pumping bra**, reclip nursing bra flaps (at home I’ll let my nips air dry but at work I pat them dry with the blanket), and apply nipple butter
14. **Move receiving blanket to desk** and put the bottles on the blanket-covered desk
15. **Remove cushions from flanges**, wipe them down with blanket, and put them in the holder on the back of the pump. *If you refrigerate the assembly between uses you don’t have to clean it each time. I keep the cushions at room temperature because brrrrr.*
16. **Pour milk from bottles into bag**, fold bag to squeeze out air, zip closed, and label with a Sharpie
17. **Disconnect bottle assembly from tubing** and put the assembly in the mini fridge with the bag of milk
18. **Check clothes for drips** (attack with receiving blande pend Tide pen), retie dress, rebutton blouse, etc.
19. **Put pump, pumping bra, blanket, Sharpie, etc. back in pumping bag** and stash in drawer
20. **Open door and remove sign**


**Notes**

* I waited until 4 weeks and started pumping with a manual pump. I used the one that the nurses gave me for free at the hospital, which has a two-handed piston assembly like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Medela-Lactina-Cylinder-Assembly-8007190/dp/B003F0UH0A/) rather than the [standard](https://www.amazon.com/Medela-Harmony-Manual-Breast-Pump/dp/B0006HBS1M) carpal tunnel-inducing style. It worked well--got letdown going, pumped enough ounces--but it took both hands and you can only do one boob at a time. If you're going to be pumping on the regular, get yourself an electric pump. 
* I managed to bank 100 ounces of breast milk by pumping once a day most days from weeks 4 to 13. Most work days I pump 10 to 14 ounces over 3 sessions and baby drinks anywhere from 5 to 20 ounces (averaging about 12) while she’s at her grandparents’.
* I pump around 8:30, 11:00, and 2:00 each day. Here's a post with my full [post-baby workday schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/5qiuue/our_weekday_schedule_with_baby_working_fulltime/).
* US moms: If your plan is grandfathered like mine and doesn't pay for a breast pump, you can sign up for a flex spending account and use pre-tax dollars. Breast pumps and parts are FSA eligible.
* I bring my electric pump into work on Monday, leave it there for the week, and take it home on Friday. There’s not a lot of time in the mornings and evenings to pump, and it’s one less thing to carry back and forth each day. I pump once a day on the weekends.
* I have a manual pump in my car and an extra electric assembly (all the plastic bits and tubing) at the office just in case.
* I pump in my office. It has a lock and a deadbolt on the door. US moms: your employer is [legally required](http://www.usbreastfeeding.org/workplace-law) to provide a “reasonable” amount of time to pump and a private space that is not a bathroom.
* My pump-friendly work wardrobe mostly comprises wrap dresses, button-up blouses over stretchy camis, scoop-neck tops with cardigans, skirts, and pants. I scouted out local consignment shops for breastfeeding- and pumping-friendly dresses. I determined my size in Ann Taylor and Banana Republic wrap dresses, then bought several on Ebay.

5qjq6f,2,2017-01-27,Help me /r/apple! You're my only hope! - Need to recover pictures from special un-syncable section of iPhone,TheAnusOfSauron,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5qjq6f/help_me_rapple_youre_my_only_hope_need_to_recover/,"So I have a customer with an iPhone 6s. It is running iOS 10. At some point a computer with about 8,000 pictures was syncronized with this phone; then that computer died. So the only place these 8,000 photos exists, is on my customer's iPhone.

Since they were put on the phone from a computer that has died, I cannot get the pictures onto another computer. iTunes sync simply ignores the pictures. Windows photo Importer and iPhoto similarly cannot access the pictures in order to download them. When I browse the phone directly, using a USB cable plugged into a Windows machine, the pictures are nowhere to be found. I can only see pictures that were taken by that iPhone, or downloaded via other means.

All of the pictures can be opened and appear to be otherwise healthy on the iPhone.

I've opened a ticket with Apple support, and they tell me there is no way to get them off the iPhone, other than emailing/texting every single one (vomit).

I have considered Jailbreaking the phone, so I can access the filesystem directly and simply drag the picture files off the phone; but I don't think this version of iOS can be jailbroken, and if it could, i'd be afraid it would wipe the photos.

So, does ANYBODY have any ideas on how to get these pictures off the phone, onto a computer... short of hiring an intern and having him email every single one?!

Edit:

I ended up figuring it out. Nobody's suggestions helped, unfortunately. What finally did it was AirDrop. I had to borrow a MacBook pro and get everything happy. It took a few hours but I finally got them over. Now they are backed up to a USB drive and another PC.

Thank you everyone for you suggestions!"
5qkqdd,11,2017-01-27,"Shot in the dark, but any hope is better than none at this point.",Poketrainer132,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5qkqdd/shot_in_the_dark_but_any_hope_is_better_than_none/,"I have recently come to terms with the fact that I am quite depressed.  The worst part for me is how painfully aware of the situation I am and how that knowledge in turn creates a vicious cycle for it to only repeat itself.  At the end of the day, I feel like a few mistakes I made out of naivety has sent me down a rabbit hole that I cannot climb out of.  I will try to tell my story and hopefully someone who understands can reach out a helping hand to pull me out, I mean, what is there to lose?

I graduated from high school at the top of my class and attended one of the most prestigious universities we have in the country.  I didn’t fully understand the point of college at the time, I just thought it was something you did to get a job.  So I took a challenging major that was “in demand” and was somewhat related to things I liked.  I got through just fine, but I spent most of college enjoying the social aspects rather than focusing on school.  I didn’t take an internship and never made a resume while in school.  So when I got out it was rather difficult to find a job.  I was in over my head.  It took over a year but I found one, a good one.

 I was part of a development program and rotated through various engineering roles.  When it came time to come off and become part of the team, my manager showed me an offer of 80,000 but wasn’t allowed to actually print it out and hand it to me.  Other managers also tried to recruit me, but I wanted to part of the engineering team so I waited.  Fast forward 3 months later after sitting in limbo…and I was laid off.  I found out in the email, they had forgotten to tell me.  Obviously that is depressing, but hey I wasn’t fired and got a severance + unemployment.   

I felt like I was going to be at that company for a long time, so I didnt have a linkedIn, an updated resume, or any industry certifications because I expected to work my way up from within based on merit.  It took a while to get that sorted and afterwards I tried to find similar jobs.  Issues were abound as I had not actually held the title I was supposed to, nor did I feel that I had the necessary experience most employers were actually looking for.  Not to mention, it was a rather niche market so there were few if any “exact matches.”  I interview and tried quite hard for a year and got in the final 2-3 candidates for about 7 positions but was not selected.  Admittedly, I don’t really have a “network” to tap which is what everyone suggests doing.  I don’t use social media and it seems ridiculous to me to call up people out of the blue that I haven’t spoken with in a long while to ask for help.  So I did not have the “inside track” for any of those positions.  

Out of desperation I took a bad job installing cable and it was a total disaster.  I worked there for about 3 months and am pretty sure at the end of the day I may have lost money.  It was ridiculous.  That just set me further behind and exacerbated the oncoming depression.  

At this point, I had to move home with my parents.  Very depressing.  But I still tried to find jobs but I wasn’t getting responses anymore.  My job gap had become too long and I was no longer in the actual place that I was applying to jobs for, not to mention there aren’t really any “exact matches” to my previous experience.  Every time I think about the situation I get depressed to the point of paralysis. 

The worst part is, the whole situation has completely drained me of any self-confidence and my self-image is rather poor.  Which makes it hard to “sell myself” to an employer.  Moreover, I am so embarrassed that I have fallen from grace so dramatically that it has created social anxiety.  I am afraid to speak to people I know for fear of them asking “what are you up to now?”  As a result,  I have become a total recluse and have not spoken to hardly anyone in over a year.  

Basically, now, I have no friends because I just stopped talking to them.  Not only do I have social anxiety stemming from shame of disgrace, I also have it from shame of falling out of contact with my friends.  I don’t talk to them because I haven’t talked to them in so long I feel that it will be weird.  So more time passes and makes it even weirder causing the anxiety to grow.

At this point, it really feels hopeless.   Both sides of the issue feed into each other resulting in a supernova of depression.  I’m depressed that I don’t have a job.  I feel that I can’t get a job because I don’t have a job (and haven’t had one for a while now, the old job gap issue).  I’m depressed I don’t socialize.  I don’t socialize because I’m depressed about not having a job.  I don’t have the self-confidence any more to strike out and start anew.  The clock is ticking now on when I will have to pay off the interest free credit cards I took out, putting a sense of urgency and impending doom into everything I do.  

Then I go to start working on ways to get a job but again, as I start, I just see all the reasons no one will hire me and it feels like a completely lost cause, so I get depressed and paralyzed.  The end result of which, is that, I accomplish nothing and just keep doing the same things that fail.  

At this point when I do self-inventory, I am literally 4-5 years behind where I should be at this point because of a long job gap after college and the one I am currently experiencing.  The worst part is, it was always my overarching self confidence in myself and my skills that pushed me through.  But now, I have none and in fact, it feels as though I have the exact opposite.  Instead of there being a voice in my head that says “you got this” there is a voice that says “you can’t do that, you aren’t good enough, they don’t want you.”  

Its gotten really bad I would say in the last 3-4 months.  I have never felt so hopeless, but that’s not why its so bad.  As I said in the beginning, I am quite aware of what is going on…just powerless to make it cease it would seem.  Over the last few months I have completely stopped taking care of myself.  To be quite honest, I can probably count on one hand the number of times I’ve even showered during that period.  

My hope is by putting this out into the ether, someone will have pity on me and help me out.  I don’t have my own “network” to tap into but maybe, just maybe, I can tap into the network of fellow humans suffering from depression.  

If nothing else, writing this has been cathartic.  In fact, it has brought me to tears and I cannot remember the last time I actually cried.  My general strategy is keep everything down and lock the inner door to my soul to prevent from getting hurt.  So at least I have somewhat shared my feelings anonymously and it feels good but still doesn't exactly move me forward.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  Any advice or help is greatly appreciated and is of course the reason I took the time to do this in the first place.

They have asked me to complete a small digital marketing plan before they interview me here. This is what they said

""By January 30, Develop a digital marketing plan to generate paid admissions for a movie of YOUR CHOICE which is now showing or coming soon to [CINEMA] (Please visit our website to select your preferred film) using ALL of the available digital channels; Website, Email Marketing, Paid Search, SEO, Social Media and others.

As part of your plan, we would like to see a projected timeline and your proposed use of a $1,000 budget. You will be expected to describe how you would plan to measure and report on the performance of the campaign, including the measurement tools you would use and an estimate of the expected performance each channel will generate (e.g reach, reactions, likes, opens and click-thrus). Please be prepared to discuss your plan in the event you are selected for an interview.”""

Could someone help me in regards to this bit? I am a graduate with internship experience though i have never created a digital marketing plan myself before so it is a little daunting and i thought i would see if any of you guys could aid me through this process.

They would just require a basic plan, so making some timelines in terms of the budget and how i would go about it. If i can get some advice on what channels, how to go about it and the budget used i could use all that information and put it together for my plan, but at the moment i am a bit stumped because i haven't done this before all on my own.

Thank you heaps in advance, i really appreciate it

I don't really know what's a good place to start or who to talk to. Should I just focus on joining clubs and getting involved? I'm not a CS prodigy by any means but I'm super interested in programming and love seeing finished products/programs. Any tips?

I am a runner and athlete in general so I need a good amount of calories on a daily basis and in the past i have had a lot of starches which I am realizing is not super healthy. I am now trying to work on eating more vegetables and don't really know where to start. 

Right now this is what I am trying to do. Any type of advice on what to to will be helpful. 

breakfast: cereal/oatmeal + banana + rice cake with peanut butter 

Lunch: I want to try and do brown rice with vegetables and chicken and maybe eggs (essentially friend rice with chicken i guess) and just make this in bulk to for lunch every day of the week. maybe add in a bag of pretzels and some granola bars cause I don't see myself being able to give all that up immediately. I am just worried about making it taste not bland and I have no clue what vegetables to get for this. 

Dinner: No clue but I want to try and do the same thing with lunch and make in bulk and then dish it out every night so I have more free time in the evening. I like fish a lot and I knwo it is pretty healthy so maybe something with that? 

i saw a burrito recipe here for massive burritos that were healthy and I will look into those as a lunch time option.
http://imgur.com/a/OPZ8j maybe wasnt here  

main thing I am looking for is what vegetables are cheap/healthy and whats your recommendation on how to prepare them to get the most out of them. Also looking for food that can last awhile if possible.

I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!

────────

Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.

Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well!
I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon!

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Pet Wolf- All credit goes to /u/roughCanid.  This is a simple prompt. The setting; generic fantasy medieval world. You? Any girl you want, be it a princess, huntress, druid, or innocent damsel. Me? Your loving and precious pet dire wolf. I was given to you as a pup, trained by your parents to protect and love you always. I was trained to fight and kill for you, but I was also trained to be gentle with you. As we grew up, we've grown more attached. You'd trust me with secrets, problems, even fantasies, in spite of the obvious fact that I cannot speak to you. Before you knew it, you found yourself in bloom. And with how often we were together, I would be exposed to your scent constantly. Perhaps you wanted this to happen, or perhaps you truly didn't know. But the fact remains that I was a wolf without a mate, and you were a female in heat. My training can only hold so long, and when you least expect it I may revert to a more feral and instinctive behavior. Because as much as I love you, I am still a wolf.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

Transformation- Idea based on this story: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WnxdFRVfWzQinY3VoIgsqX3zvurLk5GZk2HbIDvoVyc/edit?usp=sharing. General idea is that I would play a nondescript college male who is a follower, and joins in with making suggestive comments to you, who happens to be a witch. You curse me so that every time I make a comment to a girl or dont wear the women's underwear you cursed, another part of me turns female."
5qmric,3,2017-01-28,"Need advice on applying for jobs, knowing I have anxiety (and am therefore unreliable)",lezbihonest260,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5qmric/need_advice_on_applying_for_jobs_knowing_i_have/,"Hey, I need help deciding what types of jobs I can realistically apply for.


**My education:** I'm in my second last year of my bachelors of Software Engineering. I'm looking for a 4 month summer internship in Canada (where I'm from).

**My anxiety:** When my anxiety acts up, I get in bad states where I don't leave my bed for 1-3 days at a time. This usually happens every couple of weeks but is completely dependent on how stressed I am.


**My dilemma:** There are lots of software development jobs that I could get for the summer if I don't tell them about my anxiety, but I don't know if I can keep those jobs. I'm a really good worker, smart, and super on top of my shit when I have my anxiety under control, but when I don't, I become paralyzed and stay in bed all day. I'm good at communicating right away that I'm ""sick"" and later catching up, since I'm a hard worker. 


I don't want to set myself up for failure, but I'd also like a job. **Is it a terrible idea to be applying for a full-time summer internship if I don't think I will realistically always show up?**


**My Past Experience:** At my last internship (8 months long), after two or three weeks I started missing work due to my anxiety. I told my boss and coworkers and they were actually really great about it. I just got paid for the hours I did put in. On average it would amount to around 25-30 hr/week (I was trying for 40). I never understood though why they didn't fire me because I felt I was very unreliable. They fired a coworker of mine, but not me.


**My Options** 
* Apply for a full-time summer job, which I could get, but will probably be fired from
* Tell company about my anxiety in the interview, but then I probably won't get hired anywhere
* Look for part time jobs in software development (which are harder to find)
* Look for part time job in another field without stress to get my anxiety under control
* Look for volunteer opportunities, which will likely be far less stressful, and try to get my anxiety under control


Thank you for your help! I really appreciate it!!!"

Allgemeingültige Antwort: *Sollte man aber nicht machen müssen.*

#**""Sich in Linux einzugewöhnen dauert länger, als Windows nach der Installation zu ent-scheißen!""** ~ein Pleb, der Logik nicht nutzen wollte
[False equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence) - der richtige Vergleich wäre Eingewöhnungszeit von Linux vs. Eingewöhnungszeit von Windows von Punkt 0 an, wer mit Linux statt Windows aufwächst, wird das genaue Gegenteil behaupten. Der andere richtige Vergleich wäre Entkrüppelungsdauer von Linux vs. Windows, diese ist bei Linux eindeutig geringer, wenn nicht sogar 0 (abhängig davon, welche Distribution man wählt).

#**""X läuft nicht unter Linux, deshalb scheiß auf Linux!""** ~ein Pleb, der sowas ähnliches wie ein gutes Argument hat
Manchmal ist das korrekt, wobei mittlerweile [Steam viele Spiele mit nativem Linux-Support anbietet](http://store.steampowered.com/linux), linuxkompatible Open-Source-Alternativen zu Software das Original mittlerweile manchmal schon übertreffen (vergleiche Kdenlive mit Windows Movie Maker oder Git mit jedem VCS zuvor oder viele Linux DE's mit dem Windows 10 Desktop) und das [Wine Projekt](https://www.winehq.org/) es ermöglicht sogar nicht-native Spiele wie [Skyrim mit Mods mit fast-nativer Performance zum Laufen zu bringen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqUoR3PvRE). Aber es gibt durchaus Software, die einfach nicht unter Linux laufen will - aber Hand auf's Herz - kein Entwickler wird Linuxsupport in seiner Software als wichtigen Punkt ansehen, wenn keiner Linux nutzt, deshalb müssen zuerst die User Linux annehmen, dann ziehen die Devs hinterher. Und auch so, ist das kein direkter Widerspruch - ein Dualboot-Setup mit einer minimalen Windowspartition für FL Studio, Adobe Premiere usw. und dem Rest unter Linux, ist absolut in Ordnung für den Übergang. Wer aber Linux nicht nutzt, weil es keine Software gibt, weil es keiner nutzt, der verfehlt den Punkt. Wenn man einsehen kann, dass Linux vieles besser macht, dann sollte man es nutzen, auch wenn nicht alle Software direkt verfügbar ist - die Softwareverfügbarkeit kommt mit ausreichender Nachfrage.

#**""Die Linuxcommunity ist feindselig gegenüber neuen Usern, eingebildet und generell unsympathisch.""** ~ein voreingenommener Pleb, der keine normale Konversation mit validen Argumenten führen wollte
Falsch, wer an Linux nicht feindselig als Windows-Masterrace-Fag herangeht, wird in einem der tausend [Foren, IRCs, Subreddits und sonstigem herzlich begrüßt und geleitet](http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Help-With-Linux) - ansonsten erntet man, was was man sät.

##**Wer jetzt bereit ist, es zumindest mal zu probieren: Hier, wie du auf die dunkle Seite kommst**
#**Eine Distribution wählen**
Linux ist kein Betriebssystem. Linux ist ein [Kernel](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2013937/what-is-an-os-kernel-how-does-it-differ-from-an-operating-system). Das bedeutet, für ein komplettes Betriebssystem braucht es eine Hülle mit allerhand Software um den Kernel herum - das Gesamtprodukt ist eine Distribution von Linux. Bekannte Distributionen sind u.A. Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, openSUSE und Fedora. Von diesen Distributionen gibt es wiederum Abkömmlinge, das ist eine Konsequenz der Freiheit von Linux. Jeder kann eine Distribution bauen, das erklärt, warum [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity) so unmenschlich viele Distributionen listet, die größtenteils irrelevant sind - aber es ist gut, dass es diese Vielfalt geben **kann**. Selbst Ubuntu ist an sich nur ein Abkömmling von Debian, der versucht, benutzerfreundlicher zu sein. Distributionen unterscheiden sich in der Software, die sie von Haus aus mitbringen, dem [Desktop Environment](https://www.linux.com/news/best-linux-desktop-environments-2016), d.h dem kompletten UI mit dem der User interagiert (wie z.B Windows' Aero Desktop), dem [Window Manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/window_manager) etc. - das einzig wichtige für den Anfang wird aber das Desktop Environment sein und die Distribution darunter.

#**Wer als Anfänger eine Distribution heraussuchen will, kann sich hieran orientieren**

Zuerst: Man wähle einen Desktop aus. Die relevantesten sind folgende:

* [Unity](https://unity.ubuntu.com/) - der Standarddesktop von Ubuntu, selten unter anderen Distributionen zu finden. Eigen, aber gefällt manchen Usern. Ja, die Leiste kann man auch [nach unten schieben](http://www.howtogeek.com/251616/how-to-move-the-unity-desktops-launcher-to-the-bottom-of-your-screen-on-ubuntu-16.04/).
* [Gnome Shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhY7rpWXm1Y) - einer der beliebtesten Desktops, sehr eigen, aber auch recht benutzerfreundlich und weit verbreitet
* [KDE Plasma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgH1Clgr-uE) - ebenfalls ein sehr beliebter Desktop, wahrscheinlich ein guter Einstieg für Leute, die sich nicht von Windows umgewöhnen wollen und Eyecandy möchten (hat auch ein sehr gutes Dark Theme by default dabei)
* [XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/), ein Desktop der von Haus aus weniger auf Eye-Candy setzt, jedoch extrem ressourcensparend ist, vor allem beliebt bei Leuten mit mehr Erfahrung bzgl. Theming, die holen aus XFCE [ziemlich viel heraus](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/5qm6ev/xfce_trying_a_minimal_life_with_linux_mint/)
* Weitere Desktops, die interessant sein könnten: [MATE](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YHQd5pHyxts/VtIJeABXUHI/AAAAAAAAHMU/1oSQjjDwwhE/s1920/mate-desktop-3.png), [Budgie](http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/solus-budgie-desktop-turns-2-years-old-version-10-is-full-of-goodies-498176-2.jpg), [Cinnamon](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/uploads/themes/V76O-01DZ-DOAP.png)
* Anhand des Desktops lässt sich die Entscheidung für eine Distribution meistens eingrenzen, auch wenn prinzipiell alles unter allem installiert werden kann - meistens ist es jedoch einfacher, direkt eine passende Distribution zu wählen.

Danach: Man wähle eine Distribution, am besten die, die den Desktop direkt mitliefert. Anfängerdistros die sich eignen:

* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) oder ein Ubuntu-Derivat; wer z.B den XFCE Desktop mit Ubuntu will, sucht nach ""Ubuntu XFCE"" bei Google und findet [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/). Die zu empfehlende Version ist entweder die letzte LTS (Long Term Support) Version, wer die Installation lange behalten will, oder die neuste Version, aktuell 16.10 (Ubuntu-Releases erscheinen immer im 4. und 10. Monat des Jahres - 16.10 erschien somit im Oktober 2016 etc.)
* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/de/) ist nicht nur ein autistischer Hut, sondern auch ein Betriebssystem von Red Hat, einer der größten Linuxfirmen weltweit. Meistens kommt Fedora mit dem Gnome Desktop. Wird auch an den Computern des KIT genutzt.
* [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io/de/) ist eine auf Ubuntu basierende Distribution mit sehr sehr sehr sehr viel Detail im visual polish - wenn dein Linux direkt schön aussehen soll, installiere elementaryOS. Der Desktop ist an Gnome angelehnt, ansonsten hat man prinzipiell die komplette Funktionalität von Ubuntu 16.04.
* [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) ist der Klassiker unter den Einsteiger-Distros. Angeboten wird sowohl eine Edition mit dem MATE Desktop als auch eine mit dem Cinnamon Desktop. Weit verbreitet unter Anfängern, sehr beliebt, wird jedoch wegen diverser interner Entscheidungen oft kritisiert. Dennoch zu empfehlen.
* [Solus](https://solus-project.com/) ist eine Distribution, die auf keiner anderen Distribution basiert - es wurde von Grund auf renoviert. Nutzt den Budgie Desktop. Sehr benutzerfreundlich und lightweight, jedoch noch relativ jung und neu, mit Vorsicht zu genießen.
* Auch möglich, aber nicht direkt für Anfänger: [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.de/), eine Distribution für Fortgeschrittene. Vorteile sind die große Menge an Software, die auch noch immer auf dem neusten Stand ist, sowie die Entscheidungsvielfalt. Aus Arch kann man alles machen, jeden Desktop mühelos installieren, etc. etc. - aber auf Kosten der Benutzerfreundlichkeit bei der Installation. Wer ein halbes Jahr aufwärts mit Ubuntu o.ä gearbeitet hat, kann den Schritt wagen, für Anfänger aber nicht zu empfehlen. Wer aber unbedingt die Arch-Vorteile genießen will, kann sich [Antergos](https://antergos.com/) ansehen - dies vereinfacht zumindest die Installation sehr. Von [Manjaro](https://de.manjaro.org/) wird aufgrund vergangener Debakel bzgl. SSL-Zertifikaten abgeraten.
* Wer die Zeit und Möglichkeit hat, soll sich von mehreren Linuxnutzern direkt beraten lassen. Meistens ist eine der oben genannten Distros ein guter Start, oder man testet einfach alles durch. **Bei Linux gilt immer: Ausprobieren. Und sei es nur in einer VirtualBox bzw. KVM.**

#**Wie funktioniert Linux? - Installation**
Eventuell willst du vor der eigentlichen Installation noch weiterlesen, vor allem die Partitionierung wird in den Linux Basics unten kurz aufgegriffen, falls du deine Distribution nicht automatisch partitionieren lassen willst (möglicherweise empfehlenswert bei SSD-HDD-Kombinationen). Das Thema ist an sich viel zu weitläufig, aber für Anfänger ist das Prozedere meistens dieses:

**Entferne vor der Installation alle Wechselmedien von deinem PC, außer das eigentliche Installationsmedium, du überschreibst sonst ausversehen evtl. deine USB-Sticks, externen Festplatten etc.**

* Du suchst dir eine Distribution aus, siehe dazu den Leitfaden oben
* Du brennst die Distribution auf eine CD/DVD oder erstellst einen USB Stick (unter Windows z.B mit [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/?locale=de_DE)) - USB Stick ist allgemein besser, der lässt sich im Nachhinein wieder formatieren und hat meistens mehr als ausreichende Speicherkapazitäten
* Falls du Dual-Booten (zwei Systeme nebeneinander nutzen und beim Boot zwischen ihnen auswählen) willst, solltest du im Vorfeld Platz für deine Linux-Partitionen machen - Partitionsmanagementtools sollten bei Windows und MacOSX vorinstalliert sein, 50GB aufwärts dürften sicher reichen
* Du führst den USB Stick sanft in deinen Computer ein, nachdem du ihn zwei mal wenden musstest, um die richtige Seite zu finden und fährst deinen PC hoch
* Du hämmerst auf deiner hoffentlich mechanischen Tastatur rum, bis du ins BIOS kommst und veränderst die Boot-Reihenfolge so, dass vom USB Stick gebootet wird (hier [ein Guide](https://lifehacker.com/5774997/getting-started-with-linux-how-to-install-linux-on-your-computer) für die Unerfahrenen)
* Es bootet die Distribution deiner Wahl. Von hier an ist der Installprocess abhängig von der Distribution, bei den Anfängerdistros ist es meistens so simpel, dass du hier kaum mehr Hilfe brauchst
* Zu empfehlen: Festplattenverschlüsselung oder zumindest die Verschlüsselung deiner /home-Partition (vergleichbar mit dem Ordner bei Windows, der deinen Namen trägt) - aus Sicherheitsgründen, falls mal dein PC verloren geht oder die Kripo nach CP suchen will. [Passiert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRgQ0W7Nq5A).
* Falls Dualboot erwünscht ist, haben die meisten Installer hierzu eine Option, z.B ""Ubuntu neben X installieren"" wähle dies an, der Rest ist selbsterklärend
* Username etc. wählen, installieren lassen, fertig - du hast ein Linux. Im Falle eines Dualbootes kannst du von nun an beim Boot dein OS auswählen. Meistens installiert sich GRUB. Falls dir GRUB zu hässlich ist - unter Linux lässt sich [alles tweaken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijPb8f7oVXU).

#**Linux Basics I.: Das Terminal**
Ja, dieser Abschnitt muss sein. Selbst wenn Linux jemals so weit ist, dass kaum einer das Terminal mehr ansehen muss, ist es trotzdem sinnvoll, es zu lernen - alles was man sieht und was man nicht sieht, baut auf dem Terminal auf; Dinge können deutlich schneller über das Terminal erledigt werden etc. Deshalb hier die Basics:

* Jede Distribution kommt mit einem Terminal-Emulator, z.B dem Gnome-Terminal, urxvt, Terminator etc. - das sind **alles** gute Terminals, aber jedes mit eigenen Feinheiten. Wenn man ausreichend fortgeschritten ist, wird einen die Wahl des Terminals evtl. interessieren, für Anfänger tut es eigentlich jedes Terminal
* Wer das Terminal nicht in einem einzelnen Fenster haben will, sondern maximalen H4xx0r-Modus erfahren möchte, der drückt die Tastenkombination STRG-Alt-F3, F4, F5, ... etc. - über die Funktionstasten sind ab F3 aufwärts eigene Terminals verfügbar. Damit verschwindet alles, außer ein Terminal im Fullscreen. Wer zurück zu seinem ursprünglichen Desktop will, drückt STRG-Alt-F2. Auf STRG-Alt-F1 läuft für gewöhnlich der Display-/Login-Manager (darüber loggt man sich ein). Über diese Funktionen kann man bspw. 3 User gleichzeitig einloggen und diese können unabhängig voneinander agieren.
* **Verzeichnisse wechseln**: Normalerweise befindet man sich bei jedem Launch eines neuen Terminals im Home-Verzeichnis ~, hier landen alle persönlichen Dateien, vergleichbar mit dem Windows-Ordner der den Benutzernamen trägt. Um das Verzeichnis zu wechseln benutzt man ""change directory"", kurz ""cd"" - z.B ""cd Bilder/"" bringt einen in das Bilderverzeichnis. ""cd ~"" bringt einen immer in das eigene Homeverzeichnis zurück. Wer ein Verzeichnis nach oben wechseln will, benutzt ""cd .."".
* **Verzeichnisinhalt ausgeben**: Da man nicht zwingend den kompletten Content des aktuellen Verzeichnisses auswendig kennt, schafft ""ls"" Abhilfe. Wer noch genaueren Output braucht, benutzt ""ls -lA"". Meistens ist dieser Output farbkodiert, z.B blau für Verzeichnisse, grün für executables etc.
* **Kopieren**: Für das Kopieren einer Datei nutzt man ""cp"", bspw. ""cp porn.mov ~/Videos/"" kopiert das gute Heimvideo in den Videoordner. Wenn man kein genaues Verzeichnis angibt, sucht cp immer im aktuellen Verzeichnis.
* **Verschieben/Umbenennen**: Um eine Datei zu verschieben nutzt man ""mv"" analog zu ""cp"". Will man eine Datei umbenennen, reicht es, sie im selben Verzeichnis zu bewegen, aber den Namen zu ändern, z.B ""mv porn.mov keinporn.mov"".
* **Adminrechte vergeben**: Beim Ausführen von Befehlen/Programmen ist es manchmal notwendig, Adminrechte zu vergeben, z.B weil ein Programm auf geschützte Ordner zugreifen will. Hierzu benutzt man ""superuser do"", kurz ""sudo"" am Anfang des Commands. ""sudo cp porn.mov /"" kopiert somit porn.mov in das ""/""-Directory, was normalerweise geschützt ist. Meistens hat man ohne Adminrechte keinen Zugriff, Ausnahmen sind z.B das eigene Homeverzeichnis.
* **Text im Terminal ausgeben**: Bei kurzen Textdateien ist es manchmal sinnvoll, den Text einfach im Terminal ausgeben zu lassen, statt ihn extra in einem Editor zu öffnen. Dazu benutzt man ""concatenate"", kurz ""cat"". Bspw. ""cat textdatei.txt"" gibt den Inhalt von textdatei.txt aus.
* **Text im Terminal editieren**: Für kleinere Edits im Terminal, z.B einer Config-Datei, ist es meist langsamer, einen richtigen Editor wie Sublime Text zu öffnen, deswegen empfiehlt sich ""nano"" für Anfänger (später kann man dann immer noch ""vim"" oder ""emacs"" lernen) für schnelle Edits. Einfach ""nano textdatei.txt"" ausführen, dann öffnet sich innerhalb des Terminals ein Editor. STRG-O speichert die Datei, STRG-X schließt den Editor, sobald man fertig ist.
* **Programme ausführen**: Jede Software, die unter Linux installiert wird, ist über das Terminal ausführbar, auch wenn sie sich letzten Endes in einem eigenen GUI abspielt. Bspw. Firefox lässt sich mit ""firefox"" einfach vom Terminal heraus starten. Warum das nützlich ist? Firefox gibt im Falle eines Absturzes z.B Debug-Output aus - wird es im Terminal ausgeführt, kann man diesen direkt dort mitlesen und muss nach einem Crash keine Logdateien suchen. Generell ist dieses Vorgehen sehr nützlich für Debugging.
* **Autovervollständigung**: Wer während dem Tippen im Terminal die TAB-Taste antippt, erhält die Autovervollständigung von Befehlen. Das ist einerseits schneller, andererseits weist es einen frühzeitig darauf hin, dass man sich vertippt hat, wenn das Programm nicht gefunden wird. Ein doppeltes Antippen zeigt weiterhin alle möglichen Treffer an.
* **Befehle genauer betrachten**: Befehle sind meistens über Parameter veränderbar, z.B beim Kopieren vor Verzeichnissen per ""cp"" ist es nötig, ""-r"" als Parameter anzugeben, damit rekursiv in alle Unterverzeichnisse geschaut wird. Woher man das weiß? Erfahrung, oder von den Manual-Pages. Diese findet man für jedes Command per ""man &lt;command&gt;"", z.B ""man cp"". Oder man googelt. Euch überlassen.
* **Befehle wiederfinden**: Wer sich grob an die Funktion eines Commands erinnern kann, aber nicht mehr weiß, wie es genau hieß, dem hilft ""apropos"". Angenommen ich will etwas kopieren, erinnere mich aber nicht an ""cp"" - ""apropos copy"" liefert mir eine Liste aller Copy-Tools die installiert sind, inklusive Kurzbeschreibung, darunter auch ""cp"".
* Für weitere Terminal Tipps&amp;Tricks siehe [hier](http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/linux/common-linux-commands/)

#**Linux Basics II.: Software installieren**
Ein großes Argument für Linux ist Paketmanagement. Die grundlegende Idee ist es, eine zentrale Software zu haben, die über Paketquellen (""Repositories"", ""repos"") Programme installieren kann. Es ist eine Art App-Store, nur schon viel länger existent und wer dieses Wort dafür benutzt kriegt normalerweise faules Obst an den Kopf geworfen. Im Falle von Debian/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-basierenden Systemen (elementaryOS, Kubuntu. Xubuntu etc.) ist dieser Paketmanager ""apt"", in älteren Releases (vor 16.04) meist ""apt-get"" genannt. Anhand dieses Paketmanagers wird nun allgemein Paketmanagement erklärt, wer Fedora nutzt findet analoge Commands für ""dnf"", Arch und Gentoo User wissen sowieso was sie tun. Im folgenden sei angemerkt, dass sich in allen aktuellen Distributionen die apt nutzen, ""apt-get"" einfach durch ""apt"" ersetzen lässt. ""apt-get"" funktioniert aber auch weiterhin.

Die Vorteile eines Paketmanagers sind u.a. folgende:

* Zentrale Verwaltung aller Software ermöglicht es, alle Pakete z.B über ein einziges Command zu updaten, da der Paketmanager weiß wo alles herkommt und prüfen kann, ob man auf dem neusten Stand ist
* Da alle dieselben Softwarequellen nutzen und Paketmanagement generell kryptographisch gesichert ist, erhält man eigentlich immer was man angefragt hat
* Keine Bloatware, Toolbars, tanzende Affen, Viagrawerbung etc. - man muss diese Dinge nichteinmal abwählen
* Schnelles und einfaches Finden von Software, oft kein Googeln nötig
* Dependencies von Programmen, z.B Bibliotheken, werden falls nötig automatisch mitinstalliert

Anhand von apt gibt es 4 grundlegende, wichtige Befehle:

* ""sudo apt-get install &lt;Programm&gt;"" - weist den Packagemanager an, &lt;Programm&gt; zu installieren
* ""sudo apt-get remove &lt;Programm&gt;"" - weist den Packagemanager an, &lt;Programm&gt; zu entfernen
* ""sudo apt-get update"" - updatet die Paketlisten, sodass Ubuntu weiß, wie die aktuellen Packages stehen, was geupdatet werden könnte etc.
* ""sudo apt-get upgrade"" - führt das eigentliche Update durch, aktualisiert Software etc.

Ihr fragt euch jetzt sicher - **woher weiß ich, welche Programme ich installieren kann?** - gute Frage. Viele Paketmanager haben eine Suchfunktion, z.B Arch's ""pacman"". Apt löst dieses Problem mit:

* ""sudo apt-cache search &lt;Programm&gt;"" - sucht nach einem Programm in der Cache

Alternativ kann man auch googeln, aber wer hat schon die Zeit dazu?

Wer alternativ ein graphisches Frontend für apt will, der kann das Gnome Software Center nutzen. Irgendwann passiert es jedoch, dass eine bestimmte Software nicht verfügbar ist. Das liegt daran, dass euer Distrohersteller nicht jede neue Software direkt in die Repos lässt, das dient der Sicherheit. Im Falle von Arch gibt es hierzu das AUR, was das Problem einfach löst, im Falle von Ubuntu kann man weitere Repos hinzufügen. Diese findet man z.B über Google, meistens bei Launchpad - googelt einfach ""&lt;was ihr sucht&gt; ppa"", dann findet ihr einen Launchpad-Eintrag mit der PPA, dem ""personal package archive"", eines Users, meistens des Developers selbst. Angenommen ihr wollt die aktuellsten NVIDIA-Treiber - eine kurze Suche nach ""nvidia drivers ppa"" bringt euch [hierhin](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa). Dort steht auch alles, was ihr braucht, um das Repo hinzuzufügen:

* ""sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa"" - fügt das neue Repo hinzu
* ""sudo apt-get update"" - updatet die Paketlisten, damit die neuen Pakete beim Installieren auch gefunden werden

Von hier an kann man ganz normal mit ""sudo apt-get install nvidia-378"" die aktuellsten Nvidia-Treiber installieren. Klar, ist das mit Aufwand verbunden und diese Lösung ist nicht perfekt, Arch macht dies z.B Welten besser, aber ist dafür in anderer Hinsicht zu schwierig für Anfänger. Dafür werden diese Treiber automatisch installiert und von nun an immer mit allen anderen Packages geupdatet. Auch kann man Packages davon abhalten, mit dem Rest geupdatet zu werden, aber das ist ein anderes Thema und lässt sich per Google auch selbst herausfinden. Problematisch ist manchmal, dass vor allem Windowsnutzer gewohnt sind **Programme einzeln auf SSD und HDD installieren zu können** - das geht prinzipiell auch unter Linux, ist aber aufwendig und fortgeschritten - und meistens unnötig, wenn man bei der Installation richtig partitioniert, mehr dazu in Part III.

#**Linux Basics III.: Das Dateisystem**
Linux ordnet vereinfacht gesagt alles unter einem großen Baum an. Ganz oben ist das ""/""-Verzeichnis, alles andere ist darunter - z.B unter ""/home/deinBenutzername"" ist dein Homeverzeichnis. Auf diese Art und Weise wird alles fein sortiert verteilt. Hier ein Überblick der wichtigsten Ordner, falls ihr jemals nach etwas suchen müsst:

* /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin - diese Ordner beinhalten die executables des Systems
* /sbin/, /usr/sbin - diese Ordner beinhalten administrative executables des Systems
* /etc - systemweite Config-Dateien
* /dev - Devices, **nicht** die Mount-Points, wenn ihr auf Geräteinhalte zugreifen wollt, schaut bei /mnt oder /media
* /home - hier befinden sich einzelne Benutzerverzeichnisse für jeden Benutzer
* /usr - hier finden sich die meisten Systemtools, Bibliotheken und installierte Programme
* /var - Variable Systemdateien, z.B Logs sind hier

Um nochmal auf die SSD-HDD-Verteilungssituation zu sprechen zu kommen: Bei der Installation eines Linuxsystems braucht man mindestens zwei Partitionen, eine für Boot, eine für Root. Zusätzlich kann eine SWAP-Partition erstellt werden. Hier lagert das System, sobald der RAM nicht mehr ausreicht, Daten aus, um Platz zu schaffen. Interessant: Man kann einige Directories wie /usr oder /home auf die HDD legen, während der Rest unter Root auf der SSD liegt - damit ist das Betriebssystem an sich auf der SSD, die Programme werden auf der größeren HDD gespeichert. Wer allgemein aber auch für Programme die Geschwindigkeit der SSD nutzen will, sollte alles außer evtl. /home auf die SSD legen, der Platz wird bei einer &gt;200GB SSD ausreichen. Was ist mit Steam? Steam an sich ist das Programm, dass auf der SSD liegen wird, aber die Spiele selbst installieren sich by default in euer Homeverzeichnis - damit ist der größte Speicherfresser auf der HDD. Anderweitige Software ist selten so groß, dass sie die SSD sprengen wird, dementsprechend reicht dieses Setup in der Regel komplett aus und das ""Problem"" ist weitestgehend beseitigt. Für fortgeschrittene lässt sich auch mit symbolischen Links da nachhelfen, aber das ist ein anderes Thema.

#**Wie geht es von nun an weiter?**
Benutz deinen PC. Das ist alles. Linux installiert dir meistens das Wichtigste vor, LibreOffice als Office-Suite, Firefox als Browser, etc. - sogar ein Torrent-Client kommt oft mit. Wenn du Software brauchst, hast du meistens ein Software-Center (Gnome Software Center o.ä) mit dem alles wie von selbst funktioniert. Ansonsten lässt sich über das Terminal **alles** machen. Da von hier an alles von deiner Distribution abhängt, empfiehlt es sich, einfach mal eine Introduction dafür anzusehen, für Ubuntu und Derivate empfiehlt sich [dieses hier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpn1dnDO5Os), was auch nochmal die Installation veranschaulicht. Schau dich in der Hilfe um und bleib neugierig, dann hast du das Wichtigste schnell gelernt.

#**Bereits bekannte Software die unter Linux nativ vorhanden ist, die man evtl. installieren will**
* Unterhaltung: Steam, Spotify
* Produktivität: Audacity, Blender, Bitwig Studio, Gimp, Inkscape, Lightworks, LibreOffice, Sublime Text, TeamViewer, FileZilla
* Web: Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi
* Mail: Thunderbird
* Torrenting: qBittorrent, Transmission
* Messaging: Telegram, Skype, Pidgin, diverse IRC Clients (Quassel, XChat, Weechat), Discord (sowohl Web- als auch Desktopclient)
* File Hosting: Dropbox, MEGA
* IDE's: Die IntelliJ Suite, Eclipse, NetBeans, CodeBlocks, Brackets uvm.

#**Alternativen für Windows-Software**
* Adobe Illustrator: Inkscape
* Adobe Photoshop: GIMP für Bildmanipulation, Krita für Malen/Zeichnen
* Adobe Premiere/Finalcut: Kdenlive für [leichtes Videoediting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIzpXnJZlKU), LightWorks für industry-level productions, Blender für Masochisten
* Microsoft Office: LibreOffice, WPS Office, Google Docs
* Notepad oder jeder beliebige Texteditor: Sublime Text, GEdit, Atom, Vi/Vim/NeoVim, Emacs, Nano, Kate
* WinRar: Linux kommt meist direkt mit einem Entpacker (z.B File Roller)
* DaemonTools: ISO und ähnliche Abbildformate kann Linux direkt mounten
* CAD: FreeCAD
* WinAMP, iTunes, MusicBee etc.: Lollypop, Gnome Music, Amarok, Clementine, Rhythmbox
* DAW's, z.B Cubase: Ardour
* Visual Studio: Texteditor (z.B Sublime Text) + Compiler (Clang, GCC, Javac, je nach Sprache) (+ CMake/Premake, z.B für C++ und C) oder [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Weiteres](http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Linux_software_equivalent_to_Windows_software)

#**Weitere interessante Software, die man von Windows/MacOSX nicht kennt**
* [Plank](http://www.noobslab.com/2014/08/install-plank-dock-and-plank-themer.html), ein Dock, ursprünglich von elementaryOS, sehr minimalistisch, aber erfüllt seinen Zweck
* [TLP](http://thinkwiki.de/TLP_-_Linux_Stromsparen), unter anderem wichtig für ThinkPads, aber nicht exklusiv - verbessert die Stromspareigenschaften von Linux; eine einfache Installation tut meist den Zweck vollkommen, dass man einen Unterschied bemerkt, andererseits lässt sich aber auch alles auf's genauste tweaken

#**Software nutzen, die keinen nativen Linuxsupport hat**
* Schreibe dem Entwickler, dass du gerne Linuxsupport hättest - wenn alle das tun würden, ständen die Chancen für einen Port nicht schlecht und es ist ein Aufwand von wenigen Minuten
* [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/de/), was intern wiederum [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) nutzt
* [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/products), was wiederum eine Art kommerzielles, besseres PlayOnLinux ist

Auf diese Weise läuft auch [Photoshop unter Linux](https://www.bitblokes.de/2014/10/adobe-photoshop-cs6-laeuft-unter-linux-playonlinux/). Oder [Skyrim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqUoR3PvRE). Oder [League of Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUB0soeTAuw).

##**Was tun, wenn Linux breakt?**
Das sollte unter normalen Bedingungen nicht vorkommen. Wenn jedoch z.B schlecht geportete Treiber installiert werden, du per Terminal irgendwelche Dateien gelöscht hast, mit sudo-Rechten um dich wirfst wie ein Verrückter oder sonstige Schelmereien betreibst, dann kann es schon mal sein, dass man beim Boot nicht allzu weit kommt. Folgendes kannst du tun, wenn du einen Blackscreen oder ein wenig weißen Text aber keinen Login-Manager bekommst:

* Benutze STRG-Alt-F3 und logge dich ein. Wenn nur der Display-/Loginmanager abstürzt, kannst du von hier aus per Terminal alles reparieren, Packages entfernen und neue installieren, per Nano/Vim/Emacs Configs editieren usw.
* cd'e in /var/log und schau dich dort in den Logfiles (per ""cat | less"" oder Editor wie Nano/Vim/Emacs) um, ob du nicht irgendwelche Fehlermeldungen findest, die du googeln könntest
* Update dein System, wenn dieser Fehler nach längerem nicht-updaten auftritt
* Schließe eine Backup-Festplatte oder ähnliches an, ziehe mit ""cp"" alle wichtigen Ordner und Dokumente auf die externe (wahrscheinlich unter ""/media"" zu finden), ziehe die Externe ab und installier das System neu, falls gar nichts funktioniert

Falls nichtmal das Terminal erreichbar ist, nutze eine Livedisk wie bei der Installation, schließe den Installer und benutze das Linuxsystem von der CD, um per [chroot dein System zu reparieren](https://superuser.com/questions/111152/whats-the-proper-way-to-prepare-chroot-to-recover-a-broken-linux-installation).

#**Allgemeine Überlebenstipps**
* Benutz dein Gehirn
* Das Terminal ist dein Freund, embrace it und du wirst Glückseligkeit finden
* Wenn du nicht weiterweißt - Arch Wiki, dann Google, dann KitInfo @Tim, @Jannik, @Aaron oder sonst einer, irgendwer wird schon da sein
* Fang mit einer Anfängerdistro an und steige später um auf Arch, außer du hast jemanden der durchgehend deine Hand halten kann, bis du die Installation geschafft hast - oder du benutzt direkt Antergos, aber selbst dann: lass dir die Hand halten. Arch breaks sometimes.
* All distros are created halbwegs equal
* Use the package manager, beziehe deine Installationsdateien so selten wie möglich aus dem Internet
* Linux != Windows &amp;&amp; Linux != MacOS &amp;&amp; Linux != BSD, es ist eine Umgewöhnung, Dinge werden neu und anders sein, aber deshalb nicht schlechter
* Installier deine Updates
* Benutz nicht immer sudo für alles, denk nach ob das Programm die Adminrechte auch kriegen sollte (""Don't always run as root"")
* Dualbooting oder Virtualisierung ist keine Sünde, benutz Windows weiter für alles, was **nur** dort läuft, doch fokussiere Linux
* Lerne einen Terminal-Texteditor außer Nano, entweder [Vim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NUO4JEtkDw) oder [Emacs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VADudzQGvU8).
* Install Gentoo."
5qo4st,7,2017-01-28,Internship threatening to go awry,krirby,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/5qo4st/internship_threatening_to_go_awry/,"Hey guys, hoping for some advice or perspective from one of you, because I don't really know who else to turn to.

Basically, I've been doing an internship in a psych clinic for a few months, and in the beginning it was great, but since they've been expecting me to do duties on my own I've learned I'm falling short.

Basically, I'm dealing with anxiety stuff I never realized was present in me. Whenever I'm in the therapists' chair, 75% of the time I freeze up. Turns out I have a lot of distrust in me and a lot of other stuff I didn't realize was there, and it's preventing me from empathizing with patients. So I freeze up and can't really talk on an emotional level, I just close off.

The problem is I never realized this was going on in me, and I don't think my colleagues/supervisor does either. They sometimes see me doing really well (the 25% of time I feel at ease with patients) so they keep telling me to be more confident. But unfortunately I can't bring myself to that state where I do well regardless of how much I try.

So, I'm now at a bit of a loss what to do or how I can make my situation better. I only have a short time at my internship left and the pressure is starting to get to me, I really wanna fix this but I'm not sure if there are any short-term solutions. I'm thinking about telling my supervisor of course but scared of how he'll react...

Sorry for the blog-post style, just really could use some perspective on this.

5qoi4q,2,2017-01-28,I'm sorry if this is ridiculous but I don't know where else to go,singleseatonthebus,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/5qoi4q/im_sorry_if_this_is_ridiculous_but_i_dont_know/,"I am in love with someone who shows no emotion towards me. 

I am not sure where to even begin or if it even needs to be acknowledged, but I have no one to talk to and I obviously am not good at making my own decisions. 

I met Ted (not his real name) in Aug of 2011. We had just started college and we majored in the same thing- so we spent a lot of time around each other in class. 

At this time in my life, I was a very naive person. I was going into college having never kissed a boy much less anything more then that. Growing up I was a tom boy, and I went to a small school where you most likely had been at the school since you were a baby so every person in my grade I grew up with. I had low self esteem because of this. I never thought boys (or anyone for that matter) would ever like me romantically. I had dreams of having a family (amongst my career and other things) but deep down I believed that is wasn't possible for me so I never told anyone about my hopes. I settled into the idea what having a relationship just wasn't in the cards for me. 3 years prior to me starting college, my parents divorced which added a lot more insecurities to my life. Since 2009 I haven't had a room or a home for more then a year at a time. I haven't lived with my parents since 2009 so I jump from city to city trying to fill a hole inside of myself. 
Anyway, the actual problem. 
I met ted in 2011, he had a girlfriend. Like I said before I was very naive so I didn't have a crush on him at all. I liked him as a person but i would never consider liking him more then that Bc I didn't think it was possible for anyone to want me romantically. 
Slowly something changed, we would talk a lot. Usually about theatre and tv. We ended up being assigned to work on a scene for a theatre competition together, a scene with a kiss in it. This was my first kiss. I really didn't think anything of it but then the weekend of the competition we were in a store and the lady asked if we were dating (he and I are both very sarcastic and we like to shit talk playfully, so I guess she found it cute) when I went to say no, he said yes. 
This was very shocking to me. She said prove it and he kissed me right there. 
I was smitten. 
Still, the dark self hating monster inside of me started screaming and told me to ignore it. So I did.
That night he stayed up all night with me practicing for another part of the competition that I was signed up for. 
The next day we did the competition and then went back to the small town where our school was. He stopped talking to me. It went on for a little over a week and I was so upset. At that point I considered him a good friend. 
I went to his room and confronted him and he told me ""I have been ignoring you because I have feelings for you, and I didn't realize it until the competition. And that's not allowed Bc I have a girlfriend. So I can't be around you"" 
I was shocked so I left and went to my room but he followed me down. He apologized but we still went our separate ways. 
The next week at theatre rehearsal, he pulled me aside and told me he broke up with his girlfriend. 
From that point we began to spend every second together. From February to May of that year we spent the night together almost every night (I lost my virginity in mid- march of that year. 
We would talk about the future and our lives and he made me feel like the most special person in the world. 
In may of that year when we had to leave campus for summer break- he got back together wth his girlfriend. 
I was so heartbroken I reached out to my grandmother and asked her if I could come stay with her. She lived in my hometown so I would be around my friends from high school which in my head, was what I needed to heal. 
I had never been an over emotional person and at this point in my life I had never felt pain like this before. 
To top it all off, I found out I was pregnant. 
I didn't tell anyone Bc I didn't know what to do. In my head I would leave school, stay in my hometown, and raise the baby. - childish. 

I ended up having a miscarriage in late July of that summer. I have never told anyone about it. Not even Ted. 

I went back to school that august and avoided him wth everything I had. I couldn't all the time but I did a good job for the most part. He wasn't mean, he tried to be friends. He apologized for what happened. At one point when I was sick he brought me food and I started crying and he kissed me. I pushed him away and said the name of his girlfriend and he got up and left. 

From then until April 2014 he and I never really talked. We had a thing called ""I owe you one"" where we would make bets (we worked together in the theatre department of our school so we would make bets occasionally-we are both very competitive) and whoever lost owed the winner an ""I owe you one"" which basically was a no questions asked favor that could be as simple as write my essay for class or take me to luck or give me a ride to the neighboring town.

We had a very civil friendship (if you want to call it a friendship) if I was ever upset I could go to his house and we would smoke weed. We never talked about anything too deep. Usually superficial conversations. 

I ended up moving to California April of 2014 (I was depressed and decided moving away from the south would be the best medicine) 

Now jump to July 2015- I was working as an intern for a theatre group in Charleston, SC running social media pages when ted followed the group on Twitter, I didn't think much of it. Ironic but not important in my head. A week later he followed me on my own personal account. A day after that he messaged me. 

He was asking how I was but other then that. Not much was said. But then he asked me for my number. I obliged. From July until nov I talked to him 24/7- texting, calling, and skype. I visited him in NYC that November around my birthday. It was like old times again. We enjoyed each others company, we liked the same things. On my birthday I woke up in the middle of the night and he was holding my hand. My whole body went numb. Something in my head said- he was the one. 

I went back south and he set up an interview with his work for me. So I went between New York and SC 3 times before I ended up moving to NYC in late January 2016. 

I cut him off in late December Bc the week after I left to go back south after my second interview, he posted a Snapchat of his ex-coincidently the ex he went back to summer between our freshmen and sophomore year. 

I was heart broken but I toughened up. I deleted him from my Snapchat to I didn't have to see her and him together and continued to work on my relocation to NYC. (Clarification- I haven't wanted to move to NYC since I was a kid and it was my ultimate goal. I didn't move to NY for ted. But he did help me get a job which I will always be grateful for. 

After I moved to NY we didn't hang out much. I didn't want to get played the same way I was when I was younger. At least in my head. 

April after I moved things changed. Ted started making an effort to spend time with me all the time. We began spending the night together every night. Eventually our relationship turned physical. 

I started getting feelings again and I asked him what was going on between us and he said we are just friends, I'm not looking for a relationship. 

I was heartbroken but he never cut things off. Since April we have spent every second together. We commute to work together, he stays at my place, and I stay at his. He takes me to anything he gets invited to and vice versa. 

It's a very mutual relationship. No one gives any more then the other. Sometimes he pays sometimes I do. 

But still, he says he isn't ready for a relationship. In my head he is already in one. 

Every day he kills me inside. I am so in love with him and he doesn't seem to feel the same. He says he doesn't want to lead me on but then I does. On New Year's Eve he kissed me at midnight. I've never been kissed at midnight before. 

What makes it worse is that when I go to touch him. Not even to initiate anything but just to put my arm around his arm or my head on his shoulder- he pushes my away. 

When I get fed up and I end things he is the one who comes and tries to get me back. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I want an adult relationship, I want someone to love me. I am tired of these games. 

A part of me just wanted to say fuck it and move on but then another part of me still thinks he is the one. 

I know this a lot and I am sorry if this isn't what this thread is for but this is my last ditch effort to get some kind of clarity. 

I'm just tired of living with this broken heart


Edit: I am not saying I want anyone to love me... I'm not desperate. I just want ted to reciprocate. If not I want to know if I'm wasting my time. I feel guilty even thinking about the possibility of trying to meeet someone else. 

Also: I apologize if my post doesn't make sense at times or for any typos. "

------

The four soldiers snapped to attention the moment they caught sight of him. He was powerful. He was stern. He intimidating. He was indomitable, bad tempered, and a legend on the rise. He was the Knight Commander Oriaxus, and he was in a foul mood. 

He'd received the call on his NID shortly after coming on duty. It was a Army Master Sergeant by the name of Ciddeco calling to let him know they'd arrested one of his Rangers. The knight's name was Piedwhar Moonchild, and he'd been arrested for assaulting a pair of civilians while drunk and on duty. Both were court-martialing offenses. If the charges were found to be true, Oriaxus fully intended to take the Ranger to task for his transgression. That being said, he was willing to give the knight the benefit of the doubt. It wasn't unusual for a soldier with a grudge against the knighthood to use his position to settle a score. He had no worries though. There were strict rules on how to deal with the arrest of a knight. If the Master Sergeant or one of her men went too far, they'd surely end up paying the price. Oriaxus was not a man to be trifled with.  

The Knight Commander didn't bother to acknowledge four soldiers waiting for him in the corridor ahead. They were all low-ranking Imperials with none of them ranking higher than a corporal. They were hardly worth his time. They saluted him as they were taught. He dipped his head in acknowledgement and kept walking. Showing them the kindness and respect of a salute just didn't feel right. He had no idea what part they played in the apprehension of his ranger. For all he knew, the grudge he suspected was at play was one of theirs. 

""Commander?"" one of the soldiers greeted as he passed between the four. Oriaxus ignored him and kept walking, forcing the soldier to quick-step out into the middle of the corridor to block his way. The Knight Commander swept him aside with a brush of his armored arm. The soldier recovered quickly and skipped backwards to get in front of the knight again. Oriaxus stopped to study the man he was on the verge of throttling. 

The soldier was more or less the man Oriaxus believed him to be, an unwashed imbecile. The man's uniform was wrinkled and spotted with food from his last meal. There was rust on the hilt of the blade sheathed on his hip. He was unshaven, had yellow teeth, and smelled like old onions. His hair was too long, feathering out over his ears, oily from infrequent washing, and speckled with dandruff. The man was a slob and unfit to wear the uniform he was neglecting.

""You think this is wise?"" Oriaxus asked coolly. 

""My apologies, Commander. Master Sergeant Ciddeco has asked that we intercept you before allowing you access to the prisoner. She wishes to meet with you before giving you leave to interview your man. If you'll accompany us to the Master Sergeant's--""

Oriaxus grabbed him by the throat and squeezed, lifting him off the ground to let the man know just how pissed off he was. He let his armor aid him in his feat of strength, not that he was going to let them know that. There was an advantage in subterfuge. The other soldiers reached for their weapons out of reflex. Oriaxus, however, was the quicker draw. He pointed his halo at the head of the soldier closest to him and dared the others to finish drawing theirs. They froze in place with their weapons half-drawn. 

""Before giving me leave?"" he queried. ""Master Sergeant Ciddeco has no authority to deny me access to my man just like she has no authority to arrest a member of my Order. We do not answer to agents of the empire. We are outside of it."" He gave the soldier he had dangling in the air a hard shove that sent him staggering backwards. ""If Ciddeco has a problem with me questioning my man, she can come to me. Men of my status are not summoned by subordinates and especially not by low-ranking Imperial,"" he snapped. Oriaxus turned on the others and dropped his eyes to the weapons they were palming. When he met their eyes again, each man understood the warning and gingerly moved their hands away. He re-holstered his halo then and resumed his march, his eyes going to the door at the far end that was the interview room where suspects were questioned. The guard he'd shoved was quick to scramble out of  his way, proving that even the shabbiest of soldiers could still be taught.

""The Master Sergeant is going to hear about this,"" the soldier called out after him. ""There will be repercussions for this, Commander."" Then again, maybe shabby soldiers incapable of learning.

""What fear you spread,"" Oriaxus mocked. ""Weak men threaten. Strong men act. We do what needs doing when it needs to be done. There will be repercussions, Corporal. You're right about that, but they'll be geared toward you and your fellow soldiers. They drew weapons on a superior officer, and not just as superior officer. They drew weapons on a Knight Commander of Heidish Order. I'll be testifying at your court-martials."" The four soldiers exchanged nervous looks, suddenly a little less certain of themselves.

""You've never met the Master Sergeant, Knight Commander. This isn't over,"" the Corporal promised.
 
""Shut up, man. We're in enough trouble as it is. Don't provoke him,"" one of the other soldiers hissed, a sandy-haired soldier with a round face and a nose that turned up at the end. He had the orange eyes of a Haifeasian, but the pale skin of a Yortharian. He was a maastizo half-breed.

""He can't threaten us,"" the Corporal disagreed. ""Ciddeco will set him straight. You'll see.""

""Listen to your friend,"" Oriaxus called back in warning. ""Every word you speak only adds to the number of charges I plan on bringing against you."" The Corporal opened his mouth to respond but closed it when his sandy-haired comrade reached out and took him by the arm. There was fear in the eyes of the other three, enough to end the Corporal's tirade. Oriaxus smirked and kept on walking. He loved putting drudges in their place.

Ever since his capture of Magpie, he'd been permitted to write his own ticket professionally. He was in the favor of everyone important associated with that arrest. He knew the arrest was a sham. Magpie had let the Commander arrest him. That was the only way anyone was taking him into custody. But, Oriaxus still got to take credit for it, and it'd done wonders for his career. 

He was asked quite often by his peers and his subordinates privy to the knowledge of the arrest how he managed it. He hated that he couldn't tell the truth. While it was a boost to his career, it was also a lie. Oriaxus seriously disliked the fact that he was taking credit for something he didn't do. When they asked, his habit was to shrug and pivot the conversation away to a less controversial subject. That's not to say he didn't enjoy the perks of the lie. When word gets out that you're the one who captured the Butcher of Sylar, all kinds of doors open. One of those perks he was enjoying right now. He detested interactions with his Army counterparts. Imperial soldiers were beneath him. 

If he made a demand now, they had no choice but to acquiesce. He had the full weight of his Heidish Council of Elders behind him. He could tell them to fuck off without having to worry about being dressed down for it by a superior officer. Yes. Capturing Magpie, despite the fact that it was just for show, had fast-tracked him. There was even whispers around the Battle Command hinting that the Council of Elders and Pemphero were looking to fill a couple of command positions soon and that he was their top pick. He wasn't sure which positions they needed to fill, but the rumor mill had it that one of them was a Knight Marshal position. The other was the position of the Knight Numeric, High Commander of the Paladins. 

He was thrilled by news. Both positions were prestigious ones. There were only six marshals aboard each saucer, each in charge of a hundred levels of the ship. It would be a significant promotion, it being two ranks above the one he held now. He much preferred it to role of the Knight Numeric. He had no wish to become a paladin even though that would technically make him a Brigadier General. He just wasn't a religious man.

Oriaxus understood the need to protect the monastic arm of the Heidish Order. The knighthood had benefited greatly from its relationship with the monks. A knight's ability to resist the psychic attack of an opponent was a direct result of their teachings. Despite that, Oriaxus didn't want to spend the rest of his career protecting a bunch of meditating monks and their Abbots from the nonexistent threats of the other monastic orders. He was a man built for war, for battle, and as a paladin, there just wasn't anyone to fight. The holy wars were over. The launching of the fleet had practically put an end to religious dissension. People were allowed to worship their gods in peace, and if they had a problem with a particular belief paradigm, they could simply move to another saucer where that religion wasn't an issue.

When he grabbed the door handle to the interview room, he found that it'd been locked. That angered him more than the arrest of the ranger. They were treating his knight like a common criminal, like he was a man without honor. He slammed his knee into the door hard. It flew open, giving him unfettered access to the room and prisoner beyond. If the thought the locked door angered him, then seeing the condition of his Ranger threw him into a murderous rage.

The young knight was haggard and sleep deprived. His pouches and sidearm had been taken. His sword had been locked. Oriaxus suddenly felt like speaking to the Master Sergeant, or rather, he felt like throttling the bitch. No one treated his knights like this without suffering in return. The fact that they'd held on to him long enough to deprive him of sleep was troubling. He'd only just received word of his subordinate's arrest. Calling him should have been the first thing that Master Sergeant Ciddeco did after the arrest. It was unheard of. Knights could be detained with a reason, but never interrogated. There were special protocols in place for dealing with these kinds of situations. It was part of the accords negotiated between the Emperor and the Baron. 

The Heidish Order was outside the empire, meaning that its constables and justices had no authority to incarcerate, interrogate, or sentence a knight suspected of a crime. Only the Council of Elders and the Baron were permitted that authority. 

Despite his disheveled appearance and clearly weakened state, the young knight still had the presence of mind to snap to attention in the presence of his commanding officer. He surged out of his seat trailing his manacled hands. They were tethered to the table with a chain. He still tried to salute, but could only drag his hands up as high as his navel.

""Lord Commander,"" the Ranger greeted, a look of desperation in his eyes. Oriaxus marched around the table and drew his sword. He severed the chain tying the Ranger to the table with a swipe of his sword. The cuffed prisoner quickly saluted then presented Oriaxus with his cuffed hands. Oriaxus brought his blade down on the chain with a grunt and growl. The Ranger's hands flew apart, free of their constraints at last.

""Name and assignment?"" Oriaxus barked, eyeing the knight closely.

""Piedwhar Moonchild, Ranger, Yorth Brigade,"" the Ranger reported.

""One of Sergeant Rothman's men, eh?"" Oriaxus responded thoughtfully. ""Do you have no respect for that armor, son? Do you have no loyalty? Has the Order let you down in some way that you feel the dishonoring of it a justifiable act?"" Piedwhar's mouth opened and closed without uttering a word. The man was clearly confused.

""I love my armor, Sir. I love the Order. I love being a knight. If I've dishonored myself, Sir, or embarrassed you with my actions, I apologize. Just tell me what I've done wrong, and I will make amends."" A door to their right opened suddenly, admitting two soldiers. The first was known Oriaxus. It was the dark-haired knight he'd grabbed by the throat out in the corridor. The other he didn't know, though judging by her gender and the sergeant pins on her collar, she was Master Sergeant Cidecco. 

""I believe I requested you attend me before speaking with the prisoner,"" Ciddeco told the Knight Commander crisply. ""There are details of his arrest that you need to be made aware before I can release him into your custody, Commander.""

""I require the key to his manacles, Master Sergeant,"" Oriaxus told her, holding out his hand for the key. I also require a list of the charges you've falsely accused him of."" 

The Knight Commander had what some might call an unhealthy preoccupation with self-image. How others saw him mattered. He'd had a meager up-bringing. His father had been sewage tech. His two older brothers were sewage techs. His little sister and three of his first cousins were sewage techs. Everyone in his family but his mother was a sewage tech. It was embarrassing. It was a lifestyle that was beneath him. The other kids had teased him growing up. He'd suffered more humiliation in the first twenty years of his life than he had in the seven hundred and seventeen years since. 

His mother hadn't fallen into the trap though. She had dreamed bigger, taking a job as a data retentionist for the ministry. Unfortunately for her, she'd been unable to shake of the stink of what her family did for a living. The Knight Commander though, he'd figured out the secret to success early. Put yourself first. He succeeded where his mother failed, but distancing himself from his parents and siblings. As soon as he had his labor card, he went to work for the Ministry just like his mother. He'd started out as a runner for a lesser known magistrate, and worked his way up and into an internship with a Truth Speaker. The more distance he put between him and the sewage tanks on Level 40, the faster he was able to climb. He was now a man with a notorious reputation for doing anything to increase his public image--anything but betray his Order and the knights who answered to him.

While the opinions of others mattered to him, none meant more to him than the opinions of the men he was responsible for. The admiration of Pemphero and Commander Rains was heartening and exciting, but they were nothing compared to the love and respect that his men had for him. That he would never betray. It was what he'd been searching for all his life.

""I really believe we should speak in private,"" Ciddeco urged, stepping aside so that the Commander could pass through the door she'd just entered through. ""My office is close by.""

I was an average dude in high school and university. Never got bullied or anything but wasn't popular. I had friends in high school and I wanted to follow my own path and become a software engineer because I loved computers, developing video games and websites, so I went down that route and lost my friends as our paths were different I guess. I didn't really make friends in university, didn't really get along with the nerdy types found in software engineering beyond school work. Obviously no girls in software, so never got laid unfortunately.


I worked my damn ass off in university. I didn't want to go into debt with student loans so while people were partying and having fun, I was working a full time job or doing internships. If I wasn't studying or working, I was at the gym. I even got in shape, started dressing much nicer, cleaned up my face (no acne, well-groomed hair, beard). I lacked opportunity to get laid because I never had time to socialize and never really had friends to go out with.


I graduated and ended up getting a job with one of the big four (think Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook) so I make decent cash and am pretty content with what I have financially. But really I feel like during this pursuit of money, I missed out on life and especially girls. I have money but I don't even use it, I invest it, it grows but what's the point? I'm alone with no friends, no girls to share my life with. I don't want to flaunt my wealth and make superficial friendships either.


All my hobbies are introverted (reading, video games, gym, programming) so I don't go out anywhere to meet anyone new. I tried making a Tinder account and I didn't get any matches whatsoever except some fat whales and I'm a decent looking guy imo. I met one girl and she was a major party girl with nothing going on in her life aside from the travelling and partying she's done... I can't bring myself to pursue a girl like that. When I was busy working and making something of myself, you were having fun and now you want me to spend my life's hard work on you so I can have sex with you? What's worse is when I realize how easy these girls can have sex without any effort whatsoever where a guy like me who dresses well, fit, is well-off STILL has to put in work and even then can't get laid.


Sorry this is a bit of a rant, Idk, I feel like I'm getting old now and don't really have much to show for experiencing life and haven't had any fun whatsoever."

You can redeem up to 4 of each on your DMR account.  To complete the trade I'd take a picture of the tickets and email them to you.  Then you get the code and upload on your account.

**UV / UltraViolet**  **–  VUDU**  Some movies will only redeem on myuv.com, Flixster, Universal, Fox, Sony and so on.  Most port quickly to the other services and it is rarely an issue.  If I know the quality of the movie it is listed next to it. I verify the codes before sending to make sure they are still valid. If they don't redeem on VUDU I will send you notice or a link of where to redeem.

5qqseo,3,2017-01-28,Spending three months in Iceland (sept to Nov). Have a few questions!,really_really_,VisitingIceland,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/5qqseo/spending_three_months_in_iceland_sept_to_nov_have/,"Hey everyone, I (F24) have an internship in Reykjavik starting in September (I'm British) and so I'm going to be coming out by myself for three months and I'm a bit nervous! I have a few questions... 

1) I was wondering how to make friends! Would it be weird for me to hang out alone in bars? I'm presuming there will be fewer tourists at this time of year... is this likely to be true? Will the locals hate me? If I tried to strike up conversations with strangers would that go well? I'm single so not opposed to using apps like tinder to meet people - is this a thing in Reykjavik?

2) obviously I would like to do things like the golden circle tour etc whilst I'm there - what's the weather like sept - Nov? I appreciate it's gonna be cold but is it going to be light enough during the day to fully appreciate everything? How many hours of daylight am I likely to get? 

3) do you have any tips or recommendations for me as a solo traveller in Reykjavik during this time of year? 

Thanks all! :)"

5qr8a3,7,2017-01-28,Trying to get my life moving where I want and my mom isn't helping (long),justaguymovingahead,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/5qr8a3/trying_to_get_my_life_moving_where_i_want_and_my/,"FTP, throwaway because obvious, blah blah. This is a long one with a lot of background, so I hope you'll bear with me. TLDR at end.

I'm an engineering major who wants to work in renewables (perfect timing, I know). I'm job hunting right now and it's got me really down for various reasons. A bit of backstory before I get into what's happening now.

I had a summer internship after my junior year of college (the company was cool, but I wasn't a fan of the field or the location). I did well and they were enthusiastic about hiring me after I graduated. When I visited them over winter break though they couldn't offer me a job for financial reasons (they later did almost a year after I graduated). Since working for them after I graduated was my plan, I was kind of screwed (for those not in a STEM field, if you don't have a job lined up before your second semester senior year you're pretty SOL since all the summer hiring is done in the fall, at least where I went to school).

So I graduated and went job hunting in a state I didn't particularly like but it was where my ""contacts"" were. I didn't like any of the jobs I applied to and I was getting less help than I'd hoped. So after two months I didn't get any interviews and decided to go to grad school and get my MS while doing research. It went pretty well and I finally got an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to stay at the university after I finished to get my PhD.

I thought my new project was going to be great. It was working with renewables, which is what I always wanted, but it pretty quickly turned out to be not what I'd expected. The machine I worked with was built in a rented out space in a metal shop (loud noises, no heating/AC, lots of smoke, and some other things; all of which don't do well my my anxiety) and my main coworker didn't get along with anyone (myself included). I felt unimportant; the research was co-oped with a company, and they already had a company man doing this before I got on, so I wasn't exactly making any contributions another person couldn't make. My coworker constantly make me feel inadequate, and I felt like I had nothing to contribute to what was meant to be one of the most important tasks of my career. I fell into depression (for the second time in my life) and tried to get off the project the summer after my first year. My adviser asked me to give him some time to try and fix some problems, so I did, but things didn't get much better. A few months later I started feeling suicidal and brought up getting off the project again. Then it got dropped on me that I couldn't switch to a new project in the group and basically had 4 options:

1) Stay on the project.

2) Leave the group and join another professors group.

3) Leave the university and go to another one.

4) Leave graduate school and find a job.

I ended up going deciding to leave graduate school. Joining a research group after leaving another one creates a lot of distrust since your new adviser doesn't know if you'll stick around, and I honestly felt like I needed a break from school. I started job hunting at the end of November and finished up the semester on good terms. I also started getting my depression treated and I'm working on improving my well-being and the quality of my life.

Which brings me to now. I’m still job hunting and out of more than 60 applications so far I’ve only gotten one positive response to my applications and no interviews (I've gotten very little feedback in general, which I’m trying to take as a good sign). I started looking in just one city and was looking at a few specific job types, but I’ve expanded out to 6 major cities and I’m looking at all applicable jobs in them.

For those who have been job hunting, you know it’s stressful, especially the waiting. Most of my family, so I thought, was being pretty supportive and understanding of the wait, albeit my parents are even more impatient than me since they haven’t had to hunt for a job since the 80s. My mom especially has been impatient, and has pushed me to start looking at other cities earlier than I needed to. This added onto my anxiety as I had been spending a lot of time reassuring myself that this is what job hunting is like and that it’s normal to not hear back for a while, and my mom was steadily undoing that reassurance.

Turns out my mom isn’t nearly as understanding as I’d thought. I found out that the company I did my internship with had a posting for a position that I could apply for. It was at their new location though, which was in a city I liked even less than where I did my internship. Additionally, it’s very far away from where I want to settle down and nothing I want to really do is happening in that city, so networking is out of the question. Also, the job won’t get me any relevant experience, so when I decide to move on I wouldn’t have anything to show for the two years I'd be stuck there except some income. I’d basically be in the exact same boat I’m in now, except I’ll be out of touch with the job market and my network, and will have wasted 2-3 years in a job that didn't help me move forward. I'm only recently started getting my depression under control and more than anything I don't want to be stuck in another situation I hate.

I made the mistake of telling my mom about the posting though, since she called the day after I saw the posting. She pushed me to try call up the CEO, since he’d probably be very happy to offer me an interview. I said I’d think about.

An hour later I get a call from a friend, whom helped me get my internship. He gave me a lecture basically about how I need to take any job anyplace I can get one in this market and *city I hate* is where a lot of people are going, even if they don't want to stay there long.

I realized as soon as we started talking what had happened: my mom called him to get him to talk me into applying. I was pretty upset, for obvious reasons and for another I didn’t realize until a few days later (more on that later). The next day my mom texted and asked if I had talked to the CEO, I said I hadn’t and I wasn’t going to apply for the reasons mentioned above; she didn’t respond. 

The day after I get a text from my sister asking about a **job offer I had passed up**. I got pretty angry at that and kinda blew up at my sister (not directing my anger at her thankfully). I explained, much less calmly, to her the reasons I’d told my mom, especially the fact it was a job posting and not an offer. She was understanding, since my mom has been on her lately as well. She was with my mom at the time so she said she’d call me later.

Around this time, I checked the posting again and it was already gone, so at the very least I wouldn’t get anymore crap for not applying. I reasoned that if it had been taken down so soon after I'd found it, then they likely already had their candidate well before I saw it.

A few hours later, I get a call from my dad. At first we just caught up, but I knew where the conversation was going to head, and sure enough it did. He asked if I’m applying for many places and specifically at *big company in original city I wanted*, whom I’d already given an application. He was genuinely surprised to hear that, and even more so to hear that I wasn’t just looking at that city but at 5 others and I had branched the positions I was applying to (even though we’d talked before about all this). He then says that he talked to my mom (surprise surprise)(side note, they divorced 7 years ago and rarely talk; they both live in different states, my mom in the same one where the position was) and she had said I’d **passed up a job offer**. I repeated what I’d said to my sister and mention the post was already gone anyway, probably filled by the time I’d found it. He thinks my mom is getting paranoid over nothing and I’m not at the point yet of taking jobs just because I’m desperate. He said he'd talk to my mom.

Later my sister called and we had a pretty supportive conversation. She was there when my mom and dad talked and basically described that she’d told my dad I was “holding out for my dream job in my dream city and wasn’t considering anything else”. I was pretty pissed when I heard her say this, especially when my mom had told me earlier “I know you’re trying”. So basically she lied since apparently she doesn't feel I'm trying and decided to complain to my sister, dad, and friend, giving her own false interpretation of what was going on. 

It was about then I realized why I was really bothered by this. This was basically a repeat of an event from a few years ago. My mom had figured out a secret of mine (non-standard sexual interest, which she learned about by going through my dresser (this was abnormal for her to do, so far as I know) looking for a present for my sister, instead of asking where I'd hid it, and then finding some private sexual items. I’d only told a few very close friends because it can be easily misunderstood. My mom misunderstood, and decided to tell her own false interpretation of what she found to my sister and my dad, and I only found out about it because my sister confronted me afterwards. I was pretty pissed off when she did that, since it was a very private matter and instead of confronting me about the fact that she’d invaded my privacy and trying to understand what she'd found, she spread hurtful lies to my family. My sister had a long talk with me about it, afterwards she was okay with it though she definitely didn’t understand, and my dad to this day hasn’t brought it up.

My mom called me a few hours ago. She basically ignored the job posting and acted as if nothing had happened; I didn't bring it up either. She asked about generic job hunting stuff and talked about my sister, whom is also going through a big life chance and isn't taking it well, both emotionally speaking and with regards to her preparation. The conversation was just off. It was basically the same thing that happened the last time.

So here I am, realizing that my mom can’t be trusted with any personal details about me and me not trusting her to know what’s happening in my life. As well, I’m also now wondering what else she’s said that’s been a lie and what other details of my life she’s talked about to others, truthfully or otherwise. I’ve trying to decide if I should keep her out of the loop until I start getting interviews, and even then I’m not sure what to do. This is the second time she’s gone behind my back and said hurtful things about me that weren’t true, and it took me more than a year to stop bearing that grudge the first time. I'm becoming less comfortable about being involved with her.

I've gotten a lot of support from my SO, friends, former colleagues, former professors, my sister, and my dad. But it sucks how much one persons' opinion can make all that seem so much lesser.

**tldr**: I'm recovering from depression, quit my PhD program after a year, and I'm trying to get my career started. Job hunting is slow, just the way it is. My mom is making me feel bad that I don't have any interviews yet and passed up a job posting that, while I had a great chance of getting, probably would have made my depression worse and wouldn't further my career. She told people close to me that I was being lazy and passing up a great job offer, basically ignoring my reasoning. I get reminded of another time my mom invaded my privacy and told hurtful things to my family."
5qs6jp,13,2017-01-29,Detroit Lions In-Depth Mock Draft,chaseman421,detroitlions,https://www.reddit.com/r/detroitlions/comments/5qs6jp/detroit_lions_indepth_mock_draft/,"Hey /r/detroitlions, hope you guys have been having a good offseason so far. I’ve been following the Detroit Lions for as long as I’ve been watching football and hope to one day be the Detroit GM. I’m currently an intern with the Washington Redskins but I won’t tell them my allegiances if you don’t. I’ve been following the draft hype pretty religiously and so I wanted to share my thoughts on who I believe we should target in the draft. Please feel free to discuss and disagree but keep it respectful. At the end of the day, I trust our management to draft the best players for our team and bring us our first SuperBowl!
Our picks are as follows: 

•	Round 1, pick 21

•	Round 2, pick 53

•	Round 3, pick 85

•	Round 4, pick 126

•	Round 5, pick 167

•	Round 6, pick 206

•	Round 6, pick 216

I also don’t expect us to receive any compensatory picks so these pics are set in stone. I will try to keep my predictions as accurate as possible based on where I see most players going.


**Round 1, Pick 21**

**Zach Cunningham – LB – Vanderbilt** 

 In 2016, Cunningham had 125 tackles with 16.5 for a loss, three passes batted and two forced fumbles. At 6’4, Zach is a load at ILB and would be a great anchor for our defense for years to come. His presence would likely mean that Whitehead could be kicked outside into a more natural position. As many of us know, Whitehead graded out as PFF’s second worst linebacker. Zach excels in run defense but is also able to cover RBs and TEs when necessary. Although not as polished in his pass defense as his run defense, Zach is a high-ceiling linebacker that can only get better. The one true knock on Zach is his arm tackling. He doesn’t always wrap the ball carrier up correctly or square up to make a tackle. Luckily, these are problems that can be fixed with the right coaching staff……a coaching staff that helped the Lions lead the league in fewest missed tackles. 


**Round 2, Pick 53**

**Gareon Conley – CB – Ohio State**

This was probably my toughest pick to make in this entire draft because we haven’t yet addressed our D-Line and this draft is rich in CB prospects. That said, I believe Conley will be a stud if he’s still on the board around this pick. I’ve seen Conley listed between 6’0 – 6’2 which is solid size for a cornerback. Conley had a coming out party in 2016 as he was tasked with shadowing the #1 receiver on opposing teams and boy did he deliver. On the year, Conley defensed 8 passes and had 4 interceptions. His playmaking was clutch too (looking at you Michigan State). Conley was big enough to press receivers at the line or drop back into coverage. He was equally excellent in man coverage as he was in zone coverage but on the Lions, they’ll ask him to work more on a man-to-man level. With Lawson heading for a contract year, it’d be smart for us to start looking at a possible replacement or someone we can trot out onto the field in nickel/dime packages. 


**Round 3, Pick 85**

**Tanoh Kpassagnon – DE – Villanova**

This might be wishful thinking based on the way this kid has been performing at the Senior Bowl. Tanoh measured in at just around 6’7 and 280 pounds with nearly 35 inch arms and a 84.5 inch wingspan. In case you didn’t know, those measurables are absolutely insane. It was also reported that back in June, he ran a 4.74 40-yard dash. Tanoh also won CAA’s defensive player of the year with 21.5 TFL and 11 sacks. With Devin Taylor coming off a terrible season and set to be a free agent, Tanoh could slide right into his spot at DE across from Ziggy. I have a few knocks on Tanoh. The first knock on Tanoh is that I’m not sure how he’ll do against elite level OTs. With Villanova playing against teams such as Rhode Island and Elon, he was able to dominate their subpar talent. How would he do against NFL O-lines? My second knock on Tanoh is that it appears he’s a little slow off the line and relies too much on his speed to get around blockers. Any great OT in the NFL would be able to neutralize him unless he learns some new rushing techniques. 


**Round 4, Pick 126**

**Montravius Adams – DT – Auburn**

I am a big fan of Adams. At 6’4, 310 pounds, he is a beast. Adams was part of that monster D-Line for Auburn that also featured Lawson. This past year, Adams had 43 tackles, 8 TFL and 4 sacks while constantly facing double teams. He is a physically imposing individual and is fast off the line. Likewise, he was used in lots of stunts during his time at Auburn. With Ngata possibly being a cap casualty this summer, the Lions would be smart to invest in another young DT to put next to Robinson or to be a part of their rotation. My knock on Adams is that he doesn’t appear to always give 100% on every play. Sometimes you see him take on two blockers and still move himself in front of the ball carrier and other times you see him get tied up in a 1 on 1 with a guard or center. Remind you of any other DTs from Auburn? I’ve seen enough from this guy to believe he will be much different than Fairley though in terms of work ethic and consistency. 


**Round 5, pick 167**

**Ryan Switzer – WR – North Carolina**

I know what some of you may be thinking. A wide receiver? Really? Yes, really. Boldin will be turning 37 next October, Andre Roberts will be a free agent and TJ Jones has really yet to establish himself as anything special. Enter Ryan, who by all accounts, has been lighting up the Senior Bowl. At roughly 5’9, Ryan isn’t the most intimidating player. He also doesn’t have the top notch speed that you might expect from most receivers his size. He does however have great hands and a knack for running great routes. This past year at UNC, Ryan recorded 96 receptions for 1,112 yards and 6 touchdowns as the main benefactor of Trubisky-thrown balls. Ryan has shown over this past year and at the Senior Bowl that he has a unique ability to always get open. His ability to studder-step and stop-and-go have made some heads turn at the Senior Bowl (honestly though, check out some of the videos of him from the Senior Bowl). I think Ryan would be a great addition to the Lions. I see Ryan contributing right away on special teams or as a kickoff/punt returner if we decide to let Roberts walk. 


**Round 6, Pick 206**

**Jalen Reeves-Maybin – LB – Tennessee** 

Now this pick excites me a lot. Jalen’s full talents weren’t on display too much this past year as a shoulder injury limited him to just a few games of action. During his junior season though, he recorded 105 tackles, 14 TFL, 6 sacks and 4 passes defensed. Jalen is a tad smaller, coming in at roughly 6’0 and 225 pounds. However, he is an absolute beast especially in the open field. He uses his quickness to get past blockers and blow up run plays or screen passes. He is a sure tackler and due to his lack of size, has a knack for wrapping up the ball carrier around the legs. His closing speed is deceptively faster than the 40 time he is expected to run (somewhere in the mid-4.7s). Jalen is best suited for a 4-3 defense and would do well on the weak-side. The main knock on Jalen besides his size is his unproven ability to defend against the pass. Jalen defensed only 4 passes during his entire 4-year career. He reminds me of a poor-mans DeAndre Levy. I think with the right coaching, Jalen could be our biggest steal of the draft. 


**Round** **6,** **Pick** **216**

**Joe** **Mixon** – **RB** – **Oklahoma**

Were it not for his off-the-field troubles, Mixon would be easily gone by day 2. He is arguably one of the top 3 RBs in this draft class. However, several NFL sources have said that Mixon won’t be drafted at all. Mixon is an all-around great RB. He rushed for 1,274 yards this past year with a 6.8 YPC average and 10 TDs. Furthermore, he caught 37 passes for 538 yards and 5 TDs. At 6’1 and roughly 225 pounds, Mixon is a load to bring down and yet he plays so fast for someone his size. I expect him to run a 40 around the 4.48 – 4.54 mark. In the open field, Mixon is sure to make someone miss with his combination of spins or jukes or hurdles. He is an electrifying player who could very well push Washington off the roster due to his poor showing this past season. At his size, Mixon could be taught to be a great pass protector as well. I genuinely believe this man feels remorse for his actions and I think he would be an excellent addition to our backfield and might even push for some solid playing time during the season. Overall, Mixon is a great runner/pass catcher and doesn’t fumble much (looking at you Abdullah). He would be a steal at this pick.

Currently I am really drunk because I am unable to coop with myself for the first time in my life. I transferred recently from a community college to a very prestigious university (worldwide recognition) in California. I am going to go off on a huge rant, I was debating to post this to depression subreddit but thought this was better suited because i many of the things I'm about to say I am unable to confide in friends due to lack of close friends. Probably going to rattle off from most desire to get off my chest to least. Thank you in advance to everyone who replies in case I am unable to remember my newly made log in credentials.

1
I have the most caring and loving girlfriend in the world. She is truly an angel, loves me unapologetically, like true unconditional love. I've cheated on her multiple times and yet I can't break up with her. Her brother died in a tragedy and along with a whole bunch of family drama, I can't break up with her because I feel as though she needs me in her life to keep her emotionally stable. She's a smart girl, the relationship has been going for about three years, but I honestly stopped being fully committed after a year. Part of me wants her to be happy and not be depressed in the unfortunate life that she had. Another part of me doesn't want her to be happy with someone else. I don't know what to do, I am not looking for sympathy, only guidance. I realize how despicable I am, but I don't know how to approach it. In addition, she is taking care of my dog who I love very much. My dog was neglected by my brother, who I tried getting to take care of him before I went off to university, but he refused to. I truly love my dog but I know if I leave him with my parents he will be neglected due to their work schedule. She takes care of my dog, and loves him a lot. I would not shed a tear if she kept my dog after a break up because I would know he is being well taken care of. Sorry for the disorganization. 

2
I have very little friends. I had a very close knit of friends due to the sport we played together but after a year in being in puppy love, I lost the close connection to them. At university, I joined a fraternity, due to a friend from high school who pushed me into it, but got dropped almost at the end of the pledge process. Turns out I got dropped mostly because the person in charge of the pledge process had a personal dislike for my friend, primarily due to his lifestyle of doing drugs and having a poor GPA. He dropped me and tried having my friend dropped but failed because he was a more established member, unlike me. All the friends I had within the few weeks of college, all of a sudden vanished. I live in an apartment, barely off campus, but have unable to have a social life as a result. In highschool I have felt like an outcast before, but eventually I found friends due to the sport I joined. This is the most outcastish? ive felt in my life. 

3
Ive have almost no motivation to study for my classes. Admittedly, in community college, I developed an adderall habit, eventually going to the doctors to secure a prescription. I truly have ADHD, but adderall has not benefit for me anymore. I lost all motivation to succeed in my field of study, despite having taken 3 internships at the community college level while working and going to school. At the university I am at, it is a top school for my major, yet I feel no motivation to study for my midterms next week. Instead of studying, I chugged a bottle of wine. I literally hit rock bottom. I am ashamed of myself due to the economic struggle my parents faced to come to the USA to give me a better opportunity. I still face an economic struggle, but despite a better opportunity, I am wasting it away in self-loathing. My mother has a history of professionally-medical diagnosed depression but idk if thats relevant or not.

In sum, I truly feel like I hit rock bottom. So much opportunity but I don't try to accomplish anything. I am seriously in a bad place right now. I don't know what to do. If you think I am a piece of shit, seriously, let me have it. I need blunt truth.

5qsil4,16,2017-01-29,"It's been a year with the sleeve for me, jotting down my thoughts and would love feedback.",IHadWLS,wls,https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/5qsil4/its_been_a_year_with_the_sleeve_for_me_jotting/,"Hey guys,

I had the sleeve done in January 2016.  I'm considering doing a regular AMA about it, just wanted to get your guys perspective first.  Your thoughts, questions, things that I could include and/or clarify in my 'diary', etc.

First, I should thank this community.  I lurked here and asked a couple questions on an alt, and you guys were very helpful.  It's been a year, and I am down to 250 pounds.  I can't even remember the last time my weight didn't start with a 3.

I'm a 23/24 year old male that weighed 375 pounds in January 2016.  I then had the sleeve done and a year later I now weigh 250 pounds!

**What is a Sleeve Gastrectomy vs Lap Band?**

The Lap Band is essentially an adjustable silicon ring that goes around your stomach.  It is slowly tightened with further appointments to allow you to get used to eating less.
The Sleeve is a similar idea, but a lot more permanent and 'head on'. A good chuck of your stomach is cut out and a smaller stomach 'pouch', or 'sleeve' is fastened.  Any food you eat is automatically slowed down. The first few months you are gradually re-increasing the size of your stomach.  Because your stomach is so much smaller, you feel full after a much smaller portion and you also stay full longer as the food goes 'down' slower.  The average amount of food is about a half sandwich now and I feel full.

**Why am I sharing this?**

I feel that Weight Loss Surgery (WLS) has a lot of preconceived notions about it that discourage a lot of people form looking into it. Some of it is true, most of it applies only to a certain type of surgery.  By no means is WLS a magical or 'cheating' way to lose weight while still eating crazy amounts of food.  And /r/loseit will gladly tell you that it's possible to lose weight without it. (Great community there by the way as well).  If you are new to losing weight there is no question you should be starting there - intake is most of the formula. If you can control your intake using their tips you will be well on your way to a healthier weight.

That said, some people can't do it. If you've given a fair shake and feel you need a tool, that is the point of the sleeve or lapband. (There is gastric bypass also and is a little more extreme).  They are tools to help you not feel hungry and control intake. Nothing more, nothing less.

I also met some people that clearly need other help: Chronic snackers. If you are literally walking around with a bag of chips in your hand most of the day, the Lapband or sleeve will not be as effective. The point is to make you feel full and NOT continue eating.  Slowly snacking all day bypasses the whole point of these operations.

##Life now:
[Chart because Reddit.](http://imgur.com/a/XtTwH)

No question I feel much better.  My feet problems alone are due to genetic issues and probably won't go completely away, but the difference I feel is amazing.  
I was on vacation for a few weeks that required hours of walking around - and I was able to take it like a champ, if I do say so myself.  125 pounds prior, there was no way in hell I would have been able to do it.

Clothing I've gone from a 4-5XL to an XL. It's amazing. I have a much larger selection on amazon. I can go to normal stores and buy in the normal section.  It's been way too long since I could just pick a pair of pants at a store.

The hardest part now, at least for me, is listening to your stomach and not your brain.  My brain will still insist that I must finish the plate. It will still insist that I should be hungry. It will still insist that I should go for seconds and thirds.  It will insist that I can't just accept that 50-75% of that awesome sandwich is enough.  You must eat the whole thing.  But I now have an easy tool to tell it to shut the fuck up.

Typical meals for me now:
* Breakfast: 1 scrambled egg with veggie sandwich (If thick bread, will only eat 75%) or 2 egg omelet with cheese and veggies - no bread.
* Lunch: 1 slice of pizza.  Or 1 health shake. Or bowl of soup and a couple crackers. Or a piece of salmon. Or tuna and some crackers.
* Snack: Handful of cashews. Or a kind bar. Or a cookie (occasionally).  Or a pear/apple. It's much easier to make some hunger pain go away with even a simple swig of diet snapple.
* Supper: Slice of meatloaf. Or piece of chicken. Or Salmon. Or Burger (Full w/o bun, or half w/ bun). Or large salad.

Long-term consequences:
* Change of appetite.  There were very few foods that I disliked before the surgery.  Now, there is a fair numbers that I simply don't feel like eating.  My feeling is these are food that before I simply was OK with, but now that I have to decide what to 'spend' my space on I feel it's not worth it.
* Very very occasionally carbonated drinks - even then let it sit in the cup and allow most of bubbles out.
* No drinking and eating at same time.  I couldnt imagine dealing with this, but the truth is you eat so little anyway its doable. A sip of water to clear your throat after the meal is fine. 
* 5 minor scars.

Prior story/and lightly-edited journal:

#Previous attempts and journey
I was always heavy, as early back as first grade.  I would run around, play some sports, but ultimately enjoyed sitting and reading or geeking on the computer more.  While I did not particularly eat unhealthy foods (e.g. soda was a rarity in my house), I simply enjoyed food.  Even if the food I was eating was 'meh', I couldn't stand the sight of not having an empty plate. (An interesting psychological note possibly, as my parents were not constantly telling me to finish my plate. I'm wondering if it simply came from being a standard statement on TV/kids shows and movies.) 

As I got older and actually attempted to lose weight, I noticed my big hurdle: I was always freaking hungry.  It didn't matter if I had salad or steak for supper.  Within an hour, I could eat the whole meal again.  As long as I wasn't stuffed, I could, and felt I should, eat.  Eventually I managed to get myself to mostly only eat at mealtimes.  But once I had an 'excuse' to be with food (i.e. eat a proper meal) I would be eating as much as possible, trying to push off hunger pains as much as possible.

Through high school and a couple years of college I had tried various diets and exercise. (Low Carb and Atkins come to mind).  They all did jack for one main reason - I was always hungry, and eventually I couldn't take it anymore. The most I lost by regular dieting (which was almost a year of mostly soup, salad and fish with at least some daily walking) was about 30 pounds.

Exercise was another issue.  You always walk around tired.  It doesn't matter what exercise you do, if even walking up a flight of stairs make you feel like you need to take a nap.  I also genetically have an issue with my feet that pretty much guarantees my feel will get sore easily.  The weight obviously makes it worse.

Both exercise and hunger being a hurdle for me made motivation from /r/loseit not last long.  It was a constant fight, and for me personally, I could not juggle it and life at the same time.

Bottom line, I felt I was done. I was too tired to exercise and was tired of the constant uphill battle to eat minimal amounts of food.  While on diets, I became grumpy and miserable from hunger pains all day, further reducing any extra exercise.  

#Spring 2015 (~375 pounds)
At this point I'm 20/21 and halfway through college. College would at least have the benefit of requiring significant amounts of walking as it's large campus.  Further, since I can't exactly walk around with a fridge I would be forced to make do with what was in my lunch bag or budget; therefore I at least saw some weight loss in college.  It was still maybe 10 pounds a semester and it would come right back in the summer.  In previous summers I worked with kids.  Some running around with them you would think I would lose weight, but sadly it was only a few hours each day - and even of that few hours there was only minimal running I could do before being totally winded.

#Summer 2015
My first proper internship. Sitting on my ass for 8 hours a day, no longer at least running around with kids outside. I realized this was it.  I'm approaching 400 pounds.  If I don't figure another method out, I'm doomed to have catastrophic health issues.  I already have feet that cause me pain and had slightly elevated blood pressure. Both my parents have diabetes and one parent has a history of heart disease in the family. Diets weren't working and I now didn't have energy OR time to exercise. (Time between the now 8 hour workday + other family obligations).

In short, I felt I was screwed.  

Finally, I asked my doctor about WLS, something he was hinting at me to do for a while already.  I had heard many mixed things about it.  I had known people who had done the lap band with many mixed results.  He said (knowing I research anyway) to read up on both the lap band and sleeve, and we would talk about it - that way I can get my questions out at once.  He also referred me to a hospital that has a whole program helping overweight people (not only surgery, diet plans and the whole nine yards).  

I read up on it, including reading probably this entire subreddit.  It sounded plausible.  I then visited the hospital.  Had a very nice sit down where they asked what I've tried doing and the like.  To be very clear - they did NOT push the surgery.  Surgery only became the sole topic once I basically said that if I tried another diet and failed I would probably totally give up. I did not have enough motivation left to continue this constant uphill battle by myself.

The next step was a seminar, given by one of the surgeons who does the surgery.  A chance to hear it straight from the 'horse's mouth'.  He told us he himself had the lap band.  He said a huge issue is the constant availability of food. If you are constantly hungry, why fight it? A couple taps on your phone and a few pies with thousands of calories show up at your door.  At this point I felt like he was talking to me - being always hungry was definitely the main issue from my personal POV.

*insert personal struggle about surgery vs. giving diets one more shot*

I decided to... heavily consider it.

#Fall 2015
I met with my Doctor and my main question (most were answered just by listening to the seminar and google) was lap band or sleeve.  Many sources say the sleeve is more successful, but is that anecdotal?  The lap band sounded safe and reversible in a worst case scenario.

He finally told me what probably finally made me go for it: With the lap band, about 50% of patients have issues with it.  While he feels most of the failures were simply probably not doing it right and following instructions (notably, the lap band requires many follow up visits to get it tightened), the simple number was that when it came to the sleeve *he didn't have single patient who failed*.  Sure it worked better for some then others. But they all lost a significant amount of weight.  

Surgery was set for January 2016.

In the interim was much paperwork with insurance and the like.  All that can be said here was I'm glad my hospital was a fairly big one - they knew all the details already, were very professional and communicative on exactly what was needed.  I also had to go to a couple other doctors to make sure previous health conditions wouldn't effect the upcoming surgery.  Finally I had to see a therapist to... I don't know. Make sure it wasn't all in my head?   (A supposed reason is lots of people have surgery for 'fun').

#2 weeks and two days prior.
Ordered a ton of fast food with a friend and stuffed our faces.

#2 weeks and one day prior.
Went to a restaurant with family and stuffed my face.

#2 weeks prior.
Diet begins mainly to shrink your liver.  Two weeks of soup, a couple cups of salad. Mostly protein shakes.  
This time period was not unbearable.  I had what to keep me busy (preparing for finals etc.) and this time period went by pretty quick. Also helpful, the protein shakes were surprisingly filling.

# D-Day January 2016 (Morning) (15 lbs lost)
""Holy crap where did the last two weeks go?  I'm really mutilating my body by choice? WTF is wrong with me? Augh I'm terrified."" 
These were mostly my inner thoughts. As they prepped me, this thought got louder. Finally being wheeled to the ER, which was freezing cold, mostly white and looked like a perfect GTA murder scene, it's a good thing they knocked me out quick - I was about 60 seconds from running away screaming.

# Night / Post Surgery
Woke up pretty groggy.  Felt pretty shit, usual post-surgery feeling. Only this time with added doubt if I did the right thing.  After about an hour or so in recovery chewing ice chips I was wheeled to my room.  Mouth was as dry as a dryer sheet.

Nurse was nice enough to retrieve my belongings - mostly being able to use my phone helped distract me from my stress.

Didn't really sleep much.  Every hour I woke up either because my heart decided to shoot up, triggering the alarm, or another patient in the room beeped for some reason.

Once I felt strong enough I asked the nurse to please let me go for a walk. Getting your legs moving right away was stressed, but mostly knowing they were working would help me feel relaxed - my head really was spinning at this point. She asked if she could take care of one patient first for a few minutes - no problem.  Once I finally walked down the hall and could feel everything else in place (also letting out a reassuring fart - really a good way to convince yourself your wiring is intact) I felt myself calm down.  Climbed back in bed.

# Next Day
Wasn't released until late afternoon.  As before, couldn't really sleep. Anxiety built up again, I just wanted my own damn bed.  I was thirsty, but strictly forbidden to gulp water as I was accustomed to. I could only very slowly sip water out of a shot glass (medicine cup).  Well that doesn't satisfy anything.  May as well not drink.  

Same when chicken soup came -- a couple of light spoons.  The speed at which you are allowed to drink was too slow for what I was used to and was driving me crazy.

Finally doctor said I have to commit to drinking enough or I couldn't be released.  Finally gave me some perspective on just how little I was drinking.

Anyway, finally drank enough, discharged, my own damn bed and teddy bear. I finally had a good sleep.

# Days 1-14
I'm not going to lie - I was pretty fucking miserable.  I had typical post-surgery doubt (seems pretty normal among many elective surgeries and definitely this one. I was ready for it but damn, your mind hates you sometimes).

Thin liquid diet. A little water.  A little chicken broth / tomato soup.  More health shakes.  

As before, it's not really *what* I was allowed to eat that bothered, so much as the speed.  Taking sips at a time was just never in my skill set and it honestly drove me crazy to get used to it.  Thankfully my mother is a pretty stubborn lady herself. (I don't know what I would've done without her).  To give an idea of the speed: Finishing 8 ounces of liquid should take you almost an hour in the beginning.

I really just didn't feel like eating.  It just didn't pay to eat - I wasn't that hungry and it was annoying to eat so slowly. Again, thanks mom.

I had some pain during this period. As long as I was occupied it wasn't really noticeable. Only at night when I was trying to fall asleep did it really bother me. But they give you decent painkiller and it knocks you right out. I've definitely had worse.

# Day 7
Post op check up. Stitches removed.  Nothing too exciting.

# Weeks 3-4
Pureed food, and can no longer eat and drink at same time.  Mostly had baby food, yogurt and more health shakes (also tuna, eggs, applesauce). Now that I was able to eat at a more normal speed (even now I still can't devour like I used to - which is a good thing) I really started to feel better and more like myself.

No pain at this point. I'm taking some walks albeit slower than normal.  Just taking it easy.

# Weeks 5-6 (30 pounds lost)
Soft solid food. Had chicken bits. Tasted like fucking heaven to be able to chew something.

(Soft veggies, meat, fish, pasta, thin turkey)

Was back to college now, I felt pretty 'tender' but took my sweet time getting around. Was a little challenging but overall doable.  I ended up dropping a class just feeling that I shouldn't be overworking myself at this point. Considering what I heard the workload of that class became, probably the smartest choice of this whole thing.

# Week 7
Honeydew! Crackers! God damn its good to be alive!

First throw up here was with salmon.  Just ate it too damn fast. (Hey - you don't eat salmon for 2.5 months and see if you don't devour it).  This sounds weird, but it actually feels... kind of nice to throw up.  When you eat to much/fast you feel like you can't breathe.  When you finally cough it up, you gasp air. Its a different kind of throw up from eating something funny. It's more like immediately throwing off a pokeball.

# 2 Months
Felt most of my strength back. Navigating college at normal speed. Eating my pathetic lunches in between class. Complaining about Professors to friends.  Yep, getting back to normal.

# 3 Months (65 pounds lost)
Took an 8-hour drive with some friends to visit another friend.  Felt good to be back behind the wheel.  Had homemade pizza, definitely felt like heaven. Chicken was still better though.

# 4 Months 
Salad! Yep, seriously.  This long for salad.  You would think I missed it, but not really. OK, maybe a little.

This is the point where I would say I felt completely back to normal.  The only thing I really couldn't have normally was carbonated drinks, so drinking only water and diet snapple took some getting used to.  I was approaching my finals for the semester, had upcoming internships and interviews to worry about it.  

Life was definitely moving on.

# 6 Months / Summer 2016 (Dropped to under 300!)
Pretty much all food is back on the menu at this point.  

# 7 Months: 100 POUNDS LOST!

I haven't had any throw up besides the time mentioned above.  Definitely came close a few times - it takes getting used to eating at the slower speed.  But a sip of water and slow breathing is generally enough to help clear blockage.

Further loss numbers:
9 Months: 111 pounds.
11 Months: 115 pounds.
1 Year: 125 pounds.

5qu4ry,1,2017-01-29,[Help needed] Studying film/tv in Canada,reagan918,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/5qu4ry/help_needed_studying_filmtv_in_canada/,"Hi there! I’m a 27 HongKonger who is interested in film and television. I am working as a website content writer in Hong Kong, but planning to have a career change. I want to be a screenwriter/director/producer. I’m thinking about moving to Canada, studying film/tv there, and hopefully get a job after my graduation.
 
For those who are inside the Canada film/tv industry, teachers / crew / production company etc, I hope you can help me with the following questions:


1/ Can you recommend a good film/tv school or program?
(I heard quite a lot of good things about “BCIT: Television and Video Diploma” and “Capilano University: Bachelor of Motion Picture Arts”. Is that true? Do I have a great chance to get into the industry after graduating from these schools? Is there any other good schools you would recommend?)
 

2/ Should I go for a diploma or a bachelor?
(I’m concerned about the years of study. Diploma takes 2 years while Bachelor takes 4 years. I thought that I should gain as much working experience as possible during my study, eg placement, internship, part-time job , in order to increase my chance to get into the industry after my graduation. I will need a working visa to stay in Canada after graduation, so I need to work really hard to build my network and prove to the employers that I’m better off than the local fresh grad….. and I need time to improve my English since it is not my first language. But Bachelor is way more expensive and time-consuming than Diploma. What do you think?)
 

3/ How is the film/tv industry doing in Canada? Is it hard for a foreigner like me to get a job there?
 

4/ Is there anything particular I should consider before going to Canada?
 

Some background information about me:

Age: 27

Language: Chinese and English (English is not my first language, but I have already taken IELTS and scored 7.5)

Credential: Bachelor degree, major in Chinese Language and Literature; Associate degree in bilingual studies; Certificate in Digital filmmaking

Film related experience: Started filming in 2012. Made a few shorts and entered some competitions, no award received though.
 
Thanks for reading. Your comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated."
5qupa4,3,2017-01-29,A change of direction.,Reaper_of_Souls,YoureDoingItRight,https://www.reddit.com/r/YoureDoingItRight/comments/5qupa4/a_change_of_direction/,"So, first off: I just had another sleepless night and am currently running on a combination of coffee, cigarettes, Adderall, and Wellbutrin... but I *think* I've finally figured out how to use AutoModerator to set up the weekly thread. It was a lot easier than it seemed to be at first! Anyway, let's all hang in here until tomorrow and see how that goes, haha.

But I was so determined to figure this out on my own that I wasn't going to ask for help from anyone. When I went back to college two years ago, I was going for a minor in web design. I was a computer geek who knew nothing about computers, and an artist who had no inspiration to do art. It seemed like the right idea at the time? That was, of course, until I straight panicked one night and had to go to the university hospital for emergency Ativan. My anxiety was ten times worse when I attempted to take advanced web design online (and withdrew, then tried again the next summer, then withdrew again...) It didn't help that my GPA was a literal 1.99 and I had to bring it up to a 2.0 if I wanted to graduate...

But the crazy part is that even though I still haven't graduated, I completed my psychology major *four years ago*. And in the time since then, I've realized that while the majority of my Redditing is spent in some sort of emotional support position, I don't want to make a career out of it. I want something intellectually stimulating. Also something that will allow me to pay off the massive amounts of student loan debt I've incurred? Maybe I can do it?

So basically, I've been thinking instead of taking a last class, I should try and get some kind of CS internship for course credit. I don't quite have the academic background for it, but in the months before this summer before I could *get* that internship, there are certification exams I could take that would give me a leg up. This is something that could give me *real world career experience* that doesn't require a bajillion years of school. And I really want to do it.

Do any of you guys know anything about getting certified in A+, or other IT certifications? If so, which ones should I go for?"
5qupji,6,2017-01-29,I'm working on my first music project and need a bit of advice!,soundsgoboom,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/5qupji/im_working_on_my_first_music_project_and_need_a/,"Hey everyone, my name is Brian.

Verification: http://imgur.com/JYp1Zws

I recently started producing music in August of 2016 after my internship. I used all the money I earned there to build a studio in the bedroom of my grandmothers house. I built my own PC and purchased a MIDI keyboard along with Ableton Live 9 as my DAW. It took while getting use to Ableton and learning how to  record in it. Since then, I have come quite familiar with the software but I know there is still a lot to learn. 

My musical background consists of self-taught guitar, piano, and small bit of drums(basic pocket stuff, like 3 drum lessons deep). I've played the guitar for about 7 years and piano for about 1 now.

****Personal Background stuff that might bore you**
****
I spent most my early adolescence with my grandmother and my middle school to mid high school with my mother. Dad, I just started getting to know. I have 2 brothers and a sister. Most the time I spent with my mother, we lived in a section 8 home. I remember hearing about Obama's win in 2008 and going home that night to no electricity and cold showers. We didn't always live like that, there were periods though where my mother might not have made enough to cover all the bills for that month. My step-father was a great man who unfortunately relied on alcohol after my step-brothers death. He passed back in 2014. I started college in 2012 majoring in Computer Science and I am in my last semester now with a job lined up in the upcoming fall. 
****
I will soon be having a significant increase in income and want to upgrade my laboratory(that's what I like to call it). So any advice on what I should get would be great. Now to let you know what I currently have:

A. Komplete Kontrol S25 MIDI Keyboard.
&gt;Which came with Komplete Select for free which includes Massive, Kontakt 5, and a bunch of other instruments. My friend suggest that I get Komplete 5 or 6, which I'll most likely do.

B. Custom Built PC.
&gt;I know there's some hate on PC's when it comes with producing, I get the same shit with my CS buddies and coworkers. I don't mind Windows and the issues that come about, as I can usually resolve them. Also can game on it :)

C. Sweet ass Fender Telecaster. link: http://imgur.com/STiCdrF
&gt;The first guitar I had I pulled out of a dumpster. I don't ever want to put this thing in a dumpster. My favorite piece of my lab.

D. Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 Gen. 2
&gt;The first one I got conked out and they sent me another! Should I eventually upgrade this?

E. Ableton Live 9
&gt;I fell in love with this software and what it can do, I don't care that the interface is ugly, I think its beautiful.

That's about all I have used so far to create the music I have been making. I have made about 35-40 different things, thrown away most and kept 4 so far...lol

I have a friend who is going to mix and master these who currently produces EDM dance tracks. I have listened to his work and he is good at it. I plan on making more of a Rage Against the Machine, Cage the Elephant, Black Keys, guitar sounds with other midi instruments along with it. Should there be some things that he should learn when mixing and mastering guitars?(Don't really know much about those topics but learning) 

I am also a huge hip hop fan so I am trying to make something that sounds good that doesn't sound like a 2006 remake of a linkin park track. But I have been happy with the results so far! 

&gt;I am also working on a story script to go along with the project, so that I can include some parallels to my life in a way that is interesting haha. 

I am about 30% done I'd say and would like to know if should start doing something differently or should wait until I can purchase something. Until then, I'm still making art! Thanks for any help or assistance! I will post my final work here for anyone who is interested."
5qvfyi,43,2017-01-29,[NeedAdvice] I feel like i've wasted too much time and there's no way to make up for it. Can you help?,Rifferz,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/5qvfyi/needadvice_i_feel_like_ive_wasted_too_much_time/,"  First, this may be a long read, but I will try to sum it up as much as possible. Second, this is my first ever post on reddit, so if there are any mistakes, please point them out and I will promptly change them.

  A bit of background: I live in Brazil, went to the USA at the age of 2, and grew up in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Had a very happy childhood, parents were great and supportive, always considered an excellent student, A's and B's. Studied up until the 4th grade, but then my mom came to brazil, dragged me and my brother with her, and everything went to hell. Divorced parents, emotional abuse, depression, and constant moving. I moved nine times in 3 years. My grades plummeted, never was able to keep up with the subjects being taught in class because of all the different school schedules, and I was severely depressed. At one moment I just didn't care anymore, I'd skip classes, not even bother to try to understand anything and stopped trying altogether. 


  My dad eventually came to Brazil to try to save what was left of his marriage but that was also terrible because he lost everything he was able to achieve in the USA. After a while he was able to make a steady income, and, because of his english, landed a job at GE in Belo Horizonte. When his financial situation was better, in early 2012, he told me to live with him because where he lived was better (Belo Horizonte, the city i still live in), more schools, more opportunities and all that. So i went, and started studying in a new school, but this time, i started when classes started and managed to stay a whole year in the same school! The problem was/is, that i had already screwed up in the earlier years. I didn't understand anything in Math/Physics/Chem, because of the huge gap created by leaving the US and the constant school transfers here. So i barely made it past the 8th grade (year 9). In high school, my dad put me in a school that also gave me a certificate in IT (we call it colegio técnico, for anyone wanting to search about it(i have no idea what it's called in english)), and i barely made it (was even held back in the 2nd year). I was able to make some money with an internship, but my contract ended in December.


  So, as of right now, I'm 18 years old, my dad travels constantly because of the company, and I stay alone playing videogames and eating poorly. I enrolled in some online classes but was never able to finish any of them, the main reason being videogames. I have nothing against playing videogames, I enjoy it, but it has a time and a place, not everytime and everywhere. All my friends are going to college and i'm the odd one out, with no prospects or goals in life, just living one day after the other. My brother is back in the USA, living with my grandparents, (he is a citizen by birth, 3 years younger than me) killing it in school, getting good grades and making connections, learning what i didn't. I feel really depressed, alone, and I know I waste time. I think to myself ""if only you could trade all those hours playing League of Legends for hours of studying, you'd be making it right now"". The problem is, I continue playing and procrastinating because I don't have any direction. For clarity, here in brazil we have the ENEM, which is the national high school exam. You do the test, and, depending on your score, you can choose what you want to major in and which federal or private university you will pursue that major. I did it once, flunked, and now I'm planning to do it again this year so I can finally get on with my life. The problem is, I need to study, and I have NO IDEA where to begin, which is one of the main reasons I don't start.
 

  So, after this rant, does anyone have any advice for what I should be doing? Which online classes should I take and where should I begin? Is there a way to go back to the USA? I've researched some visas but not thoroughly, so if anyone has some info on that, it'd be very welcome. Thanks in advance, everyone.

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."

The first is I've always had a fantasy where I am in public and a stranger shows everyone how much of a cumslut I just can be. Or in a scene where I'm at my internship where my boss wants to fuck my face in the middle of the day. The other big one has to be an abduction one where I am used by a group of guys while pictures are being sent to my parents to show them how much their daughter is a slut. Or having it uploaded somewhere. Just being degraded from s group of guys is so sexy. Been wanting a nice BWC lately

Some of my biggest kinks are hair pulling, name calling, rope play, slapping, strangers, cum everywhere, I do love race play❤️, and face fucking seeing what would happen to me(pics/vid)

While some things I don't like are blood, and scat/piss play.

I would love to chat to anyone and I hope you are having a great night! Lashana"

5qwcci,17,2017-01-29,Need Advice on Career Path,ChemE_Throwaway,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/5qwcci/need_advice_on_career_path/,"I graduated in May 2015 with my B.S. (~3.65 GPA with 3 internships). I immediately started working for a large specialty chemicals company after graduation in a production/process engineer role. At this point I hate my job; but I'm essentially stuck for 3 years here, when my 401k will go from 0% to 100% vested. That means I'm over 50% through my stint in this role; the problem is that I don't know what I want to do next, and I'm terrified of starting another job I despise. If I can get an idea of my future career plans, I can start to focus on certain things at work to build a focused resume. I'm looking for advice from more senior engineers who have held and experienced multiple roles in industry, who can help point me in the right direction based on my interests.

Right now my role is sort of a hybrid production/process engineer role - I'm responsible for the day-to-day manufacturing and all that entails. Writing notes for operators every day, updating our OP's, providing 24/7 support, troubleshooting issues, participating in safety reviews (MOC, PHA, etc.). These are the tasks I hate, because they are not mentally stimulating and it feels like a non-engineer could do the job. It's also incredibly stressful and full of responsibility. The other half of my role is improving my processes. This is the part I enjoy, but it takes a back seat to the daily production obligations unfortunately. I love doing things like improving make rates (my favorite!), reducing costs, decreasing quality problems, etc. For example, we had a key growth product being produced in a 500 gallon reactor that we could not produce fast enough, and I increased the make rate by over 100% with zero investment (it actually made variable costs of the process cheaper and decreased quality issues). I started a capital project to improve it another 50%+. This earned us millions in extra sales and avoided having to toll the material! If I came to work every day and could be 100% focused on process optimization, I think I'd be happy.  

I have some lean training under my belt, and I use lean tools to improve my processes. I enjoy having experience to a wide variety of tools for process improvement, and enjoy reading books like *The Toyota Way*. I'm also the 5S leader for my department, which is so-so, but I don't think it should be an engineer's responsibility. I'm part of the way through my green belt project, so I don't know how I feel about six sigma compared to lean. All in all, I would be willing to consider a black belt type role.

The monotony and simplicity of many parts of my job makes me miss the mental stimulation of school, although I was never in love with being a student prior to graduation. I'd be open to getting advanced degrees if a company pays for it. I don't think a chemE PhD is in my future though...I don't like chemistry enough, and it seems very chemistry-oriented (the more chemistry classes I took, the less I liked it). The parts of school I loved were classes like junior lab and senior design. Even though I was only in the top 1/3 of my chemE class, I was hands-down one of the best at project type work (I have good technical writing/presenting skills which helped).

As far as industry goes, I don't feel fulfilled working in specialty chemicals. I don't see how it makes a very positive impact on society. Something like alternative energy, biopharm (I was interested in this particularly in college), pharma, etc. would probably be more rewarding to me. I want to know that I'm working toward making the world a better place, whether it is fighting global warming or preventing diseases.

My biggest fear right now is winding up at another job I hate. I want to be confident when choosing my next role, because I can't imagine continuing my 20's working in jobs and for companies I can't stand. Right now it seems like I might be happy moving to a process engineer or black belt role; but maybe they would both be terrible fits. Something like a pilot plant engineer or similar role that works on scaling up products or testing new processes could also be fun (I interned in a pilot plant). I'm sorry for the short novel, but if anyone could help point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it. I know that at the end of the day it's up to me to figure out where to go, but there may be jobs or industries I'm not aware of that I would fit into."
5qwsef,3,2017-01-29,Free Fall,Archwizard_Drake,SupersRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/5qwsef/free_fall/,"*[Quinn](https://www.reddit.com/r/SupersRP/comments/5m5f25/quinn_carnahan_aka_fathom/) always hated the feeling of falling.*

*The sheer terror setting in before any other reaction or conscious consideration of why. That powerlessness as your body sinks, while your intestines rise weightlessly in a desperate, pointless attempt to turn back time, still dragged down with the net your skin creates. The atmosphere rapidly becoming cold and sharp, as slight particles in the wind form obstacles against you, enough to knock the wind out of you yet not enough to slow you down. The instinctive flailing to grab something,* anything, *to stop yourself, but only grasping empty air.* 

*In a way, it was just like his anxiety attacks, except in physical terms, very* **real.** 

*It started out like any other bout of ‘heroics’. A walk through the Commercial District looking for an internship opening. An elderly woman’s purse gets snatched. Hood up, goggles on.*  
‘*Standard strategy 1: Portal to solid surface, portal in front of thief. Crash, collect, return.*’  

*Today’s thief, however, was a speedster. Less standard, especially when he’s quick enough to dodge the broad side of a building… or run up its side without losing traction.*  
‘*Modified strategy 2: Chain the tunnels to ascend the building internally several floors at a time, meet thief on the roof, repeat 1. Caution: Avoid workers.*’  

*The building in question was easily 30 stories, probably more; took a few tunnels to get up, and Fathom wasn’t really counting. He beat the thief up by stretching his tunnels as far as he could, although he was somewhat short of breath when he got there. He tried to lift the floor out from under the thief, but he simply side-stepped the portal. Then came the rush – Fathom wasn’t much of a fighter, but the thief charged straight for him, and the studs on that purse would have made it an effective flail.*   
*Quinn had always heard that adrenaline made you feel like time was slowing down around you, although he’d never heard about that faraway ticking sound. Still, he didn’t need to be faster than his attacker to dodge, if he could see him coming. He dipped back, opening a portal to catch him.*

*That feeling again. It seemed to last forever, but so did everything else; he couldn't even force himself to breathe in that time. While his head was still clear, he knew he would be right-side up in just a moment.*

*He deposited himself behind his assailant, hoping to catch him by surprise. What he* hadn’t *counted on was his attacker spin-attacking, like a cheap video game character. What he didn’t* consider *was that the thief had just come up the roof, and was still very near the edge.*

*He had just enough time to grab the purse as it hit him square in the face. He tumbled over the side of the building. The attacker was stronger than he looked; the purse straps were not.*

*Silver lining, he retrieved the purse.*

*He had considered a scenario like this before, probably a year back now. Standard strategy: One tunnel to send him back up, using the acceleration of gravity to counter his upward momentum; another to catch him at the top of his arc and deposit him safely nearby. It should have been easy.*   
*When the moment came to it though… shock set in, and his mind blanked. Whatever 'adrenaline rush' he'd been using had burned out; even if he'd remembered his escape plan, he was moving too fast to put it in motion. He had a few moments to glimpse around, spotting no other rooftops in range, his senses overwhelmed as the world moved around him so quickly. Vertigo.*

*And that feeling again. He subconsciously hoped it really would last forever – because the pavement below looked quite coarse and he was not looking forward to meeting it.*  
*He covered his face with his arms, squeezing the purse. He wasn't even sure he had time to scream aloud.*

*No snarky comments this time, just a* ‘*FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-*’ *as he accepted this was the end.*

*Does someone care to prove him wrong?*"
5qwt4s,5,2017-01-29,My husband's [27M] relationship with his coworker [25F] makes me [26F] uncomfortable. Should it?,auroraboracuda,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5qwt4s/my_husbands_27m_relationship_with_his_coworker/,"Hi Reddit,

My husband (I'll use John) and I have been married for two years. When we were engaged, he was still in a grueling grad school program that took up a lot of his time. He was also a member of a professional club where he met a girl that we will call Anne.

With about 4 months to go until our wedding, John was spending a lot of time at school studying, but he was also spending time with people from this professional group. One day I noticed that he was frequently getting tagged in pictures with Anne, just the two of them.

I didn't know this girl. So... I snooped. His facebook was signed in, and I found messages between him and Anne where John talked about giving her a back massage (or getting one? I can't remember now), but it seemed inappropriate to me. I confessed to John that I had looked at the messages after seeing pictures of the two of them. I have a hard time remembering, but I think he changed the subject, and I didn't want to push.

After this conversation, he removed the pictures of the two of them. Unfortunately, I kept snooping and found that he was also deleting all of their text messages. They would text probably three times a week, but I never knew what they were about and didn't want to say anything because I shouldn't have been looking.

We got married. Several months later I did confess to looking at his texts and asked why all of his texts with Anne were deleted. He said that he knew I didn't like her and deleted them so I wouldn't be upset. I said, ""I'm upset that the texts are deleted. If they weren't, would I still be upset?"" He maintained that he only deleted them because he knew I didn't like her and didn't want me to know that they texted. 

After this conversation I didn't bring it up again, even though I felt it was very unresolved and that there must be something I don't know for sure. I checked his phone occasionally, and it seemed that their communication was becoming more infrequent, but he still deleted the messages.

John now has a job at a hospital near the school that he graduated from. He went in to his office to do some work this weekend, and I tagged along. Apparently, Anne got an internship at the same hospital because John and I were both working on our computers when I heard a, ""Hey, what's up?"" I turned around to see who it was, and saw Anne. 

She looked surprised that it was me instead of John's office mate, but she offered a, ""Hey, how are you?"" and I replied, ""Good. How are you?""

Keep in mind that we've never actually been introduced, and we also were not introduced then.

She ducked out pretty fast, but then John asked her a question about what shift she was working. She she popped back into view. To me it appeared like she was seriously blushing. John appeared normal. 

So after that, I felt upset because I didn't know she worked there, and it seems that they have a close enough relationship that she would just pop by his office. I doubt that anything is happening now, but I have this nagging feeling that something did happen in the past. 

Should I bring this up again to my husband? Should I just accept it and not say anything since it seems to be in the past for John? Should I say something to Anne? I am planning to try to forget about it, but I just have a bad feeling.

  ---   
  tl;dr My husband tried to hide the friendship (but maybe more) that he has with his coworker. Should I ask him about it, or am I being paranoid?"

I've applied to about 125 places in the past month and have only really heard back (in a good way) from 2 places (1 of which only feels like a legit company). I currently go to a reputable school in the southeast, but have family close to NYC so I'd like to move there if possible. Everyone says to go to tech meetups, however that's not really an option for me since I live nowhere near NYC at the moment. I have internship experience and plenty of side projects, plus leadership experience in CS related clubs if that helps."
5qyb2p,0,2017-01-29,apple store employees - current and former - what are your experiences?,evaxuate,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5qyb2p/apple_store_employees_current_and_former_what_are/,"i am about to be a freshman in college and most of the schools i've applied to have an apple store very near to the campus. i am hoping to work at one, as i am very passionate about apple as a whole. 

for the past four years i haves worked for a small business called the Mac Ranch, which is basically a tech support/troubleshooting/repair shop - essentially like a mini apple store without the retail sales. i am the only employee; my boss is a longtime friend and mentor of mine. over the years i have learned much about tech support, including how to teach people the works of their devices, assistance both over the phone and in person, fixing various hardware issues in apple computers (such as faulty displays, failing hard drives, etc.) and working out software bugs in iOS/macOS as well. i take some coding classes at my high school but am more interested in the hardware/repair type stuff rather than writing programs. i am paid, not an intern, but it's based on hours spent on a project instead of hours at work every day. 

i consider myself to be well-versed in apple support; i have helped many people with their issues over the years and also made countless upgrades and repairs to devices of my own. overall i'd say hay as a high school student id be qualified to work at a store from the experience standpoint at the very least. i still have a lot to learn of course, but i have a great understanding of the basics and some other more advanced parts of apple products and service. anyways, i have some questions: 

•what is apple's minimum hiring age? i am seventeen now and will turn eighteen in september. 

•are hours known to be relatively flexible? as a college student i won't have *all* the time in the world but would love to work a pretty good amount. 

•does it pay well, or should i say well enough for a low-income freshman in college? i'm not looking for a huge salary or anything and would honestly be content with anything that is enough to get by. 

•did you/do you enjoy working there, and are there any experiences that stick out? 

•any advice for interviews, and general tips on how to get started with all this? 

as a sidenote i will be potentially majoring in some type of computer engineering so this will fit my career nicely. 

**tl;dr:** i'm an incoming college freshman with a good deal of experience with apple repairs and troubleshooting and am hoping to work at an apple store. anything i should know about it beforehand, and is it a good idea at all?
 
i browse this subreddit daily and i would also love to hear some feedback from you guys. thanks in advance! :)

5qyi6j,1,2017-01-29,sexist parents and no recognition for my hard work,pin3appl3ba3,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/5qyi6j/sexist_parents_and_no_recognition_for_my_hard_work/,"To start, I’ll just say that I'm an eighteen-year-old female from a South Asian country.
My parents are super traditional. From when I was a toddler, my dad has been telling me that I should have been killed when I was born. I distinctly remember him getting drunk and beating me often. Once I asked him if I could sleep over at another girl’s house. I started crying saying it was unfair that my brother could do so but I couldn’t. He flipped me over on the marble kitchen floor and started punching and kicking me. Along with that, I was never allowed to hang out with other children in general. I would go weeks and months without seeing or playing with another kid my age. My parents told me that they didn’t have friends so neither did I. I now have trouble communicating and with my self-confidence. Moving aside from that, my dad has followed my mother to work (to make sure she wasn’t with another man), slapped her so hard that she had to go to the ER because she couldn’t hear out of one ear, and held up knives/thrown shot glasses at her. She now has an incurable neurological condition and sometimes I wonder if it was caused by trauma from getting slapped. And obviously, she condones all this because of the sick society that we come from. It’s wrong for her to leave him and I totally understand that because they’re afraid of being judged. Neither of them are open to change. Due to this, I never get to hang out with friends. I got molested by a family friend when I was a kid, but I never told my parents because I knew they would blame me. I was suicidal AF because I felt like I did something wrong, but my parents are just assholes. When I joined an extracurricular activity for the first time, my dad claimed that I was just being a slut at school. I’m not allowed to wear shorts or dresses or skirts. I’m eighteen and they still won’t let me go to dances. My parents always claim that I’ll run away with a black/white guy and get pregnant. He’s racist too, my dad is a Trump supporter, but that’s another issue. I’m secretly dating a guy right now, but I’ll get into that later. I’m probably going to be forced into an arranged marriage or something. I don’t even know. I can’t process this all. I’ve seen family members back in the homeland get murdered for marrying guys they truly loved though. The parents gladly will go to jail because their daughter destroyed their honor or something ridiculous. My parents praise these people. 
I've always been a good student. The thing is, I did it without anyone ever telling me that I needed to do it. In elementary school, my English wasn’t too great (I can speak four languages now). I struggled at first. I think I somehow used competitivity to fuel me and get past my home life. Getting awards and recognition kind of made up for my mom calling me fat and ugly and my dad calling me useless and stupid. This changed in middle school where a few of my teachers started grading me based off favoritism and I started to get bad at math (I’m currently taking calculus, but I was getting F’s on tests so I was underperforming compared to my classmates who were understanding the content more quickly than I was). I never got anything lower than a B, but I would often get C’s on assignments just because I was a quiet girl. This crushed my confidence even more. Meanwhile, I was in a shitty school district. I found out about a top school that was not too far away and applied for an interview and crap. Another kid plagiarized my essays along the way, but I still got in, in the end. I thought going to the top school in the state would change everything for me. I was wrong. I was so sad about life at home that I started dating a senior as a freshman. He was fine before he got abusive after his mom died while we were dating. I did drugs, had sex, all that crap. My parents never found out. And again, I never got anything below a B, but my GPA was destroyed by the end of that year. My genius friend died unexpectedly at the end of the year and he would always tell me to get my life together, come and study with him before school, work past everything, etc. He was the true MVP, but I ignored him throughout the year. After he died, I was super crushed so I ended up following his advice. I got involved in extracurricular activities, raised myself up to the top 15th percentile of my class, took up internships, took a bunch of AP classes, and stuff. I rarely got sleep and I worked my ass off. Except I never got recognition. I never raise my hand in class, I’m not confident enough. Until I was told how my GPA compared to other kids, I thought I was behind. I still feel dumb because I failed some of those AP exams… yeah. My excuse is that I didn’t get enough sleep and I was traveling to competitions the week before, but it’s probably because I’m a useless piece of trash. I doubt I’ll get into a good school. I don’t think it matters because my dad might not let me leave the house. I’ll never get senior student of the month because I’m dumb I guess. I’ll never become an engineer because I’m dumb. I think my teachers hate me. I cried about who to ask for a letter of recommendation for hours because I’ve never gotten any award so they must think I’m not good enough. I don’t know. I’ve missed over twenty days of school this year and I just don’t feel like going back. I feel like the twelve-hour days of school that I put in weren’t worth it. But they prevented me from going home so that was okay... I don’t even know. I have a clear career path that I want to pursue, but I doubt I’ll get enough money or admission to a good school out of state so I can get away from my family. They prevent me from going to the doctor’s too (I have health problems). I don’t know how I can fix that, I’ve asked counselors, but they don’t give me specifics and no one has ever taught me anything about insurance and stuff. I feel overwhelmed. My dad says I probably won’t get through college anyway. I’m lost.
This is kind of turning into a sad train wreck of words. My mom makes six figures and my dad doesn’t make shit so I don’t even understand my family. My mom claims to love me and says that I don’t spend time with her, but I’m sick of getting insulted every second of the day. I don’t know how to deal with anything. I have a boyfriend who’s white and he doesn’t understand why his parents can’t meet mine. I’m afraid his parents will judge me. They probably don’t want their son dating a piece of scum like me. People at school treat me like I’m dumb and my mom says I’m ugly even though I’m not. I had an eating disorder and there’s more crap that I could’ve mentioned, but I can’t even think straight right now. I don’t know if everyone lives like this or if I’m just being overdramatic. Although I’m sure most eighth graders don’t write their mom’s resumes and crap. I’m pretty sick of life. Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh. I just hope I can get into college with scholarship money. That’s all I can depend on right now and it’s killing me. I don’t know how to get away from my family. I don’t even talk to my dad anymore. I haven’t seen his face in weeks. I don’t want to talk to anyone. I just can’t stand living like this, being treated like crap for being born a certain way.  "

In these parallels, people have lived their lives completely normally, not questioning the possibility of other worlds just like their own. These stories are from one such world-One where the enigmatic ""Facility"" is nothing to the people of Hawkridge, Washington, but a rumor. A myth. A story passed from person to person to scare each other. To dare to imagine the fantastical and terrifying could exist right under their noses. Little did these people know how right they were...*


***THE FACILITY-1983***

***CHAPTER FIVE-DOWN UNDER.***

...

**NOVEMBER 6TH, 1983. 12:36 PM.**

*The town of Hawkridge has changed. As the darkness maintained its icy grip upon the town, various residents have started to uncover some of the secrets hidden just underground. It seems that a much more sinister plot has been brewing in the town, with something far deeper and…stranger than just a simple murder. The storm that had been brewing over the past few days climbs past the shore at last, blanketing the town with a heavy rain.*

****

**The Facility.**

*Agent Blake Carter walked down the twisting hallways, speaking into a walkie-talkie.*

Phil. I’m done fucking around, alright? I’m making the call. Those brats made their way in here somehow.

…

How am **I** supposed to know!? I know I sent them back. They…must be from another timeline or something…that’s the only possibility I can think of. This has gotten far out of our control, Phil. We need the big guns. I’ll meet you at the office in 10. Be there.

…

Oh, it is? Got it. I’ll avoid the train, then. Oh, and do something about those Brothers, alright? I think they both know too much. Better bring them in. See you.

*He clicks off the walkie, and boards an elevator.*

God, I hate this job.

****

*Rick has entered the Facility, taking an Intern in the elevator he found as his hostage. As the two step out into the bustling area, Rick would feel compelled to look around. It looked a bit like an airport terminal, with people in lab coats everywhere walking around and talking to other people. Occasionally a few sharply dressed people could be seen too, talking to others in the distance. However, the strangest thing about all of it is that physically, this looked impossible. There's no way that this could exist structurally under the town...Yet, here they were.*

** **

*Rita and David would find themselves in a similar situation, after taking the elevator they found in the woods where Rick was. As the doors open in front of them, they too would also be wowed by the sights. After gaining their surroundings, David looks to Rita.*

Well, what should we do now?

** **
*Jack would find himself backed up against a chain link fence in his attempt to escape the beast that was chasing him. With nowhere left to turn, he would have no choice but to brace for another attack. To his surprise, a blinding light would come out from in front of him, behind the beast. The beast stops their attack, howling in pain as it runs off. Before Jack could say thanks to the person who saved them, He would be knocked out by the butt of a Rifle.*

*Brandon would later find a note by his bedside. It had a picture of his brother knocked unconscious and bloodied, and read:*

**If you ever want to see your brother alive again, come to Mercury Park at 12:00. Come alone.**

*When he arrived there, he would hear the clicks of countless guns from all around him. A woman’s voice calls out from the shadows. By her tone, it was obvious that they weren’t messing around with him.*

Hands up. You’re coming with us.

** **

*Lindsy and Digis would find themselves following the man who ran away from them, without many other options to pursue. Eventually, they would reach a Cave. For some reason, cool air was emanating out of the entrance…*"
5qzniy,4,2017-01-30,Recommendations for Programming to Replace Excel Spreadsheets,Valvoo,MechanicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/5qzniy/recommendations_for_programming_to_replace_excel/,"Hey guys, as the title says, I'm looking for some of your opinions on methods I could potentially use to replace excel spreadsheets with some form of programming. 
I had a meeting with the owner of a very small engineering company today, regarding an internship opportunity for myself, and this is what he wants me to do. He doesn't like the idea of spreadsheets given how easy it is for them to be manipulated and how tedious it can be to input large equations and actually read them within excel. He suggests that I look towards some form of programming to be able to provide solutions to relatively basic mechanical engineering problems (i.e. the loads acting on ships etc). I don't have a massive amount of programming experience other than some basic C++ and MATLAB. So, given the above, what would you guys recommend that I look into? Ideally I would like something which isn't over complicated.

Thanks in advance! 

edit: Thanks so much for the great responses guys! You have helped me a lot!! Given the company I would be interning for is quite small, I presume they would want to minimise licencing costs, and so I am currently leaning towards python. "
5qzos1,1,2017-01-30,M4M/M4T/M4Futa - the Alpha Apocalypse,Subboytoy,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5qzos1/m4mm4tm4futa_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you. 

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people. 

I should be getting ready for work or school.  Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. *Holy fuck, its true!*

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha? 

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks: 

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured. 
 
 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug. 

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down. 

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg. 

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

For all of 2016, I worked night shift at a hotel full time 11pm-7am while also doing full-time school and an internship. The fluctuating hours and lack of sleep killed my social life and mental/physical health. Only sleeping a couple hours at a time made me irritable and depressed. I never spent time with friends because if I was awake I was working or doing schoolwork.

About a month and a half ago, I quit this job because I thought I found a new opportunity where I would be able to work during the day that would fit in with my schedule. A local restaurant would be opening a new location right on campus and would be able to work around my school/ internship schedule while giving me sufficient hours to live. However, due to construction being delayed, I am getting so few hours that I needed another job until March. 

I convinced my old job to hire me back on part time, but now I am going to be juggling 4 different schedules. Tonight I am working 11-7, then sleeping an hour, then working 9-2, then going to school at 3. Next day I have internship hours and then school again. I know this is only temporary, but I just don't know how I am going to survive the next 2-3 months, especially because I was so miserable last year. 

Any advice as to how I can make the best of these next couple months?"
5r02mo,202,2017-01-30,Gendernomics: A Woman's Resume,Blacklabellogics,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5r02mo/gendernomics_a_womans_resume/,"About twice a year I have the questionable pleasure of having a stack of resumes land on my desk courtesy of the HR department. Over the years I've developed an approach to getting this task over with as fast as possible, and saving myself from having to read letters of motivation that are written in a Buzzfeed style of prose. You can tell a lot about a personality from their resume, how did they organize their information? What did they leave off and what are they highlighting? The random information such as hobbies, date of birth, marital status, often adds more information about the personality and their perspective.

Usually people try to hide gaps in their resume, for instance by leaving off months so that it does not say in black and white that they had a 6 month gap between engagements. They add tasks or responsibilities that they did not have, or they may attempt to gloss over the fact that they never finished their degree. What was different this year is that as the pile landed on my desk I was mulling over some future Gendernomics articles that I was considering, and it dawned on me that the manner in which I examine and judge resumes could be very useful when looking for plates or a long-term partner.

After all, when one is in the information gathering phase of a relationship with a new woman it is in your best interest to find all the relevant information and unearth all the red flags that are inevitably well hidden or spun as early as possible. A man must keep in mind that women are consummate propagandists and will always spin information so that they appear beyond reproach. Men spend their entire lives fighting to get credit for their virtuous behavior, women spend theirs fighting to avoid punishment for their depraved behaviors.

**Section 1: Personal Information**

The first section is generally the contact information for the candidate and while there is limited information to be acquired here, there are a few things to look for. Is the email address they are using appropriate? Everyone has a few emails floating around with nicknames or pseudonyms, however using these when dating, or applying for a job is a bit of a red flag. It reveals that the person does not understand what is an appropriate context for a joke email, and in terms of dating can reveal a degree of immaturity. If her email is in a different name than her own, this may be an indication that she is using an alias for some reason. If you catch a woman using 2 or more last names, multiple abbreviations of her first name, different combinations of first name, middle name and last name, this is a major red flag, as it could be a technique to prevent information gathering.

The remaining personal info can be somewhat useful, knowing a person's age is always a good idea when reviewing information in the rest of the resume, as experience and education are dependent variables of age. Relationship status is another major point, for instance if I can figure out that an applicant is recently married and in the age range 25 - 35 without children, an assumption can be made that either children or a divorce will be incoming in 3 - 5 years.

This information will not in and of itself offer you much but it does help you interpret the information in the rest of the resume in context.

**Section 2: Education**

Education in a Gendernomics context deals with the perspective a person is likely to have on relationships. When reviewing a resume, the institution that granted the degrees is always an important factor to review, and in the same manner the source of her relationship education is important to establish. Humans grow up looking at their immediate family and peer group for how to conduct relationships, romantic and otherwise. They also look to their same sex parent for how to behave, and their relationship with the parent of the opposing sex is influential to how they interact with members of the opposing sex. The goal here is to determine who were her relationship role-models growing up, and the nature of the environment in which she grew up.

A woman's relationship with her father throughout her childhood is a very important determinant of what patterns the woman may manifest as she grows older. An absent father may drive her to seek approval and validation from other men to an above average degree, which may lead to her hypergamy being more extreme than normal. This makes her more prone to branch swinging and seeking out affairs. A woman who grew up with a father who regularly betrayed her trust in a significant way, may be inherently mistrusting of men, which may manifest in multiple ways but often do in the form of control issues.

What is the sexual strategy of her mother? Domineering or submissive nurturing or a battle-axe, did she gain significant weight or let her looks go as soon as that ring went on? A woman's mother is her first role-model for femininity, and it is no coincidence that a recommendation for men who are thinking about marriage is to find out what their prospective wife's mother is like. Some things tend to run in families, such as borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder. In addition, the mother is the source of her daughters behavioral schema, meaning that if the daughter grew up watching her mother hen-peck her father, she is probably going to engage in this same behavior. This is no different from how a male who grew up with a domineering mother is likely to be a submissive doormat.

Finally, how was/is the relationship between her parents? Are they still together happily after 30 years or are they more on and off than a North Korean power grid? Did they split while she was young and go through series of relationships after, with more children and multiple additional divorces, leading her to lack stability during childhood? Humans tend to base their parenting style and relationship expectations somewhat on that of their parents. If their prospective partner is a career girl type, it is probable that her mother instilled this need in her either through overt or covert communication.

Her early life experiences of her parents and their relationship often shape much of her personality. For instance if she grew up in constant high drama situations, she is likely to share the temperament that causes this, even though she may hide it. If she comes from a family of domineering women, she most likely inherited this trait. If her father was a weak man who was crushed and dominated by her mother, odds are she will end up wanting to replay this pattern. Learning about both of her parents and  their relationship is thus, a predictor of what she will be like in a similar situation. This is not to say that it is entirely deterministic, however humans are perhaps the most influenced by their parents and other family members. Those behavioral patterns and circumstances we experienced first, are often the ones that are embedded deeply within our psyche.

**Section 3: Experience**

This is where one gets into the meat and potatoes of a resume. Her education may be stellar or below par, but this is when some her own personal patterns can be observed and considered in order to make a well reasoned decision as to how and whether one should proceed.

A major red flag when reviewing a person's experience is the duration of their various engagements. If a person has many short-term assignments that were by definition short-term such as internships, the duration is of less importance, however one should consider why few if any of these shorter term engagements resulted in a longer term position. However, if the person only seems to stay with an employer a year or two at most this is a red flag, because odds are they are only going to stay with you for about that time. You may not be able to discern whether they quit or were fired, however odds are that if there are gaps between the jobs they got fired.

The same way, if the woman keeps telling you about the 7 different men she's cohabited with at age 24, this demonstrates a predilection for playing house, but it also indicates that she tends to move very quickly in relationships. Another aspect is that if she consistently moved into their apartments, she is most likely running a side-business of girlfriend experience in exchange for room and board.

If she talks about various men in her life but never mentions any past relationships, or a low number of past relationships for her age, such as woman in her late twenties that only mentions one or two relationships, this is a sign that she should be asked to provide follow-up information. If she has multiple long-term relationships with no cohabitation, marriage or children, this tends to indicate a relationship where she was a side-chick as it is very rare for 3 - 5 year relationships not to end at the very least with cohabitation. If she lets it slip that she left because the guy didn't want to get married, this is a massive red flag, it likely means that she is on the marriage path after her plan A failed. It also means that her Plan A, after knowing her for a long time was damn sure he did not to be with her for the long term.

(well most of them, didn’t include like the Twitter and Uber ones since I thought they were too obvious to bother explaining) S/O to u/surferwannabe for posting about this before and giving me the idea! (https://www.reddit.com/r/riverdale/comments/5qqdlv/loving_it_but_wayyyyy_too_many_pop_culture/)
Here we go!

&gt; “Of My Internship? The Toni Morrison book release party I organized, by far.” - Betty

Toni Morrison is a famous novelist. (ok this one was kinda obvious but I surprised at the time because I didn’t know they were going to include real world stuff)

&gt; “Are you familiar with the works of Truman Capote? I’m *Breakfast at Tiffany’s* but this place is strictly *In Cold Blood*.” - Veronica

Truman Capote is another famous author. Two of his most famous works are are *Breakfast at Tiffany’s* and *In Cold Blood*. The first follows Holly, a sophisticated socialite from the Upper East Side (and became a classic movie starring Audrey Hepburn). The second is a true crime novel about a quadruple murder in rural Kansas.

&gt; “I feel like I’m wandering through the lost epilogue of *Our Town*.” - Veronica

*Our Town* is a play from 1938 which ends with a dude in a small town crying over his wife’s grave. Pretty depressing. Style-wise, the play also has a narrator, like Riverdale, and is pretty meta, which Riverdale shares a little of (ex. The “gay best friend” line by Cheryl at lunch which is both a comment about Kevin in the story, but also his archetype as a character).

&gt; “Wonderful! Ten minutes in and I’m already the *Blue Jasmine* of Riverdale High.” - Veronica

*Blue Jasmine* is a 2013 Woody Allen movie about a woman who loses her wealth and lifestyle and and has to move when her husband is revealed to be a fraudster. (This line is also delivered at 10:33 cause Veronica is meta as heck.)

&gt; “Read my glossed lips, Justin Gingerlake. Not. Gonna. Happen.” - Josie

Like Justin Timberlake, but like, redheaded

&gt; “There’s the hottie you were with last night, the red-headed Ansel Elgort. Is he your boyfriend?” - Veronica

Ansel Elgort was the male lead of *The Fault in Our Stars* movie and is Caleb in *Divergent*. He’s pretty freaking handsome.

&gt; “So what are you hens gossiping about? Archie’s Efron-esque emergence from the chrysalis of puberty?” - Chreyl

Zac Efron, the actor from *High School Musical* back in the day, and *Neighbors* more recently, got REALLY HOT seemingly overnight when he hit puberty

&gt; “At Spence I sat at the top of the Elites pyramid. I’m in” - Veronica

The Spence School in Manhattan is a famous all-girls private school. It’s expensive and elite and represents a certain social class.

&gt;""OK, go ahead and hate on cheerleading, but if hipster Prince Harry” - Veronica

Prince Harry is another handsome redhead, best known for BEING ROYALTY.

&gt; “Too Season 5 Betty Draper, it was a great line... But not at all true.” - Kevin
+ **Later:** “Perfect! Very Betty Draper Season 1” - Veronica

These are references to the show *Mad Men*, where Betty Draper is this gorgeous Manhattan wife in the first season, and struggles with her weight in the fifth.

&gt; ""As hot and as smart as you are, you should be the Queen Bey of this drab hive."" - Veronica

Queen Bey = Beyonce. She’s the best.

&gt; “You went to Juilliard, Ms. Grundy!  There is no one else I can take lessons from, I’ve looked.” - Archie

The Juilliard school is most famous music school in the world, and is known for the high quality of its education. It’s like the Harvard of music.

&gt; “Check your sell-by date ladies. Faux-Lesbian kissing hasn’t been taboo since 1994” - Cheryl

Ok so this one is a stretch because Cheryl picking 1994 was probably not purposeful, but if it was, it is probably a reference to the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” episode of *Roseanne*, one of the first TV episodes with a lesbian kiss, which was a big pop culture moment for LGBT representation on screen.

&gt; ""Hi, teen *Outlander*."" - Veronica

*Outlander* is a show (based on books) with a super hunky main character, who (as u/AobaSona pointed out), is also a redhead (Jamie Fraser). (Choosing to reference a show that features time travel might be a nod to the contrasting aesthetics that Riverdale has as well.)

&gt; “Well, it’s not the Met Ball.” - Veronica
+ **Later:** “I mean it’s not the Met Ball or anything.” - Veronica

The Met Ball is possibly New York’s premier social event. Put on and directed in part by Anna Wintour, it features the rich and famous of New York as well as Film, Music, etc., wearing some of the year’s greatest fashions to help fundraise for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s (also known as The Met) Costume Institute. It is the height of glamour, and of the Manhattan set we assume to Lodge family is familiar with. (thank you to u/envi for the correction, originally called The Met a different art museum, the MoMA, in the brackets)

&gt; “Guys, can’t we just liberate ourselves from the tired dichotomy of, jock, artist. Can’t we, in this post-James Franco world, be all things at once?” - Veronica

A reference to James Franco, who became known as an actor (see, *Pineapple Express*, *127 Hours*) he has also done directing work, poetry, music and visual art. He is able to do all the things he wants to do and doesn’t have to fit into just one mould.

Bonus: Rockland County is mentioned as the home of Riverdale, and there’s only one Rockland County in the States, which is just above New York City on the east side.

Hope y’all enjoyed, I’d love to hear any feedback/thoughts or about anything you noticed!

(made some edits for formatting, and Outlander starring a redhead, and calling The Met a different art museum, the MoMA)"

And what are corporations going to do with this army of customers, wanting things they could not even imagine a month ago? Profit driven institutions will not sell anything for those whom they fired, when they replaced their work with industrial automation. And automation is real. In 1970 US manufacturing sector employed 25% of workers, now it is 7%. Vladimir Lenin Steelworks in Kraków, Poland needed 6,000 workers to produce 1 million tons of steel annually in the 70’s, in 2010 producing the same amount of steel required only 2,700 workers. Places like Ruhr Valley or cities in Rust Belt really do exist.

That is the intrinsic problem embodied in capitalism, system based on wage labour, system in which large part of population is forced to sell labour in order to earn wages and survive. Factory owners do not feel responsible for communities in  which they conduct their business. That is the reason for worker movements and creation of a welfare state. But corporate greed and influence of business over government resulted in tax cuts for the rich, reduced spending on the poor. So we are buying stuff that is both overpriced and useless, paying for it with money earned by producing, distributing and selling the same products. And on every step of this process of producing and consuming, some portion of the product value is skimmed by people whose life goal is accumulation of capital. To make matters even worse, system of debt and credit makes sure that those who are in possession of large amounts of capital will enlarge their capital further and further, while also making sure, that those who are poor will stay poor and pay interests on their debts, interest on the money they do not have. So we end up in situation where constant improvements of technology, exponential growth of computing power, is making majority of population poorer and poorer. And this has consequences for the whole society. We try to promote entrepreneurship, we expect that people who work hard and have fascinating ideas succeed. Succeed at what? Taking money from people who can barely afford food, renting a shelter and heating in the winter? This kind of race to the bottom, with ever improving technology, on a finite planet, must end up in one disaster or another

Yes, our planet is finite. Before First Industrial Revolution there were about 1 billion humans living on the surface of the Earth, now we have 7.5 billion of them. Automobile manufacturers would love to sell every one of them a new car every few years. But why would we do that? If we divide surface area of Earth landmasses by the number of people living on them, we will get only 5 acres of land for every person. We must also take under our consideration, that in 2013 one third of that surface was already used for agriculture, rest is occupied by deserts, mountains and forests (which we need to absorb CO2 and pollution). And air pollution is a problem. In Great Smog of London 4,000 people had died as a direct result of the smog and 100,000 more were made ill by its effects. And now, in XXI century, when one worker of Gigafactory will be able, on average, to produce one car and 20 sets of 3.5 kW solar panels, 5 kWh batteries (every one of those sets should be able to produce enough electricity for average person, not including transportation and heating) per week, we allow CEO of corporations that make profit out of selling fossil fuels, decide about policy. That is insanity. When rise of global temperatures will catch up with rise of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (before First Industrial Revolution it was 260 ppm, now it is over 400 ppm), droughts will reduce area of arable land in many parts of the world, taking from people that already are in desperate situation, ability to produce food, destabilizing destabilized places even further.

So we should be trying to replace fossil fuels with alternatives, that not only provide people with ability to live without hurting others, but even right now, when mass produced, are simply cheaper. But no. Neoliberalism transformed into simple plutocracy. Administration of President Donald Trump consist mostly of representatives of various corporations. Lying about saving jobs that can not be saved is now enough to take one of the most important offices in the world. That is correct, many jobs can not be saved. Change to renewable sources of energy will make people who work for oil companies, coal mines and power plants simply redundant. Autonomous vehicles will replace drivers. Unless we will create completely new sectors, able to employ masses of people and pay them wages, unemployment will grow. And with growing unemployment, reduced wages will surely come, so less people will be able to buy products, those who will be able to buy them will buy less. Owners of the means of production will respond to that with investments in machinery and reductions in employment. In that situation, in that mad cycle, we should see increase in incomes that some corporations get from other corporations, as spending on machinery and implementations of new technologies increases, so GDP statistics will not be falling dramatically. Businesses will also turn for the state for welfare, so they can become so feared leeches, employing interns instead of regular workers, financing new investments out of subsidies, demanding tax cuts and so on. Should we be allowing that? Creating socialism for companies, while peoples standard of living decreases, just out of a fear of loosing jobs?

That is a state capitalism, my dear reader. An economic system of today’s China and of Nineteen Eighty-Four superstates. Middle class, a group of people who were useful to the state (institution to which few powerful monopolies outsourced task of controlling and providing for the mass of people), is always shrinking in that particular economic model. Companies work in capitalist mode of production, so efficiency is always a priority. And people, who through a hard work and years of training were able to lift themselves out of poverty, petite bourgeoisie, are being brutally replaced by newer, more efficient machinery. They are being forced to compete with the rest of the proletariat for few new jobs that are still being created. Middle class, the petty bourgeoisies incomes drop, proletariat incomes drop. At the end of that process most of the population is left with no money, the little green pieces of paper that create misery (but even in perfect system we will most likely still need to track consumption of resources and human labour, so some kind of currency will be essential for many years to come). Sometimes, in situations like that, companies resort to using their power over the government to increase state military spending. Other countries are forced to do the same thing. It all was nice and dandy during the Great Depression in the 30’s, technology was only so advanced, to only allow to mass produce machine guns, tanks, bombers and bombs. But after inevitable war for resources, we had many new technologies. We were able to built thousands of ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads. Mutually assured destruction preserved peace.

But now that system fails once again. New jobs that were created during introduction of computers to the general audience are being lost. During the 90’s, many people were employed in distribution of information stored in physical form. CDs, DVDs, games, books, newspapers. Now all of that work can be performed by a server connected to the Internet. Even if somebody buys physical copy of a media, his or her order is very likely processed by automated warehouse, at least at some point. So economy, in which most of the workforce is employed in service sector is also impossible, when computers are so advanced as ours, when we can cheaply mass produce low power microprocessors that are able to run computer vision algorithms in real time. And what now, I ask. Should we all really be preparing to a war, to fight for family values, like low wages, housing conditions comparable to those from XIX century and long working hours?

I say no. We should embrace technology, we should celebrate our ability to produce enormous amount of luxury goods without destruction of environment in which we and our children live. When economy is still alive and kicking, we should demand that reasonable taxes are put in place, and wealth is redistributed much more equally. Universal Basic Income seems to be good policy to implement. It should be able to take care of people whose job has been automated, it will allow people who hate their jobs to negotiate better conditions. Economic stability will increase consumption, companies will be able to rely on selling products to customers for revenue, instead of welfare. I would even say, with redistribution of wealth forced onto companies by democratically controlled state, free markets might finally be able to self-regulate, at least to some extent.

That is correct, I think Universal Basic Income should basis of modern communism. I think that best way to achieve real communism is freeing people from forced labour. That is what stands at the core of Marxist ideology. Technology changes modes of production, modes of production change societies. Slaves in ancient times were forced to work because they were propriety, serfs in feudalism were forced to work because they were renting land, proletarians in capitalism are forced to work because they need to purchase commodities necessary to survive. “Communism” that was implemented in USSR, did not differ much from state capitalism. Everyone was provided with a job, you could change it if you did not like your current position, state financed construction of residential buildings, hospitals, universities. If you compare it to the modern US, it looks almost like paradise, but it is not communism quite yet.

Technology is always disruptive, when deployed in society which requires everyone to earn their living by providing their labour to somebody else. Rapid improvements in computers during the Third Industrial Revolution, for example, made use of CNC machines in manufacturing possible. It drastically reduced time needed to produce many commodities. But old Soviet system using old production lines and giving special status to the workers working on them was not able to embrace this new technology, in the end collapsing and giving rise to a Russian oligarchy. And it seems the same fate is waiting for US and the rest of the countries that follow their neoliberal lead. Fourth Industrial Revolution will disrupt this outdated economic system in the same way. Many supermarket workers already lost their jobs to self-checkouts, fast food workers lost their jobs to automated kiosks. And this is only beginning, hardware needed to automate more factories and warehouses, to replace more tellers and cashiers, to replace drivers and many other professions is being mass produced right now. Corporations assume that markets are infinite, that their actions do not change those markets. But it is simply incorrect.

People in power must learn how to control themselves, how to cooperate. Otherwise we will end up with another Great Depression, people will be starving when enormous amounts of food are being harvested by autonomous machinery. New Hitlers will try to tell us that we need to eliminate one arbitrary defined group or the other in order to make things better. Jews, Muslims, immigrants, people with black skin, white skin or any other color of any other part of their body. Just do not look at redistribution of the wealth closely, be a good patriot.

We need a alternative. I think UBI is a good compromise. We increase standard of living of many people, slow down further destabilization. At the same time we reduce bureaucracy, eliminate old means tested forms of welfare, possibly making it simply cheaper than current welfare programs. Bu this should only be a start, our goal should be Star Trek like utopia, a Fully Automated Luxury Communism. Otherwise I am afraid, our current world leaders will be remembered as worst tyrants that walked the face of the Earth. Legacy worth living for, right?"

Likely, we will only be there for the summer and then will figure out where to go from there. 
I'm on a bit of a time crunch and need to get across the country pretty quickly.  After extensive research, I have decided that shipping my car/flying is not the option for me, so we are driving. Because of this, our trip will be approx 8hrs driving (give or take) a day, for 5 days. I tried to not stray far from the most direct route and I have worked out the following stops:

Start in Philadelphia, PA  (home)

Cleveland, OH

Madison  WI

Fargo, ND

Billings, MT

Spokane, WA 

And then our destination-Seattle, WA.

To keep costs low, we are planning to Airbnb. How can we make this trip not suck? Any changes to this route that you would make? What are the best times to drive? Is it best to go straight from destination to destination, or to make a few stops (beyond rest stops) and detours along the way? What are some cool things to see/do in the towns listed? Where are some cool towns to stop in along this route?

Any advice is super welcome!"

You might have missed it in the flood of political news lately, but [The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/19/trump-reportedly-wants-to-cut-cultural-programs-that-make-up-0-02-percent-of-federal-spending/?utm_term=.62ed2099fba5) (among others) have reported that the new US administration is planning to defund the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and privatize the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).

The mission of /r/Askhistorians is to provide high-quality historical answers to a wide audience. We usually work online, through [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/askhistorians), [our Tumblr account](http://askhistorians.tumblr.com/), and here, but that's not all we do. [We talk to historians and bring them here for AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/amas). We have (with your help) [presented at historical conferences](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/february-2016/have-a-question-about-the-past-askhistorians). We also advocate: for good history, for civil discussion, and for keeping historical research going.

That's what we're doing today, and we need your help. 

We don't get political for a particular candidate, a particular party, or a particular point of view. We get political when good history matters. **If you're American, we're asking you to call your Congressmen and Congresswomen to support funding for the NEA and NEH.**

The federal budget process isn't fast, and it isn't straightforward, but it *is* changeable. Each February, when the president submits his or her budget to Congress, there's a better chance of a cow getting through a slaughterhouse untouched than that budget staying in the same form. That's why your calls matter: Congress catches a lot of flak, but it does do work, particularly in the details of the budget.

And we say *call*, not email, because calls matter. It's easy to ignore an email; you probably do it a few times on any given day. It's a lot harder to ignore a phone call. [Call your Senators and Congresswoman](https://www.govtrack.us/). You won't talk to them directly; you'll talk to a staffer or an intern answering phones. They've been getting a lot of calls lately. Chances are, they'll have a local office as well as their DC office. If you can't get through to one, try the other.

Don't call other Congressmen than your own. It's a waste of time. Don't follow a script; those tend to get ignored. Just say who you are, where you're calling from (city/zip code, if you don't want to give your address), and what you're calling about.

Repetition helps. Put the numbers in your cellphone and give 'em a call when you're headed to work or have a spare minute or two. It doesn't take a lot of time, but it can make a world of good.

Why are you calling?

The National Endowment for the Humanities funds a lot of good things. If you've seen Ken Burns' documentary *The Civil War,* you've seen some of its work. If you've read *Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-45*, you've seen some of its work. If you've visited your local museum, chances are that it too received some NEH funding.

There's something else important: **NEH funding indirectly supports what you're reading right now.**

Many of our moderators, flaired commentators and even ordinary users have jobs that are funded in part or wholly by NEH grants. They have the spare time to offer their knowledge and skills here because of those grants. A lot of the links we provide in our answers exist because of the NEH. [The *Discovering America* digital newspaper archive is supported by the NEH.](https://www.loc.gov/ndnp/)

The NEH does all of that with just $143 million per year in federal funding. That's just 0.003 percent of the federal budget. If you make $40,000 a year and spent that much of your income, you'd be spending $1.20.

For all the NEH does, that's a good deal.

5r1u89,1,2017-01-30,Supplement Essay To University of Wisconsin - Madison,hnguyen9905,CollegeEssays,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeEssays/comments/5r1u89/supplement_essay_to_university_of_wisconsin/,"Here is my supplement essay to University of Wisoncson - Madison with the prompt: Tell us why you decided to apply to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In addition, share with us the academic, extracurricular, or research opportunities you would take advantage of as a student. If applicable, provide details of any circumstance that could have had an impact on your academic performance and/or extracurricular involvement. (650 words)

Here is my essay: 

“American dream” is a popular term among international school students in Vietnam. Like most of the others at my school,  I desire to reap countless learning opportunities and meaningful experience there, and University of Wisconsin - Madison adapt more than my expectations. I would not only be able to apply my knowledge acquired from the textbooks into hands-on projects in the laboratories and internship programs but also have a chance to compete in engineering team projects and develop my passionate hobby of board gaming. 	
Industrialism and environmentalism are two contradicting trends in the world: either with prosperous companies yet polluted environment or with mediocre companies yet healthy environment. Unfortunately, nowadays their desire for improving standard of living drives them toward industrialism, consequently causing the issue of climate change that have lasted for several decades. Thoughtful scientists and engineers have strengthened renewable energy, a clean but yet effective method, to change people’s direction toward environmentalism. Since then, I was inspired to follow the scientists and engineers’ side to diminish global pollution and strengthen carbon sequestration process. Through my past experience of Regional Math Championship and World Scholar’s Cup during the last three years, my competitiveness with surrounding opponents have grown stronger. What makes me feel even more ambitious is WisWind, a team competition established with the aim of designing an optimal wind turbine system in technical, economical and social aspects. In 2016, University of Wisconsin - Madison also sent a team of 15 students to compete in Collegiate Wind Competition offered by US Department of Energy. This will not only allow me to participate in an engineering project for the first time of my life but also magnify my willingness of making a greener community here and winning against the threats of climate change. 
People often say: “Do what you love”. Except for my desire to protect the environment, my love of playing and designing board games is also satisfied with Madison Board Gamers. I have developed my passion of board games for one year through spreading the world of board games to my friends and nearby people and playtesting my own game with a group of local game designers to publish it in the future. There was even some days when I spent three hours designing the game mechanics and printing the game components to try with my friends or I dreamt about a new board games ideas and wrote that into my notebook right after I woke up. With my passion and experience in board gaming, Joining Madison Board Gamers would allow me to expand this immense world within the community and inspire some members to follow the aspiration of designing a board game the way my local designers strengthened my desire of developing and publishing my own game. 
	Along with rigorous undergraduate curriculum, Co-operative internship program and several meaningful activities and organizations, University of Wisconsin - Madison would surely make a long-term companion on my academic and career pathways in the future. (491 words)

Sorry in advance for the long post, I'll try to make it brief. 

**BACKGROUND:**
I have a friend, we'll call him Fred. Fred and I have known each other for seven years. We met when he did an exchange program at my school, and he was assigned to one of my friends. At the time that I met Fred, and for the majority of our friendship, I was dating other people. Fred and I became pen pals after the exchange program was up, and the following year I did the same exchange program and saw him again when I was visiting his home country with my school. 

We kept up communication over the years, not speaking to each other very often but also acting as if no time had passed between conversations. We would talk about normal things - music, movies, interests. I enjoyed talking to Fred so much because I'm an amateur linguist and he would always help me practice different languages. He would send me music in his native language that he thought I would enjoy, and I helped teach him idioms since that's what he struggled with the most in English. We would Skype occasionally while we were doing homework, again with normal conversations.

Until this year, I only saw Fred in person one other time, when we happened to be vacationing in the same city four years ago (with our friends) and decided to meet up for coffee one day. I went to meet him along with my boyfriend, and Fred came to meet us with two of his friends. Both of them were girls, and I had a sense that he was dating or would soon be dating one of them based on their interactions.

**PRESENT DAY:**
Last summer, Fred informed me that he obtained an internship in my city and would be living in the area from October to February. I was obviously excited to be able to see more of my friend, and the apartment he chose happened to be only a few blocks from where I work part-time (unbeknownst to him). Because of that, I saw Fred maybe once or twice a week when he was here, but with some weeks where I didn't see him at all. 

I currently live with my boyfriend Mike (25M), the same one that I was with when I met Fred on vacation. We have been dating 3.5 years and have been living together for 2. He has met Fred a few times as Fred has even come over to our apartment once. However, Mike does not speak Fred's language and doesn't have much in common with him. I've invited him a few times to hang out with us, but he politely bows out every time. 

After he was here for only a couple weeks and we already had spent a few days together, he joked that his apartment (which he shared with two other girls in the program) was like my second home, and asked me to carry the spare set of keys in case one of them lost theirs, but also so that I could get in easier as their doorbell was broken. The girls knew about this and had no problem with it. I accepted.

One day I had plans to meet Fred at his apartment after work to get dinner, and it was raining out. I had forgotten my umbrella at home, and wasn't looking forward to the walk. I didn't tell Fred this, only that I was clocking out soon. When I walked out the door, Fred was waiting with an umbrella. He said he knew I would forget, and this way the walk wouldn't be so miserable.

After about a month Fred and I started watching a Netflix show together, as it gets very cold in the winter where I live and we didn't feel like going out. Since the TV is to one side of the couch, we both sat with our feet up and facing to the side. After a while Fred grabbed a pillow and used my knees as a back support. I thought this was weird but harmless, so I didn't say anything. 

At this point, my coworkers, who had already seen him with the umbrella and heard about the keys, and met him the few times that he come to my work, told me that Fred probably has feelings for me. I said that was preposterous because he's never acted out of the ordinary before. He has several friends who are girls, and he and his best friend (whom he talks to every day) speak to each other very affectionately and it isn't weird, it's just how he (and his culture) is. They looked at the posts and pointed out that only she speaks to him that way, indicating that she probably has feelings for him but not the other way around. They argued that since I've been ""off the market"" this whole time, he's probably just playing the long game and not wanting to say anything until I'm single, and I haven't been. At this point I became worried: if they were wrong, it would disrupt my friendship with Fred and also cause a lot of stress with my boyfriend over nothing. My boyfriend Mike might even request that I stop seeing Fred or end the friendship, although I don't really think he would do that. My coworkers assured me that I probably didn't need to say anything unless Fred did something inappropriate. 

Last Friday was Fred and his roommates going away party, as they are leaving this Thursday. They had a big party at their apartment with all the friends they had made, most of whom I knew from spending so much time with them these past few months. Mike did not come because he doesn't like parties, and also all the people there spoke Fred's language. At parties, I have a general rule that I never do shots as I'm a pretty small person and they hit me very hard. Fred asked me to do one because it was a special occasion and I agreed. The shot compounded with the other drinks I had got me very drunk and I only remember bits and pieces for the rest of the night. 

I remember we all got into taxis and went to a nearby nightclub. Fred bought me a beer and we danced - separately. I went downstairs to use the bathroom and then sat in the hallway for a bit before going back up. Fred found me there and I think we talked about how he was leaving soon, he asked if I was going to miss him. I think I started crying at this point, mostly because I'm an emotional person and I really was going to miss him. His running joke was that he was never returning to the States again, he had already visited me twice and I haven't returned to his home country once. So I think I was crying because of this, but I'm not sure. At this point I am pretty sure that he kissed me on the lips in a way that was more than just a peck, and said something like ""I'm joking, of course I'm going to visit you, I love you."" 

After this I don't remember anything - I don't even remember what I said in return. I woke up in my own bed, hungover. Mike told me that Fred had ridden in the taxi with me from the club, then took a taxi back to his apartment. I've spoken to Fred on Messenger since and he's acting like nothing happened. I haven't said anything to him yet since I'm not sure if I'm misremembering or not.

Fred is leaving in a couple days, and we probably won't speak as often and won't see each other again for several years. I'm not sure what to do since I'm not 100% sure what happened, and if it would be better to just forget the whole thing since he's leaving anyway. I'm seeing him tomorrow because I loaned him some stuff for his apartment and he's returning them to me. I don't know if I should say something to Fred, to Mike, to both, or to neither. If Fred does harbor feelings for me he hasn't let them affect our friendship - until the party. I only see Fred as a friend and Mike knows that and has full faith in me - and I think Fred knows that too. If he does, I don't want to complicate our friendship and hurt him by bluntly telling him what he already knows. But if I don't say anything, I feel like that's selfish of me because I don't want to lose who has become one of my closest and oldest friends. 

What should I do Reddit? Also congrats if you read the whole thing. 
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: An old pen pal of mine moved to my city a few months ago. Things were normal until his going away party, where I believe (but am not 100% sure) that he kissed me and told me he loves me. Either way, after the party he brought me safely home to my boyfriend's house and never mentioned it again. What should I do about this situation?"

I am a student majoring in Information Security and Assurance. I have nearly completed my degree with 5 courses left. My problem is I really don't feel I have gained any sufficient experience to feel like I know anything about infosec. I know this is probably mostly my own fault for not studying course material more than the required amount to finish assignments. Is there anyway to go from feeling confused to more confident regarding infosec? I am interested in obtaining an internship where I hope knowledge could be cultivated in this field. I have gone through some very basic programming on Ruby, worked in very structured virtual environments, and mostly sat through lectures regarding the field. All of this has made me feel prepped to do absolutely nothing with infosec with any confidence. Am I alone in feeling like this? Does everyone feel this uncomfortable when they are ""starting out""? I feel like I am missing something that everyone else is in on. I am interested in this field and have always gravitated towards computers but I am beginning to feel like I made a wrong choice somewhere along the way. Any thought, advice, or opinions would be very much appreciated. Thanks!

edit- I appreciate everyone's responses, I am going to study up and work on a certification path to head towards a CISSP while looking for an internship where I can get some hands-on experience. I got a little overwhelmed so thanks for everyone's patient replies."

one day outside the building Hellbent was looking at a magazine and having a smoke, when suddenly a strange figure came approaching the building he was tall, muscular, had white hair, grey skin and pointy ears. as he was standing in front of Hellbent. he said in a calm yet creepy voice, ""Do you work here?"", ""What's it to you?"" Hellbent asked ""I'm here about the job."" the figure answered. ""Oh, you the intern?, great I need my girly magazines organized, and I need you to get me more Cigarettes and a coffee CHOP, CHOP!"" Hellbent ordered. ""I'm no one's intern, I'm here for the narrating part of the job, I'm here to be a new member."" the Figure responded ""Oh! that? Tsk,Tsk,Tsk it's not that easy to be a member!"" Hellbent said ""You see you have to earn it.""
 
""How's that?"" the stranger asked. ""BY BEATING ME  IN A FIGHT!!"" Hellbent responded ""You're on!"" The stranger said as he pulled out a long sword while Hellbent pulled out his favorite gun. 

""Before we battle I must know your name"" Hellbent said ""My name is Nixxiom."" the stranger answered. ""Good, now that i know your name, LETS FIGHT!"" Hellbent yelled as he shot a couple of bullets out of his gun, but unbenounced to him Nixxiom's sword was sharp enough to cut through bullets with ease.

As Nixxiom was about to strike Hellbent grabbed his knife and stabbed him in the shoulder. while groaning in pain Hellbent approached him. ""Giving up?"" Hellbent asked. ""Not even close."" Nixxiom responded as he blasted a force of magic strong enough to push Hellbent ten feet away from him. 

While Hellbent was on the ground Nixxiom grabbed a bottle of Medicine and drank it. unlike ordinary medicine this medicine was strong enough to heal even the most stubborn wound. As Hellbent tried to make a reach for his gun, Nixxiom kicked it out of the way and grabbed a second sword and threw it down at him.

""HEY WHAT THE HELL?"" Hellbent yelled. ""If we're gonna fight dirty we should do it the old-fashioned way, NOW DRAW THAT SWORD!""  Nixxiom ordered as Hellbent got up. after getting up Hellbent grabbed the sword Nixxiom handed him and then they began to fight. As the metal from their swords were clashing, Melissa was in her office drinking coffee and responding to Dolans Email until she heard Hellbent scream.

hearing it she looked down at window of her 5th story office where she saw Hellbent bleeding, it turns out Hellbent never knew how to handle a sword and got his hand cut off by Nixxiom. as Nixxiom was pinning him down with his foot and getting ready to do the final blow, Melissa sprang into action by jumping out of her office window and gliding down to the ground with her wings, just in time to stop Nixxiom from making a HUGE mistake. 

""HEY STOP!!!"" Melissa yelled as Nixxiom turned his head to see the purple bird from the count downs and animated videos, ""What are you doing?"" Melissa asked. ""Trying to earn my spot as cast member!"" Nixxiom replied. ""Now who told you that? you already got the job a month ago."" Melissa said.

""I did?"" Nixxiom asked. ""But what about battling one of the cast members, Hellbent said th-"", ""Hellbent?"" Melissa interrupted, ""look dude, first rule here is that you never listen to what he says, I should know i work with the guy.""
""Oh! I guess i didn't have to cut his hand off to prove my dominance."" Nixxiom said awkwardly ""SOMEBODY JUST GET ME A DAMN DOCTOR!!!!"" Hellbent screamed. ""Hang on."" Melissa said as she grabbed her phone and dialed 911. after Hellbent was rushed to the E.R. Melissa decided to give Nixxiom the tour of the building. 

""And this is where we go to shoot the episodes of Super Planet Dolan."" Melissa said. ""Any questions?"", ""Yeah."" Nixxiom said ""what will my first countdown be?"" he asked. ""Lets see, your first Count down is going to be 'Nine Strangest things people tried to trade sex for'"" she answered. ""That sounds weird."" Nixxiom said with an eyebrow up. ""Don't worry at least you wont have a an awkward count down like I did on my first one."" Melissa said, giving him confidence.

A week later Hellbent came back with a cast on his arm to protect the hand he got re-attached, just in time to see Nixxiom's first count down. After recording was done everyone congratulated him on being a new member of the family, even Hellbent Gained some respect for him. ""Well Hellbent I hope you learned it's not always smart to pick on the new guy."" Melissa said. ""Yep."" Hellbent answered, ""Next time we have a new member I'm gonna make sure he's shorter than me. ""I guess you never learn."" Melissa groaned as everyone accepted Nixxiom as not only a new Character, but a new friend.

A few weeks ago, I posted a question about writing a screenplay based on Silent Hill 2.

Well, I did it.

I wrote the first draft. It's done. Completed.

And it's absolutely fucking atrocious.

Which was to be expected. The first draft of anything is shit, but since everyone seemed supportive of my efforts, I went ahead, jumped on the keyboard, and pumped it out before my last semester of college came kicking my ass into overdrive. 

So, I at least have something to work with. I can't really say how much progress will be made on subsequent drafts in the coming months given school, work, a possible internship, my short film project, etc...

BUT, I will return to it over the summer and do another draft. And then another. And another. And another...it goes on, and on, and on until I'm confident enough in my work that I'll post it here for anyone who wants to subject themselves to the torture, the pain, the suffering that is my writing. Then I'll take your feedback, if you do choose to read it, and write another draft...

Alright, that's all I have to say. Peace."

5r6l2q,6,2017-01-31,Problems with a coworker in the office,espoirhope,womenEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/womenEngineers/comments/5r6l2q/problems_with_a_coworker_in_the_office/,"I apologize if this gets long and rambly, but I'm hoping someone here may have some good advice.

I just graduated this May and started my full time job in July. I worked the same position last summer (2015) as an intern and was quite excited to come back full time. I'm a test engineer and work with a wide variety of people. I'm a very friendly person and get along with a lot of the people work on the floor as well as other engineers.

I had the opportunity to travel for work where I knew a bunch of the guys already out there. I was the only female there, whatever, honestly not a big deal to me. While I already knew some of the people there, I didn't know all of them. At this point, I had recently started dating my boyfriend and I informed my friends there of it. 

Cue, meeting that ""weird guy"" at work. The guys I know told me he's kinda creepy, just would walk up behind you and not say anything. And it wasn't like he had something to ask and was waiting, he'd just stand there, staring. Now, I have a degree in social work in addition to my engineering degree. This guy didn't come off as weird to me, just a shy guy. So I started talking to him and bringing him over to the group of guys and getting everyone to interact. The guys had tried a few times but to no avail.

Now, I made it clear a multiple points that I had a boyfriend. A new relationship and I was excited, so the ""weird guy"" knew about it from the start. But as I was there, he started to hang out more, open up a little bit, but still kinda shy. I left to go back to the main hub of operations with his number (to contact him when we were going out and our general plans).

We texted here and there, as I do with the rest of my coworkers. I checked with the guys back on travel and they assured me I did not treat him differently than anyone else there. But we all joked that he was smitten with me. I brushed it off, he knew I had a boyfriend and he was literally on the opposite coast from me.

Eventually he ended up coming back to the main hub on home leave for a few weeks. He would stop by my cube to talk about things, ask me out for lunch, and if that didn't work he asked me to dinner. Now, every time he came by I mentioned my boyfriend. Like how I just went to spend the weekend with him (long distance), or how we talked about this or him that. Literally every conversation.

Well, one week I had a truly awful week and it was just before Christmas. He ended up buying me a box of chocolates and giving me a fancy Christmas card. I thought that he was teetering on a line and not understanding that I had a boyfriend. I told him that while he's a nice guy, that nothing was going to happen, I love my boyfriend and that was that. He took a few days and said he still wanted to talk and that he understood. That was a lie.

I ended up having to go back on travel for a few days. He was to go out for a few days and fly back to the main hub. Once he heard I was going and that there wouldn't be any overlap, he was suddenly staying four extra days leaving the day after I was. I then heard from a close friend of mine there that the ""weird guy"" told him to ask me for drinks/dinner and then to tell the ""weird guy"" where we were and he was going to meet up with us.

Then more came out. He had counted the number of times we texted each other one month and apparently the number ""had to mean something"" that we couldn't text that much without it meaning something. He was worried about all of us hanging out as a group because then I wouldn't pay enough attention to him. And that when I spent the weekend with my boyfriend I suddenly stopped texting him and why would I do that. The guys had a talk with him and told him he needed to cut it out. Again this is AFTER I told him no and re-iterated that nothing would happen.

After I heard all of this I stopped texting and engaging with him in any conversation that did not involve work related items. Anytime he came out with us (as a group) he would come super drunk, drink more, sulk and not say a word and leave without warning. One night we went out drinking and apparently he was counting the amount of drinks I was having. Thankfully he did what he normally does and left without warning. He sent me a text asking ""how he can stop being so weird"" to which I didn't respond. We lied to him about a day trip the rest of us made because we knew he would throw off the whole thing. And when we went out to dinner the next night (couldn't lie, my team was playing in the playoffs, he knew I'd be there) he followed me out of the restaurant to say if there was anything he could do to make ""this"" not weird anymore, to let him know.

I later found out he had freaked out on a male coworker yelling at him in a restaurant. He lied about a mean text the same coworker ""apparently"" sent him (I knew because I watched my coworker send him this message). Now this guy is a really good worker and I don't want to destroy his life so I was hoping that the guys talking to him would knock some sense into him.

But it all came to a head when I got back to the main hub and was group messaging with some of the guys back on travel. One of them made a joke about the situation (as we do with a lot of things) but I thought that the joke was real and freaked out. Once we couldn't joke about it I realized the severity of the issue. Especially when he followed me out of a room to trying to talk to me when it was not work related.

Now I've gone to his manager about the situation who said they were going to use it as a learning experience for him and that for the time being we are to remain on opposite coasts. If I need to go on travel, I need to let her know and he will be coming back to the main hub.

The big problem I see with this is I'm miserable at work. This was before this situation happened, but travel made me happy, it made me feel home when I was there. I made a huge move for this job and I'm not loving the environment. A higher up manager talked about putting me on extended travel for this location and even more travel for when we move to our second location. He wants to find a place to make me happy and once I do that, help me find a job within the company there.

I told the ""weird guys"" other manager (there are like three layers of management, benefit of big corporations) and he said ""oh, I hope your not going out there during __, ___ and ___ times"" (basically the biggest reasons I would be out there and when there really would be any work out there). I felt entire demeaned by the situation. Why send out the new person who doesn't have an intimacy with the part when they could have someone else out there who knows it? Now just to clarify, we have two different positions and there are other people who can come out to support. But just the fact he's spent so long with this part, I understand but it makes me even more miserable. The one ray of hope I had feels like its been utterly destroyed.

Now, I don't know if he's spoken with his manager yet, so I don't know how he's going to react. I couldn't sleep last night because I had nightmares about it. Do I think I'm in immediate danger? No. But is it something I worry about? Definitely. I just don't know where to go to from here. My usual mentor is out on maternity leave and I have no one else in the workplace I feel comfortable enough talking to about this. Even if he's kicked off the project, he's still at the main hubs location most likely so it doesn't ease my mind, and would only make it worse.

I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. This is my FIRST full time job and I have zero idea how to handle this. At this point I've applied to two other positions outside of the company but I don't know if anything will come of those. Plus if I leave before a year I have to pay back my moving stipend. I'm sorry this is so long, I think part of it I just needed to get off of my chest. Any advice would be appreciated.


**TL;DR** ""Weird Guy"" at work started somewhat stalking me and became slightly obsessed with me despite telling him no. Went to his top management who was helpful, went to his second level management who was extremely demeaning. Miserable at job, this made it 100x worse. Need advice."

But after her scene in hell, I realised she only wants her family back, she is feeling regretful and guilty after all she has done. and probably, that will be one of the main subjects in the next episodes, (1) Her return to hell 
2.- I predict The presence will do an appearance, AT LEAST in a dream or a memory, we need to know why he sent Mum to hell, it could be a pretty strong reason.
3.-  Azrael: We saw Uriel and Azrael's blade again, Probably a hint to prepare us for her appearance, Also if I were her, I will come down to recover my toy back. I'm excited about that! what if she is Death from the endless. it would be AWESOME. 
4.- Michael.- Ok, I won't let my intern fanboy take over, but Michael can be a great villain in Season 3.
5.- I don't want to think negative, but Chloe and Lucifer relationship won't happen soon, why? Chloe will get mad at him for disappearing like that, and Lucifer, Knowing that she was made for him by his dad, will simply reject her or be confused for a long time.
6.- I really want to know more about Ella and Dr Linda, Ella is a super cool character and quickly became a fan favourite, and is like, the second time they instigate that Dr Linda has a dark past, so it will be totally cool to know more about them
Tell me, what do you think about it and what are your thoughts?

I would like to first apologize if I picked the wrong tag, I was confused on which one to pick. 

Okay, time to get right into it: 
I first gained a lot of weight when I was around 11 years old. I never really noticed how much I weighed because all I cared about at the time was video games, toys, and well, food. I became obese and had risk of diabetes and heart disease. 
Fast forward a few years and i'm 21 years old, a senior in college and now more ashamed of how I look than I ever was. College has taught me three things so far and although these are cliches, they speak louder to me than anything else.
1.) If you don't ""hang out"" often, you seem to lack a sense of social aptitude.
2.) By now, 90% of people are non-virgins and have been in a relationship before, if you haven't, you're a minority and a little odd.
3.) If you have bad grades, a bad GPA, and haven't done internships, say goodbye to your career.

I admit that my first two years of uni were not praiseworthy, in fact, terrible. But I got my act together and i'm learning to do better. However, I seek guidance on the other things. The idea of being a virgin at 21 isn't really bothering me, but the act that i've never even been in a relationship before. It eats me up everyday and I would much rather focus that attention to other things, but it's harder than I thought it was. I've come to the conclusion that losing weight should be my #1 priority alongside graduation, however, something is holding me back, and I don't know what it is. For some reason, i'm so very afraid of losing weight to the point i'd rather die than try at all. It seems silly, but I don't know what's holding me back. Is it the fear that after I lose weight, nothing will change and i'll still be a loser? Maybe, but it doesn't sound correct to me. Hence, I am asking for guidance. 

Thank you for reading and taking the time to respond if you choose to do so."

-taking 3510 in the fall and 3511 in the spring

-taking 3510 in the fall and taking 3160 in the spring

Wumba Lange straightened his silk tie as his gaze drifted up the intricate and extravagant workings of the massive archway which stood before him. To the right stood a pillar three times his two meter height held three golden figures of boys, each nude and brandishing silver torches with bronze flames, encircled by a silver scarf which hinted at the genitalia hidden beneath. To the left was a pillar topped by a proud and stalwart statue of a bronze woman in a flowing silver toga, a golden spear in one hand and golden laurels in the other, her bronze wings spread wide as the golden eagle atop her silver helmet glittered as though designed to ensure every eye was drawn to her. 

“The Goddess Nike, Ambassador-Friend,” A polite synthetic voice came from behind Wumba. “Famous as the Greek Goddess of Victory, the Latins coopted the deity millennia ago. This interpretation is quickly overtaking the more traditional, less warlike visage.”

“Thank you, Chaperon,” Wumba turned as he spoke and smiled at the pleasant but blank face of his automaton companion. “I was having trouble placing which God of theirs it was.”

“This interpretation is much more like the traditional visage of Athena or Minerva.”

“The Wise Goddess,” Wumba frowned up at the glimmering statue. “And the Goddess of Wise War.”

“A loose definition, but not entirely inaccurate,” Chaperon’s pleasant tone betrayed no judgment.

Wumba’s frown deepened as his eyes rose up the extravagant archway. Gold, bronze, silver, copper, marble and gems, countless and unimaginably expensive rose further and further toward the purple clouds above. Centered immediately above the archway was the shining face of Sol, the Sun God which the Latins trumpeted as a conqueror of all inferior cultures and peoples. The shining light which would always lead the Latins to victory and prosperity, the dawn which would always come after the dark of night. Up, and up, and up, and up the arch continued. Small rooms were built into the structure, identifiable by the intricate and gleaming stained glass windows, and many flanked by gold, silver, and bronze statues of Gods, Goddesses, and countless other divine figures.

As scribes, interns, guards, and only the Gods know what other professions came and went through this towering example of Latin power, passing by Wumba and his slender automaton companion without much more than a cursory glance, the Ambassador could not help but feel repulsed by the whole display.

“How much blood was poured into the foundation of this monument to sin?” Wumba scoffed as he scrunched his face and sniffed, “You can almost smell the suffering.”

“Three-thousand-six-hundred-and-seventy-two worker deaths were recorded during construction,” Chaperon replied in his usual pleasant cadence, soliciting a sigh from Wumba.

“Thank you, Chaperon.”

“Would you like to know anything else, Ambassador-Friend?”

“No, Chaperon, that will be all,” Wumba removed his square-rimmed glasses while at the same time withdrawing a microfiber cloth from the breast pocket of his blazer and began to clean the thin glass lenses, staring beyond the massive arch to the now blurred structures and trees beyond. In the pleasant orange light of this planet’s star, the deep green of the trees contrasted against the faint vermillion reflection of a building in the distance reminded him of a hillside on Terra, long, long ago.

“Ambassador-Friend Wumba,” Chaperon’s voice brought Wumba back from his escape. “Our meeting with Prima Dux Thetis is in one half hour. We are approximately twenty minutes from the meeting location in the Capitol Building. I must recommend we proceed with haste.”

“Of course,” Wumba replaced the glasses on his nose and the microfiber cloth to his pocket before waving the automaton forward. “By all means, lead the way.”

Chaperon’s feet moved with a swiftness that would surprise the casual onlooker as he stepped past the Ambassador and tread up the marble stairs with little more than a gentle click to accompany each step. Despite the automaton’s surprising speed, Wumba was a step behind him as though a human shadow to the humanoid automaton. As the pair glided between two large groups of bickering and irritated sounding men Wumba smiled, amused as one of the men complained, “And with that barbaric embassy expected at any minute I have been made to run around like some sort of slave boy! Carry messages between departments just to keep them off the intranet! The nerve of Aulus! The nerve of Thetis!”

‘*Even so far from Terra the Latins think of us as barbarians,*’ Wumba shook his head as the groups faded with distance. ‘*After so many centuries they still think so little of Germans.*’

And so Wumba fumed as he followed Chaperon through the marble pathways of the Capitol Complex, stepping between and behind groups of people which sometimes muttered about their bothersome duties in the wake of an impending embassy and sometimes muttered about their disenchantment with all facets of life in the gray bureaucracy of the planet. It was not unexpected when Chaperon came to an abrupt stop before the shining white marble steps which lead up to another towering and glittering structure, obscured from the bottom of the stairs by a larger-than-life sized statue of Jupiter brandishing two lightning bolts like spears pointed down toward those which would walk toward him.

“Our destination is at the top of these stairs, Ambassador-Friend,” Chaperon tilted his head as he looked up at the intimidating statue, a peculiar motion which Wumba had come to know meant the automaton was perplexed by some facet of the world or culture he observed. “This statue is not in the records of the Amelia Nova Capitol Complex. Nor do I have any record of it being chartered by Prima Dux Thetis.”

“Does that really surprise you, Chaperon?”

The automaton’s head tilted just a bit further to the left before snapping upright with a click, “Official meeting time is in five minutes. We must return to this matter at a later time.”

“Of course,” Chaperon began to click up the stairs and Wumba grinned as he followed. His grin diminished with each step as the massive statue loomed ever nearer, the hard face seeming to glare down at him with violent intention. 

‘*This is not the wise father of the Gods which is often touted by the Latins,*’ Wumba drew a deep breath as they topped the stairs and were less than a meter from the huge base of the angry statue. ‘*This is Jupiter Optimus Maximus.*’

“The Best and Greatest,” Chaperon’s pleasant voice startled Wumba who caught the slight tilt of the automaton’s head before a booming voice drew both their attention to one side of the statue.

“Ah, the storied Ambassador Wumba and his automaton companion,” A rotund man in shimmering green boots and generous black robes started toward the pair with arms outstretched. “I was worried you might have become lost! Welcome to Amelia Nova, I am Oculum Veri Nonus Seppius. Let us make haste, slowly, to Thetis.”

5r97mp,3,2017-01-31,Took an internship during a semester of college. Things are getting expensive. Help.,competentcuttlefish,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5r97mp/took_an_internship_during_a_semester_of_college/,"I'll try to lay out my financial situation as clearly as possible.

In the bank: $6,300

Student loans: $8,500

Rent in college city: $500/mo (no utilities)

Rent in internship city: $775/mo

Utilities in internship city: ~$100/mo

Food: ~$400 a month

Income: ~$1,000/mo

I'm in this internship from January to mid-April. We were told that we would be paid $5,200 total. I foolishly assumed this was after taxes and rented my (very expensive) place based on that. We get paid around $500 every two weeks, or $4,000 for the whole internship. I still pay rent on my place in my college town because I planned on going back on weekends. But I might have to find someone to rent it in the short-term.

During my previous semesters, I'd pay off a majority of my loan during the semester. When planning for this internship, I was okay with actually using my loan. But given what I just found out about my income, I'm panicking a little. If my math is correct, I can end up with $4,000 in the bank and $8,500 in loans, which is upsetting given I ended last year with $6,000 in the bank and $5,500 in loans.

How can I minimize my expenses?

5r983c,70,2017-01-31,Isaiah Thomas and Imagination at Work™,shnts07,bostonceltics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/5r983c/isaiah_thomas_and_imagination_at_work/,"The Celtics are one of the hottest teams in basketball in the month of January, and nobody has gotten hotter than Isaiah Thomas. **Thomas is as hot as a quality General Electric Wall Oven with spacious dual opening doors for cramped kitchens and incredible convection patterns that cook your food to perfection.** He's on an incredible run in 4th quarters and coming into last nights game, the Celtics offense was an incredible 1.249 PPP in the 4th quarter with him on the floor. For context, that would be a little less than 137 points over the course of a full pace-adjusted game.

Isaiah is an All-Star and he's got a shot at an All-NBA selection. He's the tiny soul of this team. For my money, there's no one more fun to watch in the NBA, and I'm incredibly proud that he developed the way he did here in Boston. He feels like a homegrown talent rather than a dude we traded Marcus Thornton for in hopes we could get a Jamal Crawford-ish sixth man. I guess my point here is that I love Isaiah Thomas. I love him so much and [trading for him](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/4ej3t1/the_luck_of_the_irish_part_ii/) is what pulled the Celtics out of the [trajectory for multiple lottery appearances](https://www.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/3o5ulq/the_rebuild_is_over/). 

There's a strong case to be made that if Isaiah Thomas never comes to town, there's no playoff games at the Garden in that Earth 2. The Celtics would be chasing the eight seed this year, and Al would be in Washington, dressing in black for a big showdown game against the Pacers to determine the 5th seed.

So, before I launch into the crux of what will be an emotion-stirring argument, Let's remember these over-arching truths that I agree with.

1. Isaiah Thomas is great and I'm very happy and lucky to have him on my team. In a vacuum where we don't have big cap plans, he's absolutely been worth a max contract these past two years. 

2. The Celtics are probably still in the lottery if Isaiah Thomas never comes to town, this by extension means Al Horford has never come to town and maybe Avery Bradley has been shipped for picks at this point.

3. Isaiah Thomas is a multi-time All-Star and the real soul of this team. At a certain point, sports have a to be about people and personalities you form attachments to, rather than cheering for laundry. If you can't find joy in what Isaiah Thomas is doing right now, well, I've got bad news about you enjoying basketball going forward.

#####The King in the Fourth(?)

I'm going to start this by looking at 4th quarter scoring. Something important to know is that PPP means *points per possession*, or how many points the Celtics or their opponent score each time they have the ball. For context, the average PPP for the Celtics this year is 1.093 and the average PPP for Celtic's opponents is 1.062. This should help provide an anchor for when you read PPP totals to know what you are looking for. 

Over 1.093 from team offense = good offense

Under 1.062 from opposing team offense = good defense

Under 1.093 from team offense = bad offense

Over 1.062 from opposing team offense = good defense

So let's talk about Isaiah Thomas and his 4th quarters when he's on the floor.

*All numbers are courtest of nbawowy.com &amp; don't include last night's Detroit game because it took me forever to run them and I have a day job. Please find it in your heart to forgive me.*


| It On the Floor  | Poss | Celtics PPP  | Opp PPP | Net PPP |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Isaiah Thomas | 666 | 1.254 | 1.240 | 0.014

So as you can see, when IT is on the floor in 4th quarters, the Celtics offense goes Super Saiyan. As we touched on before, that's a pace adjusted scoring margin of about 137 when pace adjusted for an entire game. What might be a little bit surprising is when take a peek at the defensive numbers and see that the Celtics are getting walloped almost as bad in terms of opponent 4th quarter scoring.

That's troubling, but hardly a new narrative. We've see the Celtics struggle with complex defensive issues this year such as ""screens"" and I think I've actually seen Weakside Help for Dummies underneath Gerald's cocoa cup a couple of games ago. The good news is that when the Celtics struggle this mightily in the 4th quarter. They have Isaiah Thomas to fix things and keep them afloat. In fact, let's check out how bad the numbers are for the Celtics when Isaiah Thomas *isn't* on the floor.

| It Off the Floor  | Poss | Celtics PPP  | Opp PPP | Net PPP |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Isaiah Thomas | 427 | 1.143 | 0.981 | 0.162

Huh, that's weird, but, again, probably pretty explainable. Rare are the fourth quarter minutes that Isaiah Thomas doesn't play, but they are mostly against opposing bench units. Despite the grumbling and groaning about Kelly Olynyk, the Celtics have one of the most potent benches in the league, so to see them ether opponents at the end of games isn't that shocking. It's a little weird that this logic doesn't extend to those games (like yesterday) when Thomas plays a full 4th quarter and gets minutes against those tender bench units, but whatever, it's pretty easy to come up with some plausible reasons for this. Thomas plays some 4th quarter minutes with the worst members of the Celtics. In fact, let's look at Thomas's most common teammates in the 4th quarters.

IT 4th quarter Teammate | # of Poss
:--: | :--:
Marcus Smart | 421
Al Horford | 356
Jae Crowder | 350
Avery Bradley | 336
Jonas Jerebko | 262
Kelly Olynyk | 211
Terry Rozier | 198
Amir Johnson | 184
Jaylen Brown | 159

Hmm, it still looks like it's mostly the crunch time guys that Thomas plays with. However, that doesn't mean much. There's still a pretty plausible rotation explanation that would explain where Thomas gets unfairly hammered for dopey teammates and tough opposing match-ups. So let's take a look at the full array of 4th quarter minutes complete with on/off differential for each rotation player who's played over 400 minutes.

| 4th Quarter Poss | Poss On | Net PP On | Poss Off | Nef PPP Off | Net On/Off Diff |
|---------------|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Marcus Smart  | 700     | 0.093     | 393      | 0.033       | 0.060           |
| Isaiah Thomas | 666     | 0.014     | 427      | 0.162       | -0.148          |
| Avery Bradley | 550     | 0.077     | 543      | 0.066       | 0.011           |
| Al Horford    | 528     | 0.016     | 565      | 0.113       | -0.097          |
| Terry Rozier  | 526     | 0.095     | 567      | 0.049       | 0.046           |
| Jae Crowder   | 505     | 0.088     | 508      | 0.058       | 0.030           |
| Jonas Jerebko | 451     | 0.096     | 642      | 0.054       | 0.042           |

*I realized after I finished this I should have but Amir, KO, and Jaylen in here, but went back for the numbers nbawowy wasn't working, I'll comment below with them when they come up, but I had ran them before and know that Jaylen and Amir were also quite positive while Kelly was about half as negative as Al is.*

So here is where we hit the crux of things. There's a way to explain away the Celtics pedestrian 4th quarter differential with Thomas. The problem is that for that to hold water you need to have someone in the rotation who is actually worse. 

**The other thing that holds water is GE's extensive line of Energy-Star approved washers and dryers. I can't tell you how often I come home and the last thing I want to do is head out to the laundromat. Luckily, thanks to GE Capital's incredible financing and helpful installation coordination, I have my own GE, double load sized washer in my home that handles all my biggest loads of laundry! Like all GE products they are so affordable and high quality.**

The next closest in terms of having a bad showing is Al Horford, and his numbers are only about 2/3rds as bad. Al is one of the Celtics three most important players, so don't mistake this as me saying he's not earning his money. He's been incredible for the Celtics, too. However, that kind of makes since given what we've seen from Horford in some 4th quarters. Al has had some well-documented struggles down the stretch of several games and he got hammered by the Felgers of the world for it. 

The fact that Isaiah Thomas can do what he does for the Celtics every 4th quarter night in and night out and still end up with the worst Net On/Off differential by far isn't just weird, it should be downright impossible.  You can look around and squint for other things to pin this on, but at a certain point, Occum's Razor has to come into effect and the conclusion needs to be that the Celtics are giving back almost all of their 4th quarter points because of how bad having Isaiah Thomas on the floor makes the defense.

#####IT's Defense, Unsalvagable?

No. 

The Celtics were a perfectly fine defensive team with Isaiah Thomas on the floor last year. In fact all of these things I'm hammering IT for now, like Net Rating and On/Off differential, all swung the other way last year. The Celtics were great with Thomas on the floor and had big scoring margins and fell apart when Thomas left the floor. 

This probably means that something about this team makes it much less easy to cover up IT's deficiencies than last year's team did. I'm willing to bet that that thing is rebounding and turnover differential. You can have a good defense with Isaiah Thomas in it. You can have a good defense when you don't rebound that well. Surviving both is probably a bit of a bridge too far.

You could also make the case that this sample size isn't that big. This probably amounts to about a 10 game sample size in terms of regular minutes. While that's a pretty small sample size, it's also a single-digit denominator fraction of the season, which isn't that small either. It would be foolish to just take this numbers as fact at this point, but likewise, this is enough of a trend that to discount them would be silly also.

#####What Does It Mean?

I guess it depends on what you see the path forward for this team being. This is a problem for the team. Is the fact that Marcus Smart has been more important to the Celtics outscoring opponents than Isaiah Thomas an indicator of a fatal flaw in Thomas or a damning indictment of the front office not putting the guys they need around their superstar?

Is the fact that Al Horford can't help the team cover for IT as well as Jared Sullinger a misscalculation by Danny or throwing the limitations of Thomas into a sharper relief?

If you're old school, you can just chaulk it up to the Celtic's ""not competing"" or ""eye test"" or whatever and say that they just don't try as hard on defense. I disagree, but we can follow that line of logic. That would be great because it would mean the Celtics have just been coasting this whole time and will be able to turn it on in the playoffs.

Whatever you think, the Celtics have a defense problem when Isaiah Thomas is on the floor and it compounds when he's at his most potent in the 4th quarters. 

That's a fact.

He's playing out of his mind right now and the Celtics have continued to win because he's done enough to keep the Celtics outscoring their opponents with this other-wordly outbursts, but what's going to happen when (or if) he comes back to earth?

No matter what you think the problem is, if this trend holds up, the consequences will materialize hard and fast in the playoffs, where weaknesses are targeted. It might not matter, because a championship this year is probably no what this team was built for (Markelle Fultz... Hello), but this is the kind of thing that can bring the good times screeching to a halt come playoff time.

#####TL;DR

The Celtics have been very bad on defense in 4th quarters with Isaiah Thomas on the floor.

This could mean:

1. The Celtics aren't trying hard, eye test, everybody loves their shot, etc.

2. There's a 'lower than perceived' ceiling on how much Isaiah Thomas can contribute to winning

3. The personnel on this team aren't capable of adequately hiding the deficiencies of our superstar.

I also purposely don't use any names in it.
As this is so far my best sexual experience, I try to cover as many details as possible.
I know that this is very long, but I couldn't really find a way to split it, without loosing the tension. I marked the places when things started to get serious, just in case if you're only interested in that.

There are always some people, you just can't get along with. I had to work with somebody like that for some time and he was simply a total jerk.
He always wanted all eyes on him and be the center of every conversation. At first he may look very handsome, but he was just a fake from top to bottom. I have to give it to him: He could really impress people with his confident behaviour and speak, but there was nothing behind it.
Whenever he was with us, he was always speaking about the same: New sports cars he wanted to buy, money and how successful he was with women. We were both around 20 years old and I had already grown out of this childish stuff. 
We actually never met in private, but since we were the same age and lived in the same area, we sometimes met randomly at a party.

It was at one of these parties I've met his then-girlfriend for the first time. I had to give it to him: He had scored nicely !
She was maybe one or two years younger, about 5'2', had shoulder long, dark brown hair that she wore as a pony, brown eyes and she was wearing something to die for. I don't know how many pieces her outfit had, but it was a black, shinny fabric and was classy and totally indicent at the same time.
The top part looked a bit like a swimsuit, two stripes of fabric came from her shoulders, crossed over her boobs and went to the back. Her cleavage was absolutely gorgeous, a nice handful that looked round and firm. You could even see a slight bump of her nipples in the stripes that covered them.
She had a flat, fit belly. almost a littlebit of a sixpack, with a nice little piercing in her bellyutton. The dress ended up in very tight pants that revealed her firm thighs, with a little gap between the legs. On the back you could see very much skin and her ass was maybe a bit wide, but nicely round and very well packed in that dress.
I have to say: I was totally jealous and just wanted to touch every part of that nice, sexy girl. But it wasn't (yet) to be.

I don't think I haven't seen her until what happend next, but I sometimes had to think about her.
One day my coworker showed up and said that I had to do him a favour. At first I wasn't interested in doing anything for him, but curious as I was I asked what this was about ? He said that he wanted revenge on his ex !
He explained that she had left him (good girl) and this was something that his ego couldn't deal with. So he had set up a fake online identity and was chatting with her for a while now. The plan was that I should take over, meet and fuck her then reveal, that this was arranged by him... what ?!
This wasn't right, what the hell was he thinking ? Didn't he had any moral at all ? I was really curious about that and didn't really wanted to let it happen, so I agreed, not knowing what to do about it. So he handed me all the details and now I was part of his game.
I have to say: The idea of banging her really turned me on, but the plan itself didn't really, I had to figure out how to handle this.

The same evening I changed the password of the account he had given me and started to text with the girl. She seemed a bit light hearted and naive but we had some really nice chats. We talked about sex but didn't really went into detail.
As it happened, she wanted me to call her after a while, just to figure things out before we maybe go on a date. It took me two days before I was ready for this, but she pushed onwards and so I called her... She sounded so happy and was talking very fast and with a very high pitch. I didn't wanted to harm that girl in any way, it wasn't right.
So I told her to sit down, because I would have to explain something. She was worried and her tone dropped immediately. I revealed as nicely as I could what this was all about and she was lost for words for a moment or two, but didn't start crying or anything. I knew that this might be over by now, but it luckily wasn't.
After a few seconds she got herself together and simply answered, that she doesn't mind and would really like to meet me, even more since I seem to be a very honest, carrying person. So we arranged to meet in the city for something to drink and have a chat.
My heart dropped again as I saw her for the second time: Her hair was a bit messy, like she came straight out of the bed, but this gave her such a cute touch. As it was winter she was wearing a sweatshirt and some wide trousers. But it fitted her so well and I just wanted to cuddle with that girl.
We had a couple of coffees, a really nice talk and I figured out, that she wasn't really lucky with the men she had chosen so far. I brought her back to her place, she gave my a kiss on my cheeks and that was it for the moment. Altought nothing more happened, I was happy that everything came out alright.

We had a few chats afterwards and I had the impression, that nothing more was going to happen.
Then one friday she said, that she would be at her parents house over the weekend and her they wouldn't be home at saturday. She wanted to give me a gift for what I had done for her and so I went there on saturday morning.
She opened the door with her cutest smile and let me in. She was wearing tight jeans and a sweatshirt, nothing too revealing and I was a bit reliefed that this went totally normal so far. She offered me something to drink and we sat on her bed but not really close to each other, listening to music and chatting. 
We talked a few minutes before she said it was time for my gift. I already felt that its not going to be sex and it wasn't: She handed me something she crafted herself using a glass cube. It was nicely painted and simply a decor to look at. I liked it very much and still have it. I gave her a kiss on her cheek and said thanky you.

----ROUND ONE, PART ONE: THE BLOWJOB----

But then things turned in a good way. She grabbed my hand an asked if I could do her another favour. My heart started to beat faster, the look she gave me went straight trough me, this was next level sexy and she just did it with her eyes only. ""I just want a kiss, the most passionate one you can offer"".
I grabbed her head with both hands, came close to her and could smell her natural odor for the first time, it was really inviting. She had smooth, silky lips and I started to kiss her with our mouths shut at first. This kiss seemed to go on forever and after some time, we slightly open our mouths and our tongues touched each other for the first time.
She knew what she was doing. She massaged my tongue with hers in a very pleasing way, I couldn't get enough of that. I started to kiss her neck, her skin was just so clean and tight, this girl was just absolutely gorgeous in any way.
She moaned a littlebit and I slightly grabbed her ass with my hands, it felt so damn good even trough the jeans she was wearing. She pushed me back a littlebit, looked me in the eyes and took off her sweatshirt, she was wearing a red satin bra and I could see her firm, round, really nice boobs again. I took of my sweater and shirt and started to kiss her again.

We pressed our half naked bodies against each other as hard as we could, we were both completely on fire. My kisses went down again, on her neck in her cleavage and over her still covered boobs. As firm as they looked, they were pumping hot and as I touched them they were totally soft. But I didn't want to rush it, this girl was just the next level.
I turned her around, again starting with the kisses at her neck and then down her spine, that was clearly visible on her back. There was not a single part of her body that was not astonishingly fit and firm. My hands went up and down on her sides, this was better than I've ever imagined before.
I ended up above her jeans, but again: I didn't wanted to rush this ! I turned her around again, kissed upwards from her bellybutton until we were kissing eachother again, I felt our bodies pumping as we pressed them against each other.
I grabbed her hair, her ass, touched her sides, I just wanted to touch every inch of her hot body over and over again. She went trough my hair, along my sides, also grabbed my ass and even scrachted a littlebit my back, that was so damn hot.

This went on for minutes, we just kissed like there's no tommorow, still kneeling on her bed. And then she opened up my trousers, just the button and the zipper. Her warm hand went straight into my shorts, she went along my hard, pulsating dick, squeezed it a bit and took her hand out again, my god: I could explode right now as he whispered in my ear ""It feels good"".
She started to kiss my neck, went down over my chest while her hands went along my sides, and then she pulled down my trousers. My shorts were already soaking with precum, she smiled and giggled. She told me to lay down on her bed, and took my shorts off as I did so, my stone hard boner was right in front of her face.
For s slight moment I wasn't sure if my average 6.5"" long, but above average thick (about the same number), partly cut dick was enough for this gorgeous girl, but she immediately pushed that tought away as she said ""You're the first cut one I've ever had and I already love it"". She touched it with the inside of her open hand and went along it, this was unbelievably hot, my entire body shaked. I was so happy that I had shaved and showered before.
She started liking my balls and went upwards my shaft, while one hand still gently massaged my balls. Her lips touched my glans and she slowly took it all in while holding my dick with the other hand. She just said ""Just let it go, it's alright"" and then moved her mouth and my skin slowly up and down while sucking slightly. I've almost faded away, I was so in heaven.
It only took a minute or two before she had a massive load in her mouth, my entire body shaked, every muscle was as tight as it could get and I moved up and down with every load that came out. She took it all in, swallowed it and cleaned my dick with her lips and tongue. Now it was my turn: I just wanted to eat that girl out and give her the same pleasure she had just given me.

---ROUND ONE, PART TWO: EATING HER OUT----

I grabbed her by the side, pushed her onto the bed and pulled the jeans down, revealing the matching red satin slip to her bra. The slip was soaking wet and as I took it off, she immediately spreaded her legs and there was her nice, juicy, hot and wet pussy. She had a little landing stripe over her vulva, which was really nicely trimmed and I loved every single thing about what I saw.
Her outter lips were just the right size, the inner ones really short and firm, the mouth was slightly open and her clit was looking at me as it had its own eyes. I couldn't resist a single moment. My tongue started to lick and push that clit, my fingers went in one after the other. She moaned and her body started to shake.
She smelled really nice down there and I wanted to lick and touch every single bit of her. My tongue went inside her, I wished it was longer so I could explore more of her inside. My fingers went up and down the outside of her lips while still keeping care of her clit.
I liked her hole, massaged her butthole and simply licked everything I could get my tongue on, this was incredible, she was incredible. I just wanted to get her off as much as possible and she did. Her fit, tight body shaked up and down, she started to roll from side to side, moaning and almost screaming. Her body was pumping, every part of her was tightend up.
I touched her everywhere, didn't stop to work on her clit and my tongue was still in full motion, I didn't want her to stop going off. This was maybe the longest climax I've ever seen on a woman and it was so nice to give it to her, even now thinking and writing about it makes me horny as hell.

---ROUND ONE, PART THREE: THE TITTYFUCK----

Eventually it was over and she started to giggle, I went up on her and we kissed each other, I already had a boner again. I opened her bra and took it off. My god: Her boobs totally matched the rest of her. They were firm and soft at the same time, a nice handful with small nipples that pointed a bit outwards, they were rock hard.
I've started to massage them, kissing and licking them, her boobs alone were a thing to die for and I couldn't get enough of them. After a while she laughed and offered me to have a seperate date alone with her boobs, my god that girl was simply gorgeous. Then she had that look again, without saying anything she turned me around and slightly touched my dick with her hands.
As she felt that it was already rock solid, she put it between her boobs, squeezed them together and started moving up and down. I never had a tittyfuck before and maybe her boobs were a littlebit to small for this, but it felt really good and I loved watching her moving up and down.

---ROUND ONE, FINAL PART----

Eventually I leant toward her, grabbed her hair again and pulled her back, we started to kiss each other again for minutes or so while pleasing each other with our hands. Then without me doing anything she reached over to a bedside table, grabbed a rubber and pulled it over my dick.
She started to rub her clit on my glans, it was hot and wet and I couldn't wait to be inside her, but she was in charge now and I wanted her to have the maximum pleasure. And then she let it slip in... we both moaned together. My dick was a perfect fit, I could feel every bit of her, even wearing a rubber.
As she started moving up and down I wanted to get in touch with her clit, but she took my hand away and ment, my dick was in charge of that and it was doing it nicely, I was in heaven and closed my eyes, grabbed her sides and moved up and down with her. We were breathing and moving together, our eyes shut, just feeling each other.
As I had gone off before, I was able to withstand that for a far bit of time and I was so happy as she came shortly before me. We smiled at each other, kissed, cuddled and were just really happy. This may have been the best sex I've ever had in my life so far.

---ROUND TWO----

We just lay in bet for an hour or so, giggled, cuddled and just enjoyed the moment. Then she offered me a shower. I tought that this would be it, so she handed me a towel and I went off to the bathroom. She didn't join at first, but it didn't took very long... As I was cleaning myself up, I heard her open the door and walking towards me. She pulled back the curtain and joined in.
This was the first time I saw her standing completely naked in front of me. I still can see that picture and it makes me so happy that I met that girl. At first we just started to clean each other up, but I was so horny again. It was again her who took the lead, so she turned off the water, took a towel and just rubbed my boner dry.
She took my hands and we went back to her bed. She again put a condom on and we simply went for the good old missionary position. This was so nice. It was nothing compared to our long sexual journey we had before but this time, I saw her boobs shaking forth and back, her lovely smile and her eyes. This time I came before her and had to finish her with my hands.
We kissed some more, but were both totally exhausted. Our bodies became extremely sensitive and we just touched each other slightly, just enjoying what had happened so far.
Then it was time for a proper shower and this time, nothing more happened. So we met again in her kitchen as she offered to make us a small snack.

---ROUND THREE---

She was wearing a white t-shirt, no bra and some bright green panties. She even looked very nice in that casual dressing. We couldn't really talk much when we sat next to each other, since we both giggled and were still totally exhausted. I was so fascinated by her lovely smile and everytime she leant forward I could see her nice boobs in her t-shirt. I couldn't believe it, but I got horny again...
As we finished our sandwiches, she was about to clean the kitchen. I wanted to help her, but instead I went into her bedroom and grabbed another condom. She didn't seem to notice that and maybe tought that I went to the toilet. As I came back, I already took my trousers off. I grabbed her sides from the back, pushed my crotch against her ass and my hands went up under her shirt.
She seemed a bit shocked, but let it happen. She was so exhausted that I had to take the lead and I didn't wanted to ruin this, so I went really slowly. We were standing in front of the sink. I was holding her sides under her t-shirt and my hands went slowly upwards. I kissed her neck and her hair, it was still slightly wet and smelled really nice.

When I reached the side of her boobs, I just gently grabbed them from underneath, slowly and gently massaging them. We still were both very sensitive and by now means did I wanted to hurt her. She started moaning a bit, but we didn't say a single word and she even started to giggle again, I loved that so much.
I reached down and pulled off her panties, but dind't wanted to put it in just yet, I had to be gentle. She slightly spread her legs, just enough for me to kiss her clit and her pussy. She was hot and a bit wet again. I started fingering her, but only with one single finger, still doing everything very carefully.
She moaned and opened up a bit more. When the juice almost started to run down her leg, I stood up, pulled down my shorts and slowly went into her. She reacted exactly the right way. I pulled of her t-shirt, kissing her neck and spine as I slowly moved up and down.
I was able to do that for quite some time. Her breathing got heavier and heavier and as I bought her to climax, her knees even got a bit weak. I came almost instantly after her. It wasn't the best climax of this day, but it was still amazing. We kissed each other once again and then it was time to leave.
I remember that driving home wasn't an easy thing, since my car back then had no power steering and my entire body was low on energy. Sadly I couldn't met her on sunday since her parents were back home.

One of the next days she texted me, that she had to move to another city for an internship at a hospital. We've never spoken about a relationship or so, but this broke my heart a littlebit.
Before she left, we wanted to meet at a party close to were she lived. Sadly she was there with some friends and I couldn't really get her for me, it was a disappointing.
I so hardly wanted her to stay, and I just wanted her ! She was wearing a really nice, dark blue, long one piece dress with a nice, but not too big cleavage. It had a nice cutout on the back, so one could see her lovely back. I so wanted to kiss that, I wanted to kiss her... everywhere.
I almost wanted to say goodbye when she came to me and said, that we should leave and just go somewhere private. We couldn't go to her place, since she was living together with two other girls and since I was studying part-time I was still with my parents, so my place was no option either.

---FINAL ROUND---

We finally ended up in the storageroom of the company I was working for. Not really romantic, but it was warm and there was no one around, I also knew that there were no cameras on the inside and I had a key for this place that was officially given to me, so this was okay.
We started kissing again, passionately but with a bit of tension, we both knew that this was maybe the last time for long, or even for ever.
As she stood in front of me, I pulled her dress over her shoulders and it felt to the floor. I couldn't believe what I saw ! She was wearing one of these bras that just holds everything in place from underneath, but exposes her breasts completely ! She had some sort of stickers over her nipples but underneath they were already hard.
I gently peeled them off, trying not to hurt her and started kissing and sucking her hard nipples. She moaned, smiled and bit into my ear, no girl had ever done this before and it was sexy.

I could feel her, smell her, touch and kiss her again, it was so good ! She took her bra off and I dove into her breasts, my hands went up between her legs and touched her black slip she was wearing along side stockings, but no girther ring. It looked so damn sexy on her thighs. I went on and I started to finger her. But then she simply couldn't hold it back any longer.
I was pushed back, she pulled of all my clothes and was already about to open a condom, gladly it was on after a couple of seconds. She layed herself on a table, looked me in the eyes and said ""this time, I need it hard"". These eyes, that filthy smile, that juicy wet pussy, simply everthing. Her legs were spread wide open...
I wished my cock was twice as long as I entered her hot, soaking pussy. I wanted to do it as hard and deep as possible. I moved as fast as I could, sometimes my dick flipped out and everytime I put it back in, it was simply heaven. The table and everyting around it was shaking, soon after our bodies were too. I had a really hard time holding it back, but managed to bring her to climax, she
screamed as she reach it and I went off like a rocket. I had to sit down next to her, my knees were weak and I felt like all my energy was gone trough my penis into her. We smiled at each other, kissed and then put our clothes back on. This couldn't get any better and we were both completely exhausted.
I brought her home, without anything further happening. At the doorstep we once again kissed each other passionately, interestingly we both said ""Thank you"" almost at the same time and this was it... she left two or three days afterwards and I've only seen her once at a shop by accident, when she was visiting her parents (she was in a relationship at this time).

Writing this, I feel that I really miss her and oh boy do I miss that body. This was by far the hottest sexual experience I've ever had and to be honest: It was the only one were I could stand four times in a row.
The only thing I know about her, since we lost contact after a while, is that she is now married. Lucky bastard...
Ah by the way: I told my coworker that it didn't worked out and she wasn't interested in me... he had no idea !"
5r9gtt,31,2017-01-31,Trying to get my life moving in the direction I want and my mom is doing more harm than good (long),justaguymovingahead,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/5r9gtt/trying_to_get_my_life_moving_in_the_direction_i/,"LTL, FTP, throwaway because obvious, etc. This is a mom story and not a mil story, so I'll take it down if it's too far off base. There's a lot of background, so I hope you'll bear with me. TLDR at end.

I'm an engineering major who wants to work in renewables (perfect timing, I know). I'm job hunting right now and it's got me really down for various reasons. A bit of backstory before I get into what's happening now.

I had a summer internship after my junior year of college (the company was cool, but I wasn't a fan of the field or the location). I did well and they were enthusiastic about hiring me after I graduated. When I visited them over winter break though they couldn't offer me a job for financial reasons (they later did almost a year after I graduated). Since working for them after I graduated was my plan, I was kind of screwed (for those not in a STEM field, if you don't have a job lined up before your second semester senior year you're pretty SOL since all the summer hiring is done in the fall, at least where I went to school).

So I graduated and went job hunting in a state I didn't particularly like but it was where my ""contacts"" were. I didn't like any of the jobs I applied to and I was getting less help than I'd hoped. So after two months I didn't get any interviews and decided to go to grad school and get my MS while doing research. It went pretty well and I finally got an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to stay at the university after I finished to get my PhD.

I thought my new project was going to be great. It was working with renewables, which is what I always wanted, but it pretty quickly turned out to be not what I'd expected. The machine I worked with was built in a rented out space in a metal shop (loud noises, no heating/AC, lots of smoke, and some other things; all of which don't do well my my anxiety) and my main coworker didn't get along with anyone (myself included). I felt unimportant; the research was co-oped with a company, and they already had a company man doing this before I got on, so I wasn't exactly making any contributions another person couldn't make. My coworker constantly make me feel inadequate, and I felt like I had nothing to contribute to what was meant to be one of the most important tasks of my career. I fell into depression (for the second time in my life) and tried to get off the project the summer after my first year. My adviser asked me to give him some time to try and fix some problems, so I did, but things didn't get much better. A few months later I started feeling suicidal and brought up getting off the project again. Then it got dropped on me that I couldn't switch to a new project in the group and basically had 4 options:

1) Stay on the project.

2) Leave the group and join another professors group.

3) Leave the university and go to another one.

4) Leave graduate school and find a job.

I ended up going deciding to leave graduate school. Joining a research group after leaving another one creates a lot of distrust since your new adviser doesn't know if you'll stick around, and I honestly felt like I needed a break from school. I started job hunting at the end of November and finished up the semester on good terms. I also started getting my depression treated and I'm working on improving my well-being and the quality of my life.

---

Which brings me to now. I’m still job hunting and out of more than 60 applications so far I’ve only gotten one positive response to my applications and no interviews (I've gotten very little feedback in general, which I’m trying to take as a good sign). I started looking in just one city and was looking at a few specific job types, but I’ve expanded out to 6 major cities and I’m looking at all applicable jobs in them.

For those who have been job hunting, you know it’s stressful, especially the waiting. Most of my family has being pretty supportive of my decision to leave grad school, my choices of where I want to go and what I want to do, and understanding of the wait, albeit my parents are even more impatient than me since they haven’t had to hunt for a job since the 80s. My mom especially has been impatient, and has pushed me to start looking at other cities earlier than I needed to. This added onto my anxiety as I had been spending a lot of time reassuring myself that this is what job hunting is like and that it’s normal to not hear back for a while, and my mom was steadily undoing that reassurance.

Turns out my mom isn’t nearly as understanding as I’d thought. I found out that the company I did my internship with had a posting for a position that I could apply for. It was at their new location though, which was in a city I liked even less than where I did my internship. Additionally, it’s very far away from where I want to settle down and nothing I want to really do is happening in that city, so networking is out of the question. Also, the job won’t get me any relevant experience, so when I decide to move on I wouldn’t have anything to show for the two years I'd be stuck there except some income. I’d basically be in the exact same boat I’m in now, except I’ll be out of touch with the job market and my network, and will have wasted 2-3 years in a job that didn't help me move forward. I'm only recently started getting my depression under control and more than anything I don't want to be stuck in another situation I hate.

I made the mistake of telling my mom about the posting though, since she called the day after I saw the posting. She pushed me to try call up the CEO, since he’d probably be very happy to offer me an interview. I said I’d think about.

An hour later I get a call from a friend, whom helped me get my internship. He gave me a lecture basically about how I need to take any job anyplace I can get one in this market and *city I hate* is where a lot of people are going, even if they don't want to stay there long.

I realized as soon as we started talking what had happened: my mom called him to get him to talk me into applying. I was pretty upset, for obvious reasons and for another I didn’t realize until a few days later (more on that later). The next day my mom texted and asked if I had talked to the CEO, I said I hadn’t and I wasn’t going to apply for the reasons mentioned above; she didn’t respond. 

The day after I get a text from my sister asking about a **job offer I had passed up**. I got pretty angry at that and kinda blew up at my sister (not directing my anger at her thankfully). I explained, much less calmly, to her the reasons I’d told my mom, especially the fact it was a job posting and not an offer. She was understanding, since my mom has been on her lately as well. She was with my mom at the time so she said she’d call me later.

Around this time, I checked the posting again and it was already gone, so at the very least I wouldn’t get anymore crap for not applying. I reasoned that if it had been taken down so soon after I'd found it, then they likely already had their candidate well before I saw it.

A few hours later, I get a call from my dad. At first we just caught up, but I knew where the conversation was going to head, and sure enough it did. He asked if I’m applying for many places and specifically at *big company in original city I wanted*, whom I’d already given an application. He was genuinely surprised to hear that, and even more so to hear that I wasn’t just looking at that city but at 5 others and I had branched the positions I was applying to (even though we’d talked before about all this). He then says that he talked to my mom (surprise surprise)(side note, they divorced 7 years ago and rarely talk; they both live in different states, my mom in the same one where the position was) and she had said I’d **passed up a job offer**. I repeated what I’d said to my sister and mention the post was already gone anyway, probably filled by the time I’d found it. He thinks my mom is getting paranoid over nothing and I’m not at the point yet of taking jobs just because I’m desperate. He said he'd talk to my mom.

Later my sister called and we had a pretty supportive conversation. She was there when my mom and dad talked and basically described that she’d told my dad I was “holding out for my dream job in my dream city and wasn’t considering anything else”. I was pretty pissed when I heard her say this, especially when my mom had told me earlier “I know you’re trying”. So basically she lied since apparently she doesn't feel I'm trying and decided to complain to my sister, dad, and friend, giving her own false interpretation of what was going on. 

It was about then I realized why I was really bothered by this. This was basically a repeat of an event from a few years ago. My mom had figured out a secret of mine (non-standard sexual interest, which she learned about by going through my dresser (this was abnormal for her to do, so far as I know) looking for a present for my sister, instead of asking where I'd hid it, and then finding some private sexual items. I’d only told a few very close friends because it can be easily misunderstood. My mom misunderstood, and decided to tell her own false interpretation of what she found to my sister and my dad, and I only found out about it because my sister confronted me afterwards. I was pretty pissed off when she did that, since it was a very private matter and instead of confronting me about the fact that she’d invaded my privacy and trying to understand what she'd found, she spread hurtful lies to my family. My sister had a long talk with me about it, afterwards she was okay with it though she definitely didn’t understand, and my dad to this day hasn’t brought it up.

My mom called me a few days later. She basically ignored the job posting and acted as if nothing had happened; I didn't bring it up either. She asked about generic job hunting stuff and talked about my sister, whom is also going through a big life chance and isn't taking it well, both emotionally speaking and with regards to her preparation. The conversation was just off. It was basically the same thing that happened the last time.

So here I am, realizing that my mom can’t be trusted with any personal details about me and me not trusting her to know what’s happening in my life. As well, I’m also now wondering what else she’s said that’s been a lie and what other details of my life she’s talked about to others, truthfully or otherwise. I’ve trying to decide if I should keep her out of the loop until I start getting interviews, and even then I’m not sure what to do. This is the second time she’s gone behind my back and said hurtful things about me that weren’t true, and it took me more than a year to stop bearing that grudge the first time. I'm becoming less comfortable about being involved with her.

I've gotten a lot of support from my SO, friends, former colleagues, former professors, my sister, and my dad. But it sucks how much one persons' opinion can make all that seem so much lesser.

**tldr**: I'm recovering from depression, quit my PhD program after a year, and I'm trying to get my career started. Job hunting is slow, just the way it is. My mom is making me feel bad that I don't have any interviews yet and passed up a job posting that, while I had a great chance of getting, probably would have made my depression worse and wouldn't further my career. She told people close to me that I was being lazy and passing up a great job offer, basically ignoring my reasoning. I get reminded of another time my mom invaded my privacy and told hurtful things to my family."

After doing a little search of the forum, I'm in maybe the not so uncrowded boat of a person traveling to Blenheim to work the wine harvest!

I have a job with a fixed period of employment so I won't just be getting there and looking for work, Im just looking for some insight on the town.  I've done a bit of due diligence and see my best bet for housing would be TradeMe or Easyrommate for a room, or dun cannon, koanui, or copper beech for a hostel.

What is the best route to get to Blenheim?  I was thinking to fly to Wellington and then take the ferry to Picton, then (train or bus????) down to Blenheim.  Would Christchurch be better given the road situation?

Anyways, working in wine has been my life the past ten years and It will be interesting to see another region.

Any help would be appreciated, if you have a room to let maybe I'll take it!

We certainly take international interns here in Northern California and I no doubt respect them a bit more for the leap of faith they take.

5rbu8t,3,2017-01-31,Any forensics people out there?,samwise_thedog,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/5rbu8t/any_forensics_people_out_there/,"So I'm really interested in cyber security/forensic accounting and was looking for some advice from those who may know more about this field than I do. 

I'll be finishing up my undergrad degree after this semester and currently have an internship at a small CPA firm near my school. I've mainly been processing payroll and doing bank recs for small companies in the area along with some simple tax returns. I'll most likely get offered a job here where one of the partners has already said I would focus on tax. They don't do much auditing and the ones they have are very small clients. 

The pay here would be much more competitive than I would have thought and it is hourly which means I would do very well during tax season but have a Friday off every now and then and work mostly around 40 hours the rest of the year. The plus here would be that I could use the downtime to get the CPA exam out of the way quickly. After this I plan on getting a Master's degree, most likely in Information Technology. 

I have two questions really. First off how difficult would it be transitioning into forensics after I get my Masters if I start out in tax? 

Second how helpful would the IT Master's degree be? I feel like something that develops computer skills and knowledge would be beneficial but is there another related degree that might be a better fit?

Would love to hear from you guys, especially if you have experience in the forensics area. Thanks for taking the time to help me out.
