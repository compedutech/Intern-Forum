t2c4f,1,2012-05-01,Internship application criticism.,AwesomeKasper,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/t2c4f/internship_application_criticism/,"Hello /r/GameDev. I'm looking for an internship in a game studio as a programmer for my final semester of school. I've compiled a list of companies I'm going to send an application to but first I'd like some criticism on my cover letter to give myself the best chances of being hired. Mostly I'd just like to know if this would get the attention of the reader and generate interest in an interview.

The letter:
---------------
Hello &lt;company name&gt;. My name is &lt;NAME&gt;, I'm a 22 year old student of Computer Science and Game Design in Denmark.  
I write to you because I am searching for a company to intern in for 3 or more months this fall of 2012. This internship is part of my 2½ year education which I will complete in February 2013. The goal is to gain real world experience in software programming and game development.  


  I send this application to you because... &lt;Something specific to this company&gt; I'm interested in your projects and the technologies your company work with etc...  


  But why me? Why am I so special I'm worth all the trouble?  
The answer is because I'm a highly motivated, self sufficient and reliable young man with a broad range of skills both technologically but also socially. I have a curious mind and enjoy challenging myself to push my own limits. I believe I can make a meaningful contribution to your development staff and I'd love the opportunity to learn from someone well established in the industry. Frankly I feel you would miss out by not hiring me.  


  I'm mainly interested in working either with specific gameplay features or AI design. To a lesser but still significant extent I am also interested in working with the GUI, backend systems, engine tweaks/optimizations, netcode and the like.  


  If you are interested in hiring me I would love to set up a Skype or other form of video call for a “face to face” interview. Barring that a phone conversation in the least.

t283z,1,2012-05-01,Drupal modules or AJAX?  I need advice.,chibling,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/t283z/drupal_modules_or_ajax_i_need_advice/,"Hello!  I recently started an internship and they want me to take information from a database and make some representations (charts, maps, timelines, etc) for a website that will dynamically change as content is added to the database.  They are using drupal, which is something I have not used before, and which I will not have full access to as a mere intern.
I can get access to the straight XML printout of the data I will need, but I'm afraid I don't exactly know how I might pull helpful information out with XSLT or something more traditional (for example, ""of these 500 entries, 30 individuals have written more than 10 books..."").

At the moment it looks like I have two options:
1.  I get somebody higher up to install a module on Drupal that can do data analysis type stuff (in which case I would love suggestions of which module to choose), and hopefully I'll be able to do everything in good old SQL...?
OR
2.  I parse the XML data and pipe it through to one of the google analytical tools, like GeoChart, etc.  But if I choose this option, which language should I use?  JQuery?  Ajax?  I don't know either, but I'd be willing to learn if it was for the best!

I know this is not the specific type of question this forum is probably used to, but beyond some pretty basic PHP, SQL, Ruby, XSLT, and Pure Data, I do not have a strong programming / database background and I need any advice I can get with this particular problem.  What do you recommend?  Thanks so much!"
t27rh,3,2012-05-01,Need help getting through to my manager.... Any tips?,bmxludwig,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/t27rh/need_help_getting_through_to_my_manager_any_tips/,"Currently I am employed at an injection molding company that specializes in short production runs. I am currently using this job as my ""internship"" and will finish my manufacturing engineering degree at the end of the summer.

The company I work for does not employ a single process or industrial engineer and it is very obvious at times. My manager is not an engineer, but rather a guy who has worked at this company for 20+ years. Currently he handles setting up productions runs, managing raw materials, oversees shipping, and pretty much knows ""everything"" about the factory as far as the presses and robots go. He does not however seem to care about how his product flows throughout the factory and it seems like I find inconsistencies daily. For example this happened today....

While finishing up my duties for the day I was walking around checking machines and verifying that the 2nd shift workers knew what was planned for the evening. While making my rounds I noticed one employee was boxing up some finished parts. The parts he was boxing up were pill crushers. The part can be seen [here.](http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=661&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=mkyYy3ikBql9iM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.amazon.com/CM-70071-Crusher-Pill-Pulverizer/dp/B000KL1N3C&amp;docid=rIRGLOmh5nbkfM&amp;imgurl=http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31kSXnJpy-L._SL500_AA300_.jpg&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&amp;ei=JVygT5rVD4PO9QSghJCoAQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=643&amp;vpy=141&amp;dur=1738&amp;hovh=225&amp;hovw=225&amp;tx=129&amp;ty=118&amp;sig=116293943106777695476&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=148&amp;tbnw=139&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=20&amp;ved=1t:429,r:3,s:0,i:78) As you can see the crusher consists of three separate injection molded parts. The clear base, the white cap, and the blue center cap. Upon realizing that the worker was taking fully assembled parts out of one box (they were just tossed in there) and placing them into another box (in rows, so the box count is consistent), I came to the conclusion that somebody wasn't thinking very clearly when they set up the work station. The parts could have easily been placed properly into boxes and shipped instantly. I counted 190 boxes of these parts that needed to be reboxed today. 

I did not understand why we were essentially redoing what has already been done. So, because I was intrigued. I sat down and filled a couple boxes up with crushers while timing myself. Turned out my average time was about 10 minutes to fill and place a box on the finished pallet. Using that number, I calculated that 10 minutes per box for 190 boxes is 1900 minutes. 1900 minutes in hours is about 31 man hours of work. 31 man hours at roughly $10.00 per hour works out to $310 dollars. 

Now, I know $310 is not a considerable amount of money to a company, but its the principle of the issue that bothers me the most....

So, I asked my manager why he decided to do it that way and his response to me was, ""The workers at the machine don't have enough time to put them into boxes."" Yes that is what he said. Somehow he determined that there was enough time to put them in the box in no particular order, but not enough time to just set them in the box so they are ready to ship.

This basically rubbed off on me as ""I don't really care, they are getting done and my boss is happy."" 

My manager is one of the worst, ""Well, we've always done it this way..."" type of people I have ever met. 

Keep in mind that this is not the only case of inefficiencies happening on this shop floor. There is not a single VSM, time study, work procedure, or setup diagrams anywhere in this factory. It is really making me question whether or not these people have anything to teach me that is pertinent to my major. 

Now, my question is... How do I go about convincing my manager that Lean Manufacturing is definitely something to look at? I need to somehow convince them that an investment in some process engineering would be a beneficial investment. 

Also, If you would like more stories about how ridiculous some of the factory dynamics are at this place, I can indulge you.

One company has offered me a co-op position from May to December, which will interfere with my fall semester. However, they seem flexible and will allow me to work under 40 hours per week when school starts back up.

Another company has offered me an intern position for the summer, possibly with the chance to continue through the school year.

Both companies were very nice to me, and are similar in terms of the industry. The positions are similar as well. I've yet to receive information on pay, etc. though.

I feel somewhat bad for making them wait on which offer I should take.

Some say co-ops are the better learning experience. What does everyone else think?"

Growing up I was always the ""trouble"" child, medicated into submission until I turned 16 and decided I didn't want to take my multiple ADHD medications anymore.  Since then I have gone to college and while it has taken me longer, I have never failed a class and I have a solid 3.2 GPA.  I have worked 1 or more part time jobs while in college that pay my bills and a car payment as well.  I take care of myself and I take care of my personality quirks.

I'm gearing up to tell my parents that I have been living with my boyfriend for about 5 months now.  I haven't been back to my apartment in ages except to pick up a few things.  I love him, I want to marry him, but we are waiting to get engaged until I get a career figured out and we start pulling in some money.  Also, my brother is getting married next year so I wouldn't want to get too close to that.  I want to pay off some of my student loans as well.  Ideally, I would want to pay for my own wedding and not be a burden to my parents.

My parents constantly treat me like a child due to my difficult upbringing.  I got in an argument over Christmas over the fact that my dad laughed at me when I said a preferred one food over another.  (Seriously?  I know what foods I like to eat!!)  Another time I was talking about having difficulties with coworkers at my internship, and my parents laughed and laughed, telling me that that was just my first job and I should stop complaining.  Really?  I have been working since I was 16!  I have worked hard to make myself marketable and have had over 5 internships during my academic career.

I'm struggling to find a way to show them that I'm an adult now.  I'm not an unruly child, I'm just trying to find my place in this world right now and I make decisions for myself.  I love them and I desperately want them to accept me and the choices I make but I can't find a way to do this.  I have incredible anxiety before telling them about any decision I've made and it's eating away at me.

Any advice for someone who wants to be accepted as the adult that they are by their parents?  I don't even know how to tell them that I live with my boyfriend!"

I don't really like where I live and I'm trying to relocate west somewhere. I'm leaning towards California but I don't really know how to find a good job without living there first. My S.O. is trying to get into animation and California seems like it would be the best option for both of us. I have a full time job lined up here in Kansas that is a good opportunity for a new graduate, but I still want to relocate as soon as possible.

The main questions I have are these:

I know living expenses are much higher in CA, so what should I be asking for in terms of salary?

What resources, websites, etc. should I use to find a job?

I don't expect to get hired anywhere crazy amazing like Blizzard, Google, or something along those lines right away. The pipe-dream is to try to get into game dev after a couple years of refining my skills. Can anyone recommend any companies in CA that I should look into?

Thanks for any help you guys give. I really appreciate it =)"

[Can't wait to start work again, so I can afford the sequel to one of my favorite games this generation!  The ending to Borderlands wasn't too hot. Not that it was terrible (citation: Lost, Twin Peaks, 24\), but it wasn't quite the payoff I was expecting. I like how you basically amended that with the Robo-Revolution DLC, though. That felt like a much better ending to the game.  Will the ending to Borderlands 2 give a much better sense of closure and reward, while still leaving room open for DLC? Or will the ""true"" ending be locked behind DLC, as is a trend slowly popping up in the video game industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ijrb1?context=5)|The ending to Borderlands 2 will be much better yes.

Dave Eddings (our VP of BizDev) deserves a huge share of credit. Most of the lines were just improving back and forth in the booth between the two of us.

I think all games are different in their requirements and what a particular audience will want out of a particular game. There is no ""right answer."" I loved working on the Hell's Highway stuff with gifted cinematic designers like Richard Jessup, Mike Davis, and Brian Thomas -- I also wish we'd done a bit more of the narrative in game as opposed to cut scenes. But I still look back fondly at the work we did and can't believe such a small group of people accomplished 86 minutes of cut scenes (small group includes animators and audio.)

My favorite part of the Alien movies is the tension before, after, and in-between the combat, not the combat itself, and that the motion tracker and the blow torch can be the scariest items in the game for what they represent.

Every single person that touched it pretty much died.
[No question, just wanted to comment that I adore your writing. ASTW is one of my web series inspirations...  OO I thought of one. Who thought up the puppet idea for ASTW?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikcn5?context=5)|I think we both did, actually. I have a friend named Sarah Nolen that makes puppets and performs puppet theater in Dallas. She was into the idea and we just went for it! (And then I totally hosed the audio for that episode and destroyed the world.)
[What was the overall budget for ASTW as a series and per episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ikeyp?context=5)|Not cheap -- but it was all equipment with no budget for people to run it. I pretty much directed, edited, sound edited, and did the special FX on all the episodes -- while having a full time job. Just doesn't work, heh.
[Do you know Paul Hellquist? He plays hockey with some friends of mine. Tell him a redditor says hi. I'm also a Plano, Texas local, Comp Sci student and game dev, hoping to get that testing internship over the summer :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4iltbz?context=5)|I know him very well. I also adore Paul. One of the smartest people I know.
[I'm a bit torn about buying Borderlands 2 on PC or 360. My brother has it for the 360 and the visuals seem to be a bit.. jumpy at times; Just not too smooth, whereas my computer runs it pretty much flawlessly. I'd love to be able to play with him (I live away from my parent's house, he doesn't yet.\) but having the screen freeze up in the middle of a fight for even a second just throws me off.

Do whatever lets you play with people you love. Having said that, we've improved a lot across all platforms.
[I always felt Nathan Fillion would have made a great cameo/character in the borderlands Universe.  I know Borderlands had a couple Firefly references in it (what sci fi story doesnt nowadays\)  Did you guys at Gearbox ever try and get a hold of him to do voice acting for BL2?  Just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4im2iv?context=5)|Uh, we have definitely brought it up as a pie-in-the-sky thing.

Also, yes.

[Even though I'm after the time you said you were staying up to, have to ask: Any plans for Gearbox Community Day 2012?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4imgs6?context=5)|Yes.
[Thanks for the advice,  I mean I would love to end up in your shoes someday but I know a lot of things have to happen to get there and a lot of other things could happen that could bring the whole thing down.  How did you get started in the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ir52o?context=5)|By buying as many shoes as possible and seeing which ones fit the best (are we still on the shoe metaphor? I seriously have a lot of shoes.)
[Will you do another series with Anthony Burch in the future? What is your suggestion for writers who want to break into the games industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t0qch/iama_chief_creative_champion_for_gearbox_software/c4ipu1y?context=5)|Find the place you want to work and figure out how to do it. Breaking in as a writer is tough -- I started as an artist and learned everything I could about building a game to marketing it.
 |And I'd love to do another show at some point but ASTW was just way too much work to pull off -- I'd put together a crew this time. For now, I'll focus on the online book stuff.

t0s0v,4,2012-04-30,Deciding between two IT job offers: Fortune 500 company and small non-profit. ,Arcanis888,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t0s0v/deciding_between_two_it_job_offers_fortune_500/,"So I am currently in a pickle deciding between two jobs in the IT field. This is my first job out of college, and I would greatly appreciate your input Reddit.

Job #1: Fortune 500 company, currently I am an intern there. Better pay, better 401k employer contribution, more vacation. The work is not very interesting though and is mostly non-technical (I'm more of a technical guy).

Job #2: Small non-profit organization. Lower pay, less 401k employer contribution, less vacation. The work is very technical as I would be the primary IT guy for the organization mostly doing DBA type work.

I know I would enjoy the second job more, but I don't know if taking the first job and dealing with it would prove beneficial in the long run (larger 401k, Fortune 500 experience, etc). I have asked my manager at job one for a different position, but all of the company's internal IT positions tend to be non-technical as we contract out most technical work. I was basically given a ""maybe"". That of course could mean I get pigeonholed into doing non-technical work, which I absolutely dread. The employees at job 2 tend to be closer to my age and since it's such a small organization, there would be a great sense of ownership. I have no idea what to do.

Any thoughts/suggestions?"

t0pl0,4,2012-04-30,I am in desperate need of help,TheTurgidOne,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/t0pl0/i_am_in_desperate_need_of_help/,"Life has been shitting on me for the last few years.  I keep hearing about how it's going to get better, I just have to believe.  My friends are either tired of hearing from me, or they're gossips and this message will get places I don't want it to.  

I'm just gonna throw the story up here, but a very short version. Maybe because it will be cathartic to finally type it all out, like I'm telling a stranger.  

I haven't been happy with my life in a long time.  I own my part in my current misery.  I get bad panic attacks and I let them stop me from making necessary changes, or confronting my ever growing to do list.  

When I graduated with my undergrad in 2001, I couldn't find work in what was then my chosen career path, so I ended up stuck in a go no where job for 5 years until I finally got fired a month before I was going to quit so I could move to Colorado to go to grad school.  I went to get my MBA so I could finally have a degree that wasn't completely worthless.  At the end of my first semester, my Dad got diagnosed with Brain Cancer.  He died 3 months later, 5 days before my birthday.  That sucked...  But I tried really hard to see the upside of it, I used the inheritance money to finally get out from under crippling debt, and went to see my best friend get married in Korea.  I started to see a future for myself, where I wouldn't be constantly ashamed of the direction that my life was headed.  I got engaged to my girlfriend of 7 years, and finally let myself feel hope.  I graduated may of 2008, right during the housing crisis.  Once again graduating from college during an economic collapse.  I moved back to Texas and did an internship at an ad agency, where my work was praised, but apparently thanks to the economic collapse, they were on a ""hiring freeze"".  My boss told me that no matter when in the future, if he had a job he would contact me.  I took responsibility and stayed in touch with him, and he answered my emails for the next 2 years, but not anymore.  

So i got another job, that I felt was beneath me (which was a huge problem that I had to cope with, but I eventually did, we'll get there, and I came to discover that no job was beneath me, if I treated them all like a career, I could go far.... HA).  I worked in a call center in customer service, for 2 years, before my Fiance said we should move back to Colorado.  We were still unmarried, because we couldn't afford to have the wedding that she wanted.  So I up and moved back got a job at another call center in customer service.  

2 months after moving here she broke up with me.  Which time (11 months) has helped me realize was an amazing thing, but it did force me to move on.  I had some friends a fellow redditor/lurker who let me live with him for a while, until I could get in with another friend where I could bring my dogs.  In November we got a new manager on our team, and he took a shine to me.  He seemed to be impressed with my credentials and told me that he was making me his project and he was going to help me move up in the company.  This is when the aforementioned revelation came about and I worked my ass off, so I could move up.  i helped on other teams whenever requested, I was always there to help on whatever.  I got great scores, and good grades on my calls so I could continue to be an example to my coworkers.  I got fired in February.  Still unemployed now, I was trying to use this time to find a dream job, something that would finally let me use my degree and get my life going in the right direction. That doesn't seem to be working out, as every day is a new slew of rejection letters for jobs that I have applied for.

Now here comes the part where if I haven't already, I'll start to sound like a little bitch.  I met a girl when i was working at my last job.  She was funny, and I had fun hanging out with her.  We did that a few times while I was working there, mostly with other friends, but once together alone.  Although I was always to chicken shit to make a move.  Well after being unemployed for these last few months, I finally asked her out.  I wasn't sure if it was a date, because to be honest I've never been on a date before I got separated from my fiance.  (She and I just kinda happened).  Well I took this girl out last friday.  We went downtown to a couple of bars, we went to this really fun bar that has old school video games, which I thought would appeal to her, b/c she has every video game system ever, almost.  And we talk about games a lot.  We went out to get dinner and talked and laughed and seemed to have fun.  We both got a little buzzed and even rode a free bus downtown,  just to people watch, which was a hilarious event for both of us.  I drove her back to her car, and almost chickened out again, but finally went for it and we kissed.  I held her face, and she mine, I thought we shared something.  She said we would hang out again soon, and she texted me when she got home safely.  I texted her the next day, little innocent things like how did you feel this morning when you woke up, because I woke up with a full on hang over.  And she responded to that first text.  I asked if she was having fun that day, because I knew that she was at a party with some friends, but she never responded, and I didn't want to end up as one of those crazy text stalkers, so I stopped for the night.  On sunday I texted her and said I would love to see her again.  I haven't heard from her since she told me that she woke up feeling ok on Saturday.  (keep in mind I texted instead of called, because during our date, she said she hated getting phone calls, and preferred to communicate through text)

So now here I am adding one more thing on to my list of shit that I am waiting on, I am waiting on a job, hopefully my dream job, or at least a job that will allow me to use my degree and perhaps make payments towards my student loan.  I am waiting on this girl to text me.  I know probably both of those things are unlikely.  I'll eventually get a job, but I'll probably have to settle and go back into customer service, where I'll end up working for the rest of my life.  I'm not saying there is anything wrong with customer service, some people are made for that, I can't tolerate idiots, and I am very sarcastic,  I should not be the front of any company's customer interaction.  I probably did something on this date that turned the other girl off, and I can accept that.  The thing that is killing me, is the constant rejection that my life has become.  I am trying to use this time wisely, this is the first time I have ever been unemployed, and it's only been 3 months, but I still hate it.  I have a work ethic.  

But instead I just sit here everday waiting for things to happen in my life so I can participate, like a animal that you leave at home, I used to get excited when my roommates came home, because I could interact with people, and maybe they would want to do something, but I think they're sick of my depression, and I hate being in the way.  
I am trying to get my life on a plan, add some daily structure into my life, so I can get out of the house, and loose weight, and stop hating every part of me.  

However for the past few days, I have just been staring at my phone, needing this girl to text me so one more thing in my life doesn't end up in rejection.  I've also been staring at my pocket knife, and it doesn't help that I heard on a tv show that slitting your wrists is like drifting off to sleep.  One of the reasons that I haven't yet, (ignoring that I am to scared to, and I don't want to do that to my friends/family) is that I know initially it will hurt like hell when I cut myself.  and when I can avoid pain, I try to.  So I don't think I'm truly suicidal, but I don't know where else to go, and r/helpme isn't really a bustling forum.

I'm going to leave my reddit up for a while in case anyone decides to pm me, it'll just be one more thing that I'm constantly staring at.

This was a little cathartic and the panic attack abated for the time being."

I have been running into many issues (such as automation) when it comes to GPO's and how some computers are under the AD and some are not.  

There are two main offices that are both separated by  hundreds of miles.  The office which I work in has the company's server, which hosts the internal website and controls the AD. The AD only affects the computers here locally, so I am only able to edit the GPO's of this office and not the office that is miles away. The other offices computers are just set up and connected via a router and what not, but they are not apart of the AD. 

I asked my boss if it would be possible to add the remote offices computers to our AD,he said while technically possible, it would be too slow since they are to demanding on the network. 

Is there anyway to mirror AD from here to the remote office using a cheap computer or something. So I can still have the other computers under the same site GPO's that we have locally? Buying another full blown server is not an option.

t40r0,5,2012-05-02,Could use some career advice.,atromic,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/t40r0/could_use_some_career_advice/,"I graduated in 2008 with a B.S. in Environmental Engineering. I took the first position that came my way as an Environmental Technician (all field work with zero design, modeling, or project management), and worked with the same company until recently when I left to travel for my honeymoon.


I've been looking for work for 4 months now with almost nothing to show for it (a couple interviews that went well, but no job).  I've decided that I don't want to work in the contaminated sites field again, but with my previous experience it's the only area I feel that I'm qualified for.  Right now the only positions I can find that are in my experience range don't include design, and have less responsibility/pay than my old job... I feel like I'm actually moving backward with respect to earning my PE.


I recently found out that a local community college offers a 2 year AAS degree in civil engineering technology, for under $12,000.  I think this would open up a lot of doors for me, and looking at the course requirements I see that it would fill in a lot of blanks in my skills, as well as allow me to put more effort into some important topics I blew off the first time around.  I'm one of those people who coasted through school and barely made it out.  I'm a smart person and a quick learner, but I simply didn't have my priorities straight the first time around... I feel like I'm much better prepared to jump head first into my studies in a way I should have been doing in college.


This seems like a great option for me not only to increase my marketability in a crappy job market, but also as a chance to build some essential skills I'm lacking and grow a professional network in the area (just moved to the other side of the country where I know no one). I plan to keep busy with internships for the entirety of my studies (something else I blew off while getting my first degree). Possibly the most important thing is that it will potentially keep me from getting pigeonholed and chronically underemployed in an industry I hate.


I'd love to hear some comments, criticisms, experiences, etc from engineers who have been in my place. Any obvious holes in my plan? Other options to consider?  Thanks.

t3lhg,2,2012-05-02,Was I being scammed?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t3lhg/was_i_being_scammed/,"It's my cakeday, and this is my first post, so I apologize if anything is incorrect, but yesterday was a very odd day for me.  I'm an actuarial science major that hasn't been able to find an internship, so I decided to find some part-full time work during the summer to try to at least make a little money.  I drove around filling out apps, and submitted my resume to a bunch of craigslist posts.

Around 6 p.m. I got a call from one of the people that I apparently submitted my resume to on craigslist.  The guy told me what his company sells credit improvement programs to people after signing them up for the HAMP program.  He interviewed me over the phone and then told me that he liked my personality and that his company was starting a new training session tomorrow and I should join.  The company sounded somewhat legit, and although I've never really wanted a true sales position, I figured I'd give it a try and at the end of the day if I didn't like it, I could bail before I was in to deep so I went.

That day, I pull up to the address that the man on the phone had given me.  It's a small office building, and as I pull into the parking lot I realize the name of the company isn't on the sign in front of the office building.  I park my car and there is a woman waiting for me with an open door up a wooden fire escape.  Once I got inside, I joined 2 other guys: one older Indian gentleman, and another older white dude with a hearing aid.  I'm not one to speculate, but he looked like he might have had some problems.  I was greeted by the man that called me over the phone and soon afterward his ""boss"" came into the room as well and introduced himself.


The entire day of training was just off.  Judge Judy was on the tv during our info session, Loud.  I was taking notes as they were explaining what it is exactly that they do, and how they make their money.  They then started instructing us on how to manipulate people over the phone.  Upon further information about the HAMP program that they are signing people up for, they tell us that you are actually not legally allowed to charge people to sign up for the program, and that we should not use the programs name when talking to people because they might just try to go sign up themselves.


After lunch, the two guys I was with didn't come back.  Instead there was a moderately attractive blonde girl, my age, that showed up instead.  At the end of the day, I left without really thinking much of it until I went home, hit a bowl hard, and got on xbox live with my dudes.  And then it hit me, that nothing the entire day felt right.  There was no sign on the office building, anywhere.  There was a woman waiting at the door to let me in.  The collection of people I was training with were characters.  The entire time I was getting training and answering questions, the boss kept telling me how smart and charismatic I am, contrary to my own image of myself.  The semi-cute blonde was suggestive when it was just us in the room.  The boss kept iterating that when we call people, they are going to think we are a SCAM, screaming scam every time he said it, making me skeptical.  And then it hit me, as I was looking at the employment contract and w-9 that they allowed me to take home to bring in today, that I could be the one getting scammed for my identity.


I decided just to not show up to the job today, mostly because I'm just really unsure as to whether or not I was getting scammed, or I guess the other possibility is that I got way to high and psyched myself out of a decent job.


Am I crazy, or does this look awkward to anyone else?

TL;DR I went in to train for a cold calling job, and left feeling like I might be the one getting scammed."

Entered by: Detective John Eveanclear

--------------------------------

They say that everyone has their demons, that everyone has some sort of creature inside...but some let their demons rule a bit more than others.  
My mother once told me that I was a special boy, that I was her little champion.  As survivor of leukemia, I was held in a higher esteem in my family, told that I was more capable than other kids in my class and I should be treated as such; however I disagreed, I was just a normal boy given a second chance by some higher power.
Despite my protests and argumentative actions, my mom seemed to believe that I sought approval from the family, and constantly reassured me.  As I passed from a child into adolescence, I was driven to my fullest potential, forced into higher classes, given positions in sports that secured my future college success.  No one seemed to ask me what I wanted, always claiming that if i could survive impossible odds, that I would also make something of myself.  In my opinion, there is a difference between fighting to survive, to cling to life and to pull through an impossible situation, and making decisions that drive you to your own success.  
At age 22, I was lined up to graduate early from college, given every scholarship in the book and was offered three separate internship positions with priority choice in each of the companies;  I was offered full benefits, decent pay and work expenditures to hire on immediately at a fourth company and, without hesitation, accepted fully.  I met my wife at age 24, married her within two years and had our first child on the way by age 27.  
Now, you maybe asking why this is relevant to the situation at hand...I just want you to understand the humanity behind it.  I'm no less human than you or anyone else, in fact, i believe I maybe MORE human than most men.  The only thing that sets me apart from you, are my actions, my choices I've made, the happenings I chose to follow.  Detective, you and I are not much different...we just have different ways of expressing creativity. 
There was no trigger for my turning point, and at no given moment did I turn and decide that I would become a monster.  In fact, I had no issue looking myself in my eyes until the day that I first got my hands dirty.  
Her name was Kelsy Denner, a pretty blonde girl who had lived across from me.  Her smile always present, she drove a beautiful car, and maintained her home pleasantly.  My wife couldn't stand her, always claimed she was ""putting out too much and trying to hard"", not that it was any of her business.  Kelsy liked running every morning at 5:45AM or so; she would come out in tight running shorts, her blonde hair pulled into a tight bun, her blue eyes creased with only a slight hint of her age, the corners of her mouth began to whisper hints of her true age, but I would never believe it.  I was always out when she ran, watering the lawn, getting the mail, warming up my car, something.  She always waved a pleasant hello as she jogged past, and i always returned the pleasantry.  
On December 10th, 2010 Kelsy Denner disappeared, never to be seen again alive.  Not a single soul would say eyes on her angelic beauty again...well not a single soul besides myself.  Then again, I'm not sure it was my soul doing the looking.  
I only remember snippets of the brief time we spent together, a time she would spend gagged and blindfolded.  I don't actually remember why I did it, I just remember something telling me that it would be fun, and that same part of me urged me to.  Grabbing her was easy, she was on a jog as par her course, and I conveniently had gone for a drive.  She was about half way through her morning routine when I pulled up along side of her, as a neighbor often would, and offered her a ride home as it was looking like rain.  She agreed and thanked me for my generosity.  It began to get hazy after that, and I only remember looking down on her, hands bound with rope, tied to a metal pole in the depths of the storage facility I had rented through a friend of a friend.  No one would venture here, nor would anyone hear her screams for mercy as my many tools did their work on her...
They claimed that her body was found mutilated, I can confirm from my memory that I recall cutting her throat with a razor blade, I definitely carved symbols into her skin, and I remember the one thing that labeled me as a serial killer:  the routine that I began calling my signature....gouging out her eyes before sewing them shut.  
It gave me the feeling of an artist at a canvas.  Nothing gave me that rush besides this, but I could easily have done without it.  When the crime finished, I packed her body into a bag and dumped her in the riverbed, waiting only 26 hours for the police to bang on my door asking if i knew anything about her ""disappearance"".  
There was a part of me that wanted to yell, to tell them my crime...but there was that voice, the same one that told me what to do and how to do it, it took over.  ""No, I didnt even know she was missing really...to be honest I didn't really know her!""  A blatant lie that would seal my fate, and begin my drive to push the boundaries without being caught.  
Nathan Polestrom was a business man, someone I was not too close to, but knew in passing.  We always got coffee together and on occasion exchanged information about the weather, a game or maybe a show on television.  He was an unmarried man, no children, parents long since dead, no siblings.  In fact, he might as well have painted a target on his head, no one would miss him until they found his body on January 4th 2011, four days after I shot him, slit his throat and again gouged out his eyes, watching the pain and agony in his face as his life slipped away. 
I once heard from a wise man that the eyes hold the soul...that drove me to see how many souls i could pierce, a personal challenge that would be my eventual downfall. 
You know, the needle pierces the eyelids much easier than most think, it's actually like sewing a shirt together, or maybe a pair of jeans with a hole.  The hard part is getting them to stop squirming as you do it, they don't like it much.  
Patricia Hart, a sexy college girl.  She went to the university library often and always sat by herself, sipping coffee and typing away on her laptop.  She never stood a chance, especially when i walked up, offering a professor's guidance.  But the only profession I knew better than engineering was engineering the perfect method of termination.  That voice that drove me to kill the first two pushed me to do the same for her; but this time her body took a few days to wash up...the storms you see.  
Victims four, five, six and seven are a little hazy, i believe I may have been on some sort of narcotic and gotten sloppy, because when I looked back on the pictures I took, the needlework was a bit shotty.  I was not happy with myself and i had to find a better methodology; a more productive one....
It was sometime around June 2nd, 2011 that I picked up steam, taking five more lives in that month, all of which were a range of ethnicities, genders, ages and sexuality; all of which were practically alone, invisible to the average man.  I had no specific group i was after, just that drive to see how humanity would weep if someone so invisible would disappear; yet no one seemed to mourn their passing.  I felt like my little social experiment was going no where, no one gave a shit about the innocent...just because there was no one close to care.  
Detectives passed the cases around, looking for some connection, but failed miserably, no one would find me with the way they were looking.  Granted, I didn't look the part, a mildly flamboyant white man, thick rimed glasses, short cropped hair with a Doctorate degree in engineering, married to a beautiful young woman who had pressed for a Masters in theoretical Physics.  Who would begin to suspect a man who was almost as invisible as his victims?  No one...no one at all.  
My thirst for blood got deeper, I needed to find a way to crank up the intensity, so i began to abduct multiple victims, often pulling from multiple cities and counties.  Holding people with no connections, no commonalities.  CSI and Criminal Minds had taught me to leave no trails, though with my IQ i wouldn't have done so anyway.  
Towards the end of 2011, my death toll was holding up to 28 or 29.  I wanted a nice round 30 before Christmas, a time when I would have to go with ""family"" and spend endless hours in doors celebrating the birth of a man I could barely remember the story of.  
The determination, the perfection, the need for number 30 before I would be forced to recede for the holiday. It drove me to the brink of self destruction, i wanted it to be a special kill...not the average pull, slice, and drop...i wanted something memorable that would leave the country shivering, contemplating my next move...And i knew just the target....
Police Chief Quincey Davis Jr. was a perfect victim, but he didn't meet my criteria.  I was used to making the invisible disappear, but I would have to change my tactics to get a man of such high profile and notoriety without being caught.  Picking up a jogging girl is one thing, getting a heavily guarded police chief is another.  
I knew i could get him from a distance, but I had to leave my signature for everyone to see...I had to get his soul....
I slipped into his home late at night, cutting the power before doing so.  His confusion and frustration made him irresistible to my generously devious hands. 
The woman was a pain in the ass though, slipping in and out of the rooms, wandering in aimlessly, looking for the fuze box, hoping to find some way of reinstating the lights.  She found none, but bitched anyway.  
When he went outside to take a gander with the incoming power lines, i grabbed him, holding a rag of chloroform to his face. 
He awoke in my clutches, a dark room with chains binding his hands and feet.  Something was different about him, he was not the typical victim.  Most screamed, begging, fearing...he simply looked around, glancing up the walls, looking for something...but when i emerged from the shadows, he simply nodded.  I informed him of my intent, telling him my master plan, his response was a simple nod of understanding; as if I were a mastermind of a Batman comic about to have his ass kicked by the dark knight himself.  
My frustration mounted as he calmly told he that I was misunderstood and needed counseling.  Who the fuck did he think he was?  Misunderstood?  I could give a fuck less about being understood, i just wanted the city to understand that my little social experiment was about to hit the mainstream.  
We bantered back and forth, his calm voice attempting to sooth a demon within that was bursting with aggravation, telling me to shut him up and end his life.  He told me he knew all about me, talking about my ""cases"" and the many files he had on me and my victims.  He said he just couldn't find the once piece of the puzzle that would lead him to me, and yet if that were the case, why had they not come knocking more often?  Could he be bluffing?  
I heard a shuffling from outside, i turned to investigate and the man wouldn't shut his mouth, i needed to find out what i had heard...was i being paranoid?  
He continued to blather about my ""mental instability"" and my ""need for attention"" when i finally had enough, i taped his mouth shut and relished the silence.  
I'm sure you're aware of what happened next, because it's what put me from a local PD killer to the FBI FRINGE DEVISIONs #1 most wanted man...
I felt them....Like they were on camera or something, i knew they were there...I dont know how, and i dont know why, but I knew they were around me.  Police, lots of them...the damn Chief had obviously been bugged or something, tracked by some method...I should have thought this through more carefully.  I turned to the chief, demanding his explanation, he just smiled and said ""what did you expect?""
The rage in me build up, and i saw red.  My hand quivering in rage, I unsnapped the gun i wore on my hip and cocked it...I heard the voice in my ear tell me to do it, but for some reason, i couldnt listen...
My head started spinning when i tried to force myself to stop...I felt a force of overwhelming anger, horrid aggravation and contempt for this  man who, in his own self righteousness, had become a police chief and was simply doing his job.  
I collapsed in hysterics on the floor and blacked out...but not really...I felt and heard everything, like a projection of myself only I wasn't in charge.  Red, everything was red, i felt my hand rip the door open, a quick voice to my left said ""danger close""...danger close my ass, I was DEADLY CLOSE.  His face filled with fear as I grabbed his throat.  
""WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT? SHOOT IT!"" The SWAT team obviously had issue with me...and my appearance?  
I could not control what happened, but i remember throwing this man to the floor, breaking his neck on impact.  Storming down the hallway, I crushed another's skull in a matter of seconds, turning to another who had begun retreating.  I followed him, running at an accelerated pace, faster than humans should.  
His death was an easy one, he simply collapsed to the floor at my feet as my hands tore his flesh away; his face parted from his skull and his lifeless body fell limp.  
Three more fell victim to my hate-filled rampage, each torn to shreds with what i can only describe as super human strength...It was then that i returned to my nest.  I faced the captain who was now shaking in fear,  his voice began slightly and broke into stammered nothing...I felt his soul crush in on itself...How could such a potent man fall to such a lowly fear?  
As I raised my hands to his face, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror; a reddish tinge to my flesh, steam rising off my body.  My torso was splashed with blood and my chest was rising and falling extremely fast...I approached the mirror, the only one in the room;  i kept it for my victims to allow them to feel less alone between the moment of abduction and execution.  It always helped them to know they had a friend in the world...one whose fate would be the same as theirs...but this friend, MY friend was not a friend at all...it was, a monster...
I recoiled in fear as the face of true evil stared me in the eyes, i tripped backwards and fell to the floor, the image so horrible my words fail to describe it.  I passed out permanently, waking to the sound of a heavy metallic door slamming; hands bound in shackles, feet zip tied together...I looked into the now stern eyes of the Captain as he stood over me.  His mouth formed a deep frown.  
He asked me to recall the events of the previous night, but I could not...he then informed me that I had brutally murdered a squad of SWAT members that had been dispatched to protect and recover him.  He demanded I speak for my crimes, and I looked into his eyes, fear filling my soul, a shattered fragment of my once so firm self, and said: ""Help me...""
Some demons remain locked in the hearts of their captors, victims in a sense; caged animals that whisper temptations into the ears of the warden that keeps them...Others are free to roam, the wardens themselves...pushed out by traumatic experiences, forced to take over and given the rights of a human being, and in those we find the truest evil mankind can muster.

t2w1e,7,2012-05-02,Is it too late to get a good internship?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t2w1e/is_it_too_late_to_get_a_good_internship/,"I applied to many companies for a summer internship, but the only interview I got was an on-campus interview with Google (which I felt went okay, but I didn't get the job).

I recently sort of turned my life around, dragging myself out of the swamp of underachievement, 8 years at a community college after HS majoring in everything with a minor in procrastination, but I got my act together and am now doing extremely well in my CS program, 3.96 GPA... I know I could excel anywhere, now that I've learned how to put my nose to the grindstone, but I can't seem to get any interviews.

I'm guessing it's because of my lack of projects, but I've been focusing on academics since I needed to bring my GPA up to transfer to UCI, and was worried about maintaining that once I got here.

Should I give up, and just take more classes over the summer, or is there something else I could do?"
t2tob,26,2012-05-02,Katharine,jaegersmith,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/t2tob/katharine/,"She looked positively darling in the early light of the grey London morning. Skin, peaches and cream, flushed rosy with fever, and he tsked in disapproval as he brushed blonde hair away from her face. The skylight didn't do her justice, he thought, knotting his silk tie around his neck. But he couldn't take any chances; he didn't want anyone else to see her.

""Goodbye, love,"" he whispered to her as he left, shutting the door firmly behind him, locking it with a twist of the silver key hanging around his neck, pulling it to make sure it is secure. On his way out the door, Emilia, his new maid, stopped him.

""That lady must be very special, Mr. Rivers, to make you forget your briefcase and miss breakfast,"" she said, smiling slyly. 

He laughed, brushed it off. ""Oh, Emilia, she is. She's one of a kind.""

""You should bring her around sometime. The house could use a lady's laughter and cheer,"" Emilia told him. She is pretty, with dimples in her cheeks and straight black hair. Her smile was infectious, and her hazel eyes crinkled at the corners as she grinned at him.

""We'll see,"" he promised, smiling back at her.

------------------------

Business was excellent as usual. He had a croissant, drank a cup of coffee - black, no sugar - as he designed yet another brilliant marketing ploy targeting the rich and famous bankers of London. He smiled at his pretty new intern, insisting she call him Neil. 

Several people stopped by his office, popping in for a little chat and a few compliments about how precise he was, how thoroughly and subtly he presented the company motto: ""Your trust means everything to us.""

Everyone said he was trustworthy, definitely the man they would trust with their money, their homes, their wives and children. Neil Rivers, an excellent man with an excellent image. He could make anyone smile.

-----------------------

On the subway on the way home, he hummed a little ditty to himself as he read The Times. ""Lots of depressing stuff,"" he commented to no one in particular. ""Lots of wars and environmental crises and disappearances.""

The lady next to him briefly nodded before turning back to her novel and loosening the collar of her white button-down. He wondered if she was reading something nasty, wondered what she would look like half-naked in his bed, her curly brown hair falling about her face, her mouth falling open with desire - 

But he couldn't think about that. He loved Katharine, and he would be faithful. He had promised her he would.

-----------------

""Emilia,"" he asked at dinner, ""would you please ask Justine to fix an extra plate of food? There's been a stray dog coming to the library porch and begging."" 

Emilia nodded. ""But of course, Mr. Rivers. Will the meat trimmings be fine?""

""That would be excellent.""

She nodded again and disappeared into the kitchen while he sat at the dining table, chewing his medium-rare steak and staring at the lovely portrait of Katharine that had arrived two weeks ago. She looked gorgeous in it - she usually did - but the portrait didn't seem to bring light to her golden hair or a blush to her fair skin.

-----------------

""Please, Emilia,"" he said after dinner, ""I am not to be disturbed. If any urgent or distressing calls come in, please forward them to the phone in the library.""

""Very well, Mr. Rivers.""

""Thank you, love."" She smiled; she liked it when the older gentleman wasn't so formal with her.

-----------------

He carefully shut the door behind him, and her eyes lit up. 

He sighed, a smile hovering around the corners of his mouth as he set the plate of leftover potatoes and meat in front of her.

""Oh, Katharine,"" he said, sitting down beside her, ""you should really eat something. I'm worried about your health.""

She ate ravenously and he clapped in delight. 

""That's a good girl,"" he crooned, running his hands through her hair. ""Oh, look, your picture was in The Times today. It appears they mislabeled the caption, though. You're not missing. You're right here with me.""

She nodded vigorously, as if to say 'Of course.'

""Well, I'm certainly glad you agree."" 

She butted his shoulder with her head. He smiled. ""How is your fever, darling? Broken? That's excellent, but we really must be more careful. You have such a fragile immune system.""

---------------

Business was excellent the next day. 

The new intern greets him like an old friend. He sits on the subway and makes more comments about natural disasters. When he gets home, he tells Emilia not to bother him and he shows lovely, lovely Katharine her picture in the newspaper again. 

Mr. Rivers is always careful.

----------------------

Emilia worries about the dog Mr. Rivers talks about. There are cars and bikes and cruel children who throw rocks at poor defenseless animals, and she wants to make sure the dog is alright. 

That night, Mr. Rivers does not smile at her, does not call her ""love."" Says he is disgusted by the corrupt morals of the bankers he works with. He does not ask for food for the dog but stomps down to his library anyway. 

She follows him after a little while, carefully holding the plate of food. It is pork chops tonight. 

Mr. Rivers is not in the library, so she sits down in a comfortable chair, sets the food on a nearby table, and waits for the dog. 

----------------

That night Mr. Rivers is not careful. He gets angry with Katharine for not answering his questions. He does not notice Emilia sleeping in his favorite armchair by the fireplace. He does not give the door a reassuring tug to make sure it is closed. 

------------------

When Emilia wakes up it is just past six in the morning, according to the softly glowing LED numbers on the mantelpiece clock. She stretches, yawns. Wonders where the dog is, is horrified when she realizes the stray will be waiting outside the door, whimpering, hanging its head and wondering why its savior is not there to feed it. 

She picks up the food, cold now, and rushes to the porch door. 

The plate clatters to the floor and she claps a hand to her mouth as the door swings open toward her. She wishes she didn't recognize the girl in the corner, bundled up in blankets and lying in a puddle of her own blood. Wishes she didn't recognize her classmate, Audrey Williams, who recommended her to Mr. Rivers, who was supposed to be in Cambodia helping orphan children, smiling back with a Glasgow grin. 

She hears a disappointed tsking behind her. 

Whips around to see Mr. Rivers, knotting his silk tie around his neck. 

""Dear me, Katharine, I thought I told you not to go poking about in my library. It's nasty business, books and numbers."" 

She doesn't have a chance to scream.

------------------

He informs job agencies that he is looking for a new maid. He tells them that Emilia quit, went to pursue a fashion design opportunity in Shanghai. Very daring, very ambitious. 

Everyone loves Mr. Rivers, is dying to be his new maid. 

He chooses one at random. Shelly Bartlett, her name is. A feisty redhead with a smattering of freckles. He likes her already.

--------------------

Shelly asks him at dinner the first night who the lady in the very large painting in the dining hall is. The very pretty lady with the straight black hair and dimples, the pretty lady whose hazel eyes crinkled at the corners as she smiled.

He smiles nostalgically. 

""Oh, that's Katharine, my late wife. She bled out, you see. Miscarriage, very tragic.""

Shelly just nods solemnly, sympathetically, and pats his arm in reassurance. 

He wipes his mouth, stands up, and tells Shelly to ask Justine to fix a plate of food for the dog."

[One of my favorite little ""features"" from Titan Quest was how if you saw a little goat-man running at you with some bad-ass glowing sword of doom he actually dropped it. It was awesome how mobs would actually wear the loot that was on them; will we see something like this in Grim Dawn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irfcy?context=5)|Yes, we've tweaked the system a little so that enemies can sometimes drop things that aren't equipped (although we're still trying to keep that semi-appropriate) but if they have a magic item, that item will always drop.  If it is just a common item, it can break and you won't see it but bad-ass glowing swords of doom will always drop when equipped.
[YOUR LEAD PROGRAMMER WAS IN BANG CAMARO??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isog0?context=5)|Haha, yeah Bryn Bennett, he actually left Harmonix (where he ended up after ILE) last year and is working on his own indie game.  I'm not sure what the name is yet but his studio is called Eerie Canal.  
[What aspects of Titan Quest have been improved for Grim Dawn in your own opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irh5z?context=5)|The biggest are mood / atmosphere and combat.  I always felt like TQ was a little flat in terms of the atmosphere.  There wasn't that sense of mystery and danger that the Diablo games do so well.  We've put a lot of effort into developing that more and creating an interesting world with a well-developed history.  We've also put a ton of effort into combat and pacing.  We've added blood / gore effects, enemy hit reactions, special deaths for some enemies, others ragdoll, zombies can be dismembered, hit sounds are crunchier, blood spatters on the ground and pools under bodies, etc.
 |There are also a lot of cool new features though.  The more open world is something I really enjoy as a player who prefers to ignore the main story and run off exploring.  We've also added more randomized elements, dynamic weather, a faction system, destructible environments - really cool busting through doors or blowing up walls to reveal hidden areas.
[By ""randomized elements"" do you mean randomized dungeons/maps? The one thing I did not like about Titan Quest was the static areas... really killed the replayability for me. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4ishd2?context=5)|We have a new feature we call ""setpieces"" that can be used to spawn different sets of randomized scenery or entire enemy camps complete with monster spawners and camp art assets.  This means on different play-throughs a specific location in the world could be just wilderness, couple coffin wagons surrounded by zombies, a groble camp with totems and boiling cauldrons, a cultist shrine with a bloody altar, or a traveling merchant camp.  We also use this technology to create randomized barriers in the levels that can change the slow of gameplay, so you fight through it a little differently each time.
 |Add to that, we also have new tech to randomly spawn dungeon entrances that can lead to different dungeons, which can also have randomized enemy spawns and randomized barriers. It is sort of middle-ground between totally randomized levels and the more appealing look of hand-crafted environments.  It is a bit of the best from both worlds.
[Haven't heard of this game before, but checking out your website it reminds me of that NWN and Baldur's Gate/Planescape esque style and I love those games! So I'll keep an eye out and donate to your kickstarter. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmh0?context=5)|I think you'll enjoy Grim Dawn then as we're going for sort of a blend of ARPG and old-school style RPG.  As a kid I loved the TSR Goldbox AD&amp;D games like Pool of Radiance, Curse of the Azure Bonds, Eye of the Beholder, etc.  I want to advance the core gameplay of ARPG while bringing some of the magic of those older games into the mix.
[Two questions, how hard is the journey from concept/idea to actual substance, IE, a working game model? I see a lot of people who start with these excitable ideas but eventually they loose steam and the idea is just vapourware.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmh0?context=5)|It is a huge challenge and one that I think inexperienced developers often totally underestimate.  The only reason we can be doing what we're doing is that we started with the sourcecode from Titan Quest, which represents about $3m worth of past development.  I've also built up a massive tolerance for working long hours, over the course of multiple years, from the development of Titan Quest - that was a brutal project.  ; )
[ secondly, where the heck do I find little indie studios? Is there a bar? A small watering hole on the web that you meet so I can see what sort of indie games people are working on? At the moment I rely on word of mouth from friends and Destructoid. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmh0?context=5)|Honestly, I'm not really sure I have any better idea than you.  I mainly only find other indie studios when read about them in articles or bump into the developers at conferences and such.  I think it is tough though to really compile any sort of list since indie can range from larger more established studios that are technically independent from publishers but not really ""indie"" and, on the other end of the spectrum, inexperienced developers right out of school or may or may not ever finish a game.
[Assuming your funding needs are met how do you intend to implement the expansion of your game studio? Will you set up offices or continue to work remotely with the new employees you intend to take on? If you choose to work remotely how do you think you will overcome the need for regular contact with all the team to ensure you maintain good momentum and direction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irivw?context=5)|It depends on where we end up with funding.  If we just barely scrape by our goal, we'll probably do a mix of working remotely and having a few people local get together at someone's house daily or at least a few days a week to help improve collaboration.  If we end up feeling like we can afford it or if we end up in a situation where we don't have quite enough to hire another full-time person, we could consider getting a small, totally ghetto office.  There is a nice abandoned building down the street that I've been eyeing.  Put a tarp on the roof and its probably good to go!
 |We've gotten pretty good at working remotely though over the past couple years.
[Grim Dawn sounds really interesting. Any info if it will be on Steam and/or when it will be released..? I realized you recently started the Kickstarter for it, but any idea what year? Are you working on your game/ game studio full time now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irljb?context=5)|We fully expect that people will be able to redeem their keys on Steam as Valve has done that with many other indie studios but, of course, they have final approval.  We think we may be able to release the alpha end of this year / early next and then are shooting for a release in August of next year.  The more people we can get helping to build out the content, the sooner we'll get the full release and the more content we'll have.
[I also bought your game Titanquest  while it was on sale on steam, and can't build up enough determination to play it. Can you think of anything that will convince me to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irljb?context=5)|Yes, I've been working on Grim Dawn full-time for about 2.5 years now along with our programmer.  Other guys, mostly friends from Iron Lore, have been helping out part-time but have to keep day jobs at other studios to pay the bills.
[Edit: typos.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irljb?context=5)|Hmm, I don't know, depends on your thirst for ARPG loot goodness.  You should go talk to the folks at titanquest.net or maybe find someone to play with on the  Grim Dawn forums.  ; )
[Anything you can tell us about classes? I always felt the biggest drawback of RPGs is the facts that they have the standard Mage/Archer/Melee characters. If like titan quest, awesome, I liked that variety.  With that being said, I loved titan quest and cannot wait to play Grim Dawn. Best of luck!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irrp8?context=5)|It will be similar to Titan Quest, as far as having classes that loosely fit into certain archetypal gameplay roles but with diverse themes that aren't just cookie-cutter RPG classes.  I'm also trying to build each class with more options for active, big-impact skills that are fun to use and more flexibility in terms of weapon-types.  So, for example, soldier is mainly geared toward melee but you can use all the skills with a gun / crossbow if you want, which makes for a lot more synergy with, say, the demolition class.  We also have an occultist, that is a summoning / debuff / DoT class, an arcanist that is more of a straight sorcerer style class with lots of high-damage and AoE skills, and a ""nightblade""...  names aren't quite finalized.  The last class is sort of a blade throwing assassin / illusionist.  Then we hope to keep adding new classes through expansions.  I'd love to get up to 10-12 skill masteries, or more!
[In which other game development positions did you work before Grim Dawn? You started as game tester and became lead designer for Titan Quest. What was inbetween?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irgh3?context=5)|I only briefly ""worked"" as an external multiplayer tester for Ensemble and then wrote a couple chapters for their official Age of Kings strategy guide.  Talking to some of the designers there, Bruce Shelley and Ian Fischer, is what opened my eyes to the possibility of working in the game industry.  Before that, I sort of had this notion that games magically appeared and never thought about the possibility of a career in making games.  From there, I landed a job as a designer at Stainless Steel Studios working on an RTS called Empire Earth.  I was only there for about half a year then went to finish my college degree.  I only had half a semester left, so it seemed ridiculous not to finish.  Then right after graduating I was contacted by Brian Sullivan who remembered me from Ensemble and was looking for a designer.  So, I started out as the only designer at Iron Lore, moved up to lead gameplay designer on Titan Quest as we hired more designers (they felt Brian Sullivan needed to retain the lead design title for marketing purposes) and then later was promoted to lead designer on our new project.
[What happened when Iron Lore studios shut down? How and why did you guys decide to start a new company without any funding etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is49k?context=5)|Iron Lore basically fell victim to what most often kills smaller independent studios, for various reasons, they just couldn't survive the gap between projects / line up the next paying project fast enough.  It was probably mostly insanity that promoted me and a couple others to try to launch a new studio.  I think to take on a task like that, you need to know just enough to be able to get started and make educated decisions but not enough that you fully realize how much work / challenge you're taking on.  On a personal level, I really wanted to be able to keep working on more complex, traditional games that I love and I didn't see a lot of job opportunities to do that.  I also didn't want to just sign on at a big studio where I'd have to work within all of the constraints handed down to me from above.  I'd already had enough of that at Iron Lore, despite it being a relatively small studio.  I wanted to be free to make games according to my own vision.  We also wanted to find a way to break out of that traditional publishing deal treadmill of signing a deal, losing ownership of your IP, getting funds as an advance on royalties you had to pay back before you earned any profits and always being at risk of going under if you couldn't line up that next paying deal fast enough.  It just didn't seem worth it.
[There is that ""open-world action role-playing"" statement in Grim Dawn description on Kickstarter. I have a few questions about gameplay - will there be multi-leveled dungeons with a bad-ass boss on the last floor? How the game world is made -  is it one seamless place or many different locations with loading screens between them? Are there bosses fixed to every locations or just in key scenes? Is gameplay divided on acts like in Diablo? Oh, btw, supported.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irydy?context=5)|Whoa, this is a very question-dense post! ; ) We're trying to create a fairly randomized.  The terrain isn't randomly generated but we want to try to randomize the location of important content like enemy camps, boss locations, dungeon entrances, as much as we can to boost replayability.  Some bosses will occur in most fixed locations, like the bottom of multi-level dungeons but others will appear more randomly.  Most of the above-ground world is seamless and actually a large, connected expanse of land that makes geographic sense.  We've developed a new system that allows us to randomly place  entrances or portals to dungeons and different regions, some extra-dimensional realms.  Entering one of these portals nearly instantly pops you out in a new location, so there isn't really loading but it isn't quite seamless when you enter these types of semi-random side-areas. We're not planning on having acts, the game is a bit more free-form where you can access regions in different orders and sort of progress in different directions at your own pace.
[Thanks for answering, Arthur! It's a good news there's no acts 'cause it really boosts replayability from the very start. Of course, if the world is well-planned and balanced. And it's a lot easier to make expansions, just extending the world map and adding new locations with new content. By the way, how is enemy levelling going to be realized? Will player meet monsters of his level wherever he's gonna go from the start or enemy levels will be fixed for every location and if player attempts to visit high-level location, he's going to get his ass kicked in so brutal and unbelievable way he'd want to cry? And will high-level locations be open for player anytime he'd wanted to visit thenm just for the hell of it and try his luck or will they be locked until some conditions met?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4it4aj?context=5)|Enemy levels for each area have a min and max level.  The max level range is generally a lot higher than TQ, which allows you to play through areas at a different pace (exploring everything vs. running through) or play them in different order.  Although, there is a max, so if you run through the starting area, then come back at level 40, it will be underleveled for you.  However, if you run ahead to higher level areas, there will be a min enemy level, so that the world doesn't completely scale with you and you can encounter enemies too high level to safely take on (although you're welcome to unsafely take them on). To gain entrance to some higher-level areas, you'll do things like gather resources to repair bridges or defeat enemy checkpoints.  You can attempt to do this as soon as you manage to get the resources or are able to overcome the enemies guarding the entrance.  
[When going to school, do you recommend getting a game design degree or something more open ended like a software developer degree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irqvs?context=5)|Honestly, I don't even really know what people do in game development courses and I think most of the industry shares that feeling.  The game programs have a few schools seem to have some merit but most just seem like a quick attempt for schools to cash in on students hoping to get into game development.
 |So, depending on what type of game development career you want to get into, there are different options.  If you want to be a programmer, get a CS degree.  That is, of course, very useful in or out of the game industry.  If you want to be an artist, think about a traditional art or graphic design course but you're probably better off learning 3d on your own (go to places like polycount.com or gameartisans.org for help).  If you want to be a designer, please learn how to write!  Haha, seriously, I can't tell you how many applications I get for design positions from people who can't even write a cover letter.  I'd suggest a degree in history, English, Business or really any traditional degree, especially one that is writing intense.  Being able to think analytically, organize thoughts, and communicate effectively on paper is critical.  Plus, if your game career aspirations don't pan out (there is enormous competition now for a relatively small number of jobs) at least you have other options.  It is probably difficult to get a job outside the game industry with a degree in game development.
[I'm going to study Digital Arts and Entertainment in college over the next 3 years, I'd also like to start up a Game Development company after a small career of developing for others. I'm more interested in programming than art, but also like designing levels, mechanics and lore. If I ever get to do an internship, I'd love to go to Blizzard but chances are low anyone can get in. Do you have any suggestions before I start? How do I impress a big company like Blizzard? And how did you start off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isy3o?context=5)|One thing I can't stress enough, is make sure you take some writing courses.  It is extremely important that you're able to write clearly and correctly.  If I get a cover letter than starts out ""I'm not sure weather or not...""  it generally goes in the trash (actual example, that really happened). There are so many people applying for entry level positions that if you can't do the basics properly, I don't think anyone will read any further.  Of course, this is more important for something like design than programming or art. Another important thing is to work on something that you can use to demonstrate your ability.  If you're aiming for a programming position, develop a small game.  If you're shooting for a level design position, grab a free copy of a toolset like Unreal and create a badass level or an entire mod.  If you're specifically aiming for Blizzard, create a Starcraft II mod or something else relevant to them.  Best way to get into Blizzard though is to start at a smaller studio and do impressive work while your're there.   As an actual example, I was asked if I'd be interested in talking to Jay Wilson about the lead gameplay position on D3 about a year and a half ago.  It was extremely temping of course, so much so that I declined to even talk to him because I felt I had a commitment to see Grim Dawn though and didn't want to be lured away from that goal. How did I get started, well as I wrote above, mostly by accident.  Back when I was in college, there weren't any game development programs and few people really thought of it as a possible career choice.  It never even crossed my mind.  However, I ended up getting sucked in Age of Empires competitive ladder play and wasted away enough hours at it that I ended up as a top ranked player.  The game's maker, Ensemble Studios contacted me to help with play-balancing Age of Kings multiplayer and then I ended up writing a couple chapters of their strategy guide with Bruce Shelley.  Talking to Bruce and Ian Fischer, I started to realize game design was something I might be able to get into.  I applied there but also at a local studio called Stainless Steel, which was founded by Rick Goodman, the brother of Tony Goodman who founded Ensemble.  I got an offer from them and left college for that first design job on Empire Earth.  Eventually I returned to finish my degree and then was hired on at Iron Lore.  So for me, it was a bit of a fortuitous series of events that changed my path in life dramatically.  
[Do you code at all? What skill/experience do you wish programmers you work with had/need to be better at? And what kind of tools do you find important to the project or what kind of tools do you wish you could just pick up for a reasonable licensing fee that really aren't out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is8la?context=5)|No, I'm just a designer who also meddles in art.  My coding skills are virtually non-existent except for the occasional crude attempts at scripting.  Rhis is our programming master-mind and could better answer this than I.
 |I think the main thing I'd wish of some of the programmers I've worked with over the years is that they'd put more thought into how they implement features.  I've found some programmers will just do the bare minimum, exactly according to the specs, and call it done.  To create robust features or tools, you really need a programmer who, doesn't necessarily deviate from the design but who has the good judgement and initiative to to take things to the next level.  It is always awesome when programmers or artists get back to you with finished work that is better than you envisioned.  That's what makes someone a real pro and a pleasure to work with.
[How much do I have to put in to get Giraffes in this game...?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is24d?context=5)|At the $1k reward tier you could name something a giraffe, which isn't an ideal solution but gets you partway there.  At $4k you could request that we create a giraffe armor set and at $10k you could design a giraffe-based quest, for which we'd have to actually build a giraffe.  Of course, we reserve the right to veto inappropriate quests but giraffe's seem like a go!
[I was to ask a question in the same direction: how do you imagine the immediate future of crate (even if only vaguely\)? guess i'm more concerned with what comes after the strenuous effort that will birth grim dawn, that is... ...both if there'll be and if there won't be a zombie apocalypse...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irmjf?context=5)|Assuming there is no zombie apocalypse, which seems overly optimistic, our hope is that the profits from Grim Dawn will finally allow us to get down to proper development, with the whole team together in one place, working on awesome traditional games.  The immediate thing would be to continue work on Grim Dawn.  When you work with publishers, you don't generally own your games, so there isn't much incentive to keep working on them since you'd basically just be doing free work to for the publisher.  In owning our own game, there is a huge incentive to keep it going as long as people want to play it.  So our main focus would be expansions and improvements for Grim Dawn.  At some point further down the road, I'd love to work on a strategy game, maybe even set in the Grim Dawn universe.
[I really liked Titans Quest and will be looking up info on your new game once I get out of work. Will it include multiplayer? Co-Op? PVP?  What were your inspirations for designing he game? Any particular books  or other games that helped give you ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is9iz?context=5)|Yes, we'll have all the same multiplayer options at TQ and will more easily expose the PvP option for those who want to host PvP games.  If Grim Dawn is a success, we'd like to add to it with other gameplay modes, like co-op survival and possibly a battle arena if we can build closed servers. One of my biggest inspirations has been New England, the region I live in.  In autumn it is the quintessential Halloween location, complete with creepy old farms and colonial houses.  I've also been re-reading a lot of HP Lovecraft, who set many of his stories in New England.  Btw, the ""Chthonians"" are actually not directly borrowed from Lovecraft, it is derived from a Greek word Chthonious, which roughly mans ""under the earth"".  [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chthonic)
[I'm an aspiring game developer looking to open up my own studio soon. Any tips would be nice :\)   What engine do you use for the game? or previous games?  How many people usually work on your games? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4ivr6p?context=5)|My top tip would be to get some experience working at an established studio so you can learn how they do things.  Aside from just building games, there is also a whole business component that goes along with running even a very small studio and for me it has been massively helpful that I was able to get involved in and was privy to some of the business end of things at Iron Lore, specially learning how to plan, schedule and budget projects.  Having an understanding of the costs involved beyond just paying wages, how to go about outsourcing, how to talk to publishers (if you decide to go that route) and how to manage a team is critically important and tough to just learn while you're doing it without making a lot of potentially disastrous mistakes. In terms of engine, Iron Lore developed their own proprietary engine for Titan Quest and we were lucky enough to be able to work out a deal to acquire it. Depends on the game, your funding and the number of talented people willing to help you out on a voluntary basis.
[A bit daunting but honest. I think many of us have a great ideas but there's so much effort that needs to be put into it... usually it's too late when you realize certain mistakes have been made and you just need to make the best of the situation. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4iwiki?context=5)|That is really what separates those who make it from those who don't.  I mean, talent is a factor but there are a lot of talented people out there and the ones who will succeed are the ones who are willing to put in that extra effort.
[Will Grim Dawn have a secret \[Animal name\] level?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is70f?context=5)|I can neither confirm nor deny this.
[I am very interested in game development myself. What programs do you recommend to get familiar with? What classes to take? I do not know where to begin to start my path towards a career in game development. What advice can you give me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4irubm?context=5)|I'd start by researching as much as you can about the workings of game studios and the different development roles.  Gamesutra is probably a good place to find articles.  Step one is to really figure out what career path you're interested in.  I sometimes get applications from people who have finished a game development course and just want a job in any position available... I'm usually not really sure what to make of those.  So, figure out where your interest lie, be it programming, art, design, production and then work on developing the relevant skills.  
[When I moved away to college, TQ &amp; TQIT is what kept my brother and I united. We were probably the only ones who pre-ordered TQIT in my town (they looked at me funny\). It really had the gameplay we liked of Diablo II, with a well-researched greek mythology theme. I really hope you guys continue your success and will be looking forward to Grim Dawn. My question is, what are the chances of making a TQ2? If there is a possibility, will it have dedicated servers instead of P2P multiplayer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is50o?context=5)|TQ2 is extremely doubtful as THQ owns the rights to the game as we'd have to cut a deal with them to work on anything TQ related, which doesn't really seem in our best interest.  Who knows though... If we can't do secure servers, I'd at least like to add the functionality for dedicated servers.  We can't do it prior to release but I think we could add this in down the road if the game does well.  I'm a big multiplayer person myself, so it really disappointed me that we were so limited in this regard on TQ.
[Who does your sound design?  And any advice for someone who is attempting to get involved in a game from the ground up?  My husband is a sound designer trying to make a break from advertising into games.  Just wondering if you had any tips.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4itim0?context=5)|The comment below offers some good advice - create a solid portfolio.  There are a lot of sound people trying to get into gaming and a lot of freelance sound designers looking for work, so it is a very competitive job market. One of the audio designers from Iron Lore, Dan Crislip, who now works at Harmonix and another guy, Steve Pardo, who works with him are doing out sound and music.
[Loved titan quest, but one of my two concerns (the other being the nonexistant gore\) is the difficulty level being to easy. I was blasting through the whole game running and gunning pretty much without dying until level 30 or something.  So what I'm wondering is will the difficulty level be more like titan quest or diablo 2, were I was dying pretty often and had to plan my moves for just about every encounter?  Also how is your approach to boss monsters? Any unique original abilities? Will they pack a punch (kinda like rakanishu from diablo2\) or are they more like slightly stronger monsters with better loot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4iwh9e?context=5)|Death comes a little quicker in Grim Dawn.  I've balanced the combat so that you can basically kill or be killed a little more quickly if you don't watch out.  If you get surrounded, for example, you'll die a lot faster than in TQ, so tactical movement is more important.  There are also some enemies with pretty hardcore ranged attacks that you need to keep an eye out for and avoid.  We've also created a number of enemies with high-damage attacks preceded by special animations, so if you're paying attention, you can quickly get out of the way. No, the bosses definitely pack a punch.  They tend to have an array of skills that can quickly prove deadly if you let them land a couple on you or don't dodge the big attacks.  We've put a lot more effort into creating encounters where players have to think a bit and keep moving around. Finally, we've balanced ranged and melee better in terms of their relative survivability and also created enemy skills that are particularly challenging to one or the other.
[I liked a lot of things in Titan Quest, but one of my least favorite things was how LONG and grindy the game got - levelling up slowed way down, and trying to play through on all of the difficulties was an exercise in patience to say the least. Will Grim Dawn work to change this difficulty/reward curve at all beyond the open world structure, and if so, how?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isdxh?context=5)|Yes, I myself was displeased with that in TQ.  I felt a sort of tedium set in on multiple play-throughs of Greece.  For one thing, the combat in Grim Dawn just feels a lot more exciting / satisfying and helps to pull you through the game.  The open world does a lot since it allows you to easily cut through areas to get ahead, instead of having to run up a long, linear road.  Grim Dawn is paced out more by increasing difficulty than the length of world you need run through.  I also feel that an issue in TQ is that the spawning system wasn't accommodating enough for different players rate of progress.  It was easy to end up out-leveling the monsters spawn, which resulted in a drop of difficulty, leading to mindless, boring combat.  The way we handle spawns in Grim Dawn alleviates that problem since there can be a wider range of enemy levels in each area.  I've also worked to make the experience curve a little more consistent so that you don't hit that wall around level 30ish.
[Are you good friends with Brian Sullivan? He was my professor for a game design class, and told us a lot about his experiences with Age of Empires / Titan Quest.  He seems like an awesome guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is31y?context=5)|Yeah, he was a cool guy to work with.  We often butted heads on game design but I respect him and miss our long philosophical talks.  I haven't talked to him in a while and hope he is doing well.  You're very lucky to have a teacher who actually has real game industry experience since it seems like most of the teachers in these programs don't.  
[I have noticed that there is a lot of talk about the ways Grim Dawn intends to improve on Titan Quest in terms of environment and combat etc.  Titan Quest was a lot of fun for me and am interested to know what aspects of Titan Quest if any do you think are most valuable and don't need improvement for Grim Dawn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is9p5?context=5)|The thing I like most in TQ is the skill system.  I think some of the skill design could have been better but I really liked the way the system worked and we're carrying that forward.  A lot of the basic stuff will remain much the same as well and many systems are just getting minor tweaks, basically improvements that are the result of feedback from the Titan Quest community.  We don't want to go crazy and completely change the game, we just want to build on it and improve it in target areas identified by fans.
[I JUST WANTED TO SAY I LOVED TITANS QUEST. ONE OF MY CLASSIC FAVORITES ALONG WITH BFME2.  So my question. How closely do you think grim dawn is, compared to titans quest. is it a lot different? For better, or worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4isb07?context=5)|I think it is quite similar in many respects since we were building from the same sourcecode but I think we've made a ton of improvements.  Personally, I'm proud of what we did on TQ but I never found it nearly as fun to play during development as I do Grim Dawn.  So, I think people will be really pleased.  
[What is your absolute favorite game of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4is6ko?context=5)|Oh man...  tough call The game I probably spent the most time playing was Ultima Online.  The level of interactions possible in that game were crazy and no other MMO has ever surpassed it in that respect.  Where else can you rig a poison trap in your personal tower, hide in the shadows and laugh as would-be burglars open it and then jump out to loot all the items off their corpses and put them for sale on your NPC vendor? ; ) I also loved Diablo / Diablo II, which probably played hundreds of hours of, going so far as to complete it in hell difficulty with two hardcore characters.  Also, the original Age of Empires, Warcraft 3, old TSR goldbox games, pirates on the Apple2GS, a totally obscure strategy game called Ultimate Domain: Genesia, and I could probably go on forever...
[As a lead designer, who implements the easter eggs? Are those completely last minute, or are they well thought out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t1ljl/iama_titan_quest_designer_struggling_to_launch_an/c4iryph?context=5)|Hah, well, it totally varies.  Sometimes individual developers or small groups just sneak them in.  This can sometimes be very bad if they don't use discretion and insert something that is offensive or could result in a copyright infringement.  At one point we discovered someone had tried to put the ThunderCats emblem on something and that is a big no-no since it could result in a copyright lawsuit if it got out.  Larger, more well-orchestrated things like the secret Overlord dungeon in TQIT are group efforts that the studio knows about and lets the team put in, assuming it isn't interfering with getting the game done.

Apologies. 

I've been working at my job at a major university medical center for 2 years (+ internship) and this was my first job after graduating with my bachelors degree. Even as an intern, I began taking on leadership responsibilities in my department because there was no one there taking care of them and that is just my personality to organize and get things done. The department manager/lead had left about 2 years before I was hired and they never hired or promoted a replacement. The other people in the department had basically been ""sharing"" the management load, and it was basically complete chaos when I came into the picture. 

In the time that I've been there I've taken on pretty much all of the roles of department manager (including managing a bunch of medical equipment, computers and databases which isn't even in my field of study but I have worked so much with them over the last year that I am more qualified than anyone else in the entire institution to work with them, and I'm thinking of even going back to grad school to get a degree in IT just for the extra qualifications) while still making starting ""just out of school"" salary. I do the work because it needs to get done, it makes me feel better to be organized, and this is my career and passion and it makes me feel good, damnit. I love what I do. However while everyone in the institution regards me as the manager when it's convenient for them to, in the end I have no authority so I get undermined fairly often when trying to accomplish things, which sucks.

The people I work with directly know exactly how much I bust my ass on a daily basis to keep that place up and running but unfortunately the administrators and the people who count do not. I think they may be a bit put off about having a specific manager for my department because of the person that left 4 years ago. They have another manager ""covering"" my department but she doesn't have a clue about anything that we do, and doesn't really do anything to manage us at all, except dictate when we can take our vacations...

So I'm looking for advice from professional people about how I can go about this situation. Obviously I feel that I deserve a promotion and a raise (did I mention I'm nearly drowning in student loan debt? yeah...) We just recently got a new Chairman (of the department - this is a medical center, so he is the main doctor overseeing the entire department) Obviously we have an HR lady as well, but she's not exactly approachable. I have always gotten weird vibes from her, like she never really wanted to hire me in the first place, and that she sees me and the rest of the staff as not very professional people. There is also a practice manager, who is my highest superior manager. I'd like to go direct to the chairman, but won't if people tell me that is inappropriate. Like I said, I am completely new at all of this. 

 **TL;DR: I work REALLY hard at my job at a university medical center and want to ask for a promotion to manager, since I basically do all of the work of one. Halp?**"
t5vvk,3,2012-05-03,Questions about switching into CS from a BA in technical theatre,randiculous,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t5vvk/questions_about_switching_into_cs_from_a_ba_in/,"A bit of background here: I'm about to get a BA in Theatre Tech, but the job I've applied to come fall is a no-go.  I haven't been having much luck so far finding a job and I'm really starting to think the Theatre lifestyle might not be for me.  I hate the idea of traveling from job to job all over the place all the time with no time off and only barely being able to make ends meet.  

My ""back up plan"" was to gtfo of my hometown area where I've been going to school, and try and get a BS in CS (or something that would make me just as knowledgeable and marketable in the CS field).  My theatre background is in lighting design, and I've taken a few math courses while in school so far that I think will help me get a start in a CS degree (Applied Calc, Calc I and II).  

I'm very self-motivated when I have time to learn new things (which once I graduate, I cannot wait to have) and I love problem-solving, math, and would some day like to work in engineering the software behind lighting technology (consoles, automated lights, etc).  So far, I've already figured out that I'm also a pretty quick learner when I put my mind to it, so I'm hoping to see if I can get the training I need quickly.  

I was wondering if there was any advice out there for what I should do?  I'm hoping to also relocate in this process to Seattle or Silicon Valley / Bay Area (especially as they seem to be good places to get into CS).  I apologize if this seems a little rambly, I'm not even sure what questions I should be asking, but any advice would be helpful:

*What degree program would be best? CS, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering, Some sort of combined program with Math and CS?

*Good / reasonably affordable schools? (preferably Seattle or SF Bay area)

*How hard will it be / how long will it take to get a BS if I already have a BA and a few math classes under my belt?

I'm also interviewing for a summer internship with a major lighting console manufacturer, ETC, next week.  The position is in sales, but I'd do anything to someday work in their R&amp;D department developing consoles and such - any advice on how I can maximize my networking within the company if I land the internship?

t5ip4,1,2012-05-03,Reddit I need your help about my teacher.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t5ip4/reddit_i_need_your_help_about_my_teacher/,"Today, I get a message from my mom saying I have been written up for academic dishonesty. What happend was me and my friend were working together to complete one of our student interns impossibly long homeworks (a usual, he gives us too much homework for an student to be able to do, and im not just saying that because he wrote us up). So we were working together like everyone in the class does and we had a few lines here and there that were similar. He feels this is enough to write us up. This occured 1 day after me and my group of friends was called into a meeting with us, him, and a principal. In this meeting did he not only act like a 5 year old by saying ""they never listen to me when I talk"" but blatantly accused us to make us look bad. Also, in the message my mom recieved regarding being told of my referall it said this is the third (keyword: THIRD) time we have been in trouble for this. This is the second. What was the other? A 1 line similarity in an essay between me and the other kid. Not only did he lie about the amount of times he has blamed up for this but the first case was dismissed after resolving it with our regular teacher because it wasnt enough to consider plagarism. How can I deal with this disgusting intern teacher or mine? He is clearly out to get me because he has nothing else better to do.

t4ch7,44,2012-05-02,"Having a rough time, need to vent to those who understand.",[deleted],gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/t4ch7/having_a_rough_time_need_to_vent_to_those_who/,"Hey Gamedev, things have been pretty rough for me in the last few years and I really just needed a place consisting of like minded people to really hear me out and give any advice they think they can. Sorry if some details are vague, don't exactly want this everywhere. Here goes...

I got my start in the game industry a couple years ago doing some mostly free game testing. I thought ""Hey! I like to break games! This will be totally awesome!"", I loved working at my job, and I loved the people I worked with, including my boss.

I used to go home every day and tell my friends and girlfriend how awesome my boss was, how much positive reinforcement he gave me on everything I did and how he went out of his way to tell me how good of a job I was doing no matter how easy I thought it was. Turns out I was pretty talented in learning the game engine and picking up technical knowledge I didn't previously have after being told just once. As you can imagine I felt pretty good about this. Not only did I get my break into the industry, but It turned out I was actually really good at my job!

After even just a few months I moved up in the ranks at the company, acquired my own interns, began to manage more, took on more responsibility, and started to give design input. Things were great.

Little did I know, things were about to take a turn for the worst.

Like most small studios, funding was always an issue. Late paychecks, no pay for months at a time, half-checks, IOUs to backpay. All that is fine, but the person in charge (lets call him Chris) didnt understand that when you dont pay people, you have to back off a bit on what you expect from them.

Chris started threatening jobs the moment he got wind that people were unhappy about our financial situation. One employee only said that he didn't want to work on the weekend like he was asked to and Chris became irate, pulling him into a conference room and yelling at him about his job security.

What were we to do? Everyone was afraid for their job, no one was getting paid, and they owned us money. Why should we work 50+ hour work weeks for a Tyrant? What happened to the boss that I enjoyed talking to? The one who told me how good I was doing at my job. Its as if he completely changed into another person in a flash.

Our crunch time was about 10 weeks working 70~ hours a week, sometimes more for the testers. There was zero sympathy towards anyone, no promise of bonuses, only fear for your job. For most people this was their first title, their opportunity to break in, and this is what they were faced with. Fear.

We got through it though. But not without several emotional breakdowns not only from myself, but from others. I blame this forced labor for the failure of my last 6 year relationship simply because I was no longer able to live outside of my office. 

There is no way to describe my dedication to the project more then one particular situation. We were coming up on a very important deadline (they were always important to Chris) and I still had a good bit of work to do. I got the news that my very close first cousin had died and he was having his ashes spread in the coming weeks. I was so afraid for my job, and being verbally abused that I did not ask for the time off to attend my cousins funeral. I never told Chris about this, and I keep it in my back pocket for when I want to let him know just how fucked up he is and how much I hate him for making me feel that way at that time.

Fast forward some time... The game is out, it did really well, we made a lot of money and got great scores across the board. All the while Chris still demanded 50 hours work weeks post-release. Where was our bonus? Where was our time to relax after all that hard work we put in? 

I have no problem moving on to DLC or the next project, but why do I feel like I am still crunching? Why are you setting unrealistic deadlines months and months after the game has been out and even our post launch DLC racked in stacks of cash!? Why are you so oblivious to the fact that everyone at your studio is unhappy, angry, still in fear, stressed, and more importantly unhappy with wages?

At one point after release some people left the company. They didn't like the direction the game was going and were very unhappy with the business practices of the company. In that time Chris seemingly realized that he was breaking his studio apart. I was not there for the meeting that day, but I listened to the 2 hour recording where Chris told everyone on the team to not worry, that things were going to get better. Hours would go down, wages would go up, and that if anyone had any concerns to issue that he would openly listen to them.

This was all a lie. And everyone knew it. But again, what were they to do? For most this was their first project, they still had resumes to build, years of experience to gain, families to feed. They could not simply up and leave.

Fast forward to today... 7 or so people have left the company all under the same understanding that it was simply because they hated Chris, his way of running the company, and the way he treated people like dogs and not human beings. I was one of them.

After I left the company I left like a new person. I not only had my life back, but I was healthier, happier, and stress free.

I readied my resume and started scouting for jobs a.s.a.p! After applying to 10-12 studios as either a Associate Designer or Senior QA (what I was most comfortable doing) I began to also setup meeting with HR personnel on LinkedIn for the upcoming GDC in San Francisco.

I had never been more excited to meet with companies that seemed interested in bringing me on to their teams despite only a few years experience and only a few shipped titles. Big companies too, ones whose games I've played all my life.

I went to my meetings, scowered the job pavilion, gave out tons of resumes and business cards, spoke with big names that loved the game I had help create. Although I did not get any direct offers while there, I felt like I was really on my way to a new job.

But with every climb up hill, there is always a downward slope on the other side...

I emailed just about every person I met at GDC, thanking them for meeting with me, making sure they knew I was interested in working with them, and stressed that if they needed anymore information from me or just wanted to talk with me more that I was always available 24/7.

I waited... and waited... and waited... then...

""I'm sorry but we have decided to go with another candidate.""

""We have decided that you were not an exact fit for the role we are looking to fill.""

""While you meet all of the qualifications that we are looking for, we have decided to wait on filling this position.""

""We had a great time talking with you and want to thank you for attending our private mixer (that we invited you to) but at this time we are looking for someone with a more defined skillset.""

""We will keep you in our database in case something comes up.""

""We will keep you on file.""

There was one company left that I had not heard back from yet. I had attended their private mixer, talked the talk, walked the walk, had every one of their employees introducing me to another one saying ""You got to meet this guy!"" After GDC I was still casually in conversation with some of their leads via email, I didnt think it could get any better.

""This is the one... I got this one... Its in the bag..."" I told myself as I waited patiently for that email telling me to pack my bags and start the rest of my life.

I got the email. It was long. Much longer then any other email I had received in this whole journey. My eyes began to water, my heart began to pound, and I put my face to my desk and cried.

(Literal Quote) ""Your experiences and qualifications are impressive.  After much deliberation in considering all of the candidates, the team has decided to move forward with another applicant.  This was a very difficult decision.  Your extensive skill-set was not a direct match to the current needs of the team.  Please know that we respect your many talents and sincerely appreciate your time and consideration.""

My girlfriend came into the room and I wept for hours. I really thought I had it. I did everything right. This was my last chance.

My savings were almost depleted, I had no job, and had no choice but to return to the company that I left to seek greener pastures.

I told my self that this time I wouldn't let things get to me. I would just do my job, go home, and forget about work. Work for the paycheck, nothing more nothing less. But that's simply not the case... I still feel exactly how I felt when I left the first time... Stressed, angry, resentful. I still get verbally abused, watch others get abused, and continue to hate every day that I have to be in that office.

I've still been applying for new jobs. Nothing has come of it yet, but I have my chin up. I have plans to attend E3 again and will hopefully get another opportunity to really get myself out there and meet more people like I did at GDC.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, its great to get it off my chest."
t48fz,1,2012-05-02,I NEED ADVICE REDDIT!!! What do you do when you have feelings for a father and his son?? ,oops_imtardy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t48fz/i_need_advice_reddit_what_do_you_do_when_you_have/,"So I have been racking my brain over this for weeks and I honestly do not know what to do. I met both of them about a year ago doing an internship, I've always had a crush on the father but he is 21 years older than myself and I never acted on any of my feelings. Then I met the son about two months later and he was like a miniature version of his dad and I really started to like him the more I was around him. Anywho after I left the internship and came home I only talked to the dad occasionally about general stuff until around February. He came out and said he'd had feelings for me and he wanted to see where they went and stuff. We started talking a lot and when he came down for his birthday I went to stay with him for about 3 days and we had sex. I was fine with all of that until I saw the son and I felt like I had been sucker punched and my feelings for him came back. After that weekend I've talked to the dad almost every day and I do have feelings for him and I love him. However on the flip side of that I do have feelings for the son and I love him too. I've gone back and forth with this and talked to friends about what to do but no one really has solid advice and it's driving me crazy. So I figured I'd try reddit since I've seen the advice you've given to people before."
t7bjl,14,2012-05-04,How to motivate oneself in searching for a job? (wall of text inside),TraceDicky,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/t7bjl/how_to_motivate_oneself_in_searching_for_a_job/,"Ok reddit, I need some input and or/advice on motivating myself to actually seriously start looking for a job. I am aware that what i am about to write might seem immature, that i am a somewhat spoiled and selfish condescending prick, and that there are people out there who would jump at the chance to get any work, especially these days. Before you critique the hell out of me however, keep in mind that i do not want to remain in the mindset which defines me now.

First, some background info. If you aren't interested in this, please skip the next 5 paragraphs.

 I am not a native speaker, and live in a shitty little country. I have degrees in sociology and cultural anthropology. I am 26 years old, and if you don't take into account the kids I've tutored, some odd translation jobs i did etc. i have one year's worth of job experience. 

Financially, i was never demanding - during high school and college i had scholarships which helped my family make end's meat. Here  academically successful students do not have to pay college tuition fees, and apart from that i spent every day commuting from home to college (about an hour there and another back) so i didn't have to pay for housing and stuff like that.

This is perhaps the source of my first problem - lack of tangible college experience. Sure, i went to all the classes, turned in my assignments and passed my exams, but never participated in extra curricular activities or various other small opportunities which might have given me more insight into the practical side of things. I thought that fulfilling my obligations, as well as not being a financial burden was enough.

I graduated fairly quickly, and started looking for work. Honestly, i never broke my back sending away resumes, or going on job interviews. I did send out some, but for the first couple  of months i thought i was entitled to  vacation after busting my balls at  completing college. 

The months turned into a year, that year, and after some time, i got offered two jobs at the same time, well, both were internships really. So, i took one working as a curator in a local museum. After working there for a year, i was supposed to gain insight into the workings of the place, get some job experience and go job hunting again. I am sad to say that, in spite of my real initial enthusiasm, the attitude of my coworkers and my mentor there left me disappointed - i was  perfectly willing to learn first hand, and they obliged themselves to provide me with what i would need. They didn't deliver, leaving me disappointed at having spent a year there and not learning enough in that time about a job i wasn't that keen on anyway. 

Here i am, 5 weeks after the end of that year, need to start looking for a job again, and am just sick and tired of it before i even began. In a nut shell, i take offence with how the ""real"" world works in regards to this. Now comes the whiny rant.

I am an introvert, and am a bit socially awkward, so it irritates the hell out of me how people expect you to be super excited, motivated and grateful at the prospect of actually getting a job doing something which you do not want to do, or where you can't seem to get ahead. It insults me as a person to be expected to be excited at the prospect of working not for pleasure or for insight, but for the ""privilege"" to rinse and repeat this every day for god knows how long. If i am to work, i wish to do so in order to provide a better life for myself and my family, and not so i can come home feeling like complete and utter crap while the best i have accomplished is maintaining status quo.

Now, i don't necessarily have to have a dream job in order to be content. I have three criteria for a job i would deem acceptable, any one of which would be enough. 1.) a collegial, cooperative and helpful working environment. 2.) a job where i can grow as a person and as a specialist, or if all else fails 3.) a job that offers enough monetary compensation for me to put up with the crap. Presenting this to some people i know resulted in looks of confusion and/or veiled condescension, along the lines of “how dare you have demands such as this” I seriously doubt that any of the 3 is unreasonable or unrealistic. 

A big part of the problem is that i feel mentally burned out. There are certain tensions within my family which stress me out on an almost daily basis, and if you couple that with bouts of depression, inertness and apathy, you have a recipe for stagnation.  That is not to say i am doing absolutely nothing about my situation – i talk with friends and acquaintances about looking for a job, i search the wanted ads on a semi-regular basis, I’ve set up an interview with one of my former college professors for next week seeking guidance on what i can do in regards to a potential career in sociology.
 Still, i can’t help but wonder why i bother doing this, at the same time chastising myself for not doing more. 

Speaking of pursuing a career in the fields i have degrees in, i feel that, in spite of being “successful” as a student, i have gained little in ways of actual competence. Basically, i would need to enroll in a post graduate program, which i do not have the funds to finance. Even if i did have the money, i don’t have any clear direction to pursue, and i feel i would need to get some real life experience on some kind of a research project to get the feel for everything.  The interview will probably boil down to “hello professor, i have no competences, no tangible idea how to pursue my career and a somewhat lackluster will to stick with it all – do you have any advice for me?”

I think that the gist of my frustration with everything is that i don’t feel that going out on the limb is worth it. I studied and was successful, but no one gives a crap in the “real” world; after that I was eager to learn, yet was treated with neglect and a lack of interest. How, pray tell, am i to feel enthusiastic about yet another endeavor after that kind of (limited) experience?

I’ll draw this to a close since I’ve rambled on long enough for now. I still have some money saved up from the last job i had, but that will dry up soon. I won’t exactly go hungry, but the family budget will definitely start to feel the strain in a few months. I am aware of this, yet feel mentally shackled in doing something about it  I don’t believe i am a lazy person, as i tend to pull my weight when what i do has significance, or when push comes to shove. Mostly though, I just don’t see the point.

 If you have stuck with the post for this long, I thank you for your perseverance. Just a couple of questions for the end:

How do i motivate myself to actually do something tangible about all of this?
Are any of my… reservations and attitudes justifiable, or am i just full of it?


TL;DR Some jerk ranting about how he's too damn inert/insecure to do what everyone else here is trying to do.

t779p,6,2012-05-04,Can't ask for help because I don't know what's wrong with me or how to explain [very long post],esbtoedrdy,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/t779p/cant_ask_for_help_because_i_dont_know_whats_wrong/,"This is going to be tl;dr. Sorry about that. But I've been watching you nice SW redditors being kind and supportive of people far worse off than I am, so perhaps somebody will be bored and looking for something to read. And even if nobody reads it -- it's been good to write it out. 

First, I don't technically have depression or whatever, because I've never been diagnosed with it by somebody qualified to diagnose that stuff. I'm personally pretty sure that the way I feel and act aligns very closely with depression or one of its close cousins (borderline personality, bipolar, etc.), and I've taken the stupid screenings online and read up on the conditions and can conclude that my behavior and feelings are consistent with them... But I won't claim to *have* them. Because you only *have* a condition if you're diagnosed. That's why my descriptions may seem a little odd through this post. 

So, I've been acting depressed/suicidal for a while in a way that's scaring my roommate. More on that later. He's trying to be supportive and trying to support me in getting help, but it's not working. Our university offers free counseling, where all you have to do is phone them to set up an appointment on the same day as you want the appointment to be, so cost and convenience shouldn't be an issue. I'm fine with agreeing to go in on a certain day a few days before, like on Wednesday I'll say I'm fine with the idea of going in on Friday (though I might already be at the point where I only make those promises to get him to stop trying to help), but on Friday I'll find some excuse why it can't possibly work out that day and I should go another time instead. The excuses vary, but the basic reasons for them are the same: 

 * I feel like others deserve the counseling services more than I do, and like I'd be wasting their resources
 * I have no idea how to explain what's going on to a complete stranger -- like, where to start
 * Appointments have to be made by phone, and I've detested speaking on the phone for as long as I can remember

It's the second of those points that's the biggest problem right now. I've felt this bad for a pretty long time, so I've gotten really really good at hiding it (well, I've just always been the kind of person who hides things), and my instinctive reaction when asked how I'm doing by anybody who isn't super close to me is ""I'm fine :)"". I feel like it'd be unfair and unkind to them to describe how I actually feel, because there's nothing they can do to change my mental state and the only outcome of telling them my problems would be that now two people would be sad instead of one. And I really really really detest the kind of people who get diagnosed with something and then brag about it and use it as an excuse to behave in ways that would be considered unacceptable otherwise. Yeah, I tend to be extremely judgmental of myself, and it spills over into judging others when I see people in situations similar to my own who prioritize themselves above others in a way that I'm jealous of but would never allow myself to do. 

One thing that keeps me from talking to strangers about my problems is that I have a really well-crafted persona of being the funny, strong, independent one-of-the-guys who takes care of everybody else around her. It's what's kept everybody else from noticing how mean I am to myself inside, and I'm even crueler to myself whenever I consider the possibility of breaking that facade. Like... when I imagine trying to detail my problems to a shrink, the _only_ thing I can imagine myself saying is along the lines of ""Why hello there. I'm a whiney little bitch who can't grow some balls and deal with her own made-up insignificant little problems. Yay, you're giving me attention! kthxbai"". 

Yeah, I really piss myself off sometimes. The reasons I've constructed as excuses to hate myself could be drawn out into a post twice as long as this one will end up, and it probably wouldn't do much good to go into them because they'd sound stupid to a mentally healthy person anyway. And there's times when I realize how stupid I am, and how I'm not really making a meaningful contribution to anything (or, I might have sometimes made meaningful contributions in the past, but when I get obsessed with my own problems like this, I hardly do any homework and don't show up to work... [1]), and I kind of get convinced that it'd be better for me to be dead. 

However, the people I judge the harshest and hate the most (again, because I'm jealous of them having the nerve to try it at all) are the people who attempt suicide and aren't successful. Inside my head, anyone who admits to being suicidal or attempts it and fails is just an attention whore. That's why I won't attempt it until I find a method that I'm very, very sure will work the first time. I know that if I call some hotline, if I ask for help, it'll be taken as a sign that I don't actually want to kill myself, and everybody would respond accordingly. By my logically flawed but emotionally convincing perception of the world, going to see a shrink and admitting to being suicidal would constitute failure and attention whoring as well. Going to see a shrink and pretending not to be suicidal would waste both their time and mine, and probably make them feel bad ifwhen I eventually find a method that's available to me at one of the times when I really want to die and have the initiative to follow through on it. Wanting to die and having enough energy to do something about that desire haven't lined up yet... but they might eventually. 

So, what're my actual problems? I don't even know. I know that I see myself as being hated by a lot of people (because if I were them, I'd hate me) and I see myself as having fucked up every worthwhile friendship that I've ever had, but both those things are simultaneously causes and effects of despising myself.  

One of the precipitating factors for this particular episode of hating myself worse than usual has been that one officer of a committe that I serve on resigned with the excuse that ""I went to the counselors and they said I have depression, so that's the reason I didn't feel good and missed a couple meetings"", and now I get all of the really freaking easy work that she was too lazy to finish dumped in my lap. This has made me really really angry -- way angrier than I usually get -- I think because I'm so jealous of her ability to just go off and be self-centered and say a huge ""fuck you"" to being responsible or considerate to the people who are counting on her. If that was an okay thing for someone to do with no consequences, then I would've done it years ago and maybe be happier now, so I really want it to not be an okay thing to do. If it's been acceptable all along and I've been too stupid to realize it, then I'm dumb enough to not deserve to be alive or _anything_. My response to this is to try to prove that her behavior is unacceptable by getting really really angry at her -- to the point where I'm seriously scared that if I have the means and the opportunity, I'm going to do her some serious harm. The only reason I haven't replied to her resignation email saying the kind of hurtful cruel stuff I say to myself to force myself to keep working is that I can't figure out the best way to express my feelings, and I know I'd only get one shot before she blocks all emails from me or whatever. 

Oh yeah, and whenever I'm mad at myself and feel really stupid, I've gotten in the habit of hitting myself in the head with a textbook or the battery part of my laptop (yay for thinkpads being indestructable) or a wall or whatever else comes to hand. My reason was initially that if I'm going to act like an imbecile then I should attempt to cause myself an excuse for it (it's okay for brain-damaged people to be stupid), but now it's just the only thing that I can think of to do when I feel bad. So when I have energy, I try really hard to hurt myself, and I stongly desire to hurt others. This is why I've hardly eaten anything for two days -- I might not think straight when I'm exhausted, but at least I can't follow through on any of the things that I feel like doing when I have energy.

------------------- 

[1] Yeah, this stupid post is so poorly thought out as to need footnotes. See, I actually have a really good job for a college kid (pays almost twice minimum wage) that'll get me the connections and portfolio of code and work experience that I'll need to have a successful career, and everybody there is nice to me (though I'm never sure if it's because i'm worth anything, or just because I'm the only female other than the secretary) and understands that school sometimes demands a lot of time... But I'm constantly scared because I'm working with a bunch of guys who've been coding way longer than I have and always know more than I do and I'm pretty much the least competent person there. Sure, I'm ""smarter"" than a lot of the silly derps in my 3rd-year college CS classes who can't so much as FizzBuzz, but that just means that I'm expected to do way better things and I know I'm not actually as smart as anyone thinks and I'm dreading the time when I have to explain that I don't actually know anything, because I'll be letting everybody down... But I'm a college kid with a really good job and a good internship and everything she needs to have a good career, which is way more than most people have, and half the redditors on here would be jealous of me for that alone, which just seems like further proof that I don't actually deserve to get help. 

----------------------

**tl;dr:** silly derpette has nothing to legitimately complain about, hates herself anyway, and has gotten so tangled up in a web of dysfunctionality that she can't seek help because she can't even summarize her problems in less than a novel and a half"

During the summer vacation, i'm supposed to be doing 3 months of practice in my field. 

The problem is, however, that the practice (i guess it would be called internship) the university sets up is lackluster and from what i've heard, it won't be that useful or productive, so i'd basically be stuck in the capital (i'm from a smaller town) wasting my time.

My other option would be to find another firm to intern at, preferably in my own town, but again, i don't know how useful that could turn out. 
  
So, i'm basically looking for some advice here, from people more knowledgeable than i. What's the best way to go about this? What other option do i have?"

t6bzt,14,2012-05-04,How valuable are Coursera and Udacity courses?,GRardB,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t6bzt/how_valuable_are_coursera_and_udacity_courses/,"Hey everyone,


Background:

- I'm a junior in college, studying computer science, and I'm on my way to becoming a software engineer out of college.

- I have successfully completed two Coursera courses: 1) Software Engineering for Software as a Service and 2) Design and Analysis of Algorithms 1

- I am currently enrolled in three Udacity courses: 1) CS212 Design of Computer Programs, 2) CS253 Web Applications Engineering, and 3) Programming Languages


Question:

- Aside from the additional knowledge gained from taking these courses, how valuable are they when looking for jobs? Do employers care if potential employees have taken these courses?

- Should I put them on my resume? If so, how/where would I do so?

- If you have any stories to tell about coworkers or employees that you've hired that may relate to this, please share! If you've taken these courses and found better success finding jobs because of doing so, even better!


Note:

- If you are unfamiliar with these courses, they don't count for credit, and they're very informal (they don't require identity verification, they can't really prevent you from cheating, etc.).

- For the record, I am not relying on these courses to get a job; I have an internship with a well-known startup in NYC this summer, and I've got prior experience as well. I'm just curious to see how big of a resume boost these courses are, if at all.

- Shameless advertising: If you're interested in/skeptical of these courses but haven't taken any, read my [blog post](http://grardb.tumblr.com/post/21996722846/udacity-and-coursera) about why I like them so much :D"

I walk in and this lady walks me around their office which is totally badass, bean bags and shit everywhere. She introduces me to two other guys and we all walk over to some sweet looking couches in front of a 70' screen tv. They ask me all the standard questions like ""What got you interested in our company?"" and stuffs like that, then they ask ""Would you be comfortable programming on a Mac?"". Me, not being a Mac enthusiast and being a total and complete dumbass, responds ""Well, I'm not really an Apple freak, but I have used them in the past."". I then look around and notice everyone around me using Macs and looking quickly back at their screens. I could have said Apple enthusiasts, Apple fan, or even Apple fanatic, but I went straight for Apple freak. What are your biggest screwups during an interview?

**TL;DR:** Called an office full of Apple fans freaks."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Could you describe the writing process? like when does it take place and how? Who selects the topics and how much influence does Jon have on it?  I hope my questions make sense since i really don't know how stuff like that works...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmapg?context=5)|The writers got a few hours, say if the meeting was at 10am, they got about until 2ish to get scripts and jokes to the head writer.  Then they start putting the pieces together.  Which jokes make it in, which don't.  Then they have to match stuff up with video footage.  Then Jon takes a look at it.  It's about 4:30 now.  Around 5ish they have a full run through of the show.  Just Jon at the desk and any correspondents that are needed, and the writers, who are sitting in the audience seats.  It takes about 25 minutes to go through stuff.
[What was Jon Stewart like off camera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm2tf?context=5)|He's the same as he is on camera.  Just the nicest guy.  The first day there, when they were showing the interns around, Jon popped out of his office.  We all froze, cause it was Jon Freaking Stewart standing in front of us, and he just goes 'Hey guys, thanks for working for us for free.'  Then he went about his business.
 |In fact, the day after the story that I was in aired I was working reception, and Jon comes in, sees me there stops by and said 'Hey DarnJester, good job last night.' 
[Explains why you chose the user name you did. I'd cherish a nickname from Jon Stewart above all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmbpz?context=5)|HA!  Nice.  
[How exactly did you become an Intern, what was the process like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm4w2?context=5)|It was actually really easy.  I found out they had interns from their website, submitted a cover letter telling them about all the work I'd done in college, I worked at the student run TV station and had a show called 'The Weekly Show' (get it?), and how much it would mean to work at the show that inspired me.  They called me up to NYC for an interview and it consisted of one question 'Do you want to be an intern here?'  To which I emphatically said yes.  And then the hired me.  It was pretty simple.
 |Turns out, and I found out about this just as my internship was ending, that they floated my cover letter around the office.  There was a contest to see if I was a stalker or not.  Apparently my cover letter came off, to some, as a little intense and I-want-to-wear-jon's-skin-as-a-coat-ish.  
[What does John Stewart do during commercial breaks? I've always wondered about that...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm9w3?context=5)|Oh, well actually when they cut to commercial they actually cut to commercial.  Meaning that the DJ, yeah there's a DJ, puts on music and plays it real loud, and they go for how ever long the commercial break is.
 |While that is happening, a script guy will come up and hand Jon the next segment's script.  A producer will come up and talk to Jon about something, they're always tinkering with stuff.  Then the stage manager will call 10 seconds, everyone walks off stage and here we go in 5, 4, 3,.... (They never say 2 or 1)
[How much writing does Jon and the other on-air hosts do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmakr?context=5)|A lot actually.  He's in on the meetings, and obviously during the run through. 
[I've never understood it when people joke on people like Jon, Colbert and Conan about how they'd be nothing without their writers.   It's completely uncalled for. Yes, the writers are important.   But the hosts aren't mindless loudspeakers.  They're intelligent.  They have to be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jtfc2?context=5)|I think what the guys went through during the writers strike, legal or not(however they did it), proved that they could handle it on their own if they needed to.
[Come on, you can tell us the truth. They can't hurt you now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jomyg?context=5)|I am telling you the truth.  Jon's right there.  In fact, the Wayne Gretzky part of the package that I was in (in the OP) was Jon's joke.  He's involved.
[ yet they still say it.   Of course, it's mostly the extreme right wingers that do it.  And by mostly, I mean 100% of the time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jugpt?context=5)|Haters gonna hate.  Remember when they tried to have a right wing version of the Daily Show?  It bombed, big time.  Not sure what my point is, maybe that right wing comedy isn't funny.  But then again Fox News in it of itself is comedy...either way, it sucked.
[Did you meet any of the ""correspondents"" or guests, and if so...were any of them a jerk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm1am?context=5)|I met all the correspondents, at the time.  And they were all great.  Ed Helms even pulled me aside a few times to give me pointers on stand up.  He was super nice.  I don't remember any guest being jerks, or if they were I wasn't around them when it was happening.  I did meet Joshua Jackson and Sir Patrick Stewart, Josh is tall, like 6'2"" and Sir Patrick, well he wasn't a Sir at the time, I think, but it was just awesome to be around him.
[As a super-huge fan of ""Fringe"", I kind of hate you now for meeting Joshua Jackson, you lucky SOB, even though  this was pre-""Fringe"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmk13?context=5)|Dude, at the time it was a) Charlie from Might Ducks, and then b) fucking Pacey Whitter from The Creek.  The man was already awesome before Fringe, and continues to be awesome.
 |I'm also glad for season 5, short as it is.
[When they do the segments where they go out and interview people, are those people always real, or are they sometimes actors? Do the real people know what's going on and are playing along, or do they actually think it's a real news show? If the former, why do people agree to be on the show when they know they'll be ridiculed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmksx?context=5)|Real.  I know.  Back when I was there I couldn't believe it either.  But people still haven't seen the show, or understand what's going on.  So for the most part it's real.  Though most politicians have gotten wise to it.  But at the same time I think the correspondents have also gotten better at being subtler with the questions.   
[Kind of a digression, but I think the new guy, Al Madrigal is *outstanding* at subtle questions that trap people in absurd positions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jyhko?context=5)|Al Madrigal is amazing.  He took to the show almost immediately.  I really enjoy his work on the show.
[*But people still haven't seen the show.*  They're even told that it's the Daily Show? I would have at least thought that they request interviews under the name of a parent company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jug6p?context=5)|No, they tell them the name, but if they ask what it is, for the people who really have no idea, they say it's a cable news show.  At least that was one of the things they said back in '03.  Now it seems like either people understand what's going on, or the interviewers, and also the writers and producers of the segments have gotten extremely good at crafting the questions.  Giving the interviewee, if that's the purpose of the piece, enough rope to hang themselves.
[How many people do they have working there who's sole job is just to watch the news channels? Also, The Daily Show seems so good at pulling up random news clips from years ago, how do they keep track of everything? I've always guessed they have some an enormous database.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkpr?context=5)|You're right, they have a giant database.  When I was there the video library was a bunch of book shelves, maybe 8 or so.  And they have a system that logs what's on every tape.  So, lets say that we need to pull up a sound bit of Romney flip flopping, you go to the computer type in Romney healthcare and a list of videos with clips of Romney talking about healthcare pop up.  Then they just pull the tapes, find the clips and edit away.
 |I've been to the new building a few times, the tape library is now enormous!
[Did you ever get used to the daily beatings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm3yx?context=5)|Yes.  I used to say 'Thank you sir, may I have another!'
[How long did you intern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm8l4?context=5)|I was an intern for 5 months.  Jan to May. It was the best 5 months of my life.
[What was the educational objective of interning at The Daily Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm8l4?context=5)|As for education...well I learned what it was like to create a comedy show daily.  There are dozens of people working there butts off every day to make the show.  Someone is always working on the next thing.  Editors are always editing for tomorrow's show.  There's a bunch of stuff that's required that you wouldn't necessarily think they'd need.  I learned a whole bunch, and I loved every minute of it.
[How many takes does Jon or any of the correspondents need on average? Do you have any stories of goofs that made it on air? Thanks! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmjb8?context=5)|One.  Seriously, these guys are good.  And honestly, I wish I did have a story of them messing up, but even if they do, they cover it well.  You've seen the show, they laugh at themselves sometimes when they slip up but they keep on going.  I like it better than way, it humanizes the comedy.
[Is Jon Stewart really as short as he seems on camera? I always feel like it is Frodo talking with Gandolf whenever he is interviewing someone over 6 feet tall.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmeqa?context=5)|He's not Seacrest short, but he's short.  But you really don't notice it when you're around him.
[What was your best experience working at The Daily Show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmaap?context=5)|Making Jon laugh.  Check out the link in the OP, for my OP.  By far one of the greatest accomplishments of my life.
 |In fact, I hope that I do 'make it' in my career, just so one day I can be interviewed by Jon and tell him the story.  Jon is like my Carson.  Carson was responsible for a lot of comics first big breaks, and they owe Carson for their careers and they've been able to tell him so.  I'd like to be able to tell Jon the same.
[Were you involved in the writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm3uz?context=5)|I wish. The only thing I got to do by the end was help in pitch meetings and the some of the producers asked for my help on research for there pitches.  But honestly, I wasn't that good of a comedy writer back then.  Now though....
[Who's funnier off-camera -- Stewart or Colbert?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmltp?context=5)|Hard question.  Stewart is a stand up at heart while Colbert is sketch and improv.  So two different disciplines at work.
 |That's my way of being a pansy and not picking a side :)
[Who is the coolest or rather friendliest correspondent that works there? Where you able to have extended conversations with Stewart or maybe Colbert? How are they in person?  Also, what did you actually have to do when you worked there?  Finally, the obvious question, did you get paid? :D ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmbsj?context=5)|Helms.  He wasn't as busy as the other guys, cause he was still newish to the show.  We'd talk about stand up, and how he got started.  He's really awesome.
[How do we know your not really Wayne Gretzky? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm8fn?context=5)|If I were the real Gretzky I wouldn't let my daughter post pics like she's been doing of late.
 |Speaking of which, have you seen Gretzky's daughter...damn!
[Since you were there with some of the greats (Colbert, Helms, Carrell\) which one did you think was the best?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkz9?context=5)|Thats like picking your favorite child.  They were all great in there own way.  Helms was closer in age to me so we got along great.  Colbert was a rock star, just the nicest guy you could ever meet.  And Carell, well Carell, and this is the about the time he was leaving, he was being pulled between both coasts, so I didn't see him as much as the others.  But he is the nicest, humblest guy.  But when he's on, god lord don't make eye contact because your face will melt, he's that funny.  He doesn't have to say anything and you're already cracking up.
[Also, any funny stories about these guys? I always imagined hilarity ensues wherever these guys go. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkz9?context=5)|They were/are all awesome. And yes when they get together it is hilarity.
[When it goes to the correspondents, they're in front of green screens right? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmm25?context=5)|Yup.  They are literally 10 feet away from Jon.  
[How does Jon Stewart take his coffee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmhpe?context=5)|Honestly, I have no idea.  In my five months there I never once got anyone coffee.  I bought the supplies to make coffee, but actually made it.
[How long was your average work day? Was it a standard 40 hours or did they get as many free hours out of you as they could?  Also, what was an average work day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmmc9?context=5)|I was there 3 days a week.  I had to get there about 9am and I left after the show was done taping, which could be anywhere from 6:30-8.  But usually I stayed later working on stuff.  Like I mentioned before, I loved that place and the people there so it was never really 'work' to me.  
[Jon Stewart is great, no doubt, but I think the real heroes of that show are the folks who dig through all the media archives to find video from a few months/years prior in which the jackass du jour contradicts something s/he said recently. Can you give us a little insight on who these Daily Show employees are and how they keep ALL THAT MEDIA archived and catalogued, in order to pull it up within a day or so of current events? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmicc?context=5)|You're right, it does take a team to get the show on the air every day.  I answered part of this question somewhere on here, but to go into it a little more:  the library is huge, so they have a few PA's, probably, maybe a intern or two, helping catalogue new video and updating the database.  And digging through said database when needed.
 |After they find it, it's up to the editors and the segment producers to put it all together.  It's a big undertaking and one that doesn't usually get done until very close to show time.
[Does Jon delegate the reading of all those books?  Because there's no other show on all of television that does book reviews, and reading all those damn books must be a task for 10 people. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmnel?context=5)|I think so.  They also had a lot of book give aways.  At one point they had one hall just lined with books and a sign begging people to take them.  
[Can you show us a dated picture from today so we can see that it is you in the video?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm1v3?context=5)|Working on that right now, should be done shortly.
[Who was your favourite former co-worker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm586?context=5)|Most of them are still there, but, honestly, if I had to pick one, it was/is Rory Albanese.  He was a segment producer (he's now the EP) when I was working there, but he was the one that really pushed me to do stand up.  He went so far as to tell me 'If you don't get on stage in the next two weeks, we're no longer talking to you.'  And so I did, and ten years later I'm still doing it.
 |But everyone there was great. 
[So where's your tour schedule already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jtcxc?context=5)|If only I had one.  How about this, Aug 3rd-26th, 2013 Edinburgh, Scotland, Fringe Festival.  That is on my tour schedule.  The rest is TBD.  
[Why have you failed at getting Jon to run for President? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmk9m?context=5)|I'm so sorry that I worked there in a non election year :(
[Sometimes Stewart seems to use his comedy to cover up a deep anger about the world we live in and political squabbling, did he ever off camera just get really angry at politics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jms4p?context=5)|Not that I ever saw.  But I was there during the run up to Iraq, so the frustration was only really starting then.  
[I read in a Colbert biography that interns at the Daily Show were responsible for supplying the writers with Lucky Charms every day. What were your daily tasks like?  I hope to intern with Jon or Stephen next summer. I applied too late this time =/](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmwh8?context=5)|You are correct.  Everyday I was there I had to make a run to the store to resupply the kitchen.  There was a list of all the stuff that was needed, and Lucky Charms was the number one cereal on the list.  Which was good because I ate a lot of it too :)  
[Did they give you any cool Daily Show schwag.. or books/videos/etc that guests gave to them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmki7?context=5)|I have a picture of me sitting behind the old desk.  It's on my parents fridge and there isn't a digital copy or I would post it.
 |Speaking of, I need my parents to make a digital copy of that photo.
[If you get the picture digitalized, post it on Reddit, you would hit front page easy and earn a shit ton of karma.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jthzg?context=5)|Thank you for the tip.  I'm not much of a Karma whore, but when I get my parents to send me a copy and I'll post it for you guys to see.  
[Can you use your inside connections to get them to fix the direction of the earth's rotation in the opening?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmrjp?context=5)|If the great Neil DeGrasse Tyson can't do it, after repeatedly tell Jon, on air mind you, then I doubt an old intern from long ago has much pull.  But if I could make it happen, I would.
[How were you qualified for the position or what were you told was your defining quality that made you the obvious choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmkpd?context=5)|Well an intern is really just a person who does the crap jobs; answering phones, making calls, getting food, transcribing video (that was the worst).  I think it was really a desire to work there.  There were other interns that were there that, for them, from my perspective, it was just an internship.  For me though, it was the chance of a lifetime.  I think that's what they saw in me.  Or, at least, that's the story I tell myself.
[Sorry if it's already been asked, but where did you go to college?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmhi3?context=5)|I went to Virginia Tech.  Go Hokies!
[Yeahhhhh! I go to Tech, we have exams right now. Party in the empo right now, shots of knowledge.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jnya3?context=5)|Blah, I know what that's like.  But good luck.  I'm trying to get down there to preform for my fellow Hokies sometime this year.  
[Not really that relevant, but I'm about to graduate from Tech next week! Woooo!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jvzgh?context=5)|Well done.  Welcome to the real world, it sucks :)  Hope you have a job lined up, at least you have your parent's health insurance for a few more years.  
[Hokie, Hokie, Hokie, Hy!  Tech, Tech, VPI.  Sol-a-rex, Sol-a-rah.  Poly Tech Vir-gin-ia.  Ray rah VPI.  Team! Team!

When I get down and perform at Tech, soon I hope, I hope a hive five and a bunch of jokes shall suffice.

[Did any of the guests get upset after an interview or just act like a prick all around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jm7cd?context=5)|Not that I saw.  Everyone seemed to have a great time.  
[How many hours/week would you say Stewert works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmnmk?context=5)|He's there everyday working on the show and other things that I wasn't privy too.  But he's a hands on guy, he's right in the thick of things.  He has a lot of demands on his time but I never heard him complain about it.
[How does TDS find so many archived footage to use in their segments? How many people do they have that go through those video archives? Is there some sort of database or search function setup they have that allows them to find the quote they need easily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmlty?context=5)|I answered the video archive question above.  But for video they don't have they go to the AP and other video sources and their libraries that are vastly more huge than the already huge TDS library.
[Does Jon Stewart generally ad lib the interviews or are they more scripted? I ask because I'd like to know just how much of Stewart's analysis of current events about his guests is his own opinion and knowledge as opposed to the collective writers. For example: the Jim Cramer reaming. How much of that was prompted by the writers or the producers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jp6a6?context=5)|I can't speak to the Cramer interview.  But they're a combo of both.  Jon's very smart, basically everyone at the show is, so they do their research, they read the books, and then come up with questions depending on far they want to go with a guest.
 |Granted, they didn't do that a lot when I was there, but, lately, you've seen Jon refer to his cards when he's quoting or trying to make a factual point that he wants to make sure he's getting right.
 |So in the end, it's a team effort.  
[Did you ever get high with Jon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jmtr5?context=5)|No :(
[So are Ollie Williams, Wyatt and the other correspondents also writers for the show? Also how often does Colbert drop by. And how awesome was the Avengers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jsute?context=5)|Seeing it 3 hours, will report back.
[What is your favorite color?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jt5tj?context=5)|I like green and blue equally.  
[Sorry, but one more question? How old are you? you seem so young!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t5555/i_was_an_intern_at_the_daily_show_ama/c4jwo27?context=5)|Thanks.  I got lucky with genetics and I stay out of direct sunlight.  I'm 33, but I do look younger, which is awesome.

t8vom,0,2012-05-05,Is it weird to find someone online that you met in person?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t8vom/is_it_weird_to_find_someone_online_that_you_met/,"So long story short, I was volunteering for an event and met a girl there. We hung out and talked for about 5 hours while we worked but eventually separated to do other jobs. Conversation was natural and I felt a slight connection. I wanted to ask to see if she wanted to hang out later but got a little flustered and didn't. Later that evening, I kept trying to figure out who she was and tried searching for her online. I did not know her last name so I searched everything I knew about her, where she was from, where she is now, where she works etc. I eventually did find her but I think it is a little creepy to befriend her online, especially since we only just met and I sort of found her in a stalkerish way. She's currently an intern and will be leaving in June so this may be my only chance to see her. I couldn't find a facebook profile for her but I did manage to find a LinkedIn profile.  My question is, would it be weird/creepy (assuming you were her) to receive a friend request online from an acquaintance?"

I really enjoy it and the guys are great, but the commute is ridiculously long (roughly 2.5 hours). I accepted the job thinking that I may be driving there, but that didn't work out due to last minute changes. I tried asking around for car pool but most people live near the work place. And now, here is where I need some help. I'm thinking of exploring other options that are near where I live. I accepted the offer at the place I'm working at now a bit too early and regret it since I was getting an interview afterwards with the company I was aiming for throughout the semester (I declined the interview with that company mistakenly). I'm trying to get back into talks with the other company that I declined. Is what I'm doing wrong? If I do get an offer from the other company, I want to leave on good terms and I really feel like I've made a mistake and should've waited out before accepting the offer.

Forgot to say that it is an internship"

Please help me.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t8gyo/my_ex_uscitizen_borderliner_took_our_1year_old/,"I just wanted to thank all you wonderful people for your 
helpfull comments. To give an update:
I have found a lawyer specialized in international custody 
cases and have found out that California honours an 
international which would give me at least visiting rights!! 
Thanks again!!

Dear Reddit,

Thank you for reading this. I was advised to post my story on Reddit so this is my first time here, will do my best to keep it short. 

My ex-girlfriend: U.S. citizen, 31 years old, teacher (looking for a job), currently lives with her mom in California.
Our Daughter: Born in the Netherlands, Dutch and U.S. citizen, 1,1 years old, currently living with her mom and grandmother in California.
Me: Dutchman, 33 years old, physician, live and work in South Africa.
We started dating in 2009 and living together in the Netherlands in March 2010. A few months later my girlfriend was pregnant and in March 2011 our daughter was born. In September 2011 we moved to South-Africa where I started working a as doctor. In December 2011 my girlfriend visited her mother. She took our daughter with her, decided to stay in California and they never came back. In February 2012 we broke up. 

I want to be in my daughters life and be a good father to her so I started to study for Step 1 of the United States Medical License Exam, with the idea to get my diploma acknowledged in the U.S. In time I want to permanently move to the U.S. This process will take about 3-4 years with all the procedures involved. In the meantime I have renegotiated my contract at the hospital I work at and now I only work for 8 months a year in South-Africa, the other 4 months a year I will be living in California to be with my daughter.

During my study I noticed that a lot of the remarkable behavior of my ex-girlfriend fitted the criteria of a (high functioning) borderliner. In the beginning of our relationship there weren’t that many strange things. She could push me away, but I thought that was a bit of commitment fear. After a while she got anxious if I wanted some time on my own and was suddenly sick when if wanted to visit a friend on my own.  She hated her ex-husband and called him evil, but although in her stories he wasn’t perfect, it never became clear to me why he was marked as entirely evil. I didn’t read too much into that because I loved her, but just before we went to South-Africa in September 2011 she started ‘splitting’: I was a hero and she wanted to have a second kid with me one moment and then the next moment I was a villain that made her unhappy, didn’t buy her enough presents, didn’t have the right hair color and was too stupid to understand her needs. There didn’t seem to be an apparent trigger for these mood swings, they just appeared. The demands she made just kept increasing by the day, until it was impossible to meet those. She would ask for one thing, only to become angry if I did that for her – because she actually wanted another thing. Whatever I did, it was always the wrong thing. I ended up feeling depressed, on my guard the whole time (not knowing what to expect) and utterly exhausted. In the last couple of months we were together she started accusing many people around her (from the neighbor to the hair dresser) of trying to pull her leg or manipulate her. Now I understand she can’t really help it. She of course thinks that there is no problem with her, I am the problem. (And all these people trying to benefit from her.) 

When I acknowledged our daughter during the pregnancy, the public official in the Netherlands told us about an international treaty between the Netherlands and the U.S. which states that I have no rights whatsoever as a father, only duties. In case a conflict arises I have no legal rights to see my child or claim (partial) custody. My ex-girlfriend remembers this very well and is using this against me to get more and more money from me and threatens to keep me away from our little girl if I don’t give in.

In January, before the break-up, we made an agreement in case we would break-up. It wasn’t a fancy document with signatures etc, but we put things “on paper” (email).
We agreed upon:
- how to divide our possessions
- I pay $900 a month for our daughter until Sept. 2012 (which gives her enough time to find a job)
- from September 2012 we will split the costs for Julia 50/50
- Every two days I get to talk to and see my daughter via Skype
- there will be no badmouthing
- I get a place to sleep at her mom's house when I come to visit our daughter for four months

Now it is a mesh. First, my ex-girlfriend asking for an adjustment of the divisions of possessions/money. I consented. Then she started asking for more money: $500 extra, indefinitely, so the whole “we’ll pay half of $900 from September 2012” is out the window. So that would be $1400 a month. I make $37000 a year. Now I have to pay my own costs and this includes the costs for the USMLE exam and the preparations for that ánd  saving up for the 4 months I will not be working and will be visiting our daughter. So I didn’t agree with her. She got very angry and cut me off from my daughter. No more Skype. I totally caved. I now pay her $1400 and I have to find my own place to stay when I come to California to visit our daughter because she doesn’t want me to be in their home anymore. I can’t really afford this $1400 a month I pay her now.

A month ago she decided to ask for even more money per month: $ 320 for a life insurance. So that would be $1720 a month starting now. She also hired a photographer to take some pics of our daughter. This cost $260 and she wants me to pay the bill. I said “no” and again I was put on a “skype-diet”. In addition she sent me an email last week that actually the 1400 dollar isn’t enough to pay the daily costs. There is, for example, no money left for clothes and not enough for food and diapers The email was accompanied by a list (written with anger) of new limitations in regard to me seeing my daughter when I visit. The message is clear: this time the consequences will be more severe than not seeing my daughter on skype. 

From September till December I will be visiting our daughter. In September in want to start paying $700-800/month  (plus a monthly deposit into a study fund on my daughter’s name). I’m afraid she will stop me from seeing our daughter if I do. I’m also afraid she will cut me off from my daughter now because I can’t afford to pay her more than $1400 a month. I don’t want to lose my daughter. 

My questions to you (hope there’s a lawyer and/or expert by experience out there reading this):

•	How do I break the news that I can’t afford to pay more than $1400 a month indefinitely without her melting down and cutting me off from my daughter again? And how am I to tell her I actually think it is fair to reduce the amount of money I am paying every month?
•	Is it true that as a Dutchman I have no rights whatsoever when it comes to visiting rights and custody?
•	Would I have rights if I would be a permanent resident in the USA (but not yet have the American nationality)?
•	I’ve heard that it helps to do an internship or something that resembles it, so I would have a better chance as a foreigner in obtaining a residency spot. Do you agree? Any tips on how to obtain such an internship (especially as a foreigner in the process of having his diploma acknowledged)?

TLDR: I (Dutchman, 33) live in South-Africa working as a physician. Now studying for U.S. Medical License Exam to be able to work and live in the U.S. to be close to my daughter. My ex (U.S. citizen, 31, probably a high functioning borderliner) took our 1-year old daughter to California and is now pushing me into bankruptcy: she will cut me off from my daughter if I don't pay. Questions: how to break the news that I want to transfer less money and not more and more? Do I have any visiting/custody rights?

t7zcn,1,2012-05-05,I think that this would be the BEST springboard for a short story. Whatcha think reddit?,TheShaggyOne808,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t7zcn/i_think_that_this_would_be_the_best_springboard/,"Okay, so the internet is a-walkin' down the street, minding its own business, till BAM! That little asshole 9gag (insert embarrassing prank/dickheaded action here)s the poor internet AGAIN! But this time is different (flashback to the other assholeish things 9gag has done before), this time they went too far. Internet isn't gonna take it any more, he quickly turns down the nearest alley and gives his main man Reddit a call. ""We'll take it from here internet, don't you worry""
Reddit is standing in a conference room in front of all his best men (Imgur, Google, ThePirateBay, Youtube, ect...) Google pounds his fist on the table ""This guy has been blowing up my servers for MONTHS now"" imgur turns her head and begins sobbing softly ""He.... He left his WATERMARK on me....."" reddit places his hand on her shoulder ""We're gonna fix this Imgur, I'll make sure that this is the last time 9gag will get away with something like this"" The door opens, a dopey looking intern pokes his head in ""You guys doing something cool?! I want in!!!"" Reddit turns his head and yells furiously. ""NO, GTFO MEMEBASE!""
He lights a cigarette and sinks into his chair ""We can't do this with the team we have now, we need help...."" ThePirateBay chimes in, an eyebrow raised. ""Surely ye' don't mean him boss..."" Youtube cries out, ""Please Reddit, think this through, you KNOW he isn't sane!!!"" Reddit turns his head and takes a long pull on his cigarette, then exhales..... ""We need that sick fuck, and he has his reasons to help us as well. He's an assassin and we can outfit him with what he need to take this fucker down once and for all. We need each other for this mission, and this mission alone..."" He looks up, one could see the worry and fear in his eyes. ""Google.....

I'm a senior in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.  I'm looking for a summer internship in the NY/NJ/PA area where I'd be able to gain more knowledge in the field of urban planning.  

My skill sets include Microsoft Office, Photoshop, SPSS, ArcGIS, Google Applications such as Sites, Docs, Sketchup.  I'm a self-starter and highly outgoing and professional.  My work experience includes tons of leadership such as being a Resident Assistant for Rutgers, Orientation Leader, and Scarlet Ambassador.  I'm an extremely proficient draftsman and artist in a multitude of mediums and am able to use my artistic skills as an effective form of communication.  I have been the recipient of scholarships and awards including the Congressional Art Award Grand Prize Winner, Deans List for Rutgers University, and the Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation Scholarship.

I'm excited to get into the planning field because I see a lot of potential for the built environment to shape the future.  I'd love to help work with a company to promote sustainable practices and update policies.  PM for a resume and portfolio!

t9ph5,2,2012-05-06,I'm depressed and suicidal. How do I change my life?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9ph5/im_depressed_and_suicidal_how_do_i_change_my_life/,"This is my situation:

- 19 year old
- Very dysfunctional and clingy family that has isolatd me my whole life, and continues to do so
- Engineer, just got an amazing internship opportunity this summer so I'm doing quite well.
- I'm a complete beta male, entirely because of my family. To this day they treat me like a 12 year old, and like a dog. My opinion means nothing, they talk down to me and they act like I don't know anything. As a result I have extremely low self esteem and and heavily insecure and socially anxious. I am also very depressed and have frequent mood swing.

I have a place away from my family, but they're clingy enough that they've perturbed my entire life. I can't tell them to fuck off because I'm not allowed to talk back. I'm treated like a dog. If I say anything to them they start freaking out and screaming and act like the world is ending, while throwing all kinds of insults at me. They haven't taught me anything, yet they act like I owe them everything. 

I feel trapped. I'm a beta male. I'm out of shape, I've never had a girlfriend, I'm continuously depressed. I don't have the courage to talk out, and if I do, I start crying because of how strongly it's been drilled into my brain that I am not allowed to talk back. They have taken all my dignity.

I have already attempted suicide. I have no self respect at all. I can't leave this family because they're psychotic. If I try and abandon them I know my parents will do something drastic like commit suicide. They love me, but they're absolutely horrible people with major psychological issues, and they don't understand how it affects me. Even if they could understand they can't do anything.

Sorry, just had to vent I guess. I don't know what I'm going to do."
t9nwf,21,2012-05-06,"As a Biomedical Engineer with 2 years of experience, am I getting underpaid?",CrazedChimp,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/t9nwf/as_a_biomedical_engineer_with_2_years_of/,"Hi Reddit,

As the title says, I'm a BME with 2 years of experience and I feel like I'm underpaid. A full description of my situation is below. Any advice/opinions about my job and salary would be greatly appreciated.

I graduated in 2010 with a BS in Biomedical Engineering from a program ranked in the top 10 in the US. Immediately afterwards, I started working as an ""intern"" at a medium to large medical device company making $20/hr. The idea was to move to full time after 3-6 months, but that ended up not happening due to a product recall, a hiring freeze, and some other problems at that company. After a year (still at the same salary) I took an Associate Engineer position at a Fortune 500 company in Boston developing a product that will be a direct competitor to the first product line I worked on (the one upside to being an intern was that I didn't have a non-compete agreement). The new salary was $52k/yr. In my new position I perform many of the same tasks and work with the same materials that I did at my first job.

After a year in this new role my salary has increased to $53k. When I agreed to take the offer for my current job I felt that the salary was much too low (I pushed back but wasn't in a good position because my first company couldn't keep me as an intern for more than a year). 

Now that I have two years of experience I feel that should be paid much more, but I believe my manager intends to have me wait until 
my annual review (in 10 months) to move up. Am I being unrealistic about what my salary should be? Should I confront my manager and discuss my salary, or should I be patient and wait? Should I try to solicit an offer from another company? Given what my current salary is, I'm concerned that even if I get promoted I won't be making as much as I should. The money is an especially big concern to me because I have very substantial student loans and I want to get back to school for a Masters as soon as possible.

Thanks for your help!"
t9myb,0,2012-05-06,I am in a lose-lose situation. How should I proceed?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t9myb/i_am_in_a_loselose_situation_how_should_i_proceed/,"To keep this short and sweet, I am having a relationship problem. Although I recently started dating this girl, I left my home country to work an internship in a foreign one. Needless to say, my girlfriend became distraught. To counter this I frequently call her (despite an 11 hour time zone difference), text message her, and Skype her, among other forms of communication, in order to alleviate her sadness by any amount. She is very stressed out because I left despite having recently starting dating. Moreover, she is currently in the middle of taking final examinations, so of course she is a bit angered. 

Everything sounds well and good, ya? Here comes the real problem...

When I contact her our conversations are fantastic and we really hit things off again. However, whenever I say I have to go, whether it be for work or for my studies (as I still have to take final examinations, despite being abroad), she becomes very depressed and angry with me. She claims that I am purposely leaving her and that I do not care about her. Apparently, she does not trust me when I explain my feelings for her. Therefore, most of our conversations end with us bickering and sometimes fighting. The quarreling has escalated with each conversation, and this time I fear that we may break up unless I pull out all the stops and convince her otherwise. 

Despite having dated for only a short while, I truly do love this girl. Every time we argue I find myself shacking from anxiety and fear that I will lose her. This may seem a bit odd, but I believe this is because of my high level of stress, which stems from my internship, my studies, and my lack of sleep.

**TL;DR: If I contact my girlfriend, she gets angry because she misses me more. If I do not contact my girlfriend, she gets angry because I am supposedly neglecting her.**

Please refrain from any childish comments or unserious remarks, such as: ""Don't stick your dick in cray cray!"" This is neither the time nor place for me to entertain such foolish notions. If you have any serious advice, please assist me in any way possible."

[Sounds like an interesting job. What type of qualifications did you need to apply for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4ki0y1?context=5)|It required a strong knowledge of tree biology (growth rates, root systems, internal tree anatomy etc..) but mostly a developed climbing skill set. I needed to come on board knowing large array of knots, how to set-up a system for my to ascend into the crown of the tree, how to maneuver within the crown efficiently and know how to set up rope and pulley systems to safely lower larger limbs to the ground.
 |Basically the office is made up of 4 old tree guys, another guy with a landscaping background and me. They needed a dedicated experienced climber who could do the work and required very little or no training, and take over so the old guys can get ready to retire lol! 
[For strong knowledge of tree biology, do they require a relevant degree? Or does job experience work? Do they just have interviewers ask knowledge-based questions to see if you know your shit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kivzp?context=5)|Basically the latter. It would be really easy to tell if someone didnt know proper terminology or procedures. Example..where and how to make the best pruning cut on the tree..or which tree has a faster growth rate.. an oak or a poplar. stuff like that.
 |I have a degree in Biology fron University of Massachusetts so that helped me getting the job.
 |Ironically in the private industry, having a college degree was a negative thing. The older tree guys who went to the school of hard knocks looked at you as a young hot shot, know it all type. I was so craving all the knowledge and experience they had but they were affraid i was coming in to steal their jobs. :(
[Holy fuck that's amazing. Is there any specific tree that's really hard to climb? One that's too easy? One that has any weird quirks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kiete?context=5)|I love climbing white oaks! the wood is super strong so I can tie into small wood (3"" diameter is as small as I will tie into)
 |The ABSOLUTE WORST is American Elm. -They have a VERY vase like shape..or V shape. So Ideally I will tie into the highest most central branch in the tree. This allows me to move around very easily if my rope is in the high center. but Elms dont have a central leader..most limbs go up, then grow horizontal..huge pain the butt.
 |And the larger limbs always always grow tons of moss. They are very slippery. I have slipped and got thrown into the trunk more then a few times.. obviously i was tied into my rope and didn't fall out of the tree because I was tied in..but fell to where the rope was pulling me.
[Pallet Town: 1 New Bark Town: 0 Checkmate Jhotoians!  Seriously, congratulations!  Professor Oak: 1 Professor Elm: 0.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kiuch?context=5)|Oh man i love you! thats an awesome reference!
[What kind of hours does a job like this entail?  Are there times when you need to do emergency pruning because of incoming visitors? And what is the most surprising tree that you have found? (Gift from someone, or dedicated too\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4ki90t?context=5)|I go in at 6:30am and leave by 4pm. I will get called in for emergency storm damage though. The occasional hurricane in the mid-Atlantic causes lots of damage. In the summer in this area of the country it gets REALLY humid and Boomers (very severe, fast moving thunderstorms that come out of nowhere) are very common. Micro-burst wind sheers do lots of damage to.
 |Coolest trees I have worked on so far in the couple weeks since I started have been..
 |A. Original gift Cherry Blossom trees from Japan. As in the actual trees the country gave to us as a gift.. not clones or re-plants.
 |B. I got to work on a tree that was over 200 years old! While employed by a private company I worked on a Tulip Poplar that was planted by George Washington himself in 1785! This was on a trail on his estate in Alexandria, Virginia.
 |C. I get to help set-up the capitol Christmas tree this December!
[I hear you all chopped down the old/new Whitehouse Christmas tree today. How did that go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kjjri?context=5)|I work specifically for the capitol building. Architect of the Capitol to be specific. That must have been the White House crew.
 |Yeah the National Christmas tree was a transplant. Mature trees very rarely survive a transplant. AoC gets a new tree donated every year. 
[*I was looking for a job, and then I found a job*  *And heaven knows I'm miserable now*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kjnd3?context=5)|LOL.
[That sounds pretty cool! How long have you been in this career/ industry? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4khx77?context=5)|I learned chainsaw skills and felling techniques in Alaska during an internship in the summer of 2008. When I moved to Washington DC in 2009 I started  my tree climbing career. So going on 4 years now. 
[Ever tried rock climbing? Or is tree climbing in a different skill set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kij00?context=5)|I tried to rock climb at a Ren. Fair. If you made it to the top you got $20! but i couldnt even get half way. :D.
 |Could have been all the Sam Adams though lol.
[So how much does one get paid to climb and prune trees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kilzj?context=5)|Well I make enough for a decent living. We will say someone with my skill set and comparable qualifications could make anywhere from 18$-24$ per hour. Some companies/agencies will give time and half for the time you are actually in the tree or doing a large removal as..""hazard pay.""
[I hate to say it, but can you provide proof please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kippi?context=5)|I dunno if this counts. lol it is my work baseball cap with AoC logo.

And you might want to donate some new equpiment to the Tree Care Division if your in the market for a memorial tree ;)
[I have a 12yo son who simply loves climbing trees.  If we're at a park with trees &amp; I'm not sure where he is, I know that I just have to walk around looking up in the trees until I find him.  I'm thinking 'tree-climber' would be a dream job for him, at least right now.  What kind of education should he aim for, in order to get that kind of a job?  Do you have a college degree in forestry?  Or, does someone usually just apprentice for a tree-climbing career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kjazg?context=5)|Forestry is a great program... from the right school. But you have to get up in a tree to learn how to do it! On the job training doesnt even begin to describe it lol. 
[What was the job interview like? Did you have to climb trees? Can you post photos of yourself in action?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4kitcj?context=5)|Standard interview really. they wanted to know about my experiences and what i was proficient at. make sure i am actually a climber and i know my way around a tree. otherwise I could become a HUGE liability if i kill myself or..ya know.. drop a tree on the capitol building 
[What technique do you use to climb? DRT? What kind of branch saver do you use? What's the scariest thing that's happened to you while in/near a tree? Thanks :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4knbfo?context=5)|DDRT yes.

Why did it die?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4knk9e?context=5)|Mature transplants rarely make it. there is no chance for it to establish itself, grow the required root system in the new soil and take up the amount of nutrients and water that is required to maintain that amount of wood unfortunately. 
[**where was the job listing posted? Where did you apply for the job?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/t8sfu/iama_tree_climber_for_the_the_capitol_building/c4l573v?context=5)|Www.usajobs.gov.

-------------------------------------
This was my first assignment with Fringe Devision Investigation (also called FDI).  I transferred in from Criminal Investigation and Profiling, hoping that the increase in pay would more than compensate for the rumors of the types of cases this branch dealt with...apparently that was bullshit.  
As per the request of the head director, I am writing this report and immediately removing myself from Fringe duty, stepping into my old position as a profiler.  This story will fill you in as to why my decision was so hastily made.  

April 5, 2009:  I was called to the scene of a homicide, on a mass scale.  There were at least fifteen bodies if not more, all of which were bound by the hands and ankles, a chain was tied to these binds and they were then hung some 12 feet from the ground.  This was, surprisingly, not the weird part.  The strange part was that every one of the bodies had a mark carved into the flesh by some form of a razor blade with a mismatched edge.  The victims had been killed a range of times prior to us being called in:  the earliest was killed almost ten weeks prior, but still looked like a fresh kill...another strange occurrence that would later be explained by the killer's constant use of formaldehyde to keep his victims looking as if they had just been killed.  
After a careful collection of evidence in this crime scene we packed the bodies to the coroner and I went back to the office for some reflection; hoping my team would assist me in this case and take me under their wings.  They did nothing of the sort, instead offering me little advice besides ""look for a lead...""
I made very little progress the first few weeks, noting that the victims had been a range of ages, ethnicities and social levels.  This killer had no real preference to his victims, just that they were killed, bound and suspended in their perfect preservation.  Nothing besides the marks made this killing abnormal, and for weeks I sat there at my desk, trying to find some form of pattern.  
I set out with a partner to talk to the victim's family, friends and acquaintances, all of which had a variety of stories.  Some were unsurprised that the person had died, while others were terrified and sobbed uncontrollably when the news was broken.  After pursuing several dead ends, i finally made a break when my phone rang one afternoon.  
I answered it to hear a horrified voice of a child on the other end, he had called regarding the warehouse we had found the bodies in.  He and a few friends had broken in to smoke a cigarette or some vague ""we're badasses breaking the law at 10"" story, and had instead encountered some rather....unforeseen consequences.  Despite the active crime scene tape, they ventured deep within the complex and were attacked by ""creatures...of sorts...something that hurt Charlie...they scratched him, bit him...""  When the ambulance came to claim the wounded boy(s), they found that one had died, one had become extremely violent and that ""Charlie"" had become withdrawn, responding only to yes or no questions and having nothing more to say then ""I'm fine...""  
The hospital checked this boy out for damage and when the FBI arrived, they requested that he call and tell us about the new development.  
I thanked him for his honesty and told him to keep away from it in the future and that I would go and check it out...but first i had a pit stop to make, to visit this ""Charlie"" kid and see what he had seen.  
My car pulled to a stop in the visitor parking lot of the cities largest hospital.  I entered it and informed the secretary of my intent, she was cooperative and directed me to the boy's room.  When I entered, a kid around 10 years old was sitting in a hospital gown, bandages around his legs, a vacant expression on his youthful face.  His brown eyes stared straight ahead, his short-cropped hair needed a wash, and his face was streaked with dirt...but he looked no worse for wear.  
I told him I was FBI, and asked him to be honest about what had happened...he just sat quietly.  I asked him if he had ventured into the warehouse without permission, he nodded.  I asked him if he knew where he was, he nodded and pointed at the word ""HOSPITAL"" on the wall.  I asked him if he had seen something...abnormal, he nodded again, looking at me with reluctance, before pulling up his sleeve and showing me a fresh-cut mark we had found on the victims; the blood trickled free from the wound, this one cut a lot less precisely than the original victims, though I would assume that the person who had done this one was probably sitting in front of me.  I asked him about it, he shrugged.  I asked him if he had done it...he nodded, holding up a pen dripping with blood.  I called a nurse to keep an eye on him, took a picture of his wound and turned to leave when I heard him speak for the first time:  ""Nothing will stop him you know...he's going to bring them back...""  
""Who?"" I asked.  He smiled silently and said ""The chosen ones..."" 
No more words from him, he rolled over and fell asleep.  I couldn't help but wonder what he meant...but now was a bad time to keep pressing him, so I headed out to my car, knowing my next destination would be the warehouse...

Gravel crunched under my tires as I pulled up in front of the large building.  The grass was tall and the fence was old.  Scattered metal parts covered the premises, the building itself was rusted and in need of a new paint job, something that would have taken a hand of God to complete.  I parked near to the larger entrance, exiting my car and walking towards the door.  The window had been cracked out and the caution tape pulled aside, fucking kids had not only tampered with my crime scene, they KNEW they were entering it when they did!  
I scoffed when I looked at the door handle that had been busted open by a crowbar and left ajar for the world to wander in.
I pulled on the handle and walked through into the semi-dark.  The light poured in from the glass in the ceiling of the main building, but no man-made lights illuminated the arena.  The bodies had been hanging from the low rafters under the third-floor office, and as i approached that area, I remembered noting that the bodies were hung in a circular fashion.  I looked at the ground, the chalk outlines we had left was still present where each body had been hovering.  I looked at them in sheer curiosity, pulling out my notepad and sketching a quick figure.  
From above, the circles that represented the bodies could be dots, each of them bound, tied, throat cut and filled with a preservative before being hung...almost like a sacrifice of sorts....
The circle became a clear happening, this was beyond intentional, it was almost ritualistic.  To be on the safe side, I decided to go around this area for the time being.  I walked across the length of the warehouse, feeling a cold chill down my spine as I did; almost that kind of chill that you get when someone is watching you and doesn't want you there...like an unwelcoming feeling.  
I stopped cold in my tracks and turned back towards the circle, I could swear there was someone...something bound there...I looked into my own sketch, and saw that the killer had made a perfect circle, and was in the process of creating something else...a line or something...perhaps a literal manifestation of a death-gateway?  
I felt extremely uncomfortable and decided to call for an assistant and wait in my car.  
Hours passed before the backup finally arrived.  Jason Upkins, a fucking intern...they didn't even bother sending me an agent, they sent me an intern...a trainee.  This boy was unarmed, so young he had NEVER seen a legitimate case, even a normal one, let alone these FDI ones.  And smelled vaguely of alcohol...I'm pretty sure he had been drinking when they called him in.  
Anyway, we both agreed it was safer to go in together and stick together.  He went first, I held the door as he walked in, allowing it to swing shut after me.  
As it had taken him so long to arrive, the sun was long set and in the transitional phase of twilight to dusk.  The previously well-lit chamber of the warehouse was now drenched in a thick darkness, the friendly sunlight was now replaced with a forbidding darkness; it beckoned to our souls...
He held a flashlight in front of him and led the way, asking stupid questions as he went:  ""Why did you come out here? Kids you say? why were they here?  Mischief makers...I remember when I was 10...what did you do?  Pfftt you are such a daddy's girl, I would have never listened to my parents!""  blah, blah, blah...obviously he had no respect for this crime scene and didn't even notice when his light started to dim.  
I stopped dead...a cold presence filled the room, the temperature had dropped significantly.  I looked around the mostly-dark room for some form of entity, someone, something...but found nothing.  I hissed at Jason to cut his light and he obliged with a slightly mocking, ""I wish I heard you say that in a different context...""  (A comment I would normally file as a complaint...but given the current circumstances, I obviously have to let it slide).  
He wandered forward into the darkness, unaware of the danger I was clearly feeling.  Those boys had definitely stirred up something...but what?  
I felt the eyes of something evil on me, a cold dread filled my heart and I felt my face begin to lose a bit of color....Jason kept walking.  
""Jason...you need to stop..."" My voice echoed into the chamber, but he ignored me, walking around in the darkness that only found interruption in the moonlight.  
He kept going until his hit something solid...something that caused him to scream.  My light flashed over and filled my eyes with terror.  
A human body, elongated and deformed hung from the same rafters that the others had...but something was different about this one...Fresh blood trickled from this man's throat onto the floor, a fresh wound in the midst of a cold body.  The hair had matted itself to the victim's face which was wide-eyed and twisted with fear.  The mouth was gaped open, limbs danged at his sides, the eyes were dark...and familiar...I approached the newest victim and realized I was looking at Charlie...only this wasn't the Charlie I had interviewed hours ago...this would be him if he were 15 years older...I shuttered in sheer terror and felt sick.  I stumbled backwards slightly and fell.  
Jason looked at the body in terror, obviously the realization that a fresh kill meant the killer was still around had set in.  
He looked at me and asked, ""Do you have an extra gun?""  I shook my head and tried to get up...but I felt a force holding me down.
I looked around in the darkness for something, but could not see beyond my light. I again tried to stand, and felt something forcedly push me down.  
I grunted in frustration...""Jason, I cant get up!""  As the words left my mouth a horrifying shriek pierced the room, a roar of pure brutal evil entered the chamber and filled my heart with dread and the knowledge that I was in a fucked up situation.  No firearm, no amount of aid, backup or armor would help us here.  Then I made a terrifying realization...  
""Jason..."" i hissed, ""You're in the circle..."" He looked confused.  ""The bodies...they were arranged...in a circle, and you're in the dead center...with the latest victim...""  He cocked his head to one side and began to ask me a question when I saw his eyes widen in surprise.  
He reached for his throat, as though choking and began to lift off the floor...I scrambled to get to my feet, but was again forced downwards by some force...
""Stop moving, just watch!""  A growling voice entered my mind, I cannot, to this day, shake the feeling of terror that filled my body when that voice spoke....It had no echo, no rebound, just four words that were said with complete conviction and gave me a preview of the terror that was unfolding in front of me.  
Jason was 4 feet from the floor when his back arched, this mouth opened as he gasped for air, none coming in...I watched the flesh tear off of his throat, as though an invisible knife had been dragged across his throat.  Blood spilled forth from the wound as his arms fell limp at their sides...chains that seemed to come from nowhere snaked their way up, like cobras to the charmer's song, gripping his ankles, bounding him quickly...
The voice cackled with laughter, obviously amused with its fine talent for chaotic evil.  I felt the skin peel on my shoulder as I lay there...It was as if something was slicing me open with a razor...the same mark the victims had appeared on my arm...i recoiled in pain as I felt the force lift itself off of me, replaced by the chilling voice:   
""You are free to leave now Nayana, but when your time comes, you will return to your master!""  
I sprinted towards my car, reaching it quickly.  I grabbed the radio and called for help as I heard the echo of a loud demonic roar pierce the sanctity of the free air.  
I collapsed into the drivers seat and awaited debriefing.  
When help arrived, they searched the premises, finding no evidence of Jason or Charlie's bodies.  There was an emptiness to the building that just didn't feel right.  The other agents looked at me oddly when I claimed the creature had scratched me, they claim I was nuts and ignored me...I only sat praying for some form of mercy, hoping the creature that calls himself my ""master"" would never find the time to call on me...oh how wrong I was....

---------------------

Special Agent Nayana ""Ana"" Malhotra is listed as MIA after requesting a transfer back to Criminology and Profiling in Washington DC.  Her request was approved, but come the first day she was to start working, she never showed up.  Jason Upkins, a trainee and intern in Fringe Devision Investigation is also listed as MIA, he was never found dead or alive despite Agent Malhotra's depiction of the events of that night.  Charles ""Charlie"" Pennswood was never officially released from the hospital, though surveillance tapes show him becoming extremely violent before rising from his bed, slightly taller than usual, walking down the halls of the darkened hospital before leaving through the front door...again, no body was recovered.  
This file is currently listed as OPEN and the warehouse was quarantined as incredibly dangerous...It has sense been leveled, though locals claim they hear the occasional ""roar"" or ""shriek"" of sorts coming from the now vacant lot.  It has since been placed under military control and fenced off to prevent any civilian from mistakenly entering the area. "

tbmcw,6,2012-05-07,"3rd year and burned out, sick of school... what are the options?",[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tbmcw/3rd_year_and_burned_out_sick_of_school_what_are/,"After hearing for years about how most people who drop out of college do so after only a semester or two, I'm finding myself in the opposite situation. I busted my ass working hard and getting good grades for my first two years, my lightest term so far was more credits than some people take in their heaviest terms, and I'm working two jobs as well because I really want to get out of here without a whole lot of debt. 


I've been doing a ridiculous amount of school and work, and I've also been leading two student groups, but up until now I've somehow had the motivation and enthusiasm to be able to pull it all off. But over the past couple of weeks, I've started to think about things and realize how phenomenally stupid the entire situation is. I'm constantly running around doing things for other people, because I tend to base my self-worth on others' opinions of me, and I'd hate myself for letting everyone down if I quit any of the jobs or clubs. 


The main thing I used to motivate myself to do well in my first two years of boring prerequisite courses was the promise of interesting, technical courses for my final two years, and an interesting job after that. But now that I'm finally in those ""interesting"" courses and have a job very similar to what I'll probably end up in for my career, I've found out that the stupid boring classes are a much better representation of how a job in this field will be, and the ""interesting"" classes are crippled by the lowest common denominator of my unintelligent peers, to the point where I learn far more by ignoring the professor completely and reading Reddit and Hacker News. 


Now my grades are starting to suffer, because I'm not putting in the time that the professors seem to want me to, and I'm preoccupied with the idea of finding some way out. I don't know if they'd let me back if I took a gap year, and I'll have no time for vacation this summer because I have a really ""good"" internship, which I'm afraid is only going to cement my negative opinions of my field more thoroughly. I've gotten enough scholarships through the years that I could combine my internship salary and savings and pay off what few loans I have if I dropped out of college after this term, but I have no idea what I'd do then. 


I'm starting to think that majoring in the field that I enjoy (computer science) was one of the dumbest decisions I've ever made, because school and work are starting to ruin coding for me. 


Redditors, have you been here? How did you get out, and what advice did you wish you'd known when you were where I am now? 


tl;dr: Burned out on school because the ""rewards"" for putting up with stupid shit turn out to be just more of the same stupidity. Seeking wisdom from others who've been there too."
tbfkm,90,2012-05-07,"So, I used to have faith in humanity. Then I had an internship at IBM when I was 16-17.",aveilleux,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tbfkm/so_i_used_to_have_faith_in_humanity_then_i_had_an/,"First off: anyone who's ever been a teenager and absolutely blown their parents/teachers/whatever away with tech knowledge will know exactly what I'm going to talk about. You know: ""I've been working with computers since before you were born, so I *obviously* know more than you!""

It was very difficult when I had an internship at IBM (I was 16-17 at the time) because I was a lab technician, which means I did a shit-ton of troubleshooting on the Windows and Linux servers (a few AIX, HP/UX, and Solaris servers thrown in for good measure). The developers (bless their little 40-60-year-old hearts) knew next to nothing about the proper usage of Windows and absolutely nothing about hardware.

I once had a guy email me instructions on how to reset a token ring LAN because the network was down. (Yeah, I didn't get that email until after the network issues were resolved... he was a clever one.) IBM hasn't used token ring LANs for decades.

A very common theme was a shortcut to My Computer, My Documents and Internet Explorer (needed for testing, be quiet) rather than the actual system icons on the desktop.

Another time a developer complained he couldn't find the Start menu. He was VNC'd into a Red Hat machine ಠ_ಠ

Though this still tops everything: the lab I worked in (Lotus QE test lab 2) houses approximately 750 servers. These are wired into switches, one at the end of every row, which are then wired into a massive switch running along one wall. (That switch is then fiber-linked to whatever ISP IBM uses.) The wires run along rails on the ceiling before coming down to their ports on the wall. It's all very neat and organized... until *developers* come along and mess with the cables. We have hostnames assigned by MAC address, but we have to manually refresh the system (security reasons, I guess?) every time a server is disconnected from one ethernet port and plugged into another. Right after determining that the server is turned on and plugged into the network, it became habit to check the wall of cables and make sure each one corresponded with the correct port.

This happened every. Single. Day.

For *eighteen months*.

I could go on, but I think I'll stop here. Maybe later (once I remember them) I'll tell some of my lucky break stories."

The problem that I have with these opportunities is that the employers ask that I work on the site from home on my own (No help from someone with greater experience that currently maintains the site, nor another intern to partner up with). When I signed up to work for these companies, I came in assuming that I would be working under someone who has been working with the site for a while and could teach me more about web design in general.

A few questions for you all:

* Should I take the job and teach myself how to master the site on my own over the summer? 

* Should I request to have a mentor or someone else to guide me through the stages of building the site? 

* Should I just forget it and look for jobs outside of Web Design/Development?

Its great for what it's supposed to do but it doesn't have the most intuitive interface and features. I'm an intern in the DataCenter with a STRONG background in programming. I was talking to some of our SAs and they expressed that there seems to be a serious gap between the different monitoring solutions. For instance, ServersAlive costs $200/yr and works well but doesn't have all the features we want. A year ago we almost went with a $100,000 Quest Foglight solution but decided the money could be better spent elsewhere. I'm looking at developing a solution on my own time which will satisfy the needs of organizations which need to monitor a large number of servers but don't need to spend tens of thousands of dollars implementing a monitoring solution.

So, I ask this: What types of features are you looking for in a monitoring solution? If possible please rate them on level of necessity (IE something nice to have, or must have). What types of things are important? What OS it runs on? Monitoring from multiple points on the network? How important is support for a solution like this? Will email support with &lt;12hr turnaround suffice? What types of systems are you looking to track (ping/db connectivity/service status/etc)?

I know it doesn't seem like much but should I finish my work and am happy with the solution, anyone who provides reasonably valuable feedback in this thread will have the opportunity to run the solution for free.

[Women's tennis might be more popular than men's. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lken4?context=5)|It's not, but it's very popular just like men's tennis. I just covered the Audi Melbourne Pro Tennis Classic and there was a surprisingly huge turnout. We're talking mid-ranked professional women's tennis. Biggest names there were Grace Min and Melanie Oudin. 
[I've heard there's actually a player cap for WNBA of ~$100k/year, and that the NBA pays out the rear to subsidize the WNBA.  Are you aware of this, and if its true, what are your thoughts about whether the absurdly low salaries hurt the sport.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmg4k?context=5)|I am. I know the NBA loses money every year with the WNBA. It's kind of sad. Unfortunately, I don't think women's baksetball is entertaining enough to make a profit here in the US.
[Personally, I agree about the entertainment aspect, I was just curious as to whether you thought higher salaries could draw more entertaining talent.  I'm not sure I could name a WNBA player since Swoopes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ln0vz?context=5)|I think they already draw all of the entertaining talent. All of the top NCAA women's players go on to play for the WNBA. Maya Moore, anyone? 
[How many female sports do you report?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhaqn?context=5)|I appreciate the sarcasm. But to answer: None, really. Unless if you consider NASCAR to be a female sport. Danica gets a lot of coverage.
[Yeah, but she's a really shitty stock car driver.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhjfg?context=5)|Agreed.
[Upvotes for hearing a sports reporter that doesn't just adore everything Danica Patrick does.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkeal?context=5)|Hahahahaha I think most reporters can't stand the attention she gets.
[I imagine your job would consist of constantly being hit on. Anyone we know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lh9rm?context=5)|It happens (getting hit on), and it's annoying. I'm there to do my job and I love sports just as much as every other reporter covering it. Most athletes I cover get to know me personally and they don't normally hit on me. The athletes who do are usually from a visiting team.  I mostly get heckled from the fans. I understand, they're probably wasted anyways. So I just ignore them. I was sexually harassed by a mascot once.
 |Also: I was told by a female mentor - who is a well-known ESPN reporter - to wear a fake engagement ring to prevent myself from being hit on. I didn't, because I just thought wearing a pretend engagement ring was weird. I dunno. Anyways, fast forward a year...I get engaged. It doesn't prevent anything. It makes things worse. It's a target on my back. Haha.
[You got harassed by a mascot? I guess you're not a furry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhc9w?context=5)|It wasn't a furry mascot!! It was a Knightro: [Link to centric.cos.ucf.edu](http://centric.cos.ucf.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IMG_9910_-Rebekah-Kubik.jpg)
 |The reason why I say ""a"" Knightro is because about 10 people dress up as Knightro for UCF. So, yeah.
 |That was a few years back. Good times.
[I'm guessing it's Erin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkzgn?context=5)|It's not. I'm not a huge fan of EA's, to be honest. I think she's more in it for the celebrity aspect.
[Aw, you didn't answer the 'anyone we know bit'!  Good on you, BTW. in Australia we have had a few women making inroads into sport commentary, reporting and even as referees for the more macho sports. It's a nice change from the usual style.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhe2z?context=5)|You mean, you don't know who Knightro is?!
[UCF student here, that is hilarious. GO Knights!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m8rsk?context=5)|Go Knights!
[I can see where you might think that, over the years, she's become more ""glamorous"" and such, but when she started out, she was very sweet and nice.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll2gz?context=5)|Put it this way: I used to idolize her until I found out who she really is.
[Is it a Pokemon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhjfv?context=5)|HA.
[What qualities were needed for the job (except looking pretty, I guess that good looks is important for television\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhed?context=5)|Being comfortable in any situation and being comfortable on camera. I don't think it's about good looks. I've seen plenty of ugly TV reporters. I think it's more about how you present yourself.
[Have you always been interested in sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhed?context=5)|I've always lived and breathed sports. Was always a tomboy growing up. Sports are a big part of my life. Can't imagine life without them.
[Do you have a go to question to try and break the ice when interviewing somebody new?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4limf5?context=5)|I like to ask a few icebreaker questions before, and I keep a few interesting questions in my back pocket. If I feel that the interview is going well, I'll break out an interesting question.
[Most hilarious on-air blooper (if any?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhbts?context=5)|Haven't had one on-air, thank goodness. I've had a lot of off-air moments like: ""Shit, my mic isn't clipped right. Are you taping this? Stop focusing on my boobs, camera guy!""
[Biggest sports celebrity you've interviewed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhc5k?context=5)|Michael Jordan. If you would have told me when I was 8 years old that I was going to interview Michael Jordan, I would have died. He was a hero growing up.
[Biggest sports celebrity who has hit on you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhc5k?context=5)|In terms of biggest name who has hit on me: It's usually the practice squad guys or guys in college. Famous athletes usually aren't pigs with reporters, because they're smart enough to know not to mess with us because we'll write a story on them. 
[Oh My God, Michael Jordan! Did you ask anything about Space Jam?!!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhfdc?context=5)|I did, actually. I asked if a Part 2 was coming out and if Marcus and Jeffrey (his sons) were going to be in it. He wasn't amused. The reporters around me were. 
[I've heard he's not the nicest guy. Confirm or deny?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lito6?context=5)|Wasn't a jerk, but didn't exactly come off to me as good guy Greg. 
[Are you an avid reddit user?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkt5m?context=5)|Reddit is my homepage. 
[Also, do you like hockey - which I might add is the most kick ass sport there is ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkt5m?context=5)|I enjoy watching live hockey, but I'm not an NHL fan. I'll cover it if I have to. But I don't cover hockey. It's not popular.
[*Thx for the honest AMA though*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll4l0?context=5)|And thanks for the question! This is fun!
[You should move  to Canada then.. eh?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lr5o5?context=5)|No.
[What was on Link to www.wwjnd.com ? It's linked from you Twitter but there is nothing up there, seems to give out ""expired website"" kind of error.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhlwb?context=5)|WWJND.com was an NFL gossip blog/website that Fox Sports acquired from me as a parter-type venture. I had a one-year contract with them. Within that year I was hired at my current position. I couldn't keep the site because of a COI. So now it's no longer in existence. I should remove that link. Thanks for reminding me :)
[Any interest in motorsports? Being american I would assume NASCAR, Indy etc, do you follow those? How about more European series, like Formula1, WRC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhlwb?context=5)|I've grown to love NASCAR. That's all I really cover though.
[Do you think that they hired you because you were a girl or because you are good at what you're doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhd7f?context=5)|I'd like to think that I got hired because I'm good at what I do.
 |I realize that being a female in this industry is going to make me a little more noticeable. But when it all comes down to it: I've had a passion for sports for as long as I could remember. This is my lifelong dream and I'm fulfilling it.
[Hate to break it to you honey but you're not there for your reporting skills.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lisha?context=5)|I'm sorry you feel that way!
[I've read through a bit of questions and noticed you like football. What team do you root for in the NFL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhrdt?context=5)|I grew up rooting for the Jets and still deep down inside am a die-hard fan.
 |Please don't hate me.
 |I'd like to think my bias doesn't show. I'm realistic about teams I dislike. For example, my AFCE prediction: I think the Patriots win the division this year by a landslide. Jets in second and squeak in the playoffs with a 9-7 record. Dolphins and Bills with 4-6 wins, 3rd and 4th.
[I would say you are actually optimistic about teams that you dislike.  I assume you dislike my team, the Miami Dolphins, because there is no way we win 4 games this year!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnlbv?context=5)|Whenever the Dolphins are bad (which they will be this year), they always lose a whole bunch and then win the games they need to lose at the end of the season to obtain the No. 1 draft pick. It's pretty sad....but I don't mind at all!
[Yep, it really pisses me off to know that we could have had Luck or RG3 instead of Tannehill!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lns9j?context=5)|Honestly, I had Tannehill as a 2nd or 3rd round pick before the combine. People forget he was a WR in college and needs a ton of work. He's the type that needs to sit out for a few years and learn. Now..who's to say he can't do that under Matt Moore? Problem is, he won't. The Dolphins drafted him to play immediately. 
[It was a very stupid decision to pick him IMO.  He will probably be no better than Matt Moore and no offense to him but what can he learn from Matt Moore?  While we are at it, what can he learn from David Garrard?  How Ireland hasn't been fired yet is beyond me.  What does the guy know on Stephen Ross?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnywt?context=5)|I think if the Dolphins start Matt Moore, they'll go 7-9. Ryan Tannehill: 4-12.
[Looks accurate, Matt Moore is definitely our best option at QB for now!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lsmbv?context=5)|For now. But I don't think Tannehill is the answer either. Prediction: Huge bust.
[Do you know the offside rule in soccer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhiem?context=5)|Why, yes. Yes I do.
[Have you seen Brett Favre's dick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhags?context=5)|On Deadspin. 
[Fair enough. What is your favorite sport to cover? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhckz?context=5)|Football, without a question. I used to hate NASCAR, but now I've grown to love it after covering the Daytona 500. Love college basketball.
[Which sport has more rowdy fans (*drunk annoying aholes*\) - football or nascar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkrj6?context=5)|College football fans. By far.
 |I've only dealt with NASCAR fans on the inner circle of the track. Those are the classy ones. 
[Are male reporters allowed to go in the locker rooms of female athletes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li4uv?context=5)|I'm not sure. I don't really cover women's sports. Out of respect, I don't usually go into the locker room. In some instances, I have to because that's the only opportunity I have to get an interview. In that case, I bring a binder or something to cover my eyes. Haha.
[Personally, I have never understood why it was necessary to go into the locker room after a game.  Would you want someone with a camera near you after a shower?  I wouldn't.  I'm surprised leagues and the athletes themselves are OK with this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9nve?context=5)|I'm not a big fan of it, and I try to avoid entering as much as possible. I'll only go in the locker room if it's an absolute must. I've noticed I have to go in the locker room more often when I'm covering the MLB. Some athletes purposely swing their dicks around. It's really immature and annoying.
[Hey there! As an avid sports fan myself I can't help but be happy for you! But to the questions!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|That's awesome! Thanks so much for reading and feel free to follow my work on twitter. 
[What courses did you take to get into sports reporting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|I was a journalism major in college, but I never took any specific ""Sports Reporting"" class. I've always been into sports - basically since I could walk - for as long as I could remember. I wanted to be a professional athlete growing up but I realized in high school that I couldn't make a living off of that (being a female) but I could still work in sports if I utilize my talents in other ways. 
[Top 5 PG's in the NBA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|The PG position has changed so much over the years in the NBA. Now, the top PGs are technically forwards who play the point position. Point forwards. So I'll give you my top true PGs: Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Derrick Rose, Deron Williams, Ricky Rubio (as long as he stays healthy he can change the NBA).
[I hope you take the time to respond to this and even if you don't, thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxfs9?context=5)|Feel free to ask more!
[Awesome! Thanks for the reply. I'm going to transfer and change my major and I thought that since I love sports I might as well pursue it right? So thanks for the info.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxj39?context=5)|I was thinking Nash, but I'm thinking as far as who will be the top 5 PGs next season. I think Rubio will be on that list.
[Being stuck in the middle of nowhere Montana, I was thinking Missoula. I have a friend that is majoring in Journalism there and she says they're good. But due to my lack of being anywhere it's essentially my best bet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxl88?context=5)|Being in a small market can be a good thing. I went to college in Orlando, Fla., so it was a little tougher to break into because that's a top 25 media market. My news organization is based in Melbourne, Fla., a much smaller city but still big enough to get my name out there.
 |Start small, but make a name for yourself where you're at so the people there don't forget you! If you become a reliable reporter about topics people care about, locals will love you. I can't tell you how many times I get thanked by parents for doing a report on local high school playoffs. Local news is important.
[Good to hear! Thanks for all your advice here and for doing this great AMA. I can't wait to get started!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lxokm?context=5)|Best of luck to you with your future endeavors. 
[BtW as an aspiring journalist I did really enjoy reading through your AmA, even if I've missed the party.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lv1aj?context=5)|If you have any questions feel free to ask! I love talking to aspiring journalists and I enjoy guest lecturing at journalism schools. It's my thing, I guess.
[Has the advent of social media prompted reporters to cover different stories (read: gossip\), ones that may have never otherwise been reported?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li3tn?context=5)|As for social media, yes, I think it does force reporters to cover gossip-type stuff more. I don't mind it. I used to have an NFL gossip blog called WWJND. But a lot of other reporters do.
[Have you ever worked with Erin Andrews/hung out with her at a game? Has she ever given you any good advice? What advice would you give to a college student who is interested in this work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll2fo?context=5)|I've worked at the same game with her a couple of times. She basically ignores all other reporters, male or female. Unless if she works with them.
 |True story: During a basketball game, while the game is going on...EA whips out her makeup bag and starts reapplying lipgloss and bronzer. This is why women in sports aren't taken seriously, Erin. Go do that in the bathroom.
 |Another story: After a basketball game at UF, she goes to take a picture with the Gators Dazzlers dance team. I heard her say: ""I know how it's like to be one of you girls. I used to be a Dazzler too. I know how cool it is to take your pictures with celebrities and stuff.""
 |Now, I hope she was being sarcastic. But I really don't think she was. Like I've said before, I feel like EA is in it for the celebrity. My favorite TV personality is Michelle Beadle.
 |Advice: Get involved at your campus paper or tv station and work your butt off. Always have a copy of your resume on hand.
[I've always expected her to be a nice girl who will talk to the fans, guess not. I can see her being like that with the make up though, I feel like she always wants to look her best but it's dumb to do that in front of everyone. Thanks for the advice though!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmi59?context=5)|She'll talk to the fans and sign autographs. She's a celebrity. 
[That she is, and she's pretty good at her job. So another question, what's the biggest game you've ever been at for a report (college and professional\) for football and basketball?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lovg4?context=5)|Haven't covered a Super Bowl yet, but I will when it comes to Florida. I've covered the NCAA March Madness tourney. Covered a few collegiate bowl games..Liberty Bowl, St. Pete Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Capital One Bowl.
[Being at the Super Bowl for a report would be just mind blowing. Considering you'd get a field pass. Do you usually?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lpglo?context=5)|Yes. But I'm not there the entire game. With football games, I sit in the press box for quarters 1-3. 4th quarter I'm on the field. Reporters can't be on the field the entire game or it would crowd the sidelines. That's why there's only one or two sideline reporters, and they work for the network providing TV coverage (I.e. ESPN, CBS, ABC, NBC).
 |I like being up in the press box. It lets me see the game from the best seat in the house. That way, I know what I'm talking about when I tape a post-game report from the field. 
[Do you notice that a large percentage of the population is not interested in sports? Esp compared to the interest level of 20 years ago. For example,  what percent of the population know who the best batter or pitcher is in the major leagues? Accepting the premise, why the lack of interest in sports today? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li8d2?context=5)|I don't really see that at all, to be honest. Just because baseball isn't the No. 1 sport any more doesn't mean people aren't interested in sports. It just means that people are interested in different sports, like the NFL and the NBA.
[Are you in any fantasy football leagues, and does being a reporter give you a really good ability to predict wins/losses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llk16?context=5)|Thanks! I love AMA's on reddit, and I was really bored and awake at 6 a.m. for some reason. I noticed no one in my profession had done an AMA, so I went ahead and did it.
[Because of inside info or general sports expertise, like a meteorologist predicting weather?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llk16?context=5)|I usually keep about 3 fantasy football teams per year. I think being a reporter helps because you're really informed. But I don't think we have an edge because of inside information. Unless if your name is Adam Schefter.
[Also, do you like the tv show ""The League""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llk16?context=5)|I don't really get to watch a lot of TV. So no. My friends who watch it tell me that I'll love it. So I'll have to check it out to see if it's on Netflix or something.
[Seriously, I have no interest in sports whatsoever, but this AMA is fascinating.  You're great at this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnsft?context=5)|For real?! That's awesome! I'm happy to keep you entertained. Thanks for reading.
[Definitely on Netflix. I love it! Thanks for answering. 3 Fantasy football teams seems like an incredible feat!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmwq5?context=5)|Just watched the first episode. I'm hooked. Thanks for the recommendation. 
[What, if anything, do you think about Roger Federer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhox6?context=5)|He might be the GOAT. To those to who say he's done, I laugh.
[Which do you prefer, American football, or football?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhfod?context=5)|American. But don't get me wrong: I do love me some soccer/futbol/calcio. I just don't cover any major soccer on a regular basis.
[I have a tendency to be annoyed by the voice of a female sports reporter. I searched up some of your work and you actually sound like you know what you're talking about. Question is, would you ever like to be a commentator for say, ESPN?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lio28?context=5)|Wow, thank you so much. That really means a lot.
 |I'd love to work for ESPN, or any other major sporting news outlet. But I don't want to be Erin Andrews. I'm not in this for the fame. I want to make a living doing what I love.
[Former aspiring female sports journalist here. Why the hate for Erin Andrews? She may be completely gorgeous, but she's also a graduate of one of the best journalism schools in the country (also my alma mater\), and she damned sure knows her sports and has an amazing on-air personality. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lmjae?context=5)|I agree that UF has an amazing journalism school. I actually got to check it out a few months ago at a regional SPJ conference. Beautiful, brand-new facilities.
 |I used to idolize Erin Andrews until I found out who she really is. I know she knows her sports and is good on-camera. No hate on her for that. But I feel like she's changed over the years. She's transformed into a celebrity. She has endorsement deals. She was on Dancing with the Stars. It's crazy. I feel like she's in it for the celebrity. It's hard to take her seriously.
 |Also...why former?
[Do you ever cover the NHL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4liu1j?context=5)|I don't. Different world down here in Florida. Not a lot of NHL popularity. Down here it's football, then college football, then NASCAR with some college basketball, NBA and MLB sprinkled in. 
[Is wearing low cut shirts a must for TV personalities? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhuur?context=5)|Haha, no. It does seem that way, though.
[Just curious, what's it like to be in the media department? Well for sports anyway. Enjoy your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhkt3?context=5)|I love my job. It's interesting to get to view sports from an insider's perspective. There's a lot that goes on. The best moments at my job are not moments that come from games. It's the stuff behind the scenes.
 |Like when George O'Leary drove me to my car in his sweet golf cart after interviewing him. I'm pretty sure he was drunk. Best. Thing. Ever.
[How was he?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lho7d?context=5)|A lot of people try to paint GOL as a bad guy. I don't think that at all. He means well. He's old school. I almost feel bad for him.
[With all of the concussion-related deaths of former NFL players, how long do you see the league lasting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li94g?context=5)|Forever. But I think the NFL will have to pay up in a lawsuit. 
[Bless you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhpuc?context=5)|Silly. I know what you were trying to ask.
[Do you see yourself doing what you do now for the rest of your life or do you have different aspirations than reporting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhpvw?context=5)|I wish I could do this forever. However, how many female sports reporters do you see over the age of 50? Not many. I just want to make a living doing what I love. That's what I do now. It would be nice to deliver sports news to the largest audience possible. That's the goal. I know that TV reporting is short-lived, though. I may go into teaching when I'm older. Would love to teach journalism.
[Suzy Kolber!  Little stretch though, she's 47.  Maybe Joe Namath will try to kiss you too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9ltt?context=5)|If Joe Namath tried to kiss me. I'd drop the mic and run off.
 |With Joe Namath.
[Do you do your broadcasts while the food is cooking? I guess I don't understand... Maybe while you're cooking food you could do like a sports show/cooking show. Not really sure who would want to watch that though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ll6to?context=5)|AHHHHH HE MADE A FUNNY!!!! Surprised it took this long for a kitchen joke.
[How many times a day do you hear from a player, ""we're going to take it one game at a time?"" or any variation of this stock answer?  Unless something wild and unexpected happens, I imagine reporting sports would get very dull after the thrill of meeting celebrities wears off.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lk2q5?context=5)|I hear it a lot. But it's on the reporter to craft a question in a way to force the subject to answer as creatively as possible. I always ask two-part questions and ask them to elaborate. I might piss off some people, but I have to do my job too.
[You've said you don't really cover women's sports, but that you were very much into playing sports growing up. Who would be your ""top 3"" wish list of women in sport that you'd interview if you could (regardless of whether they're alive now\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhs9l?context=5)|That's a really good question. Abby Wambach, Kerri Strug and Mia Hamm.
 |I interviewed Danica. She was pretty dry. Michelle Akers was awesome. 
[Also: dog person, cat person, or other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhwmh?context=5)|Dog person. Why is this such a big deal on here?
[Did you do any print stuff, or are you only on tv?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhgjm?context=5)|I used to do print stuff. But right now, I'm mainly web and TV. Sometimes my columns will run in print. But I'd say 80% web and TV.
[Ever talked with/interviewed Mark Martin? When I followed NASCAR, he was always my favorite driver.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4li8hd?context=5)|Mark Martin is a cool guy. Never ages, I feel like. Always very friendly to reporters. He's a veteran.
[Oh and any good stories about any Lakers (past or present\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhj7?context=5)|Nothing too crazy, because I don't really cover them. Saw Metta World Peace when he was Ron Artest at a night club in downtown Orlando after they played the Magic. It was him, his posse, and a bunch of groupies all up in the VIP. Typical NBA.
[Who is your favorite reporter to read/watch/listen to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhhf5?context=5)|Well, my favorite writer/reporter is Jane McManus of ESPN. She's a mentor of mine and she does some great work.
 |My favorite TV personality is Michelle Beadle. Love how she's the anti-Erin Andrews. And she's not afraid to hide it.
[Also, go 'Canes. ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lic9i?context=5)|Awwwww come on!
[Do you cover the Magic? What's your take on the Van Gundy/Howard situation? I'm pretty sure Stan is gone, but I think they should trade Howard as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhj4f?context=5)|I do. I think Howard is driving Van Gundy out of Orlando and will use that as leverage to try and stay to get a huge deal. He won't stay though, because Dwight is a psycho selfish douche. Did you see this press conference? [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y08gvGpGCwA)
 |Translation: The Magic are screwed. No Van Gundy next year. No Dwight after that. It's a shitty situation. It's sad that the Amway is going to become a big, fancy paperweight downtown. Ryan Anderson is going to be the Magic's biggest name after Dwight leaves.
[Were you at that press conference?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ljcz5?context=5)|I wish I was, but no.
[Favourite soccer team?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lk5cr?context=5)|Grew up watching Juve. Still do. I'm glad they're doing well this year. 
[Ever cover tiger woods? (or did he cover you?\) j/k..  Seriously tho, golf, do you get to cover it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ljgn0?context=5)|I have covered golf (and Tiger Woods). First time I met him was at Bay Hill...his first year back from the crazy scandal that happened. He was very polite and cordial to all of the reporters. Supposedly he treats media differently now. I heard he used to be a jerk.
[What did you major in? Did you do any internships beforehand? Do you report all sports?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4litps?context=5)|I majored in journalism. I was an intern for Scout.com / Fox sports and worked for my campus newspaper. All that good stuff.
 |Most sports. I report what's popular in my market. NHL, for example, is not popular so I don't really do anything with hockey.
[That's nice, I'm really interested in pursuing the same field. How does the communications degree differ with the journalism degree in this field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ln1kc?context=5)|I'm a little biased, but I think journalism majors are more well-rounded because we can write and report stories. Communications majors know how to read off a teleprompter. 
[That's a nice factor for me to look into, thanks! Do you think a major in one of them and a minor in the other is a good idea or not necessary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4ln4c9?context=5)|It's not really necessary, and usually they're in the same ""college"" so all of the pre-req courses are the same. 
[You mentioned that you've interviewed Tiger Woods.  What other golfers have you interviewed, and what were they like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9r6q?context=5)|Got to talk to Arnold Palmer at Bay Hill. What a sweet, old man. I just wanted to hug him. Dustin Johnson was pretty cool. Those were the only other guys who I've gotten to do a one-on-one with. Everyone else I've interviewed, including Tiger, was in a group-type setting. No one really came off as a jerk.
[Also, what is your handicap?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4m9r6q?context=5)|As for me...I normally shoot anywhere from a 90-95 from the whites. I refuse to play from the red ladies' tees. Best round ever was an 88 at TPC Sawgrass. 
[If you could get a less than appropriate ""pic"" \[insert favre joke here\] sent to you from anyone in the sports world who would it be and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lkbfp?context=5)|Not to sound lame or anything, but no one. I don't get my jollies from that. Unless if it's Tim Tebow. Then I know that'll be a huge story.
 |AMIRITE?
[Do you play any sports/have a competitive background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lhdry?context=5)|I played softball and basketball in high school. Was going to play softball in college. I blew out my ankle my senior year, and that was that.
[What's your opinion on soccer in general? MLS, EPL, whatever. Do you think it'll ever get the respect it's fans(me included\) think it deserves in America?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lj2i2?context=5)|I would hope so, but it would take some time. ESPN and all the other major sporting networks need to do a better job showing more games. The World Cup catches on. Why can't pro soccer in general?
[Do reporters sleep with athletes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4lnkph?context=5)|I don't know any. Such a funny, common assumption. 
[Have you ever noticed the sexist treatment dana jacobson gets on first take? especially from that asshat jay crawford?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tcqb4/i_am_a_female_sports_reporter_ama/c4llrlt?context=5)|I see it. It happens. She takes it all in stride though. Good for her.

But now it is really starting to get in the way of my learning, and I hate it because what I am studying is something that I am really passionate about. I want to learn as much as I can, to exchange interesting idea, and work on exciting projects, but SA is making it so difficult.

I don't talk to anyone in my classes. In the two years of university, I've been to a professors office hours once, and only after spending an hour 'getting ready' to do it. If I have a question, I just either figure it out on my own or ignore it. None of my professors know me, so it was impossible to get letters of recommendations for the summer research projects I was applying for.

I've tried getting involved in clubs, but after the first general meeting when there a few dozen people that I can hide behind, I can't get the courage to show up. My email inbox just ends up being filled with information about clubs that I've only been to one meeting for.

I even tried going to my school's career fair to get a summer internship, but I ended up awkwardly avoiding all but a couple potential  employers.

I finally forced myself to email a professor about working in his lab over the summer, and I am meeting with him tomorrow. I am fucking terrified, and I don't even know why.

Anyways, that's my rant for the day."

Excluding the days when I have an event to cover somewhere in town, I would say that I spend, at an absolute minimum, 6 of those 8 hours on reddit. I am not happy about this. This does feel good. 

I have plunged to the James Cameron-like depths of this site, innumerable pages from the front, and I have felt my face go limp in the process. It's a wonder I can even move my hands to click the mouse, lethargic and bored as I am. Sometimes I think I'm dead and that the afterlife is reddit, inane and without purpose, crowded to the walls with eternal computer terminals.

I was struggling and stressing out, then I heard a moan from the girl behind me and she started to have a violent seizure and bleed pretty heavily from the mouth. Now, I had planned on going to med school right up until my senior year in high school.  I have worked in the ER, and even been in a couple surgeries during an internship program so I have seen some scary things but for some reason this freaked me out more than usual.  There were a lot of people in the room and although there were a few people that rushed up to help her I somehow did not.  I knew exactly what to do when someone has a seizure (lay them on their side and put a wallet in their mouth..etc).  After paramedics had been called and she was conscious I had to get up and walk around because I felt sick to the stomach and pretty dizzy.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you believe in god? If you do, is it because of your parents teachings or did you come to worship him on your own terms? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1ont?context=5)|When I did believe in God, it was 100% because of the environment I was raised in. As soon as I began to question beliefs, it was a slow movement away from that.
 |In my opinion, you cannot arrive logically at the conclusion that there is a God. Those who ""know"" there is a God are either indoctrinated, or have received a personal revelation from him. Of course you can simply ""choose"" to believe in God if you wish, but that's pretty meaningless for various reasons, the primary one being that Christianity requires some pretty radical stuff from you, which you wont be capable of unless you are either really good at deceiving yourself, or actually know there is a God. That's why so many Christians are fake. I have seen a few real Christians, but cannot tell if they are actually sure of a God or simply masters at deceiving themselves.
[Thanks for the AMA.  What are your thoughts about proselytizing?  I come from a so-called third world country, and frankly, the idea of missionaries coming into my country and uprooting tradition that has existed for thousands of years (yes, before the bible, and yes, not to be combative, even older than 6000 years\) is ... well, disgusting.  What is your stance on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m969d?context=5)|Well Jesus gave his disciples the ""great commission"" where he basically commands everyone to convert everyone else. So as a Christian, there's no way to escape from this (except for those who believes that all the saved people have been pre-selected by God and there is nothing we can do about it).  Also, I do know that many people who are evangelized do not share your opinion. My dad is very involved in Africa, mostly the Congo (he goes there every summer). And he has assisted in training pastors and stuff there, and the growth has been absolutely *explosive* in the Congo. They are grateful on a level you wouldn't believe. Generally, evangelized people in third world countries tend to be more open to Christianity and tend to be more legitimate practitioners of Christianity (IE, there are less fake people) than in the US or other first world countries.
[Why can't more Christians follow the ""live and let live"" policy?  Are they really so worried about my soul?  I'm not sure I understand the rationale behind why saving other people is so important.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m969d?context=5)|I think genuine Christians do it more because Jesus commanded them too, but I'm sure some actually do have legitimate concern for you.
[Have you taken a look at deism?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5w00?context=5)|Briefly, but to me it's a little irrelevant. I'm looking for an end-all purpose in life, not so much a curiosity in how the world came to be.
 |If there is a God, I'll do whatever the hell he says. If not, I'm just going to have as much enjoyment as I can without regard to much else. If there is a God who doesn't care, then I'm still gonna do the latter.
[*Without an absolute being dictating morality, morality is whatever we, as a society, choose it to be.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|I'm familiar with Cultural Relativism, and I have read Rachels and am familiar with him as well.
[FWIW, you don't need God to arrive at an absolute morality. What you are arguing is for cultural relativism, and there are philosophical arguments against it. You should check Rachels' ""The Challenge of Cultural Relativism.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|Please note however, a successful argument against cultural relativism is not equivalent to a successful argument FOR absolute morality. There are other forms of relativism as well.
[I. Different cultures have different, often contradictory morals. II. Therefore we cannot establish an absolute moral code because morality is relevant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|Furthermore, cultural relativism isn't an ethical theory at all.
[ of all, (II\) does not necessarily logically follow from (I\). Some could have gotten it wrong.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|Cultural relativism states morality is relative to cultures. True. Fact. Ethical relativism states morality SHOULD be relative to cultures. Debatable.
[ finally, CR is unpalatable, because if we accept it, we have no basis to judge any culture's moral code, including those from our own history. Thus we cannot say that we as a society have improved by ending slavery, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8t2l?context=5)|All in all though, that's still irrelevant largely to the subject of absolute morality.
[Thanks for pointing out that distinction, although Rachels himself conflates those two terms.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9b67?context=5)|Not a fan of utilitarianism (although the concept is interesting), but Kantian ethics is pretty awesome. The main idea that Kant brings up is very golden-rule-esque, stating that we ought to act in a way whereby that action became a universal law. So it's still very much dependent on a personal basis, I think. I'm only knowledgeable about philosophy at a general level though, so you may be right.
[Aside from that, there are still ethical systems in philosophy that strive for an absolute morality, such as utilitarianism and Kantian ethics. All without recourse to a man in the sky telling you what to do!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9b67?context=5)|I'm not sure if there was a cut and dry moment. I think I've always had some amount of doubt that I recognized, but I slowly moved towards a progression of realizing all my evidence and reasoning for God was based on what other people told me, and as soon as I realized that, I immediately knew that wasn't acceptable. I still believed God existed, just thought I would have to backtrack and discover him myself. After all - thousands of friends I knew and trusted had come to that conclusion.
[Unrelated, but what would you say was the first instance that made you doubt the existence of God?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9b67?context=5)|Then after several years I realized I was as intelligent, if not more intelligent, than most, and that I wasn't coming up with any evidence for God, therefore these other people were either having a personal encounter I had missed, or they were deluding themselves.
[Do they believe blasphemy against God can be forgiven?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1pdw?context=5)|Well the bible says it is the unforgivable sin. So no. However, I think defining blasphemy is the tricky part. The general idea is God's forgiveness is unlimited. If you truly, really blaspheme God (with your heart, not necessarily just words) there is no hope for you, not so much because God can't forgive you, but because you would never truly ask forgiveness.
 |So if you blasphemed God, then asked for forgiveness (truly wanted forgiveness, not just saying it) then you didn't REALLY blaspheme God.
 |Edit: Someone who would fall under the category of a blasphemer would be a lifelong atheist. If God is real, he would deny them heaven because they chose to deny his existence. 
[I've been an atheist ever since I was a kid. Isn't it unfair that I would be punished forever if god was real, despite there being no real reason for me to believe in Christianity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m91wn?context=5)|Not really. If God is real, and he's the God Christianity tells us about, then you made a conscious life choice to disregard him. If I were God, I would have no interest in letting you chill in my kingdom for eternity after that.
[*If God is real, he would deny them heaven because they chose to deny his existence.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8yc9?context=5)|If he's all-powerful and all-knowing, he can be as petty or vain as he wants...and it's your job to do whatever he says regardless. Also if God is real, it's furthermore very unlikely that you (or anyone) has the capacity to accurately describe him, so it would be likely that your analysis of God being vain and petty would be wrong.
[If there's any doubt that god is man-made, this sort of idea proves it.  I find it funny that an all powerful, all knowing god would be that vain and petty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m8yc9?context=5)|Obviously the key question here is just whether or not he is real, and whether or not the bible is his word.
[This god person you speak of hasn't even risen above petty jealousy or vanity?  There's everyday people who can get over something like that, but yet your god can't?  Doesn't sound like a god worth worshipping to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9apv?context=5)|Again, regardless of if it's vain and petty, if he is God, you worship him regardless. Rebelling against the creator of the universe - not a good plan. So the question is still, is there a God, not is he worth worshipping.
 |And again, if there was a God, I would say that you probably just misinterpreted his qualities. I wouldn't know for sure, but he probably doesn't have any bad qualities, but it would, theoretically, be easy for you to make a mistake in determine what qualities God has because he is so complex it may exceed your capabilities of discernment.
[*. I wouldn't know for sure, but he probably doesn't have any bad qualities.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9z1z?context=5)|First of all, I don't have a God. Secondly, I would say that God probably doesn't have those qualities, but I wouldn't know.
[Uhh..  So you're saying that jealousy and pettiness aren't bad qualities, or that your god doesn't have these qualities?  I mean, you just compared god to yourself.  That sounds like you trying to discern your god.  *but it would, theoretically, be easy for you to make a mistake in determine what qualities God has because he is so complex it may exceed your capabilities of discernment.*  If this god is so complex we can't discern his qualities, then how are we to discern his wishes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9z1z?context=5)|You wouldn't be able to discern his qualities except for what he chose to tell you. I suppose Christians believe the bible is the primary source of revelation of his wishes and qualities. If God is real though, it would likely be erroneous to attempt to extrapolate from that information his qualities. It's unlikely, I would guess, that a human would have the logical capabilities to discern that information about a God.
[How does your father justify making an income in the high six figure range?  *Edit* I'm an athiest but one of my favourite people is an elderly Patrician Brother. He's a great man, very well educated, very questioning of his own faith. He takes his vow of poverty very seriously.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m3ii1?context=5)|I misspoke. He makes somewhere in the range of $200k if you include benefits. I'm not sure how he justifies it, but we don't live extravagantly. We live at a moderate middle class level. He does tithe/give to missions like 40% of his income though, and then taxes of course. My parents have always been financially responsible with purchases, savings, and investments. They believe their success is a blessing for their service and continue to give to God as they think they should.
[*They believe their success is a blessing for their service and continue to give to God as they think they should.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mc1q0?context=5)|No, I do not think they believe in the prosperity gospel. That states that the motivation for doing things is based in God's blessing. I think they see God's blessing as an extra rather than a motivation. For example, as I stated it wasn't until my dad was like 45-50 that he actually started making a salary that could be considered wealthy.  I haven't talked with him specifically, but he would agree with the bible's perspective on it. I'm certain that's one of their motivations. They likely believe that they are living without being ""rich"" by giving away most of their money. Of course ""rich"" is completely relative.  Probably most goes to helping people. The majority of our money goes towards building buildings and increasing our size/capability/personnel. We give a lot towards outside missionaries, but like I mentioned in another question, a common idea is that you need to meet people's physical needs before you can tell them about Jesus. They would not believe in ignoring physical needs and focusing on evangelism.
[What are your religious beliefs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1nkf?context=5)|They definitely believe in hell. There is a little bit of complication with regards to who goes there though. I think the general consensus is that children who haven't reached ""the age of accountability"" go to heaven if they die. They also believe that God is self apparent to everyone, therefore even tribes, for example, who have never been evangelized or taught traditional Christian doctrine can still go to heaven.
 |Really though, I don't think heaven/hell is one of their big motivations. The idea is that it's all about a relationship with Christ, and heaven is the presence of Christ and he'll is the abscence of him.
 |As for my religious beliefs: these days I'm just not sure. I deny Christianity as it is wrong to claim something you don't have. I don't have what other claim to have. I am still trying to figure stuff out, but I seem to be drifting towards atheism or agnosticism. I have met people who genuinely seem to have a relationship in some way with God, but I can't tell if they are deluding themselves or not. Either way, I'm currently on an intellectual journey to find what my beliefs are. I think short from a personal revelation from God, I'm headed towards atheism/agnosticism.
[I have been there :\)  While neither of my parents were pastors, they were both extremely active in the church.  Being the oldest of four children, it was my job to ""set the example.""  When I openly admitted I wasn't sure I believed, or rather, didn't believe the whole church and my dad disowned me.  Only my mom stuck by me.  Do your parents know?  How did they respond?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m4xjn?context=5)|Wow that's horrible. I'm the youngest of three. Both my brothers are in their mid to late 20's and are solid Christians, which has been tough for me because they are both very real people, and I'm not sure why I came to a different conclusion than they did.
 |Also, it sounds like your dad and the church aren't reading the same bible I read. Prodigal son anyone? Christianity is based upon continually offering forgiveness to those willing to accept it. Even if you are wrong, your dad and your church will have something to answer for some day, if God is real. However, don't let them affect you either way. If you're motivated to search for God, do so. If God is real, it is not a valid excuse for you to say ""well my dad misrepresented you.""
 |As I answered in another question, my parents probably know because I tell everyone, but I've never talked to them about it directly. They try to manipulate me still into going to church and whatnot. I think they aren't very concerned because it's my first year of college, away from home, etc. They had similar experiences with my other brothers and likely expect that it's a phase. So I'm not sure how it'll affect our relationship long-term, but I don't really like my parents anyway so I'm not worried.
[Are you homophobic or in any way hating towards LBGT people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m5pkk?context=5)|By your standards, probably.
 |I think I have the right to dislike people if I wish. I generally find that I don't like to be around people who are clearly homosexual, because I don't really enjoy the stereotypical personality, and it makes me uncomfortable. I'm sure there are plenty of people who are homosexual but you can't really tell - and that doesn't bother me so much.
 |But on that point, I generally don't like the vast majority of people I meet. I'm kinda picky like that. But I'm not a douchebag about it, I just only choose to be friends with the people who really stand out as awesome to me. I think that's completely fair. I'm allowed to be discriminatory in my friendships, if I choose to be, without being racist/homophobic/what have you.
 |Hating? Absolutely not. I think from a standpoint of Christianity it's probably a sin, but even then it's no different from lying or stealing, or what have you.
 |I don't really support gay marriage, if I was forced to pick a side (I don't really care) because I think that religion created marriage (IE Abraham back in the day). I think the government should stop recognizing marriage. Everyone should get civil unions, and then the religious folk can get married on top of that by their own standards if they want.
 |As it is right now, if you deny marriage to homosexuals, it infringes upon their rights. If you allow marriage to homosexuals, it defiles that which is sacred to religious folk. Easiest way is to just call it something different (like civil unions) for everyone under the law. Then have marriage by religion in addition, which isn't recognized under the law.
[*because I think that religion created marriage (IE Abraham back in the day\)*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m91sv?context=5)|I was under the impression the first recordings of marriage came from the Israelites. I'm not too knowledgeable on the topic though, so I can't say much.
[My friend in NC lost all of his rights last night. He's not gay, he's pansexual. The law in NC doesn't just affect homosexuals, it affects anyone who's not in a straight marriage. Do you know what it's like for someones lover to be sick, maybe dying in hospital, and they're not even allowed to see their sick or dying lover? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m6108?context=5)|No, I wouldn't know. Also, not cool to downvote me for my opinion. It's just my opinion, I'm not even claiming that I'm right.
 |I think the issue, as I said, is that either legalizing non-straight marriage, or not legalizing it both leaves one group of people with infringed rights. Therefore, the reason the NC vote went as it did, is you simply had more religious folk than non-religious folk.
 |I still think my solution is the best idea. Stop recognizing religious marriages under the law. Only marriages recognized under law are civil unions, then if you want to get married so that your church recognizes it, you can do that if you follow their guidelines. Then everyone is happy.
[But this already happens anyway. Anytime, for example, a heterosexual Indian couple has a marriage according to their particular customs, that is already not by the Christian book. Yet the government recognizes it, and I haven't heard any Christians raising a ruckus about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m9dmu?context=5)|I think the difference is, there is nothing they can do about that, whereas there is something they can do about this. I don't think people are so vehemently *opposed* to gay marriage, just not willing to *support* it. So ""not willing to vote yes"" gets construed as hate or discrimination, when really they just don't feel strongly enough to support it.
 |I think if gay marriage was legalized right now, it wouldn't be a big deal, because there is no way you are getting that changed. It's just the fact that Christians can actually do something about it that is causing the slow change. It's more a ""dragging their feet"" effect than a vehement opposition, in my opinion.
[I never downvoted you, dude... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m67vg?context=5)|Yeah, I didn't mean to address that to you specifically. My bad. Anyway, I hope that our nation finds a way to fix this issue without hurting anybody. Sounds like your friend is getting screwed and that's too bad.

HOWEVER, how were you punished as a child?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m4mr7?context=5)|I do remember being spanked as an early child, they stopped that at some point. Usually through removing privedges from age 10 on. Once I could drive the go-to was no car. I was very independent, and they grounded me from going to school several times. Dunno if that's legal, but it worked, because I cared about my grades more than they did.

[What are your thoughts on Pascal's Wager?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m53ut?context=5)|Well two big ones. The first being, it's only valid if you assume there is only one God (or that the God you picked is the right one).
 |Secondly, it kinda violates Christianity because if you're believing in Christ and trying to go through the motions just to get to heaven, you're doing it wrong. The motivation should be a relationship with Christ, not self-preservation. That's why heaven is a reward...because it is oneness with Christ, not because its better than eternal torture.
[Thanks for your response. The way I see it if if one believes in an omniscient god (which I believe Christians do, please correct me if I'm wrong\) than the motives behind the decision would be known.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mdusz?context=5)|Yes, God would know about the motives of a person. Therefore if you came to belief of God through Pascal's wager, that may be a bad motive. This is tricky territory, because of course it's not a good idea to guess what god thinks.
[ question: do you believe clergy (specifically the pastoral clergy\) are necessary in this day an age (where literacy is common\)? A big issue I have with Catholicism is confession. Who is the priest to be able to act as an intermediary? Just like I said above, the belief of an omniscient god would mean that god already knows I'm sorry and wanting forgiveness, so why not cut out the middle man?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4mdusz?context=5)|Your point is correct, methodist are reformed, whereas catholics are not. Methodists and most reformed folk would agree with you completely. I don't know what the catholic stance is.
[How do you think your parents would react if they find out you no longer share their beliefs? Or, if they are aware, how did they react when they found out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1umw?context=5)|Well I really don't like my parents for reasons outside the scope of this question (they had some bad parenting mistakes with me which caused some pretty big rifts). So I don't talk to them about anything personal, but I am very open with my beliefs to everyone, and as pastor's they hear all the gossip, so I'm certain they know I'm not a Christian. It's BIG news when I tell people I'm not a Christian, because of my status at the church.
 |I argue with them occasionally when they say something stupid, but they aren't nearly as logical as I am so any discussion would be pointless. They don't bother or pester me or try to evangelize me, but they often make short comments like ""God really has a plan for you"" when something good happens, and they subversively try to get me to go to church by telling my friends to invite me, etc. So they know confrontation isn't beneficial, but they are trying to get me back to Christianity.
[Sounds a lot like my parents. Do they make you attend church every week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1zqv?context=5)|Yes, when I stopped going they threatened to take my car away if I didn't go. That was when I really started realizing how much my parents were invested in me being what they wanted and realizing I had been manipulated. Since leaving for college I haven't attended church. Even for a Christian, it's pretty worthless. Better to have conversations with good friends then listen to a pastor talk about a topic that may not even relate to you.
[Do you have church groupies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m1pe4?context=5)|Not really sure what you mean, but there is definitely a very specific type of person that shows up in Church often. I've seen some weird characters and there are a lot of strange stories. When you operate a religious organization of this size, weird stuff happens a good bit. We are one of the few growing churches in our area, and there is still a lot of drama. Usually drama leads to diminishing church size. I just realized I got really off topic, hah.
[Do you think your falling away from Christianity was a result of growing up the son of megachurch pastors? That is, if your parents ministered at a smaller church (w/ a congregation of say a few hundred people\) or if they weren't pastors altogether, do you still think you'd be a Christian?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m60cm?context=5)|Interesting question. I think in either scenario I would have ""fallen away"" (I don't really like that term) from Christianity. However, I think it would have been FASTER in a smaller church.
 |In a large church, pretty much all my friends from school or anywhere else, also went to my church. So I didn't question my beliefs for the longest time because it was something that everyone else believes as well - the entire community. So it was like a continual, passive peer pressure that I don't think would be present in a small church.
[Can you share what exactly separates Methodism from the other denominations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tf0hx/iama_son_of_two_megachurch_pastors_ama/c4m3t8q?context=5)|I'm can't provide a lot of info, cuz I'm not well versed in other demoninations, but I'll give it a go.
 |Methodist's are probably much more organized than most religions, we have a governing structure. They believe the bible. They believe God wants everyone to be saved (not just the elect). They do not believe ""once saved always saved."" They do not believe baptism is necessary for salvation. Gay marriage and homsexuality is a hot topic these days,  I think a lot of the liberal methodist churches are moving towards accepting it, whereas our church believes homosexuality is a sin.

I think we are one of the top  Methodist churches in the alabama-florida area. Its not uncommon to see much larger churches. However, our area is relatively small, so its more impressive on that account too.

My mom gets paid part time but works full time, just because she wants too. They definitely believe in what they do.
 |Edit: can't speak for other pastors, but I think to operate a megachurch successfully, you have to have experience. Getting experience in the ministry does not pay well. However, greed may become a factor later on (writing books, etc). I can all but guarantee you have to be pretty dedicated to be a new pastor, because its incredibly stressful and pays nothing.

tfvnp,1,2012-05-09,Need help getting my foot in the door.  Also a bit of me just venting.,smj32091,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/tfvnp/need_help_getting_my_foot_in_the_door_also_a_bit/,"Currently I'm a Junior in my undergraduate studies and pursuing a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering.  This past semester I probably have applied to at least 20 open internships positions offered from my school as well as from company profiles.  I have been interviewed for about a third of those positions and still have never gotten any offers.  I'm at wits end with the situation I'm in and very frustrated with what I might be doing wrong. Over the past 5 months I've tried everything to boost my hireability and have made real progress but it just seems that whatever I try to do isn't good enough.  I'm involved with undergraduate research which I took up this semester in February, my gpa is in great standing, I've been inducted into the mechanical engineering honor society at my university and also elected a board position. On top of this I work part time with the university to manage the computer labs across the whole university.  It gets increasingly frustrating and makes me question my self worth when companies never get back to me.  So my question to you professional engineers is what do you guys look for when hiring an intern or new hire.  

I have a second round interview for one more company and am determined to try my best to get this position, but right now I feel like my best isn't good enough."
tfs1k,0,2012-05-09,What is your experience with graduate CS degrees?,UMadBreaux,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tfs1k/what_is_your_experience_with_graduate_cs_degrees/,"Hey all,

I am currently a year away from completing my undergraduate Computer Science degree at Georgia Tech. I have been debating getting my Master's degree for a while now, but I am having trouble deciding if the cost of student loans will be worth it. Would a Master's degree pay off quickly compared to what I would make in two years of work?

I would be looking into focusing on networking and computer architecture, but Tech also has an Information Security program that intrigues me. However, I feel that an InfoSec degree could potentially put me in a niche field and limit the opportunities presented to me.

Programmers of Reddit, can you give me some input on your experiences with graduate CS programs? What made you decide to pursue (or not pursue) it? Would I be better off focusing on work experience instead of higher education(I already have a year of internship experience)? Will I be able to learn more skills or harder to acquire skills in a Master's program than I would in the real world?

Thanks for your input!"

First and foremost I really want to thank everyone who gave me such great advice for getting my foot into the gaming industry. I took all of it to heart and it helped a ton. 

Second of all, I wanted to tell you all where the advice has gotten me thus far: a few weeks ago I started sending emails and resumes to several computer engineering firms around Ohio, basically telling them my experience and what I was hoping to get out of a job. About a day after I sent out numerous emails, I received a reply back from local Ohio company (keeping the name private) who specializes in motion sensing hardware (pretty cool stuff) and software, as well as robotics and other neat stuff. 

I got an interview and scored an internship! Now I am working full time, getting paid a decent amount of money, and having fun at a job I love. Sure it is not in the Gaming Industry exactly, but it was just the starting job I needed. Things are going well there (cant talk about the work too much, a lot of it is government contracted) and it will be a great experience for me while I am in school. 

Just wanted to say thanks to those who helped me and to those struggling like I was, try as hard as you can and be persistent! That is what helped me the most. "

They have unloaded a lot of the work on me which is getting to a point where it is making more work for everyone.

Last week, I was told the trailer would be ready by the beginning of this week and to start creating some buzz around the release, thus being a good little worker, I did.  Today I was told it wouldn't be ready for another week, and now I look bad in misleading our fans/followers.

I got an awesome internship with a fairly good sized national retail business. At the moment they have me working on a software rollout project to all their stores.

Okay, so part of this internship is building a personal set of training goals to work towards and that's where I run into problems. My understanding of the SYSADMIN world isn't terribly in depth. I understand that ya'll tend to do a little of everything which appeals to me. I've looked around in the subreddit and found some great posts that I've read over as far as things to do at home or elsewhere to work on my knowledge.

My boss is super supportive of how I want to structure my time and areas of focus here. They don't have anyone that goes by ""system admin"" here as their IT structure is a little weird (quite efficient however), the closest is their system analysts that work on the helpdesk (external, deals with the numerous retail stores, corporate network/PC issues are handled by a separate dept). 

Right now I have my training goals basically set out to give me an overall feel and concept of how the whole ""machine"" works, working a few weeks with each department (Phone/Network, Helpdesk, install/maint, CorporateOffice PC/network support). I have the focus set with the helpdesk as I'v read/heard that’s a great foundation for the job and where I work at the moment anyway.

What I humbly ask from you is if there is something that I should focus on, learn about, gets hands on with given the opportunity? Keep in mind, I'm early in my education so I don't want to try an jam advanced level stuff in my noggin before I get the basics but I am tech savvy of my own accord and consider myself intelligent and a quick learner so nothing is really out of the question.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

tihbp,1,2012-05-11,In need of advice from people in the biotechnology and accounting field as I am a little unsure where to go next....,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tihbp/in_need_of_advice_from_people_in_the/,"I am currently 23 and at a community college studying an AAS in Biotechnology and Molecular Biosciences.  I was thrown into it because at the time the adviser I saw said it was the closest program they had to Biochemistry.  Now I know they do have a biochem program, but it would add at least a year and I have already been there for a little over 2 years.   So I figured I would save time and stick with the biotech degree, which can transfer straight to University through a special partnership.  Though, I just found out that the bachelors degree that I would obtain is filled with fluff classes like ""history of theater"" and ""Adult Career Development"" and only has 4 science related classes which are: Animal or Plan Physiology, Fundamentals of Genetics, Cell Biology and Applied Molecular Genetics.

Now, first of all, I do not think that these courses would provide for a strong education that would allow me to do anything at all.  I see myself getting out with a bachelor and still being in the situation I am in now where I don't have enough education.  To add to that my main goal has always been to work in Industrial Biotechnology and product development.  Though I know how heroic it is to devote your life to research, I would rather affect people's everyday lives, and I don't think I would have the skills to do that.  I also feel a little like I am running out of time as I am already a 23 year old woman.  All of my best friends from high school have children already, so what if I don't have much time left for school? I also feel really terrible that I should already have a bachelor’s degree by now, but due to financial and personal issues I wasn’t able to stay on track.   I graduated at the top ½ percentile of my high school class, so taking so long in college, even though I am paying for it all myself, seems like I disappointed everyone.. 

This is where accounting comes in.. I got into accounting because I work as a Bookkeeper / Accounts Payable / Accounts Receivable / Everything for a small business, and the more I do it the more I love it.  If I decide to change majors I could transfer next spring (about a year earlier than the biotech route), and I also wouldn't have to worry about my financial state as I wouldn't have to take two semesters of internships.  Lastly, I would love to be able to obtain a professional internship with the Walt Disney Company.   I know it may be a sign of how young I am, but I have always wanted to be a part of something that creates so much magic.  I mean, how can’t you support something that told me when I was young that dreams can come true.  The only thing is I don't really know where to go or what to do to.  I have the ability and the drive, but I don't have any one that knows enough about the corporate accounting world to help guide me to where I would like to be.

So, I would love to hear from people in each field and get some advice.  Am I right that continuing in the Biotech program will not give me the knowledge to get me where I would like to go, or is my goal of Industrial Biotechnology still within reach?  From accountants I would love to hear what I would need to do, what classes to take, what groups I would need to join, to be a shoe-in as an intern and to set me up to have a great career.

I don't think I did the job very well, although I got a letter of recommendation from the owner and 500 EUR even though it was supposed to be an unpaid internship. I was young, it was my first internship and I don't really remember what I did there (that's why I'm not sure if I did my job well).

Fast forward 5 years - graduated from uni with a relevant degree and recently moved to the world's capital of literature. I know that the owner of the company I did an internship with has got many connections all over Europe and is quite renowned in the publishing world. I've been considering sending her an email asking for her help to get me a job...

The problem is that i haven't really been in touch with the woman since i did the internship. I've seen the son on a couple of occasions (even had a short, akward fling - no sex though - with him last summer) and we're still occasionally in touch.

I'm a bit ashamed that I never even wrote the woman a christmas card and don't know if it would be cheeky to ask her for her help so many years later . i'm not sure how to go on about it/if I should have a chat with the son first although he's got nothing to do with the company/email her directly.

There's a number of reasons for this:

* I switched to CS kind of late (about after sophomore year)
* I didn't really *get* programming until about the end of junior year (we didn't really do much of it in our classes...)
* I spent my summers working overtime at non-technical job, so no internships at any point
* My school is a private, jesuit, liberal arts school, so it isn't known for CS at all
* Between a job over the summer, part-time jobs during school, and a naive/uninformed belief that GPA would end up being the bee's knees for my resume, I didn't really spend much time getting better at programming or working on personal projects during school

Although I feel like I've worked really hard during school and learned a ton, I realize that I'm probably at the bottom of the barrel in terms of junior or entry-level candidates. I've applied to a couple of places and I get the feeling that my unanimous rejections confirm this.

The good news is that I know how to do hard work, I really do care about CS and software, and I refuse to accept mediocrity. **My question is, what is the best way for me to become employable and maybe even somewhat competitive?**

I am currently working on building up a portfolio, doing projects, maybe open-source stuff down the line (if I get good enough) and so on... But I really feel like I've only gotten half of what everyone else has gotten out of a degree in CS (or at least just from the ~4 years they spent working on their own stuff there).


* Should I basically just say screw it and go through CS again through self-guided OCW/Udacity/Coursera?
* Some of my professors have suggested working my way into grad school somehow over the summer, is that even remotely possible for someone like me? Or, more importantly, is it even a good idea?
* Should I attempt to find some sort of internship? Are they even worthwhile after having already graduated?
* Or should I just stick to working on projects until I have a portfolio that's worth a damn?

Thanks for your time."
thojr,2,2012-05-11,Applying for a undergrad student internship in the autopsy section of the medical examiners office. Who has experience in this sort of position? Do you have any advice for me? (I am a 21 yr old female cell molec bio major - junior yr.),jenejij,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/thojr/applying_for_a_undergrad_student_internship_in/,"I feel that I am qualified to the degree necessary for this job, but I know that this position will have A TON of applicants. It will be competitive to get an interview, and while lots will drop out in the interview process/after seeing a cadaver first hand, I don't know if I will be able to make the cut. 

**What Qualifies me:** I am fascinated with the prospects of working with cadavers, am not squeamish in the slightest, have seen multiple live surgeries close enough to touch (open heart, mastectomies, tracheotomies), spent time volunteering in ERs, and work in a lab where I do surgery on rats and proceed to decapitate them and remove their brains – for purpose of our study. I have taken college physiology courses, but no anatomy yet. I do have an anatomy quiz ap on my android though, haha. I should mention that I am a 3rd year biology student, and hoping to go to medical school someday. I have had thoughts of working as a surgeon. 

**My downfall:** Somehow I have a hard time being detail oriented, and it’s not that I can’t be precise, but it’s a challenge to me. I come from a family of artists and eccentric writers, and precision has never been highlighted outside of school. It’s taken a lot of discipline to work in and study science for the last three years, but I love to meet the challenge. It’s still a challenge. 


Regardless of how much gruntwork and photocopying is involved, every aspect of this job will be beneficial for me, and teach me so much. I want this position so badly, and I want to express this in an eloquent way. I have a respect for death, and an acceptance of it. I did not grow up with death in my life, and I don’t think that this is a prerequisite to being stable dealing with death (although it might be helpful.) I think I am able to empathize with those deceased, and be thankful and honored to be a part of their passing on, but still have the ability to prevent daily exposure to death and trauma from getting to me. 

**Here are my questions: Have you had this job? If so, what is it like? How do you feel at the end of each day? How do you deal with the difficulties of the job?  Would you recommend it? How can I impress in my resume?**


I really appreciate any advice anyone has to offer.

tjpy2,1,2012-05-12,"[UPDATE] Work permit to Canada from France : at a port of entry or at a mission? (please help if you can, pretty please...)",selbino,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tjpy2/update_work_permit_to_canada_from_france_at_a/,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rpfw0/work_permit_to_canada_from_france_at_a_port_of/).
So, this update may not interest everyone, but I think it might help people who come across the same problem.

First thing : the port of entry/mission is misleading. The mission is the embassy, the port of entry is the customs at the border/airport. And a detail : my internship is in Canada, not in Quebec. So maybe my experience would have been different if my internship was in Quebec.

If you want to carry out an internship in Canada, you have 2 choices, but the result is the same : a work permit. If it's your first time, or if you haven't used it before, you can go through the [IEC](http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/canada-europa/france/jeunesse-youth/programme_mobilite-mobility_program-en.asp). I don't really understand what it does, but at the end, it allows you to get (if you can convince the immigration officer) a work permit. The second way to get a work permit, is to apply directly for [a work permit](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/applications/work.asp). It's quicker, maybe it's not as clear as the IEC because the IEC is for students so it smooths things a bit, but it's a month quicker in my case. I sent the papers for my work permit April 4, I received the authorization for it May 9, and my flight was May 11. So it was a close one.

About the words. You may see work visa and then work permit. The work visa is the paper that they send you if your work permit request has been approved, and that you have to present to the immigration officer when you arrive in the country. After the officer agreed that you are legit, he delivers you the work permit. The work permit is the paper that you'll have while in Canada, and the work visa is the paper you'll have before. If you don't have a work visa, you won't have a work permit. It is also different from a visa, which is the thing that allows you to get in the country. France's citizens are not concerned by that, meaning you won't have to fill paperwork to apply for a visa before getting in the country. But if you want to work or carry out your internship, you must have a work visa before leaving France. Otherwise you're screwed.

I first thought that if you take a touristic visa and wait in Canada for you work visa to come, you can sort things out later : NO. You must have the work visa before landing in Canada. To sum it up : apply for a work permit if you're carrying out an internship in Canada, don't leave France before you have the work visa, and don't forget your universal adapter.

**TL;DR** : if you want to carry out an internship in Canada and you're from France, you must have an accepted request from the embassy, either for a work permit (in which case you will have a work visa) or from the IEC program (in which case you will have something, probably a work visa too) **before entering the country**. You also have to get a visa, but if you're French, you're not concerned by that paperwork.

**Protip** : when you arrive at the immigration office in the airport with your work visa, you have to wait in line. The waiting time depends on how many people are before you, and how many officers are there. In my case, there was about 10 people before me, and 3 officers. I waited for an hour, so be prepared to wait. Also, get your luggage first, that way you won't freak out if you come out of the immigration office 4 hours after, and you can't find your stuff 'cause it has been dispatched somewhere to wait for you but you don't know where...

And sorry for all the grammar mistakes..."

tjb9k,0,2012-05-12,Questions and concerns about moving to California for school,BrewerHimself,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tjb9k/questions_and_concerns_about_moving_to_california/,"I’m 19, I did 2 years of university (with little success) in Canada, and I’m battling the decision of whether I want to go back to school or not. The way I see it, I have 3 options:

 - Don’t go back to school. Work a steady job making a decent living until I manage to get a job as a software developer. 
 - Go to a community college here in Florida and eventually transfer to a university to complete my computer science degree.
 - Move to California (in the Bay Area) and attend community college there, eventually transferring to a UC school to complete my computer science degree. 

Each of these options has its own merits in my opinion:

 - The decision to not go back to school would allow me to work full time, make a decent living, and focus on becoming a better programmer. The downside would be the difficulty that I would have finding a job for lack of a formal post-secondary education.
 - Staying here in Florida means I would qualify for in-state tuition, which would make things cheaper for me. I’d be near my mom if I needed any help and I’d get to continue to live at the beach. On the flip side, there isn’t a huge software industry where I’m at. I have yet to meet anyone who shares my passion for developing software and this can make it hard to stay motivated.
 - Moving to the valley would put me in a place where I can meet many like-minded people who share my enthusiasm and passion for technology. Graduating from a CCC would guarantee me a spot in a number of UC schools -- with the exception of Berkeley and UCLA, I believe. The only thing stopping me from doing this is that I would have to pay out-of-state tuition and I honestly don’t know if I could afford to do that. I already have $30,000 in student loans.

If I had my pick, I would move to California. I feel a need to be in the hub where everyone is doing things that are interesting and cool. The computer science programs are larger in California and the school I would end up at if I stayed in Florida (University of Florida) is making a major change to its computer science program that appears to be for the worse. 

Here are a few questions I would be grateful for if someone could address:

 - Obviously, the major issue is money. I could probably save $5,000+ if I took a year off before moving to the Valley, but that would only go so far. My cost-of-attendance for a CCC is approx $22,000 and I think I’m eligible for ~$7,000 in need-based scholarships and grants. That leaves about $15,000 that I would need to somehow come up with. What are my options? I know of Stafford loans and I’d be willing to take out the most I can if it means getting a fantastic education and being in a prime networking spot, but what else can I do?
 - Are there many part-time jobs for computer science students in California? The minimum wage is $8/hr -- just under $1,300/mn before taxes. That would barely be enough to live on here and the rent in San Francisco is significantly higher. If I move then I want to be able to make it on my own. What are my options here?

Most of me thinks I wont do anything, but part of me thinks I might, considering I have been suicidal in the past, and that I just really don't seem to care about anything the past few months.

My ex-girlfriend (who I am still uncontrollably in love with still) stopped having feelings for me though she wishes she still could.  I am to weak to stop seeing her and I still help her in every way I can because I know she has had a hard enough life already and I still want to help.  Ever since then I get more and more pissed at myself for not letting go, and I can't go to her about it because she feels guilty for not having feelings for me anymore.

I have a lousy paying job that was my fall back job since my internship didn't turn into a full job.  I now work at a university and I am seeing everyone graduate with jobs lined up.

I am friends with lots of students that are co-workers but they are all leaving because they are graduating and are set up with better jobs than I have.

My parents think I am doing well but I barely make enough to make my car payments and keep the roof over my head.

Almost everything computer related I use belongs to work so if I were to leave I'd have to give back thousands of dollars worth of equipment and go back to using old stuff...

and I feel guilty for even posting on here because I know my life really isn't *that* bad but I just really am depressed with it and don't really want it at all.  My goals are not going to be met (having a family and a well paying job) and if I can't meet my goals then I just don't know why I would try to keep going at all...




Edit: I should also mention the ex-girlfriend is sleeping downstairs after I helped her move out of her apartment and she has no place to stay for two days... the fact that she is here is helping me not run downstairs into the kitchen and grab a knife... but I'm not sure what Tomorrow has in store after she leaves.

I love it, except it means I'll be graduating 1.5 years later than I originally planned (and wayyyy higher fees!). The job opportunities with a CS degree sound great, but if I keep going on my current path, I'll be graduating with only about ~4 months of CS-related experience (and since i haven't found an internship yet for the summer, that's not a guarantee).

From what I've heard, the PEY internship sounds like a great opportunity get some experience and make $$, but I'm wondering if it's worth it to add yet another year to my program. 

Any advice? What's more important in CS - getting a degree ASAP or getting experience? Will getting a Masters help me get a better job instead?"

* I'm trying to find internships around my city (Atlanta, GA), but I'm having very little luck so far. I tried through my school's job finder network, but none of the positions appeal to me. Does anyone know of a good internship search portal for engineering related jobs? Or is your company currently hiring interns? I'm not picky about pay, I'm mainly in this for the experience.

* My cumulative GPA is abysmally low (2.2), thanks to screwing around in my freshman year. Is it possible to just put my Engineering GPA on my resume as that's much higher? If so, what subjects should I include when calculating my GPA? Should I include Physics I,II, Chemistry etc. or just Engineering and Math classes?

* I would rather try for an internship instate, but if I get one out of state, is it common for companies to reimburse me for room and board, food etc.?

* Most companies I've looked at require cumulative GPA's of 3.5+. Should I just apply anyway to these companies? These are big companies though. Is it true that smaller companies have less stringent requirements? If so, how do I find these companies to send my resume to? I've had no luck with job search portals. 

Sorry if I sound clueless, this is my first time applying for an internship, so any help would be appreciated!"

University A: I had a low GPA ~ 3.0 goofed off a lot and eventually got expelled for a prank I pulled on another student (Nothing physical, posted his number on CL for casual encounters). I managed to transfer to another university the next semester.

University B: (Sophomore year-until graduation 2013) I currently attend a large state university in the midwest. We are known for our strength in sciences and engineering. 

GPA: Overall: 3.75 Major: ~ 3.8-9 I have so far one year of research experience and continuing. Scored a HHMI internship this summer. Student editor for an university undergraduate peer reviewed academic journal. I know how to code etc. etc.

So I learned that when I apply to graduate schools next semester they will require me to submit transcripts from ALL postsecondary schools. In addition, I learned that University A will put expulsion on my transcript. 

I really want to attend a very good graduate program. I have friends with current credentials like mine and they managed to get into top ranked programs. 

What are my chances? Should I include a letter in my application explaining that the incident was a meer prank and I matured a lot since then? My record is obviously evident. I'm just worried.

tn5el,0,2012-05-14,Successful (chemical) engineers: How did you get your foot in the door?,NoOne45,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/tn5el/successful_chemical_engineers_how_did_you_get/,"Hello everyone,

I just finished my junior year in chemical engineering at an ABET-accredited, mid-ranked university and I can't help but think I made a bad career choice. I have a 3.7 GPA, and I've been doing research as an undergraduate for over a year. I love what I do both academically in classes and what I do in my research. Unfortunately, I can't stay in academia forever, and I will need to get a real job someday.  


This is where I'm worried. I applied for well over 100 summer internship positions (I live in an area known for high employment in chemical engineering), and this netted me a grand total of 2 interviews. The interviews I got both went very well, the hiring managers seemed impressed with my experience, and they both rejected me. They did, however, invite me to inquire about permanent positions when I graduate. It seems competition for internships is just incredibly fierce. 


I'm very worried I won't be able to find a job when I graduate. Of the five people I know who graduated from my program, none of them have been able to find a related job. One is working as a telemarketer, another went to graduate school, and the rest are working retail. I see myself heading down the same path. I'm no better qualified than they are.


I have no family working in engineering to use for connections (this is how most of my friends who found an internship found one), but I do have quite a few professional connections from doing undergraduate research. Ironically, the interviews I DID get were from random ads I found on the internet.


It's my junior year and it certainly looks like I'm going to be graduating without an internship. I'll have another year of undergraduate research when I graduate, but I imagine I'll be at a huge disadvantage without any industry experience.  It's really going to be sad if I spent four years of my life studying a field I'll never be able to enter. I honestly think I should have gone to a trade school sometimes. 


So, successful engineers: How did you get your foot in the door? It seems that I need experience to get a job, but university experience isn't enough. But I need a job to get experience. Any suggestions? "
tmxpn,6,2012-05-14,Finding balance between work/life &amp; quality/quantity,Mogglez,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/tmxpn/finding_balance_between_worklife_qualityquantity/,"I'm not sure if this is correct subreddit to post in (if you know somewhere else where it'd be more fitting to post it, do suggest where), but there's something I'd like to talk about for a bit... or something that I'm wondering about. I'm sorry if this becomes a bit too rambly. **Read the TL;DR at the bottom **

I'm 20 years old and just now got an internship at a store (which hopefully - if I do well - is going to get me an actual employment at said store). Right now I'm working 8 hours a day, without a one hour lunch added in there on top of that. So 9 hours where I'm at the job. Then there's travel time on top of that, to and from the job. Additionally there is also that bit of margin where you wait for the bus, or those few minutes you get to work early or stay a few minutes late.

All this adds up to around 10-11 hours for me. 10-11 hours of the day that I'm pretty much locked up. With 8 hours of sleep every night (without that I'm a wreck) there are 5-6 hours left to do what I want on my free time, not to mention the time that I have to shower, shave, eat, poop, all that jazz. So my question I guess is a matter of quantity vs quality. Now, as this thing that I've got is an internship I'm working without pay. This is also a job that I wouldn't exactly see myself doing for the rest of my life, if you know what I mean... so those two things make these 8 working hours seem much worse than they necessarily should have to. 

But I guess what I'm saying is that I'm almost terrified and very put off that I have to sacrifice more than 70% of my life (counting the necessities) to make the remaining amount of it enjoyable or even bearable. I'm afraid that I'm being far too idealistic in that I'm thinking ""This can't be reasonable"".

Maybe this is a phase of my still passing adolescence, but it truly scares me. I feel somewhat spoiled when I say that this also is my first actual time working full hours... or even having somewhat of a regular job. and the idea that this is what I'm going to do for the rest of my life when I eventually settle for something scares me.

My more logical side tells me that this is what I feel because of several things. Some of these several things being:

* I'm not yet earning money, which makes the time I'm spending at work now feel somewhat meaningless. This will however change in about 2-3 weeks when my internship is over.

* This is not the place I will be working all my life, hopefully. I'm planning on studying later and getting a job that I will feel fits me better. A job that hopefully I will enjoy doing (not always, but enough to feel that it's not a waste a time or JUST a means of getting me money).

* I'm also not yet simply used to working this much, because I've never done it before. Once I get into the rhythm I won't think about it too much.

I think all of these three things are true. But I'm still not sure that (with above things considered) working such a vast amount of time is worth it in an ideal world. But obviously we are not living in an ideal world. To me it comes down it all being a trade-off between quality and quantity. Do I want a lot of free time? Then I won't have a lot of money or freedom in what I can do with my free time. Do I want to use my free time the way I see fit? Do I want to live comfortably? Then I need to put into those hours of work to make that happen. It feels very much either-or.

Another thing that worries me is that I'm very much a ""time optimist"" so to speak. I like to take my time doing things, just do things at my own pace. Do it calmly, without worrying about the time. The effect that attitude currently has on me is that I end up doing very little in the few hours of spare time that I have each day after work. I'm not the type to say ""I'm now going to sit down and focus on this one thing for an hour or two (perhaps a video game) and then go on to the next thing that I would like to do."". I feel like a sort of jack of all trades when it comes to spending my time. I distribute my time to doing so many things half-assed that at the end of the day I haven't really done anything or achieved anything. Granted, this is a problem with me and not with culture or society... but this in combination with a full time job, again, just scares me.

I guess I could go on forever. But what are your thoughts on this? How do you deal with balancing your work and free time? How do you feel about the idea of quantity vs quality? Is there a reasonable compromise or balance between the two that is both good and realistic as opposed to just idealistic?

**TL;DR:** I'm feeling uncomfortable and scared over the idea of spending a majority of my wake time on work(mainly this, I guess)/transport/eating/pooping/cleaning/waiting, leaving me with I would consider an underwhelming remaining amount of time left to do with as I please. I understand that I need to work in order to achieve a sort of freedom, the ability to choose where and how to live, what and how to eat, what material entertainment to get (games, music, movies, etc)... but it's still very off-putting to me, to use up a majority of your life just that I can enjoy the remaining little bit that is left.

**I guess I could go on forever. But what are your thoughts on this? How do you deal with balancing your work and free time? How do you feel about the idea of quantity vs quality?

tlupb,3,2012-05-13,"Having girl problems that I really think reddit can help  me with, care to add your two cents?",throwingaway2299,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tlupb/having_girl_problems_that_i_really_think_reddit/,"I've been dating this girl for about 8 months now, though it depends where you start counting.  We had both just graduated from high school and the plan was to end it when summer ended and go off to our separate colleges with no strings attached.  That didn't work out and we wound up doing long distance for the year; we saw each other only during breaks.  It was rough at first: we fought a lot about what we were and were not allowed to do, she liked partying and dancing with other guys and got upset when I told her it bothered me.  But after a while she stopped going out as much and focused on her studies, and things were great.

I am an outspoken atheist (go figure), but I go to a Catholic school in Oregon. As a result, I'm pretty socially isolated.  My plan has been to transfer out of here next year, this was my safety school and I got pretty unlucky in the college application process last year.  I made friends among the other kids in the Honors program, but tried to keep my distance because I knew I was probably transferring.  I got particularly close to one girl specifically.  Too close.  I started to have feelings for her, which was not acceptable because she had a boyfriend (long-distance), and I was still happy with my current relationship.  So I backed off and avoided her for most of the year.

Flash forward a few months, it's close to the end of the school year and things are still great with my SO, but I have severe chronic migraines that are getting out of control.  So I start taking this daily medication, topiramate, that is supposed to manage them.  Unfortunately, the side effects really start messing with me.  I start noticing mood swings, trouble concentrating, loss of problem-solving abilities and communication skills, and things like that.  Since maintaining a long distance relationship is all about communication, the meds turn me into a terrible boyfriend, and my distraught girlfriend tells me that I need to stop taking the medication and go back to being there for her or she'll stop talking to me.

Now this is a problem, because I can't stop taking the medication, I need it in order to keep the migraines away.  At one point, before I started taking the meds, I was getting migraines three times a week that put me in bed for up to six hours, writhing with pain.  It upsets me that she would want me to go back to that for her, and I told her I couldn't do it.  We haven't talked since then, but this was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back: I decided to end it with her.

After I made that decision, my whole plan came crashing down.  I'm not sure if I want to transfer anymore, I would have to start over with new doctors and professors who don't understand my condition, and I would have to try to join or form a new friend group as a sophomore.  My friends in Oregon have been really supportive, too, and leaving them would be hell.  To make matters worse, my feelings for my friend had just gotten more intense and I decided to confront her about it before I left for the summer.

We went for a walk together on one of our last nights there, and I told her everything.  She saw it coming, even pushed me to come out with it, but after I told her it became apparent that she was just as conflicted as I was.  She told me she wasn't ready to break up with her boyfriend for me, but she did admit that she had feelings for me, which I had sensed.  After we talked, I was surprised how easy it was to still be friends with her like nothing had changed.  When we went home a few days later, we still texted all the time, but she didn't want me to compliment her because it messed with her head too much and she felt guilty.

Two days ago things came to a head, I got fed up with having to set up rules for our friendship.  I told her that the reason I came clean with her was so that I could stop pretending, and if I couldn't be myself with her then it would be better to not talk at all.  She agreed and we haven't talked since.

I'm not sure what to do, I lost my best friend and my girlfriend within a week of each other.  My girlfriend just got home from school last night, and I'm going over there in a few hours to end it for good (I think).  Once she's out of the picture I will have a lot more free time on my hands, and I don't have any job or internship lined up for the summer.

My question for reddit is this: should I renew my WoW subscription or my SWTOR one??

**EDIT**: TL;DR I'm breaking up with my girlfriend and I want to know which video game I should start playing."

How do I boost them and get other things to put on resume?,thr0wup,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/tltw3/low_cs_grades_how_do_i_boost_them_and_get_other/,"Hey /r/berkeley, so CS grades just came out for CS61B, and... I did much worse than I thought I would. I got a C+, thinking that I'd at least be capable of getting a B+.

Realistically, I know I should have done more practice tests, asked the TA's for help, et cetera, and I've thought this over several times. I've resolved to go to office hours more often and start studying ahead of time. I've quit most of my extracurriculars, so next semester I can have more study time. I've already started learning 61C material. Okay.

The problem is, my grades are generally pretty bad. My technical GPA is sub-3.0, though my overall GPA hovers around 3.1- this is mainly because my other major is fairly easy and has been pulling them up. 

I only started studying CS once I entered Berkeley, but I feel like this isn't a valid excuse, as there seem to be plenty of people who are the same and have much higher grades. In CS61A, I also did every single project solo and got over 90% on all of them- yet I still got a B in that class- and low grades in all the other prerequisites. I love CS, but I keep doing ""badly""- and that low self-confidence makes it very hard to believe that I can succeed in this field. 

I am also currently a sophomore- I spent last summer taking classes, and I'm already enrolled in CS61C for the summer. I have two jobs, but one is IT support, the other is design-related. So /r/berkeley CS majors, given this information, should I quit CS while I can? If not...

1) How can I boost my understanding of CS and my GPA? 

2) How (and should I) to start applying for research?

3) How do I apply to my first programming-related internship?

4) Should I go to Hackathons? Do I even stand a chance?"

I have recently taken Data structures, my problem is the following:
I had an A+ average in the course (got a 94 on the final exam). However, we had a final project which counted as 40 percent of the grade, I finished it early but the class wanted an extension, so the professor pushed to the end of the semester. My program for the final project didn't work correctly as the prof expected and I only knew this after submitting it; since I got a 0. I ended up with a C+ in the course, do you think I can explain this when I'm looking for an internship next summer?  Or does this story sound like b.s.
I honestly understand the course completely, just the prof decided to be a douche and give me a 0. When I contacted him, he said it was too late as the grades have been submitted and finalized.
Just looking for thoughts from people on here who employ undergrad students as interns. 
(I have had previous experience interning as a programmer, and all A's on my CS courses except for that one class)"
tom14,7,2012-05-15,Career change?,Luxas89,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tom14/career_change/,"Hi everyone,

I've been searching for finance work for the past year, but it just hasn't panned out at all. I'm thinking about changing my career objectives because I guess I'm just not cut out to make it in finance. 

Here's some background on me. I'd really appreciate some advice about what I should pursue now.

I graduated from a top 50 school with a BA in Economics(we didn't have a finance major, so all finance courses were taught by the economics department) and a minor in Math back in June 2011. I was able to graduate with distinction. 

After moving back with my parents, I started to work on the CFA program. It's honestly helped me a lot more than I expected (I'm talking getting 0 interviews to an average of about 1-2 interviews a week, but I usually don't make it past the phone interview). 

I held an internship at a tiny publicly-traded biomedical company as a finance/accounting intern. I could honestly say that this was my dream job in internship form. At first the work wasn't too amazing- I was helping them prepare for internal audits, doing some editing to their 10-Q's and some other clerical work. However, after my boss saw what I could do and after we had discussed my career objectives, they allowed me  to contribute to the firm's strategic development by allowing me to do data and financial statement analysis. I guess I managed to make a pretty good impression while working on those projects because they eventually allowed me to do some preliminary research and analysis of their potential acquisitions. 

I've also held a few leadership roles within a couple of the extracurricular activities I participated in at my school. 

Given the ridiculous amount of free time I have, I also taught myself some basic SQL, C, JavaScript, VBA, and Access.

With that in mind, I would really appreciate some guidance as to what I should do. I'd really like to work in some kind of analytical role (my sales skills are obviously not very well developed lol).

todnq,2,2012-05-15,Two internships at once: should I do it for the experience vs. the money?,InternExp,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/todnq/two_internships_at_once_should_i_do_it_for_the/,"I am out of school and currently doing a marketing internship with a small-ish software company. I applied to another internship at a bigger software company with the mentality of ""because why not?""

The problem is that the bigger company pays slightly less per hour (as in, $2 less) than my current company. Here are my concerns:

* I don't think it's looked favorably upon by recruiters (nor does it make sense) to take a lesser-paying job than the one you currently have. Maybe it's different in this economy, but I personally believe that you shouldn't set a precedent of a downward pay trend, only upward.
* I feel like I am already considered a good candidate for a full-time regular position at my current company (my internship is almost officially over), though a job offer is not *guaranteed*. But as of now, I'm doing full-time hours at my company as an intern.
* I will have to dedicate half my time to getting paid a lower rate. Paying rent and student loans is already difficult enough.

Pros:

* The experience. I believe being able to say I did two internships at two different software companies at once may get me an even better job and higher starting pay at an even more prominent software company down the road.
* The bigger company has more stability (hence, it's bigger and more widely known). Looking at glassdoor.com, it seems that all of their department heads, including marketing, make good six-figure salaries. Their regular employees are paid very competitively, too.

Do you guys think I have any room to haggle? I don't think internship rates are very negotiable, but I may be wrong. I'll obviously ask about long-term potential, but assuming that they do say, ""Yes, there is a possibility that we may hire you down the road should we find that you're a good fit,"" would you take the internship at a lower rate?"

I now have 3 years of experience (one internship, 2 jobs) making/working on web applications, and a bunch of side projects.  Basically, I want to work as an engineer for a startup in NY for a couple years and then work my way to a manager position, eventually CTO.  I don't think I want to be a developer forever.  What will I need to do this?  I have the communications/management skills, but will I need an MBA? Different job experience? Do engineers usually get promoted to higher up positions or are they sought after elsewhere?  

Secondly, all of my experience is with LAMP technologies (php, mysql, html5, css, js, jquery, etc), and I would probably be looking for a frontend position (my experience is frontend and backend, but I simply enjoy working front-end, and I think I'm better at it).  Is there anything I should focus on now to make myself more valuable?  One thing that worries me is I am not very familiar with linux/command line or version control (my work has basically been pushing/pulling master from a git repo since I work with one other person).  So I have git experience, but not really...

Obviously I have a lot of questions, but I would love *any* advice that you have to offer!  Thank you very much! "

[This story](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tn7c2/my_computer_is_acting_weird/) reminded me of something I saw a couple of years ago:

I was an intern at a shipping company, helping their IT-techs. A user complained about ""my Word"" some times writing incoherent stuff without him even touching the keyboard. This sounds like awesome bullshit, so I went to check it out =P

I sit down at his desk, bring up a Word document and wait. To my surprise it actually started typing! At first it seemed like random letters, punctuation and spaces, but after a while I could see a pattern, and distinguish some words. The thought that this was devils work actually crossed my mind.

I start reading the ""text"", making out what it MIGHT be about, stand up and ask the users coworkers if anybody had been typing something similar. Turns out, a woman just 2 meters away had! I tell her to write certain things, and sure enough some of the letters and special characters show up O.O What the hell is going on?

I call my supervisor there, explains the situation and he just laughs, points to the keyboards and says ""Bluetooth. Her keyboard is overriding his."" I thought this was hillarious, but we did a recalibration of the keyboards or something like that and then it worked fine.

EDIT: Changed the word ""document"" from swedish to english. Thanks narulp!"

In January I left a secure job to pursue an internship that would finish my degree. It was understood that it would be a 4 mnth internship and at the end they would decide whether or not to hire me.  Well it ends next week and almost positive I will not be hired. I have called the labor force and explained my situation. That they do not have a position for me and will be jobless in a week. Since, I worked all last year and quite for a paid internship they informed me I would qualify for unemployment. However, the only problem is that they are working me everyday pretty much, with no days off. I need to go for a job interview. I have met my school hours. I am basically there to finish my contract. I know they will not let me off for the interview. Will this ruin my chance of getting unemployment if I call out sick? It will not hurt my graduation. I live in Florida.  It is a well established corporation. Can they contest my unemployment if I call out? Any help or previous experience will help me much! I am not one to sit around, I want to work. ASAP."
tpfox,1,2012-05-16,recent college grad unemployed and hopeless,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tpfox/recent_college_grad_unemployed_and_hopeless/,"Hi. I was inspired by a previous reddit thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/nxdzz/im_not_as_smart_as_i_thought_i_was/) which prompted me to write this. 

I graduated last year from a prestigious university with a major in natural science degree. I came back to home in Asia, and have been searching for jobs since without much progress. I was the student who struggled as a freshman and continued to struggle (as described in the link). I almost failed to graduate. Now I have been unemployed for a year and I don't see things getting better.

The main reasons are:
1) I have no work experience
2) I have low GPA, about 2.28 out of 4.0-- since I am trying to get hired in my country, where GPA is one of the most, if not the most important component in the job application

Looking back, my biggest mistake was pursuing my major. I found college to be a gigantic leap from high school; I was simply not prepared for the amount of work and work efficiency as required by my science courses. And despite tremendous effort, I failed to adapt. But for one reason or another, mainly because I was being stubborn and didn't want to give up, and perhaps because then I didn't know what was right for me (and how relevant to professional life college major was), I still pursued my major. As a result, my confidence was completely shattered by my freshmen year. During my four years, I was always struggling and always unhappy inside (as I was not able to share this with my friends). I was always behind with homework, always stressed out and always struggling to catch-up. But my main priority has always been academics and I truly enjoy learning and studying, which made the matters worse. I never figured my way out of my disastrous first year cycle. I have produced some good works, but was never able to manage multiple courses on time. I was also unable to pursue some courses that truly interested me.

Up until graduation I invested all my energy in catching-up and fulfilling minimum requirements, I didn't get a chance to really think about post-graduation life, until after graduation. Now that I'm back home, with my college years that were largely wasted, I have spent months trying to figure out what I want to do, when there is no way for me to really know because I have no experience. 

I am bit down, because all my friends are well employed or pursuing a degree. Most know what they want to do and have an industry/ area of interest. I lost contact with many of my friends. They would ask what I'm doing and what my plans are. I'm embarrassed to reach out. I'm embarrassed for my parents who invested in my college education.  

I really want to gain work experience (perhaps through internship). I had hopes up that if I truly work hard and wisely (treating my college failure as a learning experience that made me prudent and stronger person), although it will take me time to re-build my life, that eventually I can become the person I aspire to be. However, I'm stuck with my job search-- I know I should start networking more. I have applied to some jobs, called up one alum and few hiring managers, bought few books for help, and I look on job sites everyday. But in the end I don't have a presentable resume to substantiate my ability to work hard, and no specialty that is in demand by the job market. I think I don't know how to find a job and how to get hired in this competitive job market.

Does anybody have any advice for me?

P.S. My thoughts might be bit disorganized, as I didn't get a chance to really organize the edit. Thanks for reading!"

Well I just got my grades from my last finals and I failed Everything minus Calculus II and Engineering Science 103 which I got A's in. 

The reason I failed the classes was I got extremely sick around midterms, which was too late to get my money back on my classes and drop them...so I stuck it out and missed a week and a half of classes, but fought through and learned the material, but couldn't make up all my grades.

Will ""D"" grades replaced with A's be ignored on my transcript? Or do you think I have butchered my transcript? It looks awful....all A's and then BAM a spew of D's :( 

Give me advice on how to fight this please."

I want to start looking for an internship in the comp sci field for the summer to gain experience but I'm not sure what I can say I know on my Resume.  I've had three semesters of classes that used  java to teach the material.  I've also recently took a internet systems class that taught HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, XML, and Javascript.  

At this point I'm not sure what I can list on my resume as far as what I know or how well I know it.  I feel like I know Java well enough to list it for an internship type job.  When it comes to HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL I'm not sure whether listing these would be a good idea or not.  I understand basic HTML and CSS well enough, but never did anything with the HTML5 stuff and transforms and other fancy things in CSS.

As part of the internet systems class we were partnered up and had to make a website.  My partner and I made a simple forums with PHP, and SQL so I think I understand those on a basic level enough to get me started with anything but when I see postings with SQL as a requirement I'm not sure if what I know would be acceptable.

For the last six years I've been learning as much as I can about CS and IT, but I can't get a job in it because I have absolutely no experience.

Off the top of my head, I've done tons of computer repair, built a server (*NIX/DHCP/DNS/Samba), made a couple complex bots (AutoIt), made a few games (Blitz), built tons of stupid fork bombs (batch) made numerous websites ((X)HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/etc), graphic design, done freelance programming work for redditors, done an all-night hackathon with friends, made a Firefox add-on (XML), and plenty of other things - but I can't figure out how to turn it into a career.

I would love to do an internship, but internships don't pay the rent. I'm moving to Corvallis, Oregon to go to Oregon State University and there's a great programming job - now how do I make myself look competent so I don't look like some ignorant twat?"

I am a help desk technician for a company, but I am also doing a simultaneous internship for my degree with this company.  As per the requirements of my internship I have to complete a research project.  I have decided that my research project should be to improve the imaging process of all of the laptops that I have to configure and send out.  This is where I need your help reddit! The laptops that I configure are imaged by Windows MDT and they used Windows XP service pack 3.  Upon completion of the imagining, I would like the script that I write to start and complete these tasks:
* Prompt the technician for their username and Password. 
* Prompt the technician for the computer's new name
* Prompt the technician for the computer's new user's name and password
* Use the prompted info to change the computer's name, then restart the PC.
* Use the prompted info to add the computer to a different domain, and add the new user as a local administrator, then restart the PC again.
* Begin to run another prewritten script that continues the configuring process.

I need to learn how to write something like this in the next couple of weeks, and reddit, I could seriously use your help on where to look and teach myself.  I also need to know what the best type of scripting to try and learn.  Right now we have Auto-It scripts that seem to work pretty well.  But if there are more stable types then that would definitely work too. Thanks so much!!

trdzg,1,2012-05-17,...i don't really talk,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/trdzg/i_dont_really_talk/,"i feel like i'm just going to type and type and type. i just need to talk to something and i really don't know why i feel so shitty and i don't know. i try so hard but everything is wrong.

i cut and scratched myself starting 8th grade. got caught junior year of hs. got diagnosed with general anxiety and clinical depression. homeschooled senior year. went to community college. withdrew from classes, from an a/b to a w. 5th year university student. withdrew from classes with 9 units away from graduation. ditched my intership, my team of 5 corps members, and 20 little humans. failed suicide on valentine's day this year. not mute, but just... can't get myself to talk. to anyone. i write 3-4 words down, at most. i talk to my boyfriend via messages on skype. a few money issues, but nothing completely unsolvable. preventable, if it weren't for the valentine's day thing.

i really don't know what to do with myself. my boyfriend has been trying to keep me happy, so i try to be happy. so every day i work at my parents' restaurant smiling and nodding and then running away and being treated like i'm two years old when someone tries to get me to talk. 

the thing that gets to me is that i know it's all in my head. there really is no reason for me to be depressed. there's a table with food, roof over my head, clothes, laptop, and i try so hard to keep myself busy. i take up hobbies, i go places, and then gift them to people and when i stop, i'm thinking about ways to kill myself without failing, breaking up with my boyfriend so he won't be blamed, taking a flight to anywhere and doing it so my parents won't have to see the cadaver. 

like... this shit is in my head all the time. i want to get better but then i just fall into this... i don't know. at one point i was 95 pounds, then 130 this year. i would buy chocolate and ice cream and go to my grandma's house and then i'd refuse to leave from underneath my covers for weeks. i can't do this anymore and i don't want a visit from the emergency crisis team or medication or anything. my shrink has been nothing but good to me, but i don't want to talk to her. i just feel like i want to end it all, but i don't want to be the one to end it. i kind of jokingly asked my boyfriend to kill me instead, but his reaction was really bad and then i felt really bad when i realized how awful that was to say. 

i just realized that's really contradictory, but i don't know. sometimes i'm just... if i pretend i'm better, maybe i'll get better. but this just keeps making me feel worse and makes my head hurt and my parents are going through so much already and they really don't need this, but now they have to worry about their 22-year-old daughter who should have graduated and student financial services are just... i don't want to think about that right now. and health issues i didn't know i had just popped up. and i'm just wondering... is there really a point? ...if all i'm ending up doing is burdening my family and worrying other people, wouldn't it be better for me to end it all and have them grieve for a little and then go off and live their lives with their load a little lighter? 

i tried. i really did. i never missed therapy. i contacted and asked for help from my psychologists. i kept myself busy. i was outgoing and made friends. got accepted into an internship. volunteered. i gave myself alone time. i went shopping. i ate lots and lots of chocolate and candy and took pictures and made scrapbooks. i got a boyfriend. i tried and nothing worked and i don't know if i'm willing to try anymore but... i don't know. i just don't know what i want or how to get what i want or if what i want is even right. 

i really don't know. i don't want to go to sleep tonight wishing i won't wake up tomorrow. i just don't want to wake up to see me and just... i don't know. i feel like everything's wrong"

The only problem is, I've got other things that could possibly be on my plate for this summer- the internship, doing classes/research at school, or going home- and I need to be moved out of my dorm by Monday. I'm rapidly reaching the point where I *need* to know what's going on so that I know where I'm moving (and parents, etc etc).

If I even should contact him about this, is there a polite way to do it, or is saying ""I need to know now-ish"" rude regardless? This would assume I don't hear back from him by the end of today (5/17)."

tqupr,2,2012-05-16,I am 80% sure my g/f is cheating on me... so do I....,DoIFaceBookGymLawyer,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tqupr/i_am_80_sure_my_gf_is_cheating_on_me_so_do_i/,"So my girlfriend and I at one point had an argument over her talking to her ex-boyfriend. She was talking to him via cellphone and email all secretively. I happened to see an email, and it sounded kind of fishy that she didn't ever mention to me about it. I asked her to stop talking to him, since I can't trust her to be honest about her dealing with him. If she was open that'd be fine. I also said if she did want to talk to him that I'd want 100% transparency since she lost a lot of trust that first time.

That was in December/January. Today I see an email pop/up on her inbox as I was about to help set her up on Linux. It was from her ex. A few minutes later I find that she was ""hiding"" his emails in her deleted items folder all saved as attachments to emails forwarded to another account. Basically she was actively hiding these communications. All I could see was her stuff from the past 2 months, everything else wasn't there.

What I did see was enough to raise red flags. Invitations for them to meet up with each other, and some flirtatious back and forths. It sounds fishy to me. At this point I am 80% sure she is cheating on me.

I feel bad because she is unemployed, and her mother lives several states over. If I kick her out, she basically will have to move back home (she is currently a guest at my home, but I am on the lease). I know she just got an internship in my area (that I helped her get) that would set her up for a job, but without a place to live she is s-o-l.

So on an 80% chance should I eject her from my life?

UPDATE: I called her and asked her if she had anything to say. She didn't. I told her if there was ANYTHING she was doing and hiding from me that'd make me upset. She denied it. Then I told her what I saw, and she denied that they did anything sexual/etc and she wouldn't answer me straight about what was going on.

EDIT:

Clarification: I only snooped on her emails after I saw the little pop-ups with her boyfriend's name.

TLDR (thanks TLDR MOFO): I found some flirtations between my g/f and her ex in email and suggestions that they were meeting up behind my back. What do I do?"

Well today rolled up and no response from her or anyone else from that company. I emailed her and she said she wasn't able to get a hold of them and she would contact me once she gets in touch with them.

ttjnx,1,2012-05-18,Do you think this is a worthwhile venture?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ttjnx/do_you_think_this_is_a_worthwhile_venture/,"Hello everyone.


I am a design graduate living in the UK and I am sick of companies advertising unpaid full-time internships.

So many companies abuse the internship scheme in order to get free labour from talented graduates in the Creative Industries. So few of us can afford the luxury of working for nothing yet we need experience on the cv to get the paid job making it extremely difficult for new graduates to start their careers.


What I am currently in the process of doing is forming a charity aimed at people within the creative industries to offer them funding to help while they undertake unpaid internship schemes.


I feel that the internship scheme needs to change but at the same time there are so many loopholes which companies can use to get around paying people e.g. voluntary placements and work experience.


What I am asking from all of you guys is some feedback on this idea and any suggestions you have towards the idea to help make this new charity be worthwhile and really helpful to those in the creative industries.


Thanks guys

[In my opnion, Craig Ferguson's show is unique, as so much is improvised. None of the episodes are broadcast live (or to my knowledge most aren't\), and yet that talk show seems so much more ""REAL"" than any other to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj8cf?context=5)|But Craig, like any good host, has strong ideas about himself and what he wants to do.  He's a natural.
[What kind of role do you play in the creation and distribution of that show? The show has grown and changed since it first started very much. How much of that can be attributed of ""Worldwide Pants"" and how much could be attributed to Craig Ferguson?  I believe your sitting on a goldmine. Craig Ferguson has some of the best interviews on Television. Any chance you can just give the man a Charlie Rose style interview show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj8cf?context=5)|Craig wears an earpiece hooked up to my office and he repeats everything I say.  He really is just a giant puppet.  No, Craig is brilliant and all the credit belongs to him.  As a company, Worldwide Pants isn't run by typical ""executives.""  It's kind of me and Dave on the creative side.  Our mantra is to find talented people and let them do their thing.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  In Craig's case it's working.  Peter Lassally, who works for us on the West Coast, was crucial to identifying and championing Craig early on, and he is there on a day to day basis to work with Craig.
[Have there ever been any guests that you were unable to put on the air due to their being intoxicated, being ""out of it"", or something along those lines? If so how do you make up for that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pitmy?context=5)|I can't recall an incident like that, but I may be forgetting.  Some people thought Farrah Fawcett was on something when she had her infamous appearance.  I actually have no idea because she arrived late -- after the show started -- so everything you saw, I saw.
 |I was interviewed after the incident and said I thought she was just playing around, trying to be funny.  The day after I was in my office at 11 p.m. and the phone rang.  It was Farrah. I thought she was calling to thank me for backing her up in the press.
 |She began explaining her appearance and to this day I still don't understand what she was saying.  I just know that I was on the phone with her for an hour.  The only phrase I remember is that she kept telling me that she was going to Al Pacino's castle.  Your guess is as good as mine.
 |That was one of those show business moments I will never forget.  I am 49, so if you do the math, I was in mid-puberty when the Farrah Fawcett poster came out.  If I could have ever looked into a crystal ball and imagined myself being on the phone with Farrah Fawcett, going on midnight, and just wanting to GET OFF THE PHONE, well, I don't think my 13-year-old self would have ever believed it.
[**Al Pacino's Castle.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk2cu?context=5)|Every time you try to leave it, it pulls you back in.
[I must know more about this place. Must. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk2cu?context=5)|Thank you and g'night!  Hey, I'm a professional.  Don't mess with this!
[What is the the most uncomfortable thing youve you've seen on the Letterman set? The Crispin Glover incident?  The various Harvey Pekar arguments? Your boss' mea culpa about dating his staffer and getting blackmailed?  Anything else come to mind?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pirl4?context=5)|We've had our moments.  You can't predict them.  They just happen.  And the truth is, they are great for us.  Crispin Glover, I think, was trying to do a bit -- but I can't really be sure.  Harvey Pekar was great television.  Farrah Fawcett was another one that was pretty amazing to watch up close.  And there was one with the old actor Oliver Reed (now longer with us) that was compelling.  He had a few cocktails and I thought there was a chance he was going to punch Dave.
[Also, was Larry ""Bud"" Melman really that odd? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pirl4?context=5)|As for Dave's ""mea culpa,"" I actually didn't find that awkward at all.  Part of what makes Dave the best is that he is honest and authentic in all situations.  And I though he handled a difficult situation amazingly well.
[Interesting...never heard of the Reed incident and I was a fan of his as well.  Watching it online right now. That is one amazing beard. Thanks for the head's up. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj4o9?context=5)|Here's a little more on Oliver Reed.  I don't remember when this was, but I was not yet a writer on the show.  (I suspect it was late 1987/early 1988 because I became a writer in Feb. 1988.)  I was 25 and I was given a chance to segment produce.  I was assigned Oliver Reed.  He had been in some movie that took place on an island.
 |I got him on the phone and said, ""Hello, Mr. Reed.  So, you spend several months shooting on an island --"" CLICK.  He hung up.
 |I call back, the publicist says, ""Oliver is mad that you asked if he was on an island.  He says, of course he was on an island.""  I said I wasn't really asking that, just thought maybe there might be a story or two from shooting that he'd like to share.
 |He gets back on the phone and I try a different approach.  I figure I'll talk about his past.  I say, ""Hello, Mr. Reed.  I see that you and Lee Marvin spent a lot of --"" CLICK.
 |And that concluded all interactions between me and Mr. Oliver Reed for the rest of our lives.
[I have two questions. 1: how painful was it for you having to watch Joaquin phoenix live on set on letterman? (you know which episode\) 2: what is your opinion on Jay Leno and this whole Conan/Jay thing. (great show last night btw\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pixhb?context=5)|The Joauin Phoenix thing is not painful for us at all.  I'm never worried during those situations because   I always have supreme confidence in Dave.  And boy did he come through with flying colors.  When he told Joaquin, ""I wish you could have been here tonight,"" it was tremendous.  The place exploded. I thought Conan was an incredible guest last night on our show.  He was really hilarious.  I'm a big Conan fan, really from the start when he took over for Dave in Late Night.  I remember the first cold opening he did with him walking to work and everyone telling him, ""You better be better than Letterman!"" I immediately thought, 'This guy is really smart and funny.""  The idea of going into Dave's old studio and not being suffocated by the past, and moreover creating your own original brand of that show, is something for which I think Conan deserves enormous credit.

[This is why i love dave more than any other host. he always knows how to stay on top of every situation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjhap?context=5)|That is why I love Dave more than any other host.  That and the other hosts didn't put my kids through college.
[How did you get into the industry? Is it tough to get your feet of the ground when trying to become a writer for TV?  Also, who is the longest in the Letterman Shows Shower? Is it David?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piwvp?context=5)|I started as an intern at Late Night one year out of college.  Here's a tip: once you get into a place, you start putting small amounts of poison in the watercooler.  Not enough to kill anyone, just enough to make everyone a little slower, a little duller.  Next thing you know: head of the company!
[That explains a lot about the show &amp; the network.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pl0gl?context=5)|And show business in general.
[How much does Dave hate Jay Leno? Is it real or is it mostly for show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj75m?context=5)|They need each other to survive like Superman and Lex Luthor.  (Just so we're clear: Dave = Superman)
 |Honestly, I don't think Dave spends a lot of time thinking about Jay.  As Dave said on last night's show, they've known each other for a long, long time so I'm not really sure even I completely understand the relationship.
 |When they shot the Super Bowl commercial together there was no tension or hostility at all.  It was professional.
[Who were some of the worst guests to deal with on Letterman?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pitpd?context=5)|The answer to this is never as dramatic as you want it to be.  We really haven't had a lot of big diva incidents and such.  Everyone always asks me, ""Is so and so nice?""  Our segment producers have a more thorough interaction with them and can give fuller answers, but generally everyone is on their best behavior when they do our show.
 |Occasionally a publicist might get aggressive.  I'll leave the names out because we have to work with these people, but once I remember a publicist threatening to pull a guest because he/she/it didn't like the way we had formatted the show.  Specifically, the order of the guests.  I politely told he/she/it that they couldn't tell us how to format our show, much as I would never tell he/she/it how to producer their movie/album/book.
 |The publicist turned to his/her/its assistant publicist and said, ""Call Jay and see if he has an opening.""  At which point I turned to our talent booker and said, ""Call Tom Brokaw and see if he's available for tonight.""
 |And then somehow everything magically worked out.
[So we know the guest wasn't Tom Brokaw. How many does that leave?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj82f?context=5)|Nice work detective.  Unless it WAS Tom Brokaw and I was just using him to throw you off the trail.
 |Your move.
[You are a fine diplomat sir. How about Crispin Glover? Were you there during the 'incident'? I always wondered if it was staged, but it looked pretty scary at the time. God, I'm old.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjkrt?context=5)|I was there when Crispin had his incident, but I was pretty removed from the action.  I think I was just a talent assistant that time.  My personal belief is that it was comedy gone wrong, and, in the words of my boss circa 1985, we all know how painful that can be.
[Can we infer that every time a same-network star comes on that's not plugging something there was a cancellation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjrvf?context=5)|Do we even get that anymore?

[I was a guest on the Late Show audience show and tell, and it was probably one of my favorite memories in my life.  Always been a big fan of Dave.  My question:  Is Dave planning on retiring anytime soon, and if so, any rumblings as to who could be his Late Show successor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pivj1?context=5)|I really have no idea when Dave is going to want to retire.  Dave is in a rarified position in show business in that he can choose when to get off the stage.  It's rare.  Normally, someone shoves you off with a meat hook and there's usually blood and flesh left on the floor.  Dave has to decide for himself when he's had enough.
 |From my standpoint, Dave is still as good as he ever was -- in some ways, better than he ever was because he has incredible stature now.  He is bigger than his guests and that creates an interesting dynamic.
 |Night in and night out he's still really, really funny.  And I say this because it is true, and also on the chance that he finds this IAmA.  I'm not an idiot, people! 
[What's Dave like in person? Do you guys get along?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj66b?context=5)|Dave has been on TV for about, I don't know, 5000 hours now.  And largely without a script.  You know what he's like.  You see it every night.  He's not playing a character -- that's him out there.  His honesty as a performer is his biggest asset.  You always know what he's thinking or feeling about something.  He's just not a phony, and that is absolutely the case off the air as well.  The fact that he expresses himself in such a unique and funny way night in and night out, well, that's the reason we've all had jobs for this many years.
[So no, then?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pligs?context=5)|Hahahaaha.  We get along great.  There has been no bigger influence in my life than Dave.
[In your mind, who are the standouts able to form the next generation of late night hosts?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pirj5?context=5)|I think there is huge talent out there across the board: Ferguson, Fallon, Kimmel and of course Conan, Stewart and Colbert.  The problem for these guys is not their ability, but the change in the TV landscape.  Talk shows at their core are meant to be sort of filler shows at the end of the prime time day.  Now with DVR, people can watch CSI or whatever else they want at 11:30 p.m.  It's tough competition.  Plus throw in Adult Swim, video games, fascinating Reddit IAmas like this one -- I don't think anyone will ever again have the mantle the way Johnny and Dave did.  It's just not set up that way.
[How's does one get into writing for a late night talk show?  Any advice you can give?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj2ms?context=5)|It's never easy, but I have to say it's easier now than ever because there are so many places.  Just find any outlet for your jokes.  Cable shows.  Reality shows.  Game shows.  Even if you can start by just getting in the door as a production assistant.  A writer's assistant is a great way in.
 |Here's a success story:  Tracey Wigfield.  She was a page at CBS.  I met her, hired her as an assistant on Knights.  Gave her a chance to write some ADR (additional dialogue recording) lines for a scene when Jon and I were too busy.  She did a great job.  I recommended her for a writer's assistant job at 30 Rock.  She got it.  Did a great job.  Now she's on staff at 30 Rock.  I think she was nominated for a Writer's Guild Award for one of her scripts.  (Maybe she won -- don't know). Tina Fey told me she's doing great up there.
 |Bottom line: her career is better than mine now.  Advice: Don't ever help anyone.
[Oh god, I screwed it up didn't I?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj0u2?context=5)|I think that actually looks better than me, and also answers that other guy's question about whether Dave ever tried to seduce me.
[Rob, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being Barack Obama and 10 being Adolph Hitler, how racist is Michael Ian Black?

[What kind of car do you drive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pizll?context=5)|I have never been a car guy.  For years I drove a beat up Honda Hybrid, but we actually used it as a prop in the movie and it got sort of destroyed.  (That sounds more exciting than it actually is.  It wasn't a big car chase -- just a character throwing rocks at it.  It's one of the funniest scenes in the movie.)
 |I now drive a Lexus Hybrid.  45 m.p.g.  We are big into environmental stuff in my family.  My wife is on the board of the Connecticut Audubon, we use no chemicals on the lawn, my wife built a summer house that is Silver Leed certified -- if that means anything to any of you.
 |But, the real reason I stepped up to a Lexus is because I needed a good stereo system so that I could listen to Mike and Tom Eat Snacks every day on my way to work.  I told Tom Cavanagh that he owed me for the car and he actually wrote me a check.
[What selection does Dave have into choosing the musical guests? He seemed to REALLY like the Hold Steady, and the Gaslight Anthem. If he likes the band, does that increase the chances of them being asked back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj592?context=5)|Dave doesn't get involved a ton with the music bookings. Certainly he has his favorites and, as with everything on the show, we tailor things to what we think Dave likes.  Sheila Rogers is the head of our talent department and Sheryl Zellikson (please let me have spelled that correctly) is specifically dedicated to music bookings.
 |The music has become one of my favorite parts of the show.  It's a real treat for me each night to stand on the stage and watch such great musicians.
[Hi, Rob. Do you listen to Mike and Tom Eat Snacks? If so, what do you think? Also, do you have any funny stories about Tom and Michael from your 'Ed' days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piq84?context=5)|Mike and Tom Eat Snacks is my favorite thing in the world.  It is embarrassing what a fan I am of that show.  (Except for the two episodes I guested on.  I knew full well I was ruining their show, but I was so excited to be on I didn't even care.)  I think those guys are geniuses and that podcast is one of the funniest things being done right now in all of comedy.
[It seems like lately Dave has just become a bitter old man. I loved watching him and his slightly aloof take on the world always killed me, but it just seems like the joy has gone out of him. Any thought to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj5tz?context=5)|You say bitter old man, I say hilarious national treasure.  Potato-potahto.
[I have NEVER understood the Paul angle. I was watching the show from even before you started there and Paul has always seemed creepy, strange, odd, and his music sucks. I just don't get it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj5tz?context=5)|The Spanish redub show was part of my writing submission.  So you're talking, oh, 25 years ago?  I think the show has appropriately evolved to a great place.  You don't want to be Gallagher smashing watermelons in your 60s.  Part of Dave's genius is to have smartly evolved the show into what he is comfortable and great at doing.  You have to keep moving forward.
[He's a legend for good reason, I just remember how happy and joyful he used to be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pkv57?context=5)|Also, I remember getting a ton of complaints from the Miami affiliate because people thought we were just running the show in Spanish from then on.
[I can't fucking believe you were the guy who did the dubbed show. If memory serves the guest was someone like Jacqueline Bisset.

 |There was a period of time when I was headwriter that I ate a turkey hero from Rupert every day for two years.  And I went down to his store at some point and saw that he had started naming sandwiches after staff members.  Everyone had a sandwich named after them.  Not me.
 |I said, ""Rupert, why do I not have a sandwich named after me?  I ordered a sandwich every day for two years!""  And Rupert looked at me and in his laconic dulcet tone said, ""You're sandwich is too boring.""
[What is your collaborative writing process like with Jon Beckerman? Do you prefer working with a co-writer, do you also write strictly solo? How did you two come up with the idea of We Made This Movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pizib?context=5)|I'm the luckiest man alive to have found a partner like Jon Beckerman.  He's a genius, super funny, and, quite frankly, easy on the eyes.  We were lucky in that we both grew up together working for the Late Show.  I was made headwriter a week after he was hired as a writer.  He then went on to be headwriter when I became EP.
 |When I was headwriter I would often gather two or three writers in my office when it was crunch time.  Jon was always in that group.  He's really one of the best ever Letterman writers.  So we have a great shorthand.
 |Our process is that we talk and talk and talk and talk.  And then talk more about an idea.  We discuss characters, scenes, story.  We end up making a very detailed outline.  (This may be residue from our days doing ""Ed"").  After we have a detailed outline, we divide things up and write scenes individually, but by then we understand the dynamics of those scenes in detail.  It may also be that we have jokes or ideas from our talks that end up in those scenes.
 |When we're done, we give each other notes.  It's like I'm the boss of the stuff he writes and he's the boss of the stuff I write.  The goal is to never have anything in a script that either of us doesn't like.
[I remember seeing an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast that was written by some writer's of The Late Show. I can't remember which episode, but were you involved with that? Any interesting stories or anything to say about Space Ghost?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj7k2?context=5)|I liked Space Ghost a lot, but was not involved.  I believe the writer you're thinking of is a guy named Matt Harrigan who used to work for us.  Very funny guy.  Very nice guy.
[What formal/ informal education do you think was most beneficial to helping you do what you do? Who is you favorite guest to have on The Late Show? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjd0o?context=5)|In some ways my education didn't contribute at all, however, when Jon Beckerman and I were writing ""Ed,"" I found that every ounce of brain was tapped at some point to be used in scripts.
 |The more references I had, the more I know about -- no matter how irrelevant it might seem: from Shakespeare to Art History -- at some point, it came in handy.
 |Favorite guests for me are: Howard Stern, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, Marty Short.   And Conan was great last night.  There are more, but I'm forgetting.
 |The people that I admire are the people that realize that while they might be there to promote their project, our show is OUR project.  And they are a part of it.  Guys like Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Marty Short work really hard at their appearances.  They are huge stars.  They don't have to do anything.  But they come sometimes in advance and shoot stuff and prepare bits.
 |One of my best memories is directing ""Dave and Steve's Gay Vacation.""  This was Steve Martin's idea.  Jon Beckerman and I wrote a lot of the specifics, but Steve was really the guys behind it.  There was a moment where I was explaining something to Dave and Steve and they're both looking up at me.  It was an out of body experience.  A little voice in my head said, ""Two of the greatest comedians of our generation are listening to you right now.""
[Any thoughts on the Larry Sanders Show ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piqaz?context=5)|I was a big fan.

[Morning Rob. You recently Directed your first feature. Do you miss 35mm film? How did you approach We Made This Movie in terms of determining a Directing style and what are the challenges of directing your inaugural feature film as opposed to episodic television and which did you enjoy better?

Thanks for your insights, Rob!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4piqo4?context=5)|My first directing experience was on Ed, which was shot on film.  I know I am supposed to miss film, but I don't think I directed enough on film to have a nostalgic feeling for it.  I directed the pilot of ""Knights of Prosperity"" on video and I loved it.  It's much easier and faster.  You don't have to change lenses.  It gives you great flexibility.
 |Our DP on We Made This Movie is a guy named Chris Sargent who is a big talent.  (Our DP on Ed was Michael Slovis who also is a big talent -- he's now on CSI).  A good DP can make shooting digitally look plenty good.
 |On WMTM, we shot everything the way high school kids would shoot it.  No dollies, no cranes -- nothing they wouldn't have themselves.

Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pj0x7?context=5)|On a show like Late Show (and Late Night) that's been around so long, there are eras.  Sometimes people want to feel like their particular era was the best or the most important.  I don't think that way.  I think it's all part of a big quilt.
 |The early days of the show -- before I was there -- were magical.  Merrill Markoe and that group redefined television and I don't think anything can compare to those early days.
 |The show had a whole other explosion in the 90s when we first moved to CBS.  I had thought at the end of NBC that Dave couldn't get any more famous, but when the show moved to 11:30 it existed at a whole other level.  We would do stuff and the next day people on the street would talk to me about it.  It was crazy.
 |And I think there's a whole other chapter out there -- whenever Dave ultimately retires.  That will perhaps be the most memorable moment of all.
 |As for my favorite stuff, I think it would be the remotes we did with Dave.  Probably the ""Fun with Rupert"" pieces would be at the top of my list.  Dave was amazing at that.  I laughed all day doing those.
[Did you get to take home any nifty free stuff from the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk3gf?context=5)|New person comes in.

I am new to it, but I find it fascinating.  I don't have enough time, but I could easily find myself becoming addicted to it.  I love the celebrity stuff, but I'll take all the ""I work at McDonalds"" or ""I just got struck by lightning"" you got.

It was a crossroads for all of us.  I always thought Dave would be great at 11:30.
 |One funny thing I remember from that time was how much thought we put into that first show.  It's all Dave cared about.  And then we came in the next day, I remember Dave looking at me and laughing and saying, ""Oh my God, we gotta do more of these!""

[Not even Julia Roberts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pmyrl?context=5)|That's really funny.  I actually had originally written: Nope.  Except for Julia Roberts.  No joke.
[As someone finishing school in TV production, do you have any advice for me on producing my own shows? as in, what is the best way to present and pitch a show? who are the best people to pitch to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjt06?context=5)|TV shows are more about the people doing them than the idea.   It's like starting a business.  ""Ed"" cost $2 million an episode.  We made 83 hours.  That's $166 million dollars that people had to pay for that show.
 |Of course they didn't have to write that check all up front, but you get the idea: they want people with track records, who have shown they can run a business.
 |Having said that, when Jon and I did Ed we had no track records and had no idea what we were doing.  So I may very well have no idea what I'm talking about.  And yet, that doesn't stop me from talking!
[Ed has launched the careers of so many stars (Justin Long, Julie Bowen, John Slattery and Ginnifer Goodwin\).  How could Paramount or NBC not want to release this?  They release so much other crap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pk938?context=5)|That's been my pitch exactly: ""Come on!  We're just as crappy as everyone else!""
 |We were certainly blessed with that cast.  A lot talent there.  And very nice people.  Many of them are my best friends today.
 |Here's a little ""Ed"" anecdote for you: I wrote and directed Larry Teng and Lesley Boone's wedding proposal.
 |That's right.  Larry Teng, who worked on the show, and who is now a big time director, came to me and Jon and asked if he could propose to Lesley on camera.
 |So we wrote a scene where the whole cast is sitting around the bowling alley and Molly (Lesley's character) is talking about how she's the only one without a spouse.  (This was after Ed had proposed to Carol.)  She's going on and on about how she's never going to find anyone.  It was a completely made up scene.  And then Larry -- who was not an actor on the show.  He worked in post production -- walks in, gets on one knee and asks Lesley to marry him.
 |The look on her face was amazing.  She had no idea what was going on and we had it all on film.  Her parents were there and came out.  It was really nice.  And now they have the cutest babies ever!!!
[I'm an aspiring writer, still in college right now but want to get in the TV industry after I graduate. How did you go about transitioning from intern to writer on the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/tt9sy/i_am_rob_burnett_executive_producer_of_the_late/c4pjfwq?context=5)|The best advice if you want to be a writer is to write.  It sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised.  When I got my job at Letterman, I was already writing movies with a buddy of mine from college -- Steve Engel (who is now a bigshot successful TV writer).  But my point is to just keep writing, get it into the hands of people as close to show business as you can, and hope for the best.  It's also worth trying to get any kind of job on a production to get in the door.
[PS: Knights of Prosperity never got its due, I loved that show. I still think about the one where Donal Logue pretends to be an architect all the time. And of course ""Ed"" was excellent as well.

He had three tapes and he asked me to look at them and tell me what I thought.  He was considering showing them on our show.  (I honestly don't remember what they were.)
 |I watched the tapes and told him I thought he should play one and not all three because they didn't build on themselves.  He couldn't have been nicer.  He said, ""Right!  You're right.  Thank you.  We'll just show one.""
 |It was a lovely interaction.  He ran the one tape.  It played well.  It was all good.
 |Next morning I tune into the radio show and hear him going on and on about how dare I tell him what's funny.  Who does Rob Burnett think he is?  Telling me what I can do and can't do?  Etc...
 |I think it's all professional wrestling with Howard.   I love the guy.
[So here's my question: what happened? He is more like Leno these days and he kind of kisses his guests ass (sorry Dave\).

That's one thing Dave isn't.  He never clung to his old act.  At times, as headwriter, it was painful because Dave started refusing to do stuff that you knew would work.  But he was right.  He has a compass for himself like no one else I have ever seen.  I admire it.

tu3s0,1,2012-05-18,Summer work Legality Issues,Porkchopdreams,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tu3s0/summer_work_legality_issues/,"Hey Reddit, 

I am in desperate need of some help.
I recently accepted an internship down in the states for the summer. The internship is a paid one for a few months down here. The problem is, I am a Canadian citizen, and I have no idea how to go about the legality issues involved. I've looked into a few forms, and the J1 looks most appropriate, however, the company I am interning with is smaller and has never dealt with this type of program, and thus I need a bit of guidance for both me and the company.

There is unfortunately an extra caveat to this problem. I am already down here in the states, and I have been working for the last month with the company. It has not been until this week that the company informed me I need to find a way to make this internship legal (long story short, they've been to busy and in need of help to notice until now that this situation is illegal).

Any advice would be much appreciated,

twm65,0,2012-05-20,Girlfriend's work visa was denied. Airline won't refund her ticket. Any ideas?,ajfriend,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/twm65/girlfriends_work_visa_was_denied_airline_wont/,"My girlfriend is set up with an internship in India through AIESEC, where she'd be doing marketing and advertising for a technology company. She bought her plane tickets while her work visa application was being reviewed. The embassy got back to her, basically saying that they were suspicious of her being a journalist. They even asked her to write up a document where she would promise to not write any articles about India while she was there, or anytime after she left. We're not really sure why they're making such a big fuss, but we've heard that it might be because they're worried about articles highlighting, say, government corruption and hurting foreign investment.

Her visa has so far been delayed twice, and she's already had to pay to push back her flight plans. Right now, her case is under further ""review"", and it's unclear how long this process will take, or if she'll even get a visa at the end of it. She was super excited to be going to India, but this process has been so long and is costing her so much money that she'd like to cancel her ticket and get a refund. However, the airline, British Airways, isn't willing to refund her. Even to change the ticket to go somewhere else would involve ridiculous fees.

She has two flights. The Brazil-London flight is more expensive and is refundable. The London-Delhi flight is cheaper, but non-refundable. The airline is telling her that the restrictions of the London-Delhi flight apply to both, so she can't even get the refund on the Brazil flight, which seems pretty sleazy to me.

Does she have any hope of getting any sort of refund, seeing as this visa issue is out of her hands? Even just changing the flight to come visit me in the U.S. would be great, as long as the change fees aren't too bad.

Unfortunately, the airline isn't being very flexible. She told them her situation, and asked what her options were. She was basically told that she'd lose her money.

Are there any negotiating tricks that can help her out here? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

tvmdx,1,2012-05-20,Long-Term Relationship Going South?  Need Reddit's Help!,throwaway_13003,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tvmdx/longterm_relationship_going_south_need_reddits/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.  

Long-time girlfriend (6+ years) and I grew up together from first grade on.  We were friends, never lovers...Went to prom together as friends.  Separated at high school graduation and went to separate states for school.  Three years later, I get an email from her asking how I've been.  This leads to phone conversations, which then leads to relationship.  I moved to where she was living and got an awesome job.  We lived together, things were going great.  We had a great friendship, deep conversations, and awesome sex.  Then the economy turned south and while my job was still secure, it was far less awesome.  I decided to move back to our home state to attend graduate school.  She was fine with this and even encouraged me, as it would lead to a more secure life for us later on.  We bought a home together and she travelled frequently to and from our hometown for her work.  
Two years of graduate school passes and everything is still good between us.  It's not perfect because we see each other frequently, but not all the time.  Her job gets transferred to the other side of the country... much too far to travel to and from our home.  I made the decision to transfer graduate schools to move with her.  We began renting out our house.  Things were good, but money was tight.  Living in a new city and attending graduate school left little time for a decent job.  I got some great internships which have led to some great opportunities.  However, this lack of funds caused her to have to work more in order to compensate.  Her job requires 10-14 hour days and sometimes 7 day weeks (This in not just due to our need for money, but also the nature of her industry).  She's often tired, and the relationship wanes.  I try to pick up the slack, taking care of our dogs, doing laundry, cleaning, picking up groceries etc., all while going to school and working internships on a full-time basis.  I want to make it as easy as possible for her.  Sex falls to about once every 3 to 4 weeks, and she all but stops communicating.  We have lots of fun times, but some mediocre times too.  I try to reinforce that once I'm done with school, things will be better.  I have some great leads at jobs and the money will be good.  She can work less, even stop at some point.  We can travel and do all the things we've put off.  Plus, we'll have more time together to enjoy each other.  Last week, I graduated.  The night before graduation, she tells me she needs a break from our relationship.  She says she feels too tied down, like she can't enjoy her life.  She wants to ""find out where she wants her life to go.""  Tells me I'm her best friend and she still loves me.  
This past Monday, I moved into our spare bedroom to give her time and space.  I thought maybe she's having an hard time at work because she's been working so hard as I worked toward this goal.  I've been leaving her alone to give her the space she says she wants.  Meanwhile, after I moved out of our joint bedroom, she's been coming home later and later.   She got home at 12:30a the first night, then 1:30a, 2:15a, 3:30a, and last night she didn't come home.  She finally arrives at 12:30p this afternoon.  
Flashback to the past few years since our recent move together.  She has a cell phone but rarely uses it...she keeps it on silent most of the time.  It's impossible to get a hold of her because she's so against being reachable constantly.  I've gotten used to it, but it can be frustrating.  Anyway, starting this week, on my graduation day, she's been texting the same number over and over.  About 70 texts since last Sunday.  Late at night, even after she gets home.  I notice this as I'm paying our cell phone bill.  Definitely out of character for her as she was so against having her phone on and/or using it regularly.
Then, finally, after not seeing her all week, I see her yesterday morning as she's leaving for work.  She asks if I still love her and gets emotional.  I tell her, ""Of course I love you sweetheart.""  She leaves and I say bye.  After not coming home last night, since she's been home today, she doesn't really even acknowledge me.  I told her that I'm giving her space, but it's hard living in the same place and not seeing each other occasionally.  However, we've been in a long-term relationship, and it doesn't need to be like this.  She says that ""it's awkward for her.""  I told her if she's seeing someone else, to tell me so I'm not holding out hope that we might reconcile.  She couldn't even respond to my statement.  
I'm starting to study for my state licensure test beginning tomorrow and this is making it very hard to concentrate.  I've always felt like she was perfect for me, and I care about her deeply, but I can't be with her if she wanted a break to cheat with someone else.  

Advice Reddit?

TL;DR:  Girlfriend of 6+ years wanted a break, texting an unknown number constantly, but giving me hope of reconciliation.  Not sure if she's cheating or how to even respond."

I know I can do it and maybe get by with A's and B's, but I'll have absolutely no time for anything else (personal projects, etc.). This is a problem because my portfolio is very light and my gpa is sitting at a 2.8. Last semester I took 12 hours, which enabled me to get straight A's and build a decent web app. 
So my question is, should I take less hours and graduate a semester late(thus getting a higher gpa and a thicker portfolio) or should I try to graduate as soon as possible?
It's very important to note that I'm paying out of state tuition (15k a semester). Also, I haven't yet completed an internship, and feel that I would be better off doing one next summer(meaning graduating later) rather than after I got my degree.
Thanks!"

I am 24 and will be completing my Bachelors (finally) in about a year and a half. I have worked in IT since I was 18. It all started with an internship at a large corporation and I recently got a nice job at a small business. 

I never intended to get into this field, but my uncle offered me the initial internship and I gladly accepted. In the last six months or so I have come to realize that the odds of me applying for a corporate IT job after I graduate are quite high and because of this I have decided to take Computer Programming in C and I fucking love it. It has completely inspired me and I finally enjoy working with computers for the first time ever. I plan to take courses and master these languages:  C, Java, and Python. I also plan to take Networking and Unix/Linux courses. My current major is Political Science. 

My questions are: is it essential that I major in Computer Science if I want to get into this field? Would a minor in Computer Science or Computer Engineering be sufficient (maybe a minor is not even possible). If I want to get into this field after graduation, do you think I should get a degree or certificate in something related to Programming or will taking those classes, getting a BA in a subject and my IT experience be enough to get my foot in the door?

Please ask questions if you need too.

**;TLDR
I have 5+ years of experience in IT, both corporate and small business, I recently started learning programming languages and I love it. I plan to take other languages and Computer Science classes. Should I go for a degree in something related to programming or will the experience be enough to get me in the door? Granted that the IT experience I have does NOT include programming.**

Thanks!

I plan on majoring in software engineering. 

One of the colleges is a pretty hardcore tech school. 70% boys (I am a guy by the way). I was looking at the facebook page and I saw no one there that I really thought I could be friends with. Most had anime or video game characters for their profile pictures (not that there's anything wrong with that). I got the same feeling when I went to visit the campus. However, this college has an extremely good job placement rate, which is its main selling point. Above 90% of graduates got a job 6 months out of college.

The other college is more of a real university, with a wide range of majors. When I visited this campus I loved the atmosphere there, and I felt like I could fit right in with the people. However, the engineering department isn't nearly as big, and I am not sure about the job placement rate. However the course work looked a lot more in my favor; a lot of hands on classes as opposed to sitting in front of a computer. This college also does not require internships (they can be taken, though), while the other one does.

So I was just wondering, would one choice be better than the other for my overall college experience, and onwards after that?"

I recently dropped my laptop and half the screen appears to be either completely white or have multicoloured lines running down it. It's pretty much the definition of broken. [Here is an image of the screen.](http://i.imgur.com/vdu1C.jpg)

The problem I'm facing is that I'm far from tech savvy and I'm pretty poor. Pretty much all my money goes on rent these days and I've been using my laptop for an internship I'm currently part of. So I'm in a serious conundrum.

Here are my details and questions:

The laptop is a Toshiba Satellite A660-11m. The screen details are as follows:

* size : 40.6cm (16.0”) 
* type : Toshiba TruBrite® HD TFT High Brightness display with 16 : 9 * aspect ratio and LED backlighting 
* internal resolution : 1366 x 768 
* response time rise + fall (Typ.) : 8 ms

So my questions. How much am I looking at for a screen replacement of this sort? I'm a bit wary of taking it into any computer repair shops in my city (Liverpool, England) as I'm ripe to be ripped off. How hard is it to replace the screen myself and could I save myself a few pounds? I'm not tech savvy but I'm a really quick learner and youtube pretty much has tutorials on everything these days.

Any help would be massively appreciated. I've looked after this laptop so well as it was a present my Dad got me for graduating from university. A piece of my soul died when I seen it hit the floor.

Thanks again."

tyxp2,447,2012-05-22,How automation saved the girls' evening,knight666,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/tyxp2/how_automation_saved_the_girls_evening/,"Before I begin, I must establish some backstory.

I'm in college to become a game programmer. Currently I'm doing an internship at my school and hopefully I will graduate next year. Every day I go to my tiny office to toil away at a simulation game to help disabled children.

And I do mean it's a *tiny* office. What the school did was basically take the end of a floor and cordon it off with cheap walls (you know, the type where you can't put a nail in because it might bring down the wall). It doesn't have airconditioning, it doesn't have a window that can be opened and there are four desktops + a bunch of laptops heating it up.

There are four of us here, but two (the art girls) are working on a different project, a virtual supermarket. For the past few weeks they've been building and labeling virtual products in Maya (ed: a professional 3D modeling tool). It's what we call ""monk's work"", because in the old days, monks would copy the entire Bible by hand.

But yesterday, one of the teachers came in in a bit of a panic. Turns out they needed all this stuff done today, preferably *yesterday* because they had to resort to doing simulations on screenshots instead of the real scene.

One of the problems, the girls complained, was that they had convert all the textures from PNG to DDS. I wasn't really listening, because this wasn't my project, but somehow those words bounced around in my head. And they connected to... AssetBuilder.exe! You see, for our own project, I had already solved this project. I was sick of loading times that ran into the minutes, so I wrote a tool (using some open source NVIDIA code) to convert PNG and TGA images to DDS textures.

I told them that I would tweak it for a bit and they were ecstatic! It worked very well, converting all images to textures automatically.

Then, the teacher came back with some new bad news: all the items had to be labeled. That meant loading the scene in Maya, selecting an object, clicking on a MEL script and entering ""product"" in the ""Node ID"" field. For 1700 products. The girls estimated it would take 10 hours to do that by hand.

Seeing my previous success with automation, the teacher turned to me. Couldn't I, you know, do some programming magic on the script to automate it? I told him I had never done MEL scripting (ed: Maya's scripting language) but I'd give it a shot.

I quickly realized I was in way over my head. Fixing the script would require understanding how it worked and it was *massive*. I abandoned it and focused instead on the end result. You see, the script was for a converter. And it would convert selected objects to an Ogre .scene file. Which is... XML!

So I glanced over it and it was full of definitions like this:

    &lt;node name=""awesomeProduct001"" id=""""&gt;
         &lt;mesh name=""AwesomeSpread"" /&gt;
    &lt;/node&gt;

Luckily, Notepad++ was installed, so I wrote a quick regex:

     From: &lt;node name=\""(.*?)\"" id=\""\""&gt;
     To: &lt;node name=""\1"" id=""product""&gt;

I ran it and saw those magic words on the screen, saving them 10 hours of work: 1739 items converted. 

I can't say I blame them for not trying to automate it, they're art people after all. But when you're a programmer, everything looks like an opportunity for automation. :)

Help?,JerkJenkins,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/u1izi/i_want_to_retrain_to_learn_programming_for/,"Some background: I’m in my mid-20s, went to school for Corporate Communications and ended up in marketing/ advertising/ sales/ PR. I’m just not satisfied and have an itch to learn a new area of expertise – which is why I want to retrain myself as a programmer, preferably with a focus on developing software for use online and developing online applications.

I have a few questions:

- Is it worth it to try for it at this point? 
- What will I need to learn at a bare minimum?
- What would be the most useful skills to learn?
- How can I do this relatively cheaply?
- Would a marketing/ business background be useful coupled with programming and development knowledge?

I admittedly don’t have much experience at all with programming – just a bit of HTML / CSS in college and some bare-minimum C++ in high school. I picked up a book on Ruby a few months back and have been enjoying learning through it, though. My current plan is to teach myself the basics and some beginner - intermediate skills. Then, after I have a decent base, take classes at local community colleges/ online classes as needed to fill in the gaps and round off my knowledge. I’ll then either pursue internships in programming and development, or I’ll directly apply for a Computer Science school and pursue a degree more seriously while working on acquiring internships and actual programming experience.

What's the best course of action to take?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u1e74/got_a_misdemeanor_in_chicago_whats_the_best/,"Hi guys, Reddit has helped me before and this time I need more help than last time. Definitely. 

This is a hypothetical uh.. a situation story that could have happened to some guy I know. eh-hem*

So short version of the problem is I was double hopping onto the CTA,  got caught by a police officer, and I cited a misdemeanor with a hearing date. 

The longer version is I'm back in the city for summer break, didn't have a cta card, and got egged on by my sister. Btw this is not for an excuse, I got caught doing something stupid, so I'll pay the fine or do whatever is necessary of me. Yes, yes, brain is dumb as a brick. 

This happened after the day after NATO when all the people were leaving, so heighten police watch, yah I know! I'm dumb as a rock, moving on. I double hopped with my cousin, and then this officer comes out "" Hey you! Come here!"" I thought aww a ticket or citation. Instead I get hauled off the station. 

They took me down to the closest station, and held me for about 7 hours, till 12am release. Did fingerprints and all that. Now I'm registered. And I have a court date. 

The problem is I have to leave for a internship before the court date. So when I get a legal representation from a lawyer? Would that cost me a shit ton!?
 I'm already in college debt. What is a decent average cost for an ok lawyer. I just need a decent lawyer this case.

Also additional questions.
1. My cousin was with me as well, and when he asked the arresting officer where he was taking me. He flat out refused to tell him, and kept asking him ""ARE YOU HIS MOTHER!?"". Yah... are cops always pricks like that? Or is it just procedures?

2. Why was I held for so long on a simple charge as a Misdemeanor is it to teach me a lesson or something? IF, not that I would cause it'd cost too much, IF I had gotten a call to a lawyer could he have gotten me out faster? I wasn't given a call till at least 2-3 hours in, Then I had to wait in a separate holding cell for until midnight.

3. Would this show on my record. Basically if I'm applying for a job from now on and they ask if ""If I have been arrested before?"" I would have to comply legally and say YES? Or only if I'm convicted of the charges?
-If  and if possible, how long do I have to wait before I can erase that from my records?

4. Would my school be informed of this? Will they take away my financial aid for the coming semesters? Yah I'm not a rich, I need my financial aid, dam why did I do it. 

Additional information of facts.
This is my first time arrest.

The cop didn't give me my Miranda rights when he made the arrest and put me into his cop car. I know the Miranda rights are there for questions  only after an arrest. But he asked me some questions in the squad car, and I was frazzled so I answered them. He asked me ""why I did it."" I said"" I shouldn't have"". It was pretty much obvious that he saw me doing it. 
So am I even dumber than an actual rock for cooperating and answering questions? Or should I have just kept my dumb mouth shut?
Do my Miranda rights extended only after I am booked and registered?

Little fun facts in jail I learned in jail.

My cellmates will disclose any information about their case and their past crimes that they had commuted but not charged with. They also will disclose relevant information about crimes that the police are ignorant or reluctant in solving(gang banger murder cases). Wow, that was an eye opener even for me.

Jail is cold, get a hoodie. 

They will check IN your underwear! Apparently for guns after you are held in custody. This officer said they found find a .45 MM gun in dude's underwear before. 

I learned that sometimes officers arresting a person for smoking a blunt will let them off, for reasons unknown. 

If you get caught for a charge that can send you to jail for a long period of time. APPARENTLY they will buy you a pack of smokes and a happy meal.

Now this is all hearsay. But I think it's pretty legit fun facts.
Oh yah it's boring in jail. I counted in my head to 3528-ish. Kept skipping numbers when my mind wandered. How far have you counted before?

Why do we do what we do? We do it because we're human and it was a bad point in time. "

I felt ready for the technical interview, I thought I would be able to ""wow"" them. 

Then this morning I had the interview with the gaming company. **Oh my god** it was **awful**. What's worse is that they asked me such a *simple* question. And I choked. I went straight into coding, when they asked me about my personal projects i just *blanked*. I was nervous as shit and completely blew it. In the afternoon I had my other interview with a financial company over the phone. The man had a heavy accent but I was used to that sort of thing. We went over quite a few tech questions within a 30 minute time frame, and I managed to answer all of them except one. Still I was fairly unsatisfied with the whole phone process.

All that technical preparation just did not prepare me for that face to face interview with 2 software engineers. How can I better myself?

**tl;dr: blew my first real technical interview with my dream internship, and is extremely demoralized. How can I prepare myself better? What do employers expect out of an intern?**"
u0n8x,18,2012-05-23,Occupy the Truth,AncientGreed,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/u0n8x/occupy_the_truth/,"I’ve never sympathized with the idea that the rich become richer by stealing from the poor.  I see these “occupy” groups on the streets and all over the news with their message that corporate greed needs to be stopped.  That financially we are in ruin and that the truth needs to be heard.  Well, whatever their version of “truth” is.  I never expected to be in the position that I am now, but I think that if I am going to be erased like the others I should do my best to try and warn people that our current state is far worse than any nightmare you could come up with.  There are people out there every day lately protesting and wanting you to know the truth.  I’m here to tell you that they only have it half right.

Let’s start from the beginning: I run a very large, very well-known company (it doesn’t matter which one).  Contrary to what some of you may believe, I worked hard to get to where I am.  I didn’t come from money, but I had the drive and determination to get what I wanted.  I started with this company right out of college as a Bud Fox-type, at the bottom of the ladder.  My motto for success had always been “eat shit and learn to love the taste.”  I did whatever was asked of me and more.  This job took over every facet of my life, and as a result I quickly rose through the ranks.  Sure I had to stab a lot of friends in the back along the way, but it used to be my idea that I wasn’t on this Earth to make friends.  Making money was all that mattered to me and I suppose it’s why I eventually was chosen to become the CEO.

As CEO, I quickly learned that we were a money making machine and I was simply along for the ride.  I downsized (or eliminated) departments to increase revenue.  I increased productivity, but offered less rewards for meeting the required goals.  I was making our Investors and Board happy, which made us all rich at the end of the day. 
 
Like most successful companies, we had a high turnover rate.  If a person didn’t hit the ground running within the first day, they were gone.  Who had time to care about anyone walking out the door holding a box?  I expected a lot from my employees, but never gave a second thought when terminating a position over a mistake.  I simply never cared for or respected those under me.  Well, that isn’t entirely true.  There was one person who I saw a lot of promise in.

Bobby Daily was a lot like me when I was his age.  He came in fast and never slowed down.  He excelled at every level and his performance refused to be ignored, even by me.  I took him under my wing and gave him a higher position to test how well he’d do.  I could see that his peers hated him, just as mine had hated me at that level.  He showed a lot of promise.  At some point, there was talk about bringing him into the inner circle of management.  I felt that he was ready, but our Investors wanted a test.  I assigned Bobby to one of our larger clients.  I don’t know if it was the pressure, or the rate at which he’d climbed, but Bobby finally slipped up.  An important document went missing and a deadline came and went.  This was all it took for the Board to lose faith.  I chose to knock him down a peg or two within the company as punishment.  I still saw a lot of value in him, so letting him go was out of the question for me.

Bobby never reported to his new position.  A week went by with no word.  At first I was angry.  I had given him a second chance, and he spit in my face.  At the end of the week I made it a point to go to Human Resources myself to see about contacting him.  I wanted to fire him personally.  The problem began when HR told me they’d no record of a Bobby Daily applying with us, let alone working with us over the course of two years.  This instance caught me off guard, and to be honest, it made me a little afraid.  I didn’t expect foul play at first.  I was simply worried about what the Board might think if they got wind of the incompetence within the company under my watch.  First Bobby was a disappointment, and now an entire department not keeping proper records?  I went straight to my bosses to clean up the mess myself before rumors starting flying.  Imagine my confusion when none of the Board members remembered Bobby either.  These men, these brilliant men who I’d looked up to not remembering the very person we’d had countless, in-depth conversations about over these past few weeks. What the hell as going on?

That same night I stayed later than usual at the office.  Since I was usually the last to leave anyway, nobody would think twice about what I was about to do.  Bobby was an employee; therefore a paper trail of some sort would have to exist.  I decided to dig further into HR and see if maybe there was something they weren’t telling me.  Maybe there was something I was being protected from?  Plausible deniability isn’t uncommon in my line of work after all.  I had to have spent hours digging through paperwork, only to find absolutely nothing.  Not a resume, not a signature, not even a damn W2.  What the hell was going on, and why was I being kept out of it?
The next day at work I was ready to give up on finding the truth.  I thought the better of it once I realized that the answer could mean my entire career.  There was a negative light on Corporate America right now, and I didn’t need it shining on me.  I went about the rest of my day “business as usual” when a lead was literally handed to me.  I was approached by a mail room intern named Tom Duenas.  He had an inter-office envelope in his hands, but seemed extremely nervous.  I had a reputation around the office, so I didn’t think much of it at the time.  It occurs to me now that he wasn’t afraid of me, but of something else.  He gave me the envelope and quickly left.  I pulled out a single page of paper with a handful of names on it.  What was this supposed to be?  I made a copy and asked my secretary to get Tom back into my office.  She informed me that he was gone for the day.  Thinking that these people might work for me, I logged into Outlook and began typing in the company address book.  Five of the six names didn’t come up at all.  As I typed in the final name, I saw a match in the system.  As I reached for a pen to write down a department, I looked up to see the information literally disappear in front of me.  It was deleted before I could get a lead.  I called in my secretary once more and I handed her the copy and asked her to look into these people.  I explained that I was positive one of them worked for us as I just saw them in our system.  It didn’t take her long to come up with nothing.  Not even a lead on the final name.  I asked for the list of names back, and she quickly apologized and explained that it had been shredded.

Later that same night, I returned to HR with the original list I had kept.  Again, I turned up with no information.  If they had worked for the company, there was no record of it.  Tom returned to work two days later.  He seemed different from the other employees in that he was timid and very nervous.  He told me that he had quit a few days earlier and was only picking up his final check.  I kept trying to ask about the list of names he had given me, which only made him more standoffish.  I followed him outside and to his car begging to find out what he knew.  Eventually he gave in.  He told me that the list was in fact people who had worked for me, but were fired.  I told him that there was no proof of that.  He brought up Bobby, and told me that when people are fired, they are erased.  Not just from the company standpoint, but altogether.  Not a single person has been heard from since, and nobody inquires as to why that is: no friends, no family.  No one.  None of this made any sense to me.  I asked him how any of it could be possible.  He claimed that he didn’t know.  It was with that uncertainty that Tom got into his car and drove away.  

“I think it’s time we talked.”  It didn’t take long for those above me to figure out what I had been up to.  I was starting to get scared, and if being asked to step down was the worst of what was to come my way, then I’d welcome it and get far away from here.  Oddly enough, the board had other plans for me.  

“We think it might be time for you to join us.  After all, you’ve certainly earned it, haven’t you?  You’ve done right for yourself, and right by the company.  We could use a man like you before it’s too late.”  Too late?  “It won’t be announced until next week, but we’ve negotiated a merger.  A lot of us at the top will be safe of course, but a lot of people at the bottom will have to go.”  Go where?  Where Bobby and the others went?  “Yes, we’ve noticed that you’ve taken an active interest in some of our ex-employees.  You’ll soon come to understand why we’ve had to deny them, just as you’ll have to.”  What do you mean?  “You’ve helped to make us and the investors very rich, but really that sort of thing was promised to us a long time ago.”  By who?  “*Those* who lack greed in the financial sense.  *They* have no immediate concept of wealth in the same way that we do.”  How is that possible?  “By being older than time itself as we comprehend it.  Our profits go up with no interference, and we become rich when *they* ask for so little in return.  Our needs are complicated: stock points, bailouts, tax money, bonuses, etc.  All that *they* require in return are the souls of our high turnover rates.”  They’re dead?  These were people with families…”Money can buy everything.  Money can even buy silence.  It can buy compliance, and complacency.”  Think of what you are saying.  I can’t be a part of this.  I have to—“What?  You have to what?  Tell the world?  Take a look outside of your office window.  You see those protesting below?  More importantly, do you see the sick and deranged among their ranks?  Those who prefer violence and defecating on cop cars to the half-truth of corporate greed?  You aren’t the only one who knows the whole truth.  There are others with this knowledge, and it has driven them insane.  That is who you’ll find below, and you’ll share in their insanity if you don’t join us.  Your mind will slip into oblivion before you can find a person who’ll believe you.  We are offering you a chance to avoid all of this, and to expand your mind and help you to comprehend things you’ve never even dreamt about.  Now tell us, what will you decide?”

I must end my tale here.  Even now I know that I don’t have much time left.  I sent this record of events to every media outlet that I could think of.  Nobody will print it let alone take it seriously.  This is the only website that I can entrust it to in time, and in the hopes that while I will be gone soon (and my existence altogether), some of you will learn the truth and find a way to do something about it.  About *them*.

There isn't a guarantee of a full-time position after internship is over, but my supervisor has discussed this possibility with me (if there's an opening, which is highly unlikely).

My question is: what do I do in the meantime? When should I start looking at and applying for positions in other companies? When should I approach my supervisor about a possible full-time position?"

What can I do?",fh892hnjik,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u34bn/i_got_a_new_job_but_my_current_employer_is_now/,"So I've worked for this small startup for the past 2.5 years while I am going to school. I started as an intern and I'm still only working part-time. I graduate next month and I landed a job at another company a week after I graduate.

Because it's a startup, I work directly under the big boss of the company. I do a lot of stuff to make his life easier and to get entire projects wrapped and shipped. Because I'm in school, I don't always have time to go into the office to check how my projects are running, I use computers I have at home to run stuff. 

I let my employer know that I would be moving away from the company in a little less than 2 weeks. He showed no emotion but I could tell he was less than thrilled. I said I would finish the current large project I have running at home and then be off, I don't want to leave him hanging, and it is a fairly important project. He said that he wasn't happy about me looking for another job, he said he didn't like me ""doing things behind his back"". However, then he said that I had to finish this other unrelated project which was only half done, and would take a lot of effort.

I was about to object when he said that ""What company did you get a job with? Ah, yeah I know a few VP's there. If you don't finish these projects, I'll make sure you don't have a job at this company."" This was rather intimidating, and so I went along with whatever else he said until I could check on that. He wanted me to stay after I quit and do contract work in addition to my other job. I said I would think about it.

So when I got home I emailed and subsequently talked to a person I interviewed with at the new company. I explained everything and she said that since we are in Washington, we have Terminate-At-Will employment, barring anything I signed when I got to the company. She basically said that she was not a lawyer and the new company can't help me out until I'm actually on the job. She also reassured me that unless I had any major dirt (which I don't) that he could dig up and show to this VP he knows, that she doesn't think he can get me fired.

So now I'm still stuck with what to do. I don't want to leave on bad terms, but he's making it difficult not to. I'm kinda afraid about getting lawyers sent after me, especially if it's in his power (which it very much is, the kind of job I do needs lots of lawyers). And if I tell him I don't want to contract, he'll push more projects on me."

My ex-girlfriend's sister is telling my clients that, I ""beat"" the ""living shit"" out of her sister (my ex) and that she is going to kill me. My ex and I are still good friends and still talk or text on a daily basses. I have never treated her with anything other than respect and kindness, ex or her sister.

Because of the lack of proof, of ""Imminent Threat"", I am having trouble getting a judge to even get a court date. I have had a TRO from 2010, on her for 3 months, after she broke in to my house, the county sheriff's where unable to serve her as she runs do to warrants and lawsuits against her. I was left with little choice but to let it laps. From Jan 2011 to Feb 2012 she was in jail. I also have contacted her probation officer with no forward progress.

I moved back home after school to pay off some of my school debts (including college kid using credit cards debt) - Credit card debt was acquired because I was a dumbass young adult ""Oh fuck yea i'll just charge that"" I know my financial situation and that is why I am living at home to proactively work on the debts. I have my own insurance my own phone payments, my own car my own gas. My parents pay for  my housing and the food I eat while I am here (they insist I have tried)

I am an avid gamer namely PC games, D3 WoW SC2

My dad is an enthusiast against gaming

Currently I work 6 days a week as a cook averaging 45-55 hours a week making &lt;$11 an hour. While I am applying for jobs in my field (probation officer) I thoroughly enjoyed my work at my internship in probation when a client came up and shook my hand after getting her a job and a safe living environment for her and her daughter and said Thank you for helping me I couldn't be here without you I know I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.


After work I come home and like to play some video games and watch netflix

My father exclaimed ""You need to stop playing this shit it is ruining your life, anyone who would play these fucking games is a loser with nothing in their lives. ""

I have very limited friends back home since they are all else where now. So I socialize with my lifelong friends on ventrillo or teamspeak while gaming

I was told ""i have to stop spending time on my computer when my dad is home"" Instead I am supposed to watch tv and ""socialize"" with my parents (socializing is bitching about everything while they are very well off and should have nothing to bitch about but everything is a big deal, essentially it is stressful and annoying to ""socialize"" with them and I find zero enjoyment spending any time with them.

To compromise I have used my culinary skills and have begun cooking for all of their friends and every meal when I am at home. I cook it, I clean it, and I eat dinner with them but afterwards I venture back up to my room and play games with my friends who live everywhere in the states.

I am not sure where to go or what to do, but being asked to stop doing what I enjoy simply because my father does not approve of games really bothers me and has beyond alienated my father and I to the point I would rather sit in my car for hours in a walmart parking lot to wait for him to go to sleep before coming back home

I apologize for the rant and poor me sob story but I have exhausted talking to him and am looking for some advice or input as to how to handle this situation

At the same time, I earned a BS in Applied Computer Science and a BS in Management (dual degree). I get the feeling that my knowledge set is a little different than a lot of programmers: I don't really know much about .NET or web development (back in the day I used to build my own little websites but this was with just Javascript/JScript and HTML). 

My expertise is mostly Java and C++ and I've put a fair bit of my own time into studying beyond just the basic syntax: I can explain how dynamic method lookup and garbage collection work in Java and what’s *really* happening during all those complicated method calls. The programs I've written are more or less the standard data structure stuff like graphs, heaps and other AVL trees, ""splay"" trees. I can also explain what big O/Omega/Theta actually mean, for what that's worth. I’ve also taken it upon myself to learn PL/SQL with what I can download for free from Oracle. 

That being said I've never written a line of production code (although I've seen many millions of lines in COBOL, RPG, JCL, SQL, PL/SQL, .sh scripts, Java, and C#). I never did any internships during undergrad because I needed to keep working full-time to survive, so I'm kind of at a weird impasse where I have some experience but it may or may not be what recruiters are looking for. 

I want to move into business systems analysis or software engineering. I really do love programming and math but people tell me I'm one of the non-typical CS people who are also great with many different types of people and good at interfacing between the IS teams and other employees/customers, so I think maybe becoming a BA would be the best. I've worked side by side with many BAs and I have no doubt I would be great in such a role if given the chance.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you think I can help you out. I'm not looking to make a fortune, ever. Internships would be fine by me and I'm more than willing to start anywhere to prove myself. My autodidacticism is by far my strongest trait: I can teach myself most things with minimal formal instruction and I have a pretty strong acumen for logical science. I’m pretty humanistic as well and have a strong interest in and behavioral psychology. 

I'm in Dallas presently but I'd be willing to relocate to Austin. Thanks for reading.

u4qdg,1,2012-05-25,Recent grad 50+ apps no offers,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/u4qdg/recent_grad_50_apps_no_offers/,"I have applied to 50+ jobs. I am starting to get depressed. A little background about me:

graduated this month with a 4 year Computer Science degree from a top 5 program in the US. I have a 3.2 GPA

I have internship experience with a fortune 500 company

I have been working part time as a web developer for 6 months for a small office

I have had a number of phone interviews, but i haven't gotten past 2nd round interviews everywhere. I am starting to get desperate because I am not in a good situation with my current job. I only make 12.5/hr despite having a degree. I can't really ask for a raise because I told them I am leaving in 3 months, regardless of whether I have a different job or not because I am very unhappy where I am. I have to support myself as well, so I can't quit. This job is a nightmare mostly because I was hired as an entry level developer, but I am the only IT person here. The code I have to work for is a mess, and the company is basically using a database system that is 15+ years old.

I don't really want to do web development. In fact, I hate it. Ever since putting my resume on dice.com, i get calls all the time from recruiters asking for php developers. Sometimes i think these people have absolutely no tech background and just blindly respond based on keywords on resumes. I would rather do application development in C++ or mobile development in Java.

I am not really sure what else I should be doing other than keep putting my resume out there. I missed the career fair at my school, and I am trying to get a job in California, but I have no connections there. Most of the jobs that i have applied to i have done online. At this point though, I would considered anywhere but where I currently am. I am not sure what else i should be doing."
u4bpw,198,2012-05-25,Whats the point in your studying a degree if you can't find my family photos ,Angelojoseph17,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/u4bpw/whats_the_point_in_your_studying_a_degree_if_you/,"During my intership year at university , I got a job at a marketing company. The company itself was owned by one owner, the typical flash type. Guy drove a bentley and had a nice house(mansion), veneered teeth etc. But when it came to spending on IT they always never wanted to invest despite being able to. 

The company had around 100 ish users. Mainly in windows environment and a few macs (people who used them , didnt really use them for the right reason just wanted macs) . 

Being a intern meant my IT manager knew i would have to stick around for the whole year as a part of my degree. Which meant i was given stupid jobs and usually worked from 8 in the morning till 8 at night. No one really appreciated anything I did and if anything IT was a department where everyone just took their frustration on. Being straight out of uni i thought shit is this really what i want to get into. 

The sales team were the worst. They were very driven, by driven i mean assholes who wanted everything right now. Had to be the first in line, never created tickets for work and excepted work to be done within minutes. 

There was always the one guy, he was the top salesman, i guess with that he had the head honcho, main guy asshole persona on him. We had run ins with him lots of times. This guy pretty much made my year horrible. He would ring me at 9 /10/11  pm at night to help him resolve internet problems with his isp and would use the ""i have a pitch to work on for tommorow  so i need to vpn right now"" . He would ring me up and 5 in the morning and say ""hey my blackberry is not receiving emails, I'm out of office today, I need it working now..."" Who the fuck is up at 5 am in the morning... , 100% of the time it was a case of doing a battery pull rather than checking out our bes server.

Another time, he left his laptop on top of his car at the client site and drove off actually running over it. Then he comes back and says i need to get a new laptop, need it working in 30 mins , I also want the same model. My IT manager has no backbone and he would cave into doing whatever other managers wanted just so he was liked by them. Which meant i would drop stuff and do whatever these assholes wanted. 

Towards my end of year i got my sweet revenge on mr sales man of year. He comes into the IT office storming in like a bull and says somehow his computer deleted all his family photos of his laptop. I do my logical think and calm him down and say log a ticket and i will look into it for you. If you stored it on a network drive i will be able to retrieve it. He then mouths of amount how useless our IT department is , how useless i am as an intern (which pissed me) etc etc. I look to my manager and he just says sort this out right now. 

Ask him where he stored it, he says under pictures. Had a look not in there, had a look in the bin , not in there. So i do the most logical thing and go into windows search and search for all images and set it to thumbnail mode. He and my manager sit next to me as try find  it, lo and behold all the images i keep seeing are porn, hardcore porn ..... Mr sales guy suddenly starts sweating going ""hey thats not mine, nooo must be a virus.... "" Hes goes bright red , it was worth it watching this asshole squirm.  As he keeps repeating it another female colleague comes into get a keyboard and she sees the screen and is ""omg thats disgusting"" Sales guy is like ""its a virus keeps downloading porn on my computer"".

At this point i go "" funny.. never come across a virus that only particularly seems to keep downloading milf porn, better write  this on our wiki"" 

Needless to say word went around and thats the last time he ever bothered me till i was there. As much as i hated the places, it was something for my cv and helped me get other jobs when i finished my degree. 

Sorry for being long.

u6hwx,0,2012-05-26,I'm torn between two internships. What do I do?,the_quai,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u6hwx/im_torn_between_two_internships_what_do_i_do/,"So here's the deal:

I specifically didn't apply to art museum internships in the spring when I should've because I wanted to have a more relaxing summer. I didn't want to overhaul my entire wardrobe or be cooped in a museum hall, regardless of prestige. I'm not yet decided in what I want to do with my life but I know that the internship I take in the summer of my junior year is vital in deciding that for me. I feel like I'm shooting myself in the foot due to ""not taking a wonderful opportunity"", but my interest is not in conserving or learning so much about academic art but in producing it. I ended up getting an internship with this one organization that may not be as institutionally valued (we'll call it internship A) but is more active in its creative pursuits (throws parties, produces musicians, has an online visual magazine, etc.) Like most internships it's unpaid, so I applied for funding from my college ($3,000), expecting to hear back on whether or not I would receive that funding by the beginning of May. Around the time I was about to begin the internship (the second week of May) I was still waiting to hear back from my college only to find out that my sponsor &amp; professor lied about completing their forms, thus nulling my chances of receiving any cash at all since it made my application incomplete. Though extremely disappointing, I was beginning to accept the situation for what it was.

This is when things become more complicated. My advisor/professor (the one who had part in making my funding application incomplete though she denies this - I have verification from the head of funding saying otherwise), came up with the idea that I should volunteer at a museum, if they will take me, so I can possibly re-qualify for whatever money is left at the college. The thing is, the processing at that point already is over, so the scheming has pretty low hopes to begin with and applying for any sort of volunteer position at a museum was done and over with in the spring. But she claims she has an in with the museum, made her calls and called me at the most inconvenient of times to complete this application in this rushed week period since hearing back from the college that I didn't get the funding for my other internship.

Just yesterday I started my first day as an intern for internship A and it went along well enough for what it had to offer. Because I no longer qualified for funding with this internship I wouldn't need to commit to the 300hrs he calculated for me to begin with, so we agreed to return back to initial 18hr week the organization offered in the first place. With internship A I would be working 3 days a week for 6hrs each day. That was fine with me since I liked the work I was given to complete while there and for the days I would have off I could devote to my own work. I would also likely obtain worthwhile contacts in the art world to help further my own creative pursuits. 

Much to my surprise, the ""in"" at the museum (Internship B) mentioned by my advisor came through and called me, wishing to set up an interview this upcoming Tuesday. This opportunity is only enticing to me under the guise of still receiving funding from the college this summer. It was why my professor/advisor called in the first place. I never told her I was unhappy with my internship, I was only displeased for not receiving funding from other's (her and my sponsor's) incompetences. In order to receive funding, I have to complete 300 hours at the internship I would be working with. This means that I would have to be working exclusively with the museum this summer if I am to get the position, but this also means that I would have to drop the internship I already have seeing as the work schedules would be in conflict with each other. Internship B is located in the Bronx (a particularly sketchy area recounted by my advisor) and I'm staying in Brooklyn. Internship A is in Brooklyn, thus making it more convenient and price affordable. 

There is no point in taking whatever hours the museum would offer because as much as I wouldn't mind working for them, I can't afford to volunteer my time.  I'd like to note that my landing this internship B position will not ensure funding as per more correspondences so far. Upon questioning my advisor if the funding head has gotten back to her, she had avoided a response, coincidentally or otherwise. This gives me a feeling of her insinuating I should take Internship B over A regardless of funding or not. Most of what I know so far about Internship B does not appeal to me, but if I decide to not take the position, I would threaten my relationship with my advisor, whom for the majority of the stay at my college has otherwise fought for me. I feel guilty or bullied into accepting Internship B considering the degree of her involvement and the abnormality of the museum looking at my application now at all.

I feel so extremely defeated to the point of paralysis. I don't know what to feel or choose. I need her on my side in my academic future, I don't want her being disappointed in my decision to turn down the traditionally coveted opportunity. Please help me."

I was supposed to stay for the rest of summer (I'm just here for a summer internship), but I'm two weeks into this, and I'm already about at my stress limit.
There's a couple of things that bother me, but really the deal breaker is the pets. I've never lived with cats or dogs that shed before, and all of a sudden there are three (four while we're taking care of someone else's dog) in this relatively small townhouse. Unfortunately, I think I've discovered that I'm allergic to pet dander. Also, the dogs are really rowdy and one of them is HUGE. They bark a lot and sometimes keep me awake at night. The cat is soooo sweet, but sheds like crazy!
Would it be horribly rude of me to ask my friend to start looking for another roommate so I can move elsewhere? From what my friend has said of previous sublets, they have not had difficulty finding them before. Do you guys have any advice for me? I'd really like to live somewhere else, but also don't want to ruin my friendship with this person. Even if I move out, we will continue to have close contact throughout the summer (aka, work)."

But this one developer. Oh boy. I wish I could defer her, but unfortunately I was the only lab intern who had the clearance to get into her office. I got tickets nearly every other day from her, but this one takes the cake.

Subject: New keyboard does not work

Content: You recently ordered a new keyboard to replace my old one and it doesn't function correctly. Please come to &amp;lt;office&gt; and diagnose.

I sigh and head over, figuring she'd forgotten to plug it in. I arrive, and her system looks normal. The keyboard is plugged in (it's a fancy new USB keyboard, \*ghost noises\*) and it can control the BIOS fine. I boot into Windows, and suddenly the keyboard stops functioning. It's a Logitech, so it should have no issue with Windows... hmm...

I go fetch my laptop (Thinkpad T30), plug it in there, and it works fine in my copy of Windows. I sigh, picturing the worst, and ask her if she'd done anything to ""prepare"" for the new keyboard.

""Why yes,"" she tells me, ""I heard somewhere you need to delete the old drivers to prepare for the new hardware, so I just deleted the old keyboard drivers. I figured the new keyboard would come with a disc.""

Let's recap: this is a developer who knew enough to *find* the generic HID drivers, but not enough *not to delete them*.

Her old keyboard became a headdesk mat that day.

Epilogue: Threw her drive into a functioning test machine and transferred the HID drivers into system32\\ before returning the system to her. She's never been happier.

I closed the ticket with: ""The usual issue."""

I'm now 22 and this hasn't improved. I've gone to university but am now living back at home with my parents as I am just an intern and do not earn enough to not live there.

So since living at home since March (I went and lived in France for six months after university) she's become a monster. I feel hopeless and sick constantly because of her. She went to the beach today with my dad, I didn't go, and when she came back all she's said is how fat and hopeless I am (I am 5'9 and a UK size 10) she chucked scales at me, asked me whether I wanted pure lard for dinner and now is just going on and on about how pathetic and useless I am to her, and how my dad is on her side with this.
My dad has said nothing in this argument, except to ask me whether I went to the gym.

I have attempted suicide in the past, clearly failed, didn't see anyone about it, just got through university without seeing anyone (various panic attacks throughout, particularly at the end of my final year where I drank and took sleeping pills, scared about going home again) I spoke to my doctor about not sleeping well due to exam stress and got given the pills, but I don't have them anymore.
I want to speak to someone, I do, but I don't get home until late and by then the surgury is shut, and I can't really take a morning off or whatever to go to the doctor as I'm just an intern and really want this job :(

Sorry for the rant, thanks for reading if you got this far.. I don't really know what I'm going to get out of this post, but hey, feel slightly calmer for just writing it down. For the staying with friends bit, not really an option as they all live with parents and I don't want to worry or upset them, and I'm seeing a guy at the moment, were close, but he knows nothing about this and I don't want to scare him off!"

My grades have been going downhill really fast; last semester I dropped all but two classes at the last minute, and this semester I got my first two Cs in classes that were supposed to be easy.  I have pretty good research and internship experience, but my GPA is abysmal.

I feel that I have an acceptable understanding of the material in my classes; I don't think I've gotten less than a 90% on a test in college yet, and for many of my group projects I feel like I carry most of the workload.

For the last few semesters though, I've been getting close to 0% on my participation and homework grades.  I basically don't turn in any individual work.  I know the correct advice is to ""stop being lazy and stop wasting your parent's money and just do your work,"" but for some reason I spend all semester putting it off and worrying more and more about the huge pile of unfinished psets and essays, and refreshing my email waiting for the inevitable angry email from a professor or TA.

I've been thinking that maybe working with other people in my classes could help; for group projects I do fine, and I often volunteer to do all of the work because I have the extra time.  The problem is that I don't know anybody in my majors, and I'm not sure if doing homework in groups is really common at all.  Also I'm pretty embarrassed about my work ethic, so I don't think a study group would really benefit from my joining.

Do you have any advice for how to improve?  I'm thinking of going to see a shrink, but I'm pretty sure I'm not depressed; I try to get out of my room every day, but I spend most of my time avoiding doing real work with my research job or with extracurriculars."

I'd love to get some work in Bristol working for one of the many broadcast, video production, web or app development companies based here, but I've got so used to working in the (dying) niche of commercial DVD &amp; Blu-ray production that I have no perspective on what use my skills are in any other industry. There's also no high-end DVD/Blu-ray work in Bristol to give me an in-roads to broadcast or video industry either. A specialist like me isn't that useful here.

I did work for a year as a creative tech manager for a local charity (AV for live events, filming, kit bookings, photography, Mac IT &amp; server support, creative tech support) but I left as the role and organisation was far too chaotic and they were far too reliant on 'self learning' rather than paying for proper training in anything (I want to do things properly or not at all).

I know the basics of graphic design (I've had to design some disc graphics, business cards, website etc), video production (had to edit a few basic conference videos together among other things), web development (hacked my own website together), IT support (basics, no professional training) and I have a pretty good knowledge of video formats. I don't feel any of these skills are good enough to get me into a professional organisation though - I'm a jack of all trades, master of none as it were.

I've been spending a lot of time at home without work for the last couple of months, phoning and emailing companies, going to networking events, but without much luck. I'm feeling pretty de-motivated, unconfident and useless at the moment. I'm trying to learn app development, web development and various software packages during this time to boost my skills but I just can't focus or seem to get anywhere.

If I was younger, I think I'd find it easier to jump in as a runner or intern (and learn on the job), but at the moment I get the feeling the companies I'm contacting don't know what to do with someone of my age (mid 30's) who's applying for entry level and even just for general temping work (I 'don't have any relevant office experience' apparently).


Any suggestions on what sort of positions (video, web, development or something completely different) I should be aiming for? What skills I could be learning? What things can I do to get out and boost my confidence?

tl;dr - I want to start a new career doing something different in a new city, but little confidence in my skills or idea of what jobs I can do."

I ideally want to get a job in or within say 30min of Baltimore, Philadelphia or Boston. I have friends in each of the cities, and I hear they are fun places to be post college. I will certainly work hard at my job. However, I want to work to live, not live to work. I value my social life. 

I have been applying to jobs in these areas for months now with little luck, not even an interview (I have a solid GPA, but no internship experience). However, jobs I've applied to in less than desirable locations, seem to be much more interested.

The job search is getting frustrating, and I'm starting to feel like a piece of shit about it. I'm going back to my summer construction job tomorrow until I find a career. So my question is, should I just give up my dream of having an enjoyable life in a good location, and broaden my scope to less than desirable locations?  "
ua9sd,0,2012-05-29,Doctors refusing to help my boyfriend who suffers from mysterious ever-increasing chronic pain. Please help.,Rehauu,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ua9sd/doctors_refusing_to_help_my_boyfriend_who_suffers/,"My boyfriend was in rear ended a few years back and, less than a year later, developed horrible pain in his lower legs, fingers, and arms along with mild headaches and an ""uncomfortable feeling"" in his throat which has now been going on for over 2 years. At first, the pain would flare up and then improve. He was managing with heat and trying medicines like Neurontin. He saw several doctors repeatedly and was tested for everything obvious. He was finally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. As the pain increased over time, he eventually stopped getting highs and lows and just had a constant level of pain that slowly increased. He eventually had to start taking hydrocodone to manage the pain. He's also on Cymbalta and Baclofen, he has Zanaflex for bedtime, and uses a mix of heat, TENS units, massage therapy, a chiropractor, and a gluten free diet to try and control it. Nothing but the hydrocodone puts a dent in it. He spends a lot of time shaking his legs and rocking back and forth, he can barely sleep at night which makes the pain even worse, and he's dropped over 20 lbs in a year which he didn't need to lose.

He was just recently sent to a pain specialist who says he feels that my bf's pain is too severe and too constant to be Fibromyalgia. He wants to do a spine MRI and check for MS among other things. He gave him a new hydrocodone prescription with a few more in it than before. Unfortunately, his pain actually got worse before he was due for a refill and he was forced to take extra just to function at all. Now, he has completely run out and he can't get a refill for another 9 days.

Here is the sticker. He called his pain doctor on Thursday to see what they could do and the nurse and front desk worker both repeatedly said he would get a call back that day and never did. Even the after hours on-call physician never returned his call. He went the entire holiday weekend debating whether or not to go to the ER but decided to stick it out until today (Tuesday). He spent an entire day crying off and on which is extremely out of character for him so I've worried as hell about him. I'm in another state doing an internship and can't even comfort him. He tried asking his regular doctor for help with the situation and was given another prescription of hydrocodone. The pharmacy refused to fill it. His doctor's nurse finally called him back just a few minutes ago and told him that they couldn't do anything for him because he has only seen them once and is too new of a patient.

What in the world is he supposed to do? He barely made it through the weekend and had to borrow a few Vicodin (which have half the hydrocodone in them of his pills) from a friend of his mom's and was managing on just a fraction of his usual dose. So not only is he in horrible pain already but he's also being forced to suffer some withdrawal symptoms. His doctors knew he would be dependent on the medicine and still allow this to happen. I really don't understand. He's not drug seeking, he doesn't abuse it, he takes it when he can't stand it anymore which just happens to be most of the time. It's reaching a breaking point and we're both getting desperate to figure out what's causing his pain and solve it with something other than narcotics. Nothing is happening fast enough. He's doing everything he can to just take the edge off the pain.

Should he just go to the ER? Would they even care to help him? What could they do to help? If all they can do is give him a shot or something, how is he supposed to last until the 7th? We're both freaking out, his mom is terrified he's going to do something impulsive like kill himself (although I don't think he will. He is scared and hurt, not depressed.) Is there anything else he can do? 

TL;DR: My bf has insane amounts of chronic pain in his legs that leaves him rocking back and forth for hours on end and ran out of medicine when the pain increased more than expected in a fairly short amount of time. His doctor refuses to help him. What should he do to make it to his refill date on the 7th? Would the ER be able to do anything?


UPDATE: His pain doctor contacted his regular doctor and they agreed to send him to the addiction/psych ward of the main hospital. He was really upset that they would think he is an addict or a drug seeker but we both agreed that he should go so they could see that he doesn't fit the profile of an addict and see that he is truly in a lot of pain. He left just before 10 am and I just heard from him (at 12:30 pm). He said the doctor at the addiction/psych ward was surprised that his pain doctor refused to help him and they didn't even hesitate and gave him two Percocet and an Ativan. I am beyond relieved at this point but now we still have to tackle the main problem of.. What could possibly be causing this that we haven't already ruled out?

Thank you all for your help and suggestions, I really appreciate it and will pass them on to him as soon as I can. If anyone has any ideas as to what else could cause these kinds of symptoms, anything else that might be worth trying to relieve the pain, or any questions, please feel free to comment or PM me."

This is my second build, I'm looking to replace a 2 year old rig that has served me well and is still going strong, but I've gotten my first job / internship and I love to build so here it goes.

CPU: intel i5-3750k

CPU Cooler: cooler master V8
(I've done a lot of research and asked on toms, and I am able to confirm that this cooler will allow me to get to 4.5 ghz I wanted to go with the noctua nh-d14 but I just love the design of the v8, and it's a lot cheaper!)

MB: AsRock Z77 extreme6

 GPU: Radeon HD 7870 

Case: nzxt phantom full tower white w/ red trim

SSD: http://tinyurl.com/buz54zx

I've got a 500gb Samsung spinpoint, a copy of windows, and a 650w corsair tx psu as well as 8gb of ddr3 g.skill ripjaw ram, so I should be good there. ( Oh, and of course my mouse and keyboard and such).

Total: ~$1,100

My biggest concern comes from the ssd, I want one and I only want to spend about 100 bucks. I'm new to the ssd world and while this looks like a good choice to me, I'm not sure. I know I want at least 120 - 128 Gb to make it useful to me, but other than that I'm lost.

Any opinions are welcome, I think I've got a sold build picked out aside from the ssd, and I'm excited to order! Finally, sorry for the messy formatting I'm doing this from my iPad...

However, my formal IT work experience is quite light; since 2001, I haven't even logged two years working in an office setting drawing a steady paycheck. I put myself through college by working as an independent IT technician, gathering jobs from OnForce and referrals from friends and family. I'd held my last position for eighteen months, when I was hired as a QA Specialist for a small data services company in Manhattan, but was let go when my primary responsibility of data acquisition using Python was outsourced to the Ukraine.

I've been told by a few recruiters that I should focus on a single specialty in the IT field in order to improve my prospects. I've spent quite a bit of time working with the QA department of my first real employer many years ago, and that's where I felt most comfortable, so that's where I'd like to spend my time. However, my QA experience is limited to my current job title, and an unproductive summer internship spent doing some manual testing for a website. Ideally, I'd be happiest with a contract position in an established QA department where I could gather enough experience over a 4 to 6 month period to move into a more senior position.

If anyone has any leads or advice, please contact me via email (Simon@hova.net) or cell phone (516-353-0040). Thanks again for your support!

My new job is stuck on Windows 98!,coreybo24,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/uc6r0/help_my_new_job_is_stuck_on_windows_98/,"I just started this summer engineering internship and they only use Windows 98. The PC they gave me is a Pentium III. The monitor is a NEC ""MultiSync 95"". I don't know what that means except that it is enormous. Also everything on the screen is HUGE and in horrible color. The resolution will not increase past 640x480, and the colors won't change from 16 colors even though I selected different options then restarted as recommended. I tried downloading KernelEx so that I could use some Windows 2000/XP stuff but that didn't really work. I downloaded Opera as my internet browser which has helped a little, but maybe there's another one out there?

Main requests:
Recommended upgrades and tools?
Best internet browser to download?
How can I fix the color and resolution?
Any other suggestions...

Links would be helpful. Thanks in advance!

UPDATE: I just want to clarify that this is an environmental engineering summer internship, so no lives are in direct danger by bad hardware/software. And I doubt that they would be in ""design danger"" either because it's still a reliable company that does good work. And I'm gaining some pretty valuable experience right now so I don't think I would quit unless I got a better offer. So... temporary fixes??

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I love Shadowrun for the SNES, one of my favorite games, ever.  Also has one of the best beginnings: waking up in the morgue, falling out of a slab in the wall.  What inspired that beginning scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsfj4?context=5)|Denny Thorley, the Producer on the game, loved the game but wanted a little ""lighter"" take on it. So as I often do I went the other way and pitched the opening in the morgue - not only to tweak him but because it gave us a great way of introducing the world to the character and the player at the same time since Jake had lost his memory. Plus, I really wanted to hit some of the central Noir themes, and the combination of dead man walking and lost memories play right into Noir.
[How important will be dialogues in your game? Will there special quests that can be solved through dialogues? Skills that can be used in dialogues? Will quests have more solutions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsfvi?context=5)|We think that the conversations are one of the key pillars of the game. We want the game to be about story, and in an RPG story is told via a combination of action and dialog with the majority of the depth coming from the dialog. I have been focusing all my efforts exclusively on the design of this critical aspect over the last several weeks and I am very excited about where we are headed, including the ability for quests to be solved only through leg work and conversations. 
[Back in 1993, when i was still a kid living under the roof of my fundamentalist christian parents, dying to get into tabletop roleplaying your game was the first one that actually appealed to me. For years I have been a gigantic fan. I've followed your system, read the fic, followed your kickstarter development and drooled with total anticipation.  Before I ask a single question THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for the worlds you made, from Shadowrun to Crimson Skies thank you. Don't ever stop. Don't ever quit on your stuff, because its freakin awesome.  What other directions have you considered taking your IP's in? Have you ever considered getting anything like a TV series based on Shadowrun or Crimson Skies?  How do you feel about the Shadowrun MMO project they are working on in Germany? Are you concerned about how well recieved its going to be as a F2P model?  4th Edition Shadowrun is kinda a point of contention among its fans; how do you like the direction the universe took after the 4th ed stuff started coming out?  What were some of the ideas when you first designed the history starting from 1st edition that you looked at at the time and said ""Well, that actually sounds pretty awesome but I don't think anyone will buy it."" and tossed?  Do you still have worlds left up in your head that you haven't had a chance to do anything with?  Do you think its ever a possiblity that Shadowrun (after Returns and the Online project outta Germany\) could ever see Triple AAA production values from a major studio again, or did the whole FPS thing completely jade you to the experience? (Honestly, wouldn't blame you if it did.\)  Also; if some rabid, mildly insane mega fan of yours from canada was to arrange to have a sandwich delivered to you, what kind of sandwich would you prefer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tuyvu?context=5)|I've been working on tv and movie versions of my game settings for years. Maybe some day.  The SR MMO looks promising and I can't wait to see what our friends at Cliffhanger Games come up with.  I'm focusing on the original Shadowrun era because that's the one I created and still love. I know some people are unhappy with 4th Edition but I'm not part of that.  I generally don't ""toss"" many ideas I have for games, especially RPGs. They often live for so long, all my ideas eventually make it in.  There are plenty of game worlds still in my head. The question is, would anyone else like them?  I think that Shadowrun would make a great AAA game and I know just what I would do with it. However: A) I don't own the rights B) I don't want to spend years on a single project.
 |In general, I don't eat things given to me by anyone who could be described at ""rabid"". Hope that makes sense. . . 
[Assuming that you guys knock it out of the park on this release, what are your long term goals for the Shadowrun franchise?  What do you want to be when you grow up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsjln?context=5)|Man I have been asking myself that question since I was 10 and I still don't have a good answer for that.
 |All I know is that I want me and Harebrained Schemes to keep making games that we love and want to play. 
[FASA created some of the most intriguing settings for games, and you're responsible for quite a bit.  What would it take to get all of the FASA licenses permanently wrestled away from Microsoft and into the hands of loving creators such as yourself?  Is there a Kickstarter for this in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttzvz?context=5)|Thanks for the complements. I don't think we will ever end up with all the right for the old FASA games, but our goal at Harebrained Schemes is to start creating games and universes with the same integrity, depth, and intriguing settings like I used to do at FASA - so stay tuned for what happens in the next couple of years :)
[Hi thanks for doing this! What races will be playable in SRR?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsept?context=5)|Human, Elf, Ork, Troll, ,and Dwarf.
[Thanks for doing this AMA. I would like to know a few things about *Shadowrun Returns*.  ** **Street Samurai** see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.*  ** **Combat Mages** see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.*  ** **Hackers/Deckers** see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.*  ** **Shaman** see the “true world” that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other “dead” objects appear as mere shadows.*  I love this idea and I'd love to hear more about it. (I'm new to SR world.\)  A few questions come to mind. Is Samurai's perspective basically our own (i.e. perception of moving physical objects through sensory stimuli\)? Will graphical assets change significantly in different perspectives? Will UI change significantly in different perspectives? Would change of perspective change perception of other senses than sight? (I'm thinking about hearing.\)  **II.** What kind of graphical engine will you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsm0y?context=5)|The street samurai's view is the ""physical"" world but overlayed with a HUD that displays weapons and tactical information, kind of like a fighter pilots HUD does for air combat. As the player clicks to other characters there are graphical elements that change to present that characters ""world view"", but mostly it is overlays of information (glowing auras, laylines, etc) and some cool visual effects rather than a completely new view. We are expanding the Moai client code base for our graphical engine 
[Thank you for doing this first and foremost. As a troubled young adult, I am looking for a purpose. What brought you into the idea of creating game developing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tscjb?context=5)|I was a dyslexic child and cold not read well. As a teenager I encountered D&amp;D and it totally blew me away. Here was a game that inspired the imagination and thrived on socialization. It caused me to learn to read those damn confusing rules and all of Lord of the Rings as well. Totally changed my life.
[Given that SR will be cross-developed for both tablets **AND** PC/Mac/Linux, does that mean that we can't expect a game that's larger in scale/scope, and have more than 10 hours of gameplay (given the graphics, memory and processor speed limits of tablets\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsi0v?context=5)|Since the current tablets are already more powerful than the home PC's of the 1990s I don't believe the limitation is not a hardware one but rather one of realizing that there is a ""hardcore"" game audience on the devices and that they will pay enough to create games of appropriate depth.
[I am thinking about how brief (but marvelous!\) Crimson Steam Pirates was, and hoping that we're going to see longer, more in-depth gameplay.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsi0v?context=5)|Crimson was not an RPG, but rather a linear tactical combat game so SR will be much much deeper and have a longer play than for sure. Plus with all the creativity of the SR audience empowered by the editor we will release it should have an unlimited amount of play. 
[What was your favorite mech in MechWarrior?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tuuyc?context=5)|I'd say it was the MadCat--it was the first 'Mech to really capture the aesthetic I was looking for.
[1\) What personal beliefs allow you to identify with and enjoy the heavy metal, cyberpunk aspects of the content you create?  2\) With perhaps the exception of Shadowrun, many of these universes share themes of honor, duty, pragmatism, contrasted with the stories of people who face the consequences of believing in those ideals. Which of these ideals, or ones that I may have missed, do you share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttsoz?context=5)|I enjoy creating and telling stories in complex worlds with shades of gray rather than stark black and white because it gives the writer more legitimate and compelling points of view to work from. In BT/MW we created very different Houses and Clans each of which had their own compelling world view and philosophy. While they were often ""evil"" from each other's points of view, from an objective point of view the reader could understand the actions taken and how they meshed (or didn't) with each culture's view of what honor or duty means.  Shadowrun has it's own version of what honor and duty means. While an RPG allows and encourages each GM to create their own version of the world they are playing in, in my version of Shadowrun the runners are classical anti-heroes meaning that they are totally outside the ""law"" doing things that disrupt society but they do live by an internal code of honor and duty to each other and to the SINless, the poor souls without system identification numbers that live in the slums and are prayed upon by gangs and corps with equal abandon. In my version of the game the runners are often the only hope the SINless have.  
[, I'd like to say that I'm a big fan of both Shadowrun and BattleTech, so thanks for creating those.  Also, how much input did you and the other folks at FASA have into the  various Shadowrun video games (the SNES &amp; Genesis games, as well as the Sega Mega-CD game that never made it out of Japan\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tsdg5?context=5)|Thanks for the thank yous. In actual fact I had every element for the first 25 years of the game all written in code on my padded cell wall BEFORE we published the first edition of Shadowrun which means I am about to run out of material and better start writing again soon :)
[1\] Which edition of the table-top game do you think will have the most influence on the genre and setting of Shadowrun Returns?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttcb1?context=5)|1 &amp; 2) We are mostly looking to the 2nd and 3rd editions of the P&amp;P game for our inspiration and time setting.
[3\] Should we expect to see a more wired or wireless world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttcb1?context=5)|3) Well its funny with all the good guesses I made about the future 23 years ago I totally missed the wireless revolution :) Our current thought is that we will hit a middle ground between the ""retro"" future of the original version and a more up to date version of the world.

[As someone who sadly is moderately young, I didn't get a chance to grow up with Shadowrun as many people here might have. That said, I'm following this project with extreme interest because I love everything cyberpunk. So my question is, even though this game is primarily for Shadowrun fans is it something that a newbie who lives and breathes cyberpunk and RPGs could enjoy as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tshws?context=5)|We want to make sure that SRR is not just for those that grew up with SR, and thus will it will have all the depth of SR lore that we can shove into it, we are working really hard to make sure that it is a great entry into the world of Shadowrun that does not make the first time player feel overwhelmed.

(Battletech, Shadowrun.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4tu28w?context=5)|I wouldn't say that tabletop games were the result of limited technology. When Dungeons and Dragons was created, no one was saying, ""Since we don't have personal computers, let's do this."" Instead, I would say that they were an innovative expansion on the tabletop miniature wargames of the era.
[Were pen and paper RPGs a result of limited technology, or a legit art form that should be kept alive?

From my perspective, it has nothing to do with rules or pacing. It's about getting together with your friends and spending a few hours using your imaginations together. All these years later, there's still nothing like it. 
[Hello Jordan, first I want to thank you for the fantastic work you've done. The themes in mechwarrior of personal honor, pride in one's self and loyalty to ones house have had a deep personal impact on me.

Early on, the story was heavily guided by me. Then, when I found the right people to pass the torch to, I stepped back and focused on other projects, checking in regularly to ensure the original vision was being maintained.
[Why do you think Shadowrun struck such a cord in Germany?  I'm US-based and am curious/jealous at how much larger the fans seems to be over there.  A friend of mine, whose played since first edition, even overheard a random group of tourists riding a the train from an airport discussing the game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttlmv?context=5)|Its a fine question. I think it is because it hit a nerve at the intersection of Cyberpunk which as very popular in Germany a different take on classic high fantasy that has also been very popular in Germany. But maybe some of the German fans can express it better or correct me altogether!
[Jordan, big fan of your work!  I'm a writer who has been working on a game similar to Shadowrun Returns for a while - we loved the P&amp;P Shadowrun, and wanted to see it reincarnated as a squad-based strategy game somewhere between X-COM and Disgaea.  I'm excited to see what the official version winds up being!  My question is, how does someone contribute writing to a project like yours?  Is there an opening for an internship, or do you accept submissions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttdw9?context=5)|Thanks, we're excited too.

This is kind of broad, but how did you go about owning a business with somebody?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uavdc/i_am_jordan_weisman_creator_of_shadowrun/c4ttpe9?context=5)|I did attend Circle Campus for a year and it was a good experience. Starting businesses isn't hard, it's staying in business that's hard. The trick is to first find a business that you can afford to start and be excellent in. To do that you need to keep your costs down as low as possible. When I started FASA in 1980 I lived with my parents and took no salary for two years to get the company going (32 years later I am doing it again to get HBS going).
 |In terms of partners the key thing to realize is that it is like picking a wife or husband as they are somebody that you are going to spend A LOT of time with for hopefully many years. You need to make sure that you can work with that person to reach decisions quickly and that their work ethic and style matches your own. Even with all that said, make sure that your partnership agreement provides for exiting a partner should everything not work out well. 
[I read on your kickstarter update that you hired the original composers of the games on the Sega and SNES. This makes me very happy.

I can't speak to their method of composition but clearly we will clearly be using WAV files or similar for playback.

ubkmp,2,2012-05-29,I got two job offers ... HELP!,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ubkmp/i_got_two_job_offers_help/,"After graduation, I applied for full time positions *and* for internships because applying for full time didn't go well since I didn't have any ""experience"". In March I was able to snag an offer for an internship that I accepted. I figured it was better than nothing and I needed experience so when I to a job fair, I have more ""competitive experience"". Also, I figured if I do well on the internship, it could lead to full time with the company. Sounds great, right?

Two months later I got a call and interviewed with another company and *FINALLY!!* after countless rejections, I got a full time offer with a great company!! 

The hiring manager gave me a verbal offer over the phone and told me HR will email me the details. :) I haven't heard from HR about my start date yet and I haven't I gotten a written offer via email, but I hope those will come soon. It's been a week and I'm concerned because my internship starts next week. :/ 

So now I'm in a bit of a mess. I didn't want to cancel my internship last minute without a written offer from the other company because I didn't want to take the risk in case my full time offer gets retracted for some reason. :/ So at this point, I'll likely get the details of my start date sometime *during* my internship. 

There's a chance I can do my full internship or that I'll have to quit 3-5 weeks into my internship. In other words, I'll work for 3-5 weeks and tell them I quit. :( I don't really know what to do. I don't want to tell either company about each other just yet because it will look bad. I mean, what would you think if I told you on the very first day of my internship ""*I think* i might have another offer somewhere else so I'm gonna quit in a few weeks?"" What should I do if my start date is in the middle of my internship? Do I just up and quit? Should I try to push my full time start date till after my internship. Overall, the full time position is a priority for me.  

Thanks for your help, Everyone!

I've always wanted to work for a start-up but I expected to be an underling for a little while. Seems like a pretty serious jump from recent graduate to the sole developing expert of a company.

I recently graduated from a private, non-profit, regionally accredited online program with a BS in CS in December. I have been working locally as an intern for a few months. I completed some work in Visual Basic for this company, and they use my program on a daily basis.

This is fine, but there aren't really any open positions within the company. I can't continue to live off an interns pay forever.

I have been looking for jobs, and have had a couple of good interviews, but didn't land the jobs. Each time I interview, I get the feeling that when it is found out that I completed the program online (which I am honest about), it feels like they don't take me as serious as they should. I feel like I know how to program, and have been doing it for some time now (prior to school). But rarely do I get the chance to show it. The places that I interviewed for haven't asked for prior work or have had coding tests.

What should I do? Should I simply not mention it's an online program (even though it is an actual brick and mortar school)? Should I try to force projects at them?

How do you handle big life transitions, like graduating college or breaking up with your first love? What is the best way to handle a break up with someone you love who still loves you too? I can't even think about dating anyone else yet, and am worried about keeping myself sane while going through this transition from graduation to an internship to law school. Any ideas?

(preemptively, wanted to clarify why I did not post this to /relationships. this isn't about my relationship anymore; I am trying to take care of myself and my own happiness now.)


Story:

I have been dating the most incredible man for two years. We are enormously happy in our relationship, and are one another's best friend. He is my rock and my happiness, and has empowered me with so much confidence. He values my intelligence, accepts me at my worst, and can make me laugh when I am hysterically sobbing.

He is one in a million.

But, alas, we are freshly graduated from college after he earned a masters degree and I earned my bachelors. I am off to an internship on the East Coast followed by law school in the Mountain West, while he has a job 1000 miles away on the West Coast. We talked, and decided that it was best to put things on hold indefinitely. We have done long distance twice, for a 3 month stretch each, and it was tough-- really tough. He said he definitely wanted to revisit things in the future, but we need to take time to get ourselves together. I love him more than anything, but we are so young and not ready to think about marriage quite yet. While it's painful, it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't know how to handle this. 

We are staying together until the very moment I leave for my internship next week, but I am really struggling with my emotions. We are not breaking up because things are going wrong, but ending amicably, because we would never wish the other any harm or pain. It is not fair to either of us to expect to be able to have the same relationship we've had when things are changing so enormously. He's my best friend. I am so sad he's leaving, and am in so much pain. After being in a relationship for so long, I feel like I don't know how-- or really want-- to be single. I don't want anyone else; I want him. But I can't have him right now, I know that.


I have been a wreck since graduation because all of my closest friends, he being my very best friend, are moving away. I am nervous for my internship in a big city I have never been to, and terrified for what law school holds. I am really, really struggling, and have been suffering with the worst depression I've battled since high school. 


I would love to know if any Redditors have advice for me on how to handle this maelstrom of emotions. Furthermore, if anyone has advice on how to most appropriately interact before and post-move with my soon-to-be-ex SO, I would be very grateful.

* Networking Skills: Minimal a.k.a I know enough that I might accidentally blow something up

Problem: The OS, VMWare center and client we installed by someone else. I attempted to get to the website via http://&lt;server&gt;:8282 but I it doesn't find me the host. I tried entering the default passwords (root, administrator, vmware) into orchestrator and client, but to no avail. The person who set it up mentioned ignoring Fully Domain something or the other (he doesn't remember) error while installing vCenter. I looked it up and think its Fully Qualified Domain Name, to which the solution seemed like fiddling with the DNS reverse lookup. So I installed DNS server role and followed some guides but no luck. I have uninstalled DNS server role to make sure I don't break something accidentally and now stumped.

The reason I haven't updated Windows is because I have heard there are problems with that.

* Clean Room


* Contact university about Academic Status (Sent message, awaiting response)


* Reset Sleep Schedule (successful)


* Complete all classwork and homework. (done for thursday)


* Plan one fun thing with girlfriend/friends as a reward.



That is the entirety of my list. I figure that posting it will help me keep on track. I reduced it down to only the important things, and it seems manageable for a week. Even if this post dies, I will comment on this with my status on these tasks.  If anyone would like to remind me periodically that would be amazingly helpful. Here's to finishing!

I'm tired and disappointed. Our internship advisor told us the employment rate for electrical engineers coop students was about 95%, but none of us got interviews. Its been a month since the job posting on our special coop website has started and all the Computer Engineering science got interviews (at least 5). ELEC students = 0.

What do you think? Is there hope for electrical engineering students?

I've done few personal projects and I am very interested in this domain. It hurts me to see that no one wants to hire us.

I posted to /r/resumes (http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/ud5zy/critiqueinput_what_to_add/) as well but wanted to get advice from people in the same field as well.

I'm a senior computer science student and going to be applying to a software internship. I have a few concerns:

- Is the branding statement good? I don't quite get it after reading the r/resumes FAQ, to me it just seems like an objective statement just not being labeled as ""objective."" The example in the FAQ didn't really seem to convey a ""personal brand"" and mine does not seem to as well.

- My resume is currently a little bare because I don't know how else to add to it without seeming like I'm adding fluff. Is coursework appropriate or not, if so do I put electives in computer science and what I learned? I don't really have any personal projects worth mentioning or that I'm confident enough to showcase.

- My jobs in sales are not relevant to any computer science jobs. I don't have any accomplishments worth bullet pointing for these. Should I keep them, add to them, or get rid of them?

- Are extracurricular activities fine as is?

Thanks for your time."
