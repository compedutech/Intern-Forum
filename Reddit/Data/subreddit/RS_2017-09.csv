6xb9yz,15,2017-08-31,Math major/CS minor here ... Feeling lost in terms of my career options,PhunkyFish,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6xb9yz/math_majorcs_minor_here_feeling_lost_in_terms_of/,"I just graduated in May with a 3.69 GPA and did a web dev internship over the summer. I'm now looking for software engineering positions away from my hometown but as a person who only completed a CS minor and not a major, I feel like I'm having a harder time getting through some of the common technical interview questions that ask stuff about algorithms or data structures.

Ultimately I think I'd like to do something that makes use of my math background such as cryptography, big data/machine learning, or statistics but from what I've seen most of the jobs in these areas require at least a Master's so I would likely need to go back to school. The problem with that is I'm completely broke, have a lot of student loan debt, I'm burnt out from school in general, and I have no idea what graduate program would be best for me.

I know that a lot of pure math grad programs will cover tuition and even pay you a stipend through fellowships and assistantships, but it seems to me that a CS grad degree would be more practical for the fields I'm interested in and I'm not sure that those same benefits are as common for CS programs. Most programs also have a CS bachelor's preference or at least require specific undergrad classes which I have not completed such as a hardware/architecture related course and OS/programming languages. Is it possible to take these classes on their own without enrolling in a 4 year program at a university?

**tl;dr:** I have a math degree with a CS minor but I feel like I lack some of the CS knowledge required to get through a lot of entry level software engineering interview questions. What do I do?"
6xbb64,1,2017-08-31,Fed up with classes and want to leave - what are my options?,HAIRY_BUTTFUCKER,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6xbb64/fed_up_with_classes_and_want_to_leave_what_are_my/,"I switched over to CS after 2 years of being a math major and am only on my 3rd semester of CS courses (although I have 2.5 years of experience with programming).

I'm 24, in a fairly serious relationship, broke, and still living at home. I can't see myself finishing another 2.5 years at university and maintaining my sanity. I want to finish my degree. I've spent so much time at university it feels awful to give up on it, but I don't want to get caught up in the sunken cost fallacy.

I'm thinking of applying for an internship this coming summer, and hoping that will lead me to a permanent job where I can either finish my degree at a new university part time, or forget about it entirely. I imagine a 2 month internship is more valuable than a year of classes anyway. 

What other options are open to me? I see two sticking points. The primary one being that I don't have a lot to show for my skills. I haven't worked on any large projects, and I only have a couple hundred lines of PRs on GitHub. Second concern is that not having a degree will glass-ceiling me. I'm placing all my eggs in one basket by betting an internship will remedy all of this.

I'm sorry if this my post seems disjointed. I've thought about this a lot over the last year and am still not able to organize my thoughts well on it. 

Any constructive comments are welcomed.

My current plan is to speak with boss in private when I see him and ask if he can give me a ""concrete"" answer about whether I will get converted or not by the end of the week. (Hopefully with a raise too!)


If I don't hear back from him (email/in-person wise), would it be appropriate for me to just follow up with an email directly stating whether he has a decision/not for me yet?

I took a computer science class freshman year and solving those difficult problems with coding made me fall in love. It felt so satisfying finding the solutions! (Btw I was doing basic coding on a website called Scratch) 

My Sophomore year I joined the MESA club (Robotics club) and I was also exposed to some coding there which was the VEX coding language (RobotC) and I was also exposed to Labview. There I learned how to program robots on my own since I barely had any mentors to teach me the code. It was just me and the internet. It was still fun solving those bugs I ran into and I loved whenever I ran into a ""DUH"" moment.

I also had a Game design class where I was exposed to Gamesalad, a program that is in a way similar to Scratch but focuses a lot on making games. I worked with my friend thats an amazing artist and we made a pretty cool game that we showed off near the end of 2nd semester for that year. It wasn't a FANCY game but I still felt proud of it.

That same year I also got an Internship at some local private company that wanted us to make a game using the 'Stencyl' Language. It was just me and some other guy (that barely did any work) do all the programming on the game. Everything from collisions, player movement, enemies and even UI. Again, it was fun but I really wished someone taught me the ways of coding in Stencyl. I was just thrown in there to learn a language, use my background knowledge and use the internet to make a game in under 2 months.

Throughout high school I made just a few more games that were a part of some projects for my math class but nothin special. I was just using what I already knew and the games were very simple.

And now we come to today. I'm in my final year of high school and boy am I scared. I've been scrolling through this subreddit and there are so many things that excite me but scare me at the same time. I'm scared that maybe this isn't for me because i've been doing only simple coding and the harder coding would overwhelm me but then at the same time i'm excited to learn new things, especially when i'm being taught and not left alone to teach myself. I'm really excited about programming so should I major in CS for college or is there another major specifically for programming? Is what i've been doing in high school the right way to become a Computer Scientist? How hard is CS? Should I just not do college at all and go for bootcamps? Would I have to worry about not being able to get a job in the future? I just don't want to end up a failure with a bunch of student loan debit working a minimum wage job all because I didn't plan my future out correctly."

I have been applying to many jobs, mostly within the financial and banking industries, transportation management industry, and entry level analyst positions, and have not yet had any luck.

I believe my most glaring weaknesses are:

* no professional experience, no internships completed
* no statistics background and very little experience with SQL
* no proficiency with any programming language other than Python (which I have been learning since graduation)

My work experience consists of 7 years in the restaurant industry (BOH) and 4 years officiating youth sports. I have been learning Python and its applications for data analysis in my free time.

What I am interested in:

* a professional job that is not selling a junk product (i.e. whole life insurance)
* something where there is room to either utilize my mathematical skills immediately or to grow into a position where they will be used
* at least $30,000 dollars a year with benefits

I am willing (and eager) to start at the bottom and work my way up, just as I have in the kitchen. My long term goal is to become a data analyst in some capacity or a software developer, but as I do not believe I currently have all the skills necessary, I am willing to do just about anything that gets me professional experience. I have never worked in an office setting.

Any tips for me? Thank you very much for taking the time to read this!"
6xcwpg,3,2017-09-01,Need advice about a potential career move (Corporate to startup).. Really can't make up my mind,DebugMyLife,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6xcwpg/need_advice_about_a_potential_career_move/,"This is a choice I've been struggling with for a few days and I don't have the experience or knowledge to know what the right decision is. I am humbly seeking help from those with more experience who can share their wisdom.

I currently have a job at a big corporation working 9-10hr days with 2 hours of driving each day. I've been at it for a little over a year and I'm fairly content. Some days I love it, but other days it's a chore. It's always stressful. I'm continuously told I should take on less work each sprint, but it seems like during planning, really important things come up that I feel like I have to take on for things to go smoothly for the team/company. I've been told I'm doing pretty well and have a bright future there, but it is a constant struggle to stay at the top of my game. I have a lot of higher-ups here supporting me and wanting me to succeed. There are a lot of layoffs happening, but I don't believe I'll be hit.

I recently got a call from an old internship employer asking me to come work for him. I originally didn't take on a full-time with him because of location, but he's now offering remote work. This place is the complete opposite of the big corporation. Extremely small to the point that my manager is really just the CEO himself and I would make up a third of the development force. They make multimedia applications. If I work here, I would be pretty autonomous due to faith in the work I provided during my internship. There wouldn't really be anybody watching over me (which could lead to me growing bad coding habits!).

Here are the pros to each:

Startup:


- No commute



- More free time to pursue life/coding interests (probably 9 hour days, no commute)




- No more stressful agile deadlines. 




- Autonomy (this is a pro and con really.. who am I going to learn from?)




- Daily programming. Daily technical challenges, but of less magnitude





Corporate:


- Stable future




- Career growth (I feel like other employers in the future would like it more)




- People to review my code and fix my bad habits!




- Greater technical challenges (by far), but more sparse (lots of config and plumbing work)




- People to look to for help if I get stuck





In terms of money, the startup pays 15k more in salary, but the corporation makes up for it in stocks/bonuses so they come out to be about even.

Here are my concerns with moving to the startup:


- If the company goes under in 18 months, will it look really bad that I worked 14 months at one place and 18 months at another?


- Will I be able to learn as much doing more coding, but having to do it/review it on my own?


- Will my salary/position be too high to match my skills/experience (I would be making 115k salary being only a year and a half out of school..)



I have been fretting over this decision for almost a week. I'm not sure what would be better for my career. I would certainly be more relaxed with the startup, perhaps much happier, but I'm worried what it might set me up for in the future. Please reddit, help :)"

6xfkk1,27,2017-09-01,How To Get A Free Office,alfredohere,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6xfkk1/how_to_get_a_free_office/,"Sup Reddit,

My name is Alfred and I started my e-commerce business one month ago. Me and my business partner have been working in cafés and at the office where we have had our internships. It has been quite stressful. Cafés always close right when you start to get into a flow state and the wifi never works. As summer is ending, our internships are coming to an end too, which means those offices will be out of reach. 

It also feels like you don’t have a serious business unless you have your own office. Where are you supposed to bring your customers, investors etc. The credibility doesn’t exactly start high if you meet at Starbucks… That’s why I decided to find us an office. 

Since our budget is very limited I decided to get an office very cheaply, and I managed to find one **FOR FREE**.

#PART ONE: Where the hell do I start looking?

As many journeys, this one started with good old google. I simply searched for offices in Stockholm (the capital of Sweden. I tricked you into learning some geography ;) ). That didn’t really help. Stockholm is apparently absurdly expensive, my friend who runs a startup pays 5000 dollars a month for his small office… 

Co-working spaces came up a lot. That’s an office which is shared between a few startups and freelancers. This is great because you can get inspired by other entrepreneurs and it also offers good networking opportunities. Though, this was still out of my budget range. 

Partly through the search I stumbled upon something called **Startup Incubators**. It’s a place for startups that are just starting out. Many of them are sponsored by the government. I guess this is more common in socialistic Sweden, but I think it’s more common that most people think. Entrepreneurs are very important to the economy and many governments are realising this. Every city wants to be the birth place of the next big unicorn, so they sponsor entrepreneur activities.

#PART TWO: Startup Incubators?

I thought Startup Incubators only existed in Silicon Valley. Places like Y-Combinator, where geniuses create billion dollar companies. But apparently they are popping up everywhere. 

Startup Incubators are great for many things.

•	Meet other entrepreneurs

•	Connect with the startup incubator network

•	**Free office space**

It was mostly the last point which stuck to my mind. **FREE OFFICE SPACE.** That would be amazing. Getting a place where meetings can be held and where we can do our all-nighters. But it must be really hard to get such wonderful perks, right?


#PART THREE: APPLY, APPLY, APPLY

To get that dreamy government subsidize office space, you have to be super smart. Hundreds of companies must be applying every week. It has to be almost impossible, when the perks are so great? (spoiler: it’s not impossible and you don’t have to be a genius. If you watch my videos, you’ll understand I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed.)

There are five Startup Incubators in Stockholm. Despite of having massive imposter syndrome, I decided to apply to all of them. In the application form I had a fake it till you make it attitude. Wasn’t necessarily lying, but stretching the truth a bit, hehe (don’t judge). 

What happened? It turns out that all that stands between you and a free office is five boring application forms. **I WAS ACCEPTED**. It felt great to get that massive affirmation on your business idea. If someone likes your idea so much that you get a free office, the idea must be pretty damn good!

However, I didn’t get into all of them. Actually, I was only accepted in one! So my big learning here is twofold.

First, governments have tonnes of help out there. I’m sure a free office is just the beginning of my usage of government subsides. Investment/loan is definitely my next big ask. 

Secondly, apply, apply, and apply. It wasn’t intelligence or talent that got me this office. I write like a rake, as we say in Sweden (it means I write badly, which you can see from this post). I got this office because of one thing: persistence. I believe every business or person has a chance of getting what they want from an application. The chance of getting what you want is never zero, but it’s seldom 100%. Our chance seems to be around 20%, which means we have to apply to five things in order to get one. 

Five startup incubators in one city might be abnormally high. Though if you live in a big city, I’m sure you have at least one startup incubator that you can apply to. So if you want that free office, make sure to **apply, apply, and apply**.
[I also documented this entire office journey in a vlog. I also show my how my office looks like, if you´re interested](https://youtu.be/IMt6CiRCkNc)

My school is unique in that we can do science research during school hours and it counts as a ""core science class."" I've been doing this for around 2 years and I've gotten super close with my mentor, and he's agreed to write me a recommendation.

Since my planned major is applied math, I also asked my BC Calc teacher for a rec letter too. I got really into math late into my junior year, resulting in a giant upward trend in my grade (93-&gt;95-&gt;100) and me getting pretty close to her. She's also teaching one of my senior math courses (Multivariable Calc).

One or two of my schools require a humanities recommendation, so I've also asked my IB Spanish teacher for a recommendation for those schools instead of my math teacher. She likes me (I think). 
 
I did an internship at a stem cell lab at a med school over the summer and I've also gotten close with the PI there, and she's agreed to write me a supplemental rec.

There's my situation, and here are a couple questions.

1. Do 2 science recommendations make me unfavorable to colleges? My school is very STEM-heavy so my counselor so it wouldn't hurt, but I'm applying to a couple LACs and pseudo-LACs so I'm on the fence here.

2. How redundant is 2 research recs? How much would that hurt my application? I would hate to sacrifice my school research mentor's rec because he's the teacher I'm closest to out of my three teachers, so help me weigh the pros and the cons.

3. Do prospective major and the subject my rec writer teaches have any correlation? Would I look better if I got a rec from my math teacher instead of my Spanish teacher? 

4.  What's better? Well-roundedness or super STEM warrior? ~~vote now on your phones~~

Thanks.

tl;dr - science + science rec or science+humanities rec for a potential science major

I hope you are all having a wonderful friday as I am with upgrading our network with brand spanking new Cisco Meraki switches, AP, and security appliance! Alongside studying for my MCSA cert!

I again have another wonderful IT Intern story for you all that I know you will all like! So now onto the story!

to set the scene of the story, we have started to replace BOX SYNC with BOX DRIVE so that it can relieve pressure off our network because a lot people are complaining that box sync is not syncing folders and files properly. We installed BOX DRIVE and everything was peachy until we get complaints from $LEGAL that they can't see certain folders/files on the desktop end but can see it via the web portal, the OS they are using is Win7 PRO. For those that are familiar with windows are aware that if the OS sees you access a certain folder a lot from time to time, it will make a shortcut on the favorites section in file explorer for ease of access, this is where I messed up in not noticing it first hand.

Also for those that know little about BOX like I do, BOX is a cloud based storage platform that acts like G Drive, dropbox, onedrive, ect. like any other cloud based storage system, you have to download the app on your desktop to make it work. BOX SYNC downloads and uploads ALL OF YOUR FILE(S) which can choke a network up big time in a enterprise environment which is why BOX DRIVE came out as an alternative. BOX DRIVE works the same as sync but it's much less resource hungry like sync, with drive it only downloads the file(s) you need to work on and once you are done working on it, it'll upload the changes instead of doing all of the files all at once. So that I now given a description on it, lets get on with the story!

$me=me duh

$LEGAL=legal team

I am sitting down on my desk why my buddy tells me to chat with BOX support because $LEGAL are having issues with folders not appearing on the desktop. Once I get BOX support on chat, I explain the issue and had $LEGAL send me over screenshots (which they did very well which surprises me) of the folders they can't see. the BOX tech tells me that they are still accessing the old BOX SYNC file path, I didn't believe the tech at first but I did a double take on the screenshot that was sent to me and I saw what he was saying.

I walk over to $LEGAL talked with one of the users to look at the file path

&gt; $me= ""hello $LEGAL! do you mind if you can show me how you are accessing these files?""

So I watched the user open up file explorer and click on the folder under the favorites banner and was able to see the files but I didn't see any blue check marks next to them. Once I looked closely again I saw the thing that was haunting $LEGAL from the past, windows kept the file path to the old BOX SYNC file paths and was able to open and work on the files and saved all the changes locally.

&gt; $me= ""wait a minute, I uninstalled BOX sync, why is the folder to it still here?""

&gt; $LEGAL= ""yeah, why is it still there?""

after the light bulb went out on my head

&gt; $me= ""do you access this folder on a daily basis?""

&gt; $LEGAL= ""yes""

&gt; $me= ""ok, so windows like to remember folders you access on a daily basis to make it easy to access. basically you are visiting a ghost of the past that hasn't moved on.""

&gt; $LEGAL= ""wait so all of the work I have done hasn't been synced?!""

&gt; $me= ""lets just copy the files you worked on here and move them here to the ACTUAL BOX folder""

So I moved the files they worked on and verified that the files have synced and been saved. once I have done that, I removed the old folder paths to BOX SYNC and made a desktop shortcut to the BOX DRIVE folder.

I went back to the chat with the BOX support tech and apologized about not believing in them since Win7 ease of access bamboozled me.

So a word of advice for IT that uses BOX, make sure to delete the old file paths that lead to BOX SYNC so that it won't confuse your users once you install BOX DRIVE. I will post a story soon once I finish upgrading our network! "

I play baseball at the collegiate level, and we were at the end of one of our early morning workouts. One of the last exercises we had to do was a farmer carry, which is when you pick up a couple 100 pound dumbbells, hold them at your sides, and walk around in big circle in the weight room. At this point in the workout, my hands are pretty sweaty and my forearms are gassed so about five steps from the end of the farmer carry the dumbbells slip out of my hands, narrowly missing my feet. I'm almost done with the carry so I pick up the dumbbells again and attempt to finish the carry.

I get the weights up about to mid thigh, and they slip out of my hands again but this time I'm not so lucky. The dumbbell I was carrying in my left hand lands directly on my big toe. The pain doesn't really hit me at first; my adrenaline is pumping. So I use what little strength is left in my body to once again lift the weights to my side and stride out the last few steps.

I set the dumbbells down and realize my toe is in some serious pain. My worn out, adrenaline filled brain thinks that maybe if I just walk it off I'll be okay, but every step causes a shooting pain through my whole toe. I take a look at my foot, shoe still on, and realize that in the 30 seconds or so since I smashed my toe, I have already bled through my sock and my shoe (I was wearing pretty thin training shoes). This was about the time where I decided that it was probably a good idea to head up to the training room to determine the exact damage I've done to my poor phalange. 

I limp slowly up the stairs to the mostly empty training room. Remember, this was an early morning workout, so the most athletic trainers have yet to arrive. There are a couple student interns there and one trainer for a different sport. As I limp in and heave myself onto a table, I explain sheepishly that I dropped a weight on my foot. I carefully remove my shoe and sock and get my first glimpse of the damage.

The weight had hit right at the front end of my toenail, my toe is bleeding profusely from underneath my toenail, and the force of the dumbbell has ripped the root of my toenail straight out of my toe. The nail is hanging on by just a couple pieces of skin. Around this time, our baseball trainer comes in and sees the carnage.

There was a lot of blood trapped underneath the nail, so my trainer uses a cauterizer to burn a hole through my toenail to drain it. In order to get as much of the trapped blood out as he can, he squeezes my already smushed toe which causes me to almost pass out. He wraps it in gauze and tells me to keep it elevated to minimize the bleeding.

After this, a few calls were made to set up X-rays and an appointment with an actual doctor. Unfortunately for me, the doctor that treats all of our athletes is busy, so I have to wait to see him. In the meantime, the bleeding from my toe has yet to cease and I can't really walk around. My trainer gives me a boot and crutches which was nice, if it wasn't January and if there wasn't a layer of snow and ice covering every outdoor surface. I only slipped once or twice.

I end up not being able to see the doctor until several hours later, all the while the bleeding has still not fully stopped. It turns out I have shattered my toe, and lacerated the skin underneath my toenail. The doctor numbs my toe, removes the toenail and sutures the wound. The interesting part was that he used the now dead nail to protect the cut by sliding it back where it was supposed to go and stitching that onto my toe as well.

I ended up missing about 4 weeks of baseball, as well as having to limp around campus in a boot in the snow for a couple weeks. Our strength coach never let me do a farmer carry again.

Sorry for writing a novel, I just wanted to share this overall miserable experience with everyone.

TL;DR
I dropped a dumbbell on my toe during a workout, shattered my toe, ripped my toenail out from the root, and needed a bunch of stitches to fix it"

I'm applying for an associate's degree program that includes A+ and Network+ training, and internship opportunities toward the end.

In the interest of time and money, would I be better off just going for certs and shoot for a help desk job to work up from, or would the assoc. degree actually make that much of a difference on a resume?

Last year just before I turned 21 I got a ''level 3'' college degree in IT (we work with level here, 1-4 4 being the highest and after that its get even higher without numbers)

My plan was that I was supposed to find my first job with it, after a year I never did, no one wanted someone in my field with a level 3, they only wanted 4.

Now at 22 i'm going back to finish a 3 year long education to get my ''level 4''. I've done internships so while I do have work experience, I have never been paid for real, the government gives me about 380 a month for going to college as long as I do well.

My mother doesnt mind me living at home finishing college until i'm 25, but I still feel weird and guilty never having had a ''real'' job. Ofcourse I plan on getting a job after college and moving out, i'm just scared I won't find anything again even with the best possible degree I could get."

I would like to be able to do this, but admittedly am a novice and lack a solid personal project at this time. 

My skill level is essentially my intro to programming course in Python, the coursework I am taking this semester (Java OOP and Data Structures class), and a small role on an Arduino/Python project that involved creating a parallel parking algorithm for a small remote control car.

My role on the Arduino project was as a research assistant, but it wasn't as hands-on as I was anticpating. I would not be able to recreate the algorithm from scratch, but I could discuss the various parts of the code and their relevance to the project.

**A couple questions:**

Would this suffice as good personal project to submit based on my role?

I think it would be great to talk about, but I wouldn't want to give any illusions about my aptitude or role.

Secondly, if I were to consider a different project I would hesitate on being able to create my own project from scratch at this point.

But say I have done a tutorial re-creating the snake mobile game in Java and again could discuss the various parts of the code and how it pertains to the result.

Would something like this be appropriate to discuss as a ""personal project""?

School: University of British Columbia Honours Computer Science

GPA: 4.10/4.33 cumulative, 4.25/4.33 major

GRE: 170Q/163V/4.5AWA

Research Experience:

* Worked on NLP project (8 months) for my honors thesis with Professor at UBC. Achieved state of the art results, which resulted in publication at mid-tier international conference (not top-3 ML conferences, but up there)  

* Working on bioinformatics research project with large team for the past year. Expect to be second/third author on in-progress publication.

Work Experience:

* 2 internships at Facebook doing machine learning and natural language processing
* internship at Microsoft doing deep learning and natural language processing
* TAed upper year CS classes for the past 3 years

LoRs:

* Strong letter from Prof that I published NLP paper with (he's established in the field and has connections at other schools)
* Strong letter from PI at bioinformatics lab (his main field is Biology, but I'm hoping he can co-write it with the CS PhD student in charge of the project to better capture my technical skills/contributions)
* Medium letter from Prof that I'm working with in the upcoming months (established, but might not get to know me that well given the limited time)
* Medium letter from Research Scientists that I worked with at FB (PhDs from my target school, know my work well, however, they're in industry and not academia which may reduce the impact of the reccomendations).

So /r/gradadmissions, what are my chances for my target schools? What, if anything, can I do in the next few months to improve my chances?"
6xj2y8,13,2017-09-01,Am I being taken advantage of or should I be happy,ScruffMcgruff60692,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6xj2y8/am_i_being_taken_advantage_of_or_should_i_be_happy/,"A little background as it may be relevant. I am a senior MIS major, 3.9 GPA with multiple extracurriculars and I did a social media analytics internship with BOFA last Spring.

This summer my aunt called me and said her work is looking for a programmer and I should check it out. I really was not looking for anything as I was heading India for a software engineering class in 2 weeks. So, I go to the interview and they explain that it’s a basic SQL query/report writing gig with a few other things where they need me, visual basic for their POS system etc. I tell them I do know SQL but am by no means a pro, they say we can treat this like an internship and I can learn as I go. So, I am thinking this is sweet, sounds good! They offer me 10 bucks an hour and based on me wanting to get experience and it sounding super mellow, I agreed.

So, I go to my first day and learn that I am the sole SQL writer, no one in this office of 5 people writes code and there is only 1 IT guy. Everything for the system that is built and coded in Bangladesh. So, from day one this is not an internship, I am the sole stateside developer. My first day I was sent an excel spreadsheet with 100 different types of widgets/reports/alerts that needed to be written, I have deadlines, customer fixes, when I do not understand stuff they do not say no worries take your time, they then badger me constantly, where are you? how long till your done? 

Today they decided that I should start doing business intelligence and analytics, determining KPI's and writing reports. I have to pitch to the overseas developers how we can work this out on the front end on Wednesday. They are even talking about me writing an app after that.

One of the main Pros is that they do let me have time off when I need it no questions asked and I can work remotely when needed. After I was hired I worked for 1 week, then headed to India and Indonesia for 2 months. 
Of course, I am getting a decent resume point for future jobs and the experience is good. I feel as I could walk to any SQL internship or position and land the job.

The cons are
I am taking 4 super hard classes 3 days a week and I am not sure I can continue to dedicate myself without effecting my GPA. Especially when I am making barely $150 a week after taxes and it is a 40-minute drive. I received a ton of scholarships this year and am doing fine money wise. I am literally thinking about queries in my sleep, instead of school. 

I feel a bit taken advantage of by calling it an internship and paying me 10 bucks an hour. I am also sick of being talked to in a condescending manner by non-programmers when I do not understand something. Some of these queries are a bit out of my skill level, as they want some reports 5 different things that do not even match up. I have taken queries to my professor, posted on reddit and stack overflow all with the same outcome; it is not possible, they need to lower the requirements or break it into 2 queries, or it is possible but it would take a significant amount of time and they still act as if it’s a lack of knowledge on my part and that I need to figure it out. From a non programmers point of view its easy whats adding 2-3 more things.

As an internship, I am hoping to work with and learn from the people above me. Here I am learning by googling stuff and know I am starting to retain a bunch of bad habits. 

So here is my question should I look for a different internship or am I being a baby and this is a gem for the experience. They say they want me for the long haul and want to hire me as soon as I graduate but I am not going to work here. I want to go to a company where I can grow, learn from senior developers, learn industry standards etc.

6xj8yl,105,2017-09-01,Apartment all to myself (Part 1),ghostoflaika,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6xj8yl/apartment_all_to_myself_part_1/,"I got home from work and stumbled over the throw rug just inside the door.  I managed to catch myself before it went too far.  I looked down, annoyed, and saw a little ripple in the rug.  I smoothed it out with my foot.  It’s funny how quickly we return to our routines.

“Maya!  I almost just killed myself on this stupid rug!”  I yelled with a laugh.  She didn’t respond.

“Oh yeah, you’re in Iceland on your amazing internship, leaving me here alone to slog to work at the store every day.”  I said to myself.  She’d only been gone two days and I wasn’t used to being without a roommate yet.  She deserved to go, and I missed her, but there were perks to having the apartment to myself.  I pulled out a whole stack of kimchi to eat with dinner without her giving me the stink eye.  I ate while watching Netflix, and eventually fell asleep there on the couch, TV droning.

I woke to a weird noise.  It took me a second to figure out where it was coming from.  I followed it to my computer desk and found my phone sitting there ringing.  It was odd because I don't normally leave it there; also, it wasn’t my ringtone.  I tried to answer it but the other end went dead immediately; I must have been too slow.  I rubbed my eyes as I got into the settings to fix my ringtone.  Before I could fix it, a text came in.  The sender said unknown, which I had never seen before.  

*Are you alone?* 

*Haha, very funny, who is this and how’d you block your number?*  

*That was me that just called.  I wanted to make sure you were awake.*

*WTF, Jason this better not be you.  I’m gonna beat your ass when you get back from break.* 

*Jason?  Not even close.  How did you enjoy the ringtone?*  

My heart jumped.  I immediately spun around, eyes darting to every corner and back.  My skin crawled; I could feel someone watching me.  For a split second, I thought about searching the apartment for the perpetrator, but I’ve watched enough horror movies to know how fucking stupid that is.  I bolted out the door and ran across the hall.  I banged on my neighbor’s door and it swung open almost immediately.  I pushed my way in.  He looked startled, but let me pass through.

“What’s wrong?”  Jack asked.  

“Lock your door.  There’s someone in my apartment.  I have to call the police.”  I said.  He looked startled, but did as I asked.  He stood by while I called.  I felt immensely better after hanging up; they were sending a patrol over to check it out.

“You sure it’s not a friend playing a prank on you?”  Jack asked, having heard me explain the whole thing to the operator.  I had calmed a bit and I felt like maybe I WAS overreacting.  Then my phone buzzed.  A text.

*You shouldn’t have called the police.  You aren’t going to want them to find what I left for you in there.*

*You haven’t found it yet, have you?  It was still there when I checked earlier.*

My mind raced.  If this was a joke, I didn’t get it.  Then it hit me.  I rushed back over and stepped just inside the front door.  I flipped up my throw rug, the one that had tripped me earlier.  Beneath it was a little plastic bag; inside was some sort of course light colored gravelly stuff.  I looked a little closer then realized what it was; I’d seen Breaking Bad.  I stuffed it into my pocket and ran back to Jack, who was waiting with his door open.

“What was that?”  He asked.  Before I could explain I heard hard footsteps outside.  We both got quiet, then there was a firm knock on my door.  Jack looked out his peephole, then opened the door.  It was a cop.  I let out a long breath.  

“You called about a break in?”  He asked.  He quickly checked the apartment, there was no one there.  After he’d cleared it, I followed him in to explain what had happened, but I was glad to see Jack left his door open.  The cop listened to my story, but he didn’t seem all that concerned as I was telling it.

“So, someone broke in and changed your ringtone?”  He asked, sounding skeptical.  I nodded.  He looked over at the perfectly intact door then back at me.

“I mean, they didn’t BREAK in, but they snuck in.  They got in here without my permission.”  I clarified.  He nodded but didn’t look convinced.  

“You sure the ringtone didn’t just reset to default or something?”  He asked.  I showed him the texts.

“Looks more like a friend pranking you, is that a possibility?”  The little baggy of drugs was burning a hole in my pocket; for the briefest moment, I thought I should pull it out and tell him about it.  He’d understand it was a real break-in and not think those were my drugs at all, right?  I hesitated, something about his skepticism made me think twice about handing over what could essentially get me arrested. I didn’t show him the drugs.

“If not a friend, is there anyone you can think of who would do this to you, maybe an ex, angry coworker, angry neighbor, anything?”  He asked.  I shook my head.  He put his blank notepad away.

“Alright, well, do you want me to look around some more then?”  He asked, his eyes scanning the kitchen.  He shifted the throw rug in front of the door with his foot.

“No, no, that’s alright.”  I said, worried what else might be hidden in my apartment.

“You sure?”  He asked.  I nodded.

“Ok, I’ll file a report.  Call if you can think of anything else or you have any other issues.”  He said before leaving.  Jack watched him go, then looked at me for an explanation.  I slipped across the hall and he closed the door.  I knew Jack was the kinda guy who didn’t trust the cops 100%.  I pulled out the little bag.

“What is that, meth?”  He asked, sounding completely unfazed.

“I think so, I’ve only ever seen it on TV.  Someone snuck in here and left it in my apartment. I think they did it so when I called the cops they’d find it and arrest me.”  I said, scared again.  He took it and stuffed it into his pocket.

“I’ll take care it for you, don’t worry.  Are you gonna stay over there tonight?” He asked.  Jack was a nice old guy, weird, but nice.  He always wears one of those Vietnam hats with all the pins on it.  I think he’s on disability from the VA because he never works.  He helped me move my computer desk up to my apartment when he saw me struggling in the stairwell and we chat when we pass in the hall, but I don’t really know anything else about him.  I considered his question.  It’s summer and all my friends were back home or on internships for the season.  I don’t have a car and I barely make enough money to pay my rent, let alone enough to splurge on a hotel room.  

“You can stay over here if you want.”  He offered.  I had never been in his place before.  I looked around; there were books stacked up everywhere and it was in desperate need of a cleaning.  He chuckled.

“I know it’s a bit of a bachelor pad, but you’re welcome to stay if you’ll feel safer.”  He offered.  I was hesitant, but then I thought about going back to my apartment alone.  He went to his couch and pulled out a large object, then handed it to me with a grin.

“If you’re not comfortable staying here, maybe this’ll help you.”  He said.  I pulled it from the sheath, it was a large and well used machete.

“She’s been through a lot with me, but if she makes you feel safer, you’re welcome to borrow her.  Be careful, though, she’s sharp.”  He said smiling.  It did make me feel safer.  I glanced back towards my apartment.

“Want me to come look around with you?  I promise I won’t call the cops if we find any more meth.”  He said.  I agreed and the two of us walked around my apartment opening closets and cabinets until we’d checked everywhere, we found nothing.

“I’ll be right across the hall all night.  Don’t hesitate to call me or come over if you need anything.  And remember, you only have one life to live, don’t let anyone ruin it or take it from you.  It’s yours, not theirs.”  He said, very serious about the last part.  I was touched by his comment.  He patted my shoulder and closed me into my once beloved first apartment.  I immediately felt a sense of dread.  I was alone again, but I didn’t feel alone.  I went straight to my bedroom, closed the door and pushed the chair up against the door handle like I’d seen them do in movies.  I plopped onto my bed, still holding the machete.  Every creak, every footstep in the hallway, every voice from another apartment, I was sure were all coming for me.  I didn’t sleep a wink.

I got up early for work, exhausted and emotionally drained.  Getting no sleep did allow me time to think, I knew I had to catch whoever it was in the act so the police would have some evidence, before I became the evidence.  I set up my webcam to record, downloaded a remote desktop app to my phone, then headed to work.  My heart jumped when my phone rang in my pocket halfway there.  I dreaded to look at the number, but when I did I felt instant relief.

“Dad?”  I answered.

“Hey kiddo!  I don’t have long to talk, but I had a minute and I wanted to see how your summer’s going.”  He said.  It took him a few seconds to respond to my greeting; there’s always a delay on his satellite phone.

“It’s going OK, Dad, how’s yours?”  I said, not sure how to even start to tell him about the problems I was having in what I knew was going to be a short conversation.

“Busy as ever.  I wanted to tell you how proud I am of you, I know you’re working very hard.  I hope you’re having fun in your apartment.  Your mother would have loved to help you pick out furniture and decorations for it.”  He said, I could hear his voice getting wistful, even across the terrible sat phone connection.

“I know, I miss her.”  I said.  He didn’t respond right away.

“Dad, there’s something…I don’t know what to do.  I’m having a problem.”  I said then waited the appropriate 7 seconds for his reply.

“What’s that sweetheart?  You broke up, I missed the last part.”  He said.

“I need some help…I’m scared.”  I said.  

“I don’t know if you can hear me, but I think I’m losing …I’ll call as soon…”  The line went dead.  It was good to talk to him, even if it was so short.  I was sorta glad his phone cut out when it did; he couldn’t have done anything from where he is but worry; I shouldn’t have even mentioned that I was having a problem.  I felt slightly better at work than at home; at least in the light of day and with people around it seemed safer.  Even though I tried not to think about it, I found my mind running over what had happened.  I couldn’t figure out who would be doing this to me, I lived a pretty mundane life, I certainly had no enemies that I knew of. 

It turned out to be busy enough at work that I didn’t get much chance to check my phone.  In a way it was nice, I could kinda try to put it out of my mind.  The problem came during my lunch break when I pulled up the app and instead of showing me my living room, it was just a black screen.  I started dialing the police then it occurred to me that it could just be an error in the app or maybe I forgot to set the computer to stay awake or something totally stupid.  I told Doug I had an emergency and he let me go early.  I rushed home.  Jack cracked his door open while I was fiddling with my lock.

“Problem?”  He asked.

“I don’t know.  Could you keep your door open, just in case?”  I asked.  He nodded and it made me feel a little safer knowing at least someone was there.  I headed straight for the laptop.  I froze when I saw it hadn’t gone to sleep, it was closed.  I didn’t even bother grabbing it, I ran out into the hallway.  I pulled out my phone as I rushed downstairs.  I dialed 911, but before they picked up I got a text.  

*I hope you’re not calling the police.*

I could hear the 911 operator pick up; I hung up.  Did they have control of my phone?  I thought of the remote desktop app I’d downloaded; did they have something like that on my phone?  How do they know I’m calling the police?  Another text came in.

*You know I like to leave gifts for the police to find.* 

I shut my phone off.  Whoever it was knew exactly where I was and what I was doing.  I didn’t know if it was my phone or not, but I wasn’t willing to take the chance.  I rushed out of my building and into the sunlight.  At least there I felt in the open, the stalker could see me, but so could everyone else.  I walked the few blocks to the police station quickly.  There I waited for an officer to talk to me.  He was a tall man, he took me into a small room and asked me to tell him the story.  I laid it all out for him, as much as I knew, and he listened, giving no indication of his feelings about it.  He took a few notes, but not as many as I would have thought.

“It’s illegal to file a false police report.”  The cop said flatly after I’d finished.  I stared at him, trying to figure out what he’d said.

“What do you mean?”  I asked finally.

“This is your tenth report this month.  I don’t know if you’re just bored or if you need some kind of counseling, but you will be charged if you keep doing this.”  The man said, he wasn’t angry when he said it, more annoyed.

“I’ve only called the police once in my life and it was yesterday!”  I insisted.  

“I pulled your record when you checked in here at the station and read all the reports before I came out to talk to you.  The responding officers all wrote in the reports that there was no evidence of break ins or harassment of any kind.  I suggest you get yourself some help.”  He said then stood to show me out.  I was so shocked I didn’t know what else to do but leave.  I ran home, my mind racing.  I made it to my door before I broke down.  I didn’t want to go inside; I just stood there and stared at it, then I crumpled.  I heard Jack’s door creak open as tears ran down my cheeks.  He kneeled down and put a hand on my shoulder.

“What’s happened now?”  He asked gently.  The whole story just spilled out of me between sobs, I told him about all the texts and the computer being shut and the police reports.  I had no idea who would do all this, but someone was tormenting me.  I told him the cops weren’t even going to help me; I was probably going to turn up as one of those dead girls and they’d talk about how the cop’s hands were tied and there was nothing they could do to stop it all from happening.  They’d all say how terribly they felt about it, but I’d still be dead.

“I’m starting to think you might be in danger.”  He said.  I actually laughed.

“Oh yeah?  What the fuck gave you that idea? Anyways, there’s nothing I can do; I don’t have a car, none of my friends are here to help me, my father is at sea, I don’t even have any money.”  I said.

“Do you want to get out of town?”  He asked.  I dreaded to hear him offer me a ride.  He pulled out a wad of cash from his pocket then pushed it into my hand.

“You have family somewhere else?  Can you take a bus or rent a car or something?”  He asked.  I managed to pull myself together and stood up.

“Yeah, my grandparents live in Florida.”  I said staring down at the money.  He whistled.

“Well, probably rent yourself a car and drive straight there.  That should be enough for the car and fuel.”  He said heading back into his apartment.

“Just get yourself somewhere safe, I seen too much in this town to watch a nice girl like you get hurt.  The cops’ll get their act together eventually.”  He said.  I left the door open so he could watch from the hallway as I quickly grabbed a few things.  On my way out, my foot caught the throw rug in front of the door.  I flipped it up and what I saw was not what I’d expected.  I actually had to squat down and get a closer look just to confirm what it was.  It was a dead goldfish.  Then it hit me, I knew who had been in my apartment.

At my very first internship, I attended the trade show and, guess what, I closed the deal with the foreign construction company. Two years ago, I worked at the startup with no business team. They didn't have a financial statement, accounting record, etc. I did everything. It was very challenging, and I had to keep going back to my professors how to sort out everything. One day, the miracle happened, I found the investor to close the deal for series A funding. The CEO was very happy, and he really appreciates me. 
Now, I am working for another startup and building a business logic to implement into their software. The CEO and managers LOVE me. Literary, they always say I am the game changer of this company. This week the company closed the deal with five clients by just showing my prototype and logic behind that. 

However, even I applied, I have never gotten a chance to work at a large company. Most of my friends are doing an internship at large companies, and when I talk to my friends, I realize I am in the completely different world. 

In startups, I don't have anyone to ask for questions...My friends always advise me, ""You should ask your supervisor for instructions, ask them questions, don't hesitate."" I am not hesitating; just no one knows the answer. They hired me to do the work that they can't do.

So, what is the difference doing the internship for startups and large company? What usually interns at a large company do every day? What are the expectations in the large company? How do they measure your contribution?

I don't need any more training if that helps.

I am a fourth year student in computer science and have been at the same internship for the past 1.5 years. The company is fairly large and offers a pretty good wage, culture perks, and the people are great. 

The only problem here is that the experience I'm getting is not really what I want. I write SQL queries day in and day out, I do the work of what used to be split between 3 people but received no pay raise, and the amount of work has increased tremendously.

I recently interviewed and received an offer at a very small company (~5 people) and included would be all of the equipment that I have at my current position, plus a pay raise, plus experience in what I actually want to be doing.

My question to everyone here is: given this scenario, what would you do? Stay at the cushy larger company with all of it's perks and people, or go to the small company, work harder, and receive experience in what I want to do after graduation.

Any help would be much appreciated."

Here's the abridged version of my story. When I graduated high school, I didn't actually want to go to college, I wanted to be lazy and get a shitty job with no regard to my future. But, I went because I felt pressure from my parents. You can probably already tell where this is going.

I chose computer science because that's what my dad did, and I liked computers, so I thought I would enjoy CS. I did not. This is partially due to the absolutely terrible professors I have had, but I dedicate at least 80% of my conundrum to my own bad attitude. I have a 3.2 GPA, no extra-curriculars, no personal projects outside of the ones I've done for class, no internships, and should have graduated already. I became apathetic and dropped out with only 30 credit hours left from graduation.

I've been working for the last year at a shitty job, and suddenly realized that I *do* want to go back to school and make a better life for myself. I think I will actually enjoy CS now that I crave a challenge. Thus, I reapplied and have been accepted for the Spring semester. However, I have no idea how to recover. Here are my main questions:

* Are there any good online resources for the most important CS classes? I've been lurking this subreddit since I made my decision to go back, and it looks like Data Structures and Algorithms is the most important class. It's also the class I did the worst in (though I did pass). I would really be grateful if there were online lectures that I could watch to get a better feel for the material. After that, I will likely do a LOT of practice problems.

* Am I completely fucked for applying for internships? Will the youngins beat me due to the fact they took their shit seriously from day 1? I also am not located near a tech hub. My school is the University of Florida.

* Will I be able to get a job without an internship? I'm 100% okay with not working for one of the bigger companies. In fact, I would actually prefer to work for a smaller company at first, even if it doesn't pay as well. For the past year, I've been working as a technical consultant at a computing help desk. Perhaps that may work in my favor?

* Will anyone even *want* to work with me/give me work on a project with my below par CS knowledge? Or do I just need to be more confident in my problem solving skills?

I really appreciate any and all advice you guys could give me. I'm very worried but I refuse to give up."

I transferred last semester to a okayish, relatively unknown state university, and that's the only semester I've finished where I've been considered a CS major. Based on what my adviser has told me, I still have about 7-8 semesters left before graduation.

As I haven't taken a whole lot of CS core classes, I don't have much to show for it. I have 3.5 GPA, I'm somewhat proficient in Python and Java, I understand the basics of git, and have a decent understanding of the most popular data structures and algorithms, but I really don't have any projects showing that off besides some small school projects.

I'd say my only advantage right now is having some relatives that work at some pretty big companies who want me to send my application directly to them as opposed to going through a traditional application, but I can't imagine that would help me a whole lot, especially considering the competition I'd be up against.

Do I have any shot at an internship next summer? Or should I spend it honing my skills and working on some personal projects, and then shoot for summer 2019?

However the new job is pain in the ass. I have completed just a week and I already feel like to search for another job. The reason I feel so is .
1) The code sucks- They made interns to wrote their whole app. And there no good practises, god classes and I don't understand what to do in the code. However in such a bad application they expect me to fix their bugs.Naturally I suggested we need to fix the code first however they said they don't have much time to fix the code as they want me to work on some other application too.
Worst of all they don't even have any senior developers.

2) Unspecified responsibility :- So I work at this company as an Android developer. However they don't have any IOS developer and they want me to write code for IOS too. Here's the truth I don't know a shit about IOS development. In fact I don't even own an Iphone. At the time of interview .I clearly mentioned that I am not ready to work on IOS still they are trying to push  me to work on IOS.

3)Lack of facility:- So in Android we need some emulator's to test our code. So the one that comes with the IDE isn't that good. So I suggested them to go for a paid emulator's however they want me to work on free one cause they say they can't afford as they are the ""small company"".
Here's the second rant.The place where I work there's no canteen or any hotels nearby when I leave office typically at 7:00 I feel hungry as fuck. I have to travel all the way to my place so I can eat something good.



I feel a heck lot demotivated to work in such environment .However as I am a fresher. I guess  I had to continue to work here for sometime.Currently I learning some stuff so I can get a job at other place. Can someone give me some advice as to what should I do."
6xv40h,1,2017-09-03,"Limited amount of time at top school, #1 focus is job- should I eschew theory courses for practical courses?Will this hurt me down the line?",Gibbssss,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6xv40h/limited_amount_of_time_at_top_school_1_focus_is/,"Hi,

Some very quick background about myself, which I think is relevant:
I was a little lazy growing up the same way I'm sure a lot of other people were, disappointing GPA coming out of high school, went to local state school, 2 meaningless years and I dropped out. However, I got my act together, worked hard, enrolled in CC, and transferred to a top school in the northeast, one I would have thought I have no business being at considering how poorly I did prior. 

This is where the question comes in. My parents help me out financially by covering rent and food expenses, a blessing I'm not overlooking. I was able to transfer 60 credits- about half the graduation requirement. But in starting over, I chose a new career path- CS- which means I essentially had to complete a CS education in about 2.5 years rather than the full four. This means that I have to be selective with which electives and courses I take. 
I just finished a pretty full first year of courses and got most of the essentials out of the way, but I'll be in the market for a junior internship- yet my programming breadth and depth knowledge can be described as freshman. 

But this school, for all it does for me, is really expensive. Like really expensive. A 3 credit class is $5000. I need a total of 30 more credits to be eligible for graduation, but I'm now having to make decisions based on the financials involved rather than purely school reasons, as Im in the private loan game.

Btw, if any more info is needed, please ask in the comments, its hard to be able to include all relevant info off the top of my head in this post. 

Ok, if you've read this far, the questions are as follows. I'm registered for an introduction to cryptography course that I was looking forward to taking that is purely theoretical and doesn't teach any hardcore practical skills. A general consensus is that I should be broadening my CS horizons and making sure I know about all that's out there, but I'm nervous to waste precious time and money on something that won't help me land a job- the #1 most important thing for me. I like and appreciate the theory of CS and would probably enjoy it much more if I didn't have to bankroll this school. I already have a courseload that involves the rigorous C programming course and a quick course that teaches python. Should I replace the theory cryptography course with one that is programming based and teaches practical skills?

Thanks a lot for the help, and again, any additional info you need, just ask, it's hard to remember it all off the top.

TLDR: Go to expensive school, a 3 credit course is $5000, I only have 3 semesters left and freshman-level experience, should I eschew a theory-based cryptography course I wanted to take for a practical programming course instead if my #1 focus is getting a well-paying job out of school"

6xvhrd,2,2017-09-03,More internships or go for full time?,asdf-qwerty-career,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6xvhrd/more_internships_or_go_for_full_time/,"I posted in the daily chat thread yesterday but didn't get any responses so I thought I'd make my own thread.

I'm a second degree student. Just finished my first 8 month internship with a small startup (&lt;30 people). I did a bunch of backend &amp; some AWS and front-end.

They have verbally offered a full time position once I graduate. I'm definitely looking around at my other options though, and I'm not entirely sure if I should pursue internships or full time. 

Pro for internships: can get more varied experience, in bigger companies (and options!) 

con for internships: take longer to graduate

 Pro for returning full time: I already know the company, can have ownership over features. 

Con for returning full time: I won't have the resume weight of a big company, very few mentors. 

Pro for full time elsewhere: best of both worlds! 

Con: harder to get a job - have been getting a ton of rejections already. I don't know if my experience is enough for a larger company. I'm not necessarily targeting top tech, I'd be happy somewhere like SAP/Cisco/Oracle/GE.

Does anyone have any input? "

I've posted here before and got good advice regarding my situation. I now recently have turned 25 and thanks to finally getting my life on track I was able to graduate college in 2015 and completely turn around my terrible GPA, stop getting in legal trouble, stop using substances etc. 

I graduated college with a BS in Criminal Justice - nothing spectacular but the legal system has always interested me and I have always felt like it was a field that would be emotionally rewarding for me. My problem now is that I have held down an 'ok' job as a social worker now since basically the moment I graduated college. Going on three years of being a social worker has been an eye opening and extremely interesting experience. I have (hopefully) impacted many lives but it has sometimes come at the expense of my own health and I believe that I am starting to become emotionally fatigued to the point that I would rather go from making 40-45k a year to just making 10-13/hr. 

I don't live in a huge place, but I live within commuting distance of many major cities (Baltimore, Washington D.C., places in VA etc.). I just know that for the amount of stress I have acquired through the field that I can't continue at this salary level right now. A lot of my co-workers and friends go on to get their MSW (Master's of Social Work) and then make 60-80k fairly easily, but I am just not convinced that I will be able to continue in this field long enough to make that a sound investment. 

My personal interests are cars, financial investments, research and analytics, and IT. I have a meager IT background but my family is comprised of people who have done IT their entire lives and would always be willing to help me learn more. 

I just have no idea where to go from here because now social work is really all I've ever 'done' in the professional world. Should I try and go towards sales? Should I go back to school for a different degree and go through a different internship? Are there other options within the criminal justice system or government as a whole that I should be looking into where I would be able to have a higher salary? 

I just feel completely dead in the water right now and I'm not sure where I should go or what the best choice would be or if I'm missing something. I'd be happy to provide more information about my hobbies or interests. I don't have a criminal record, at least nothing past the age of 18. 

I appreciate any guidance you all could offer me on this or any advice you could give me. Thanks for reading all of this! "
6xxofc,3,2017-09-03,I really don't want to go back to school because almost everything there gets on my nerves (xpost r/offmychest),Theseus_The_King,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6xxofc/i_really_dont_want_to_go_back_to_school_because/,"I have enjoyed living life at my own pace this summer, and being able to better choose who I want to be around. Now that I'm going back, I feel like I'll have less control over my life, and I'll be forced to deal with people I really want to barely see and be thrust back into drama I want nothing to do with anymore. I'm going to be going from high rolling to babysitting again. 

I am neutral on seeing my classmates in my program, they are at least tolerable to be around. But I don't want to see any of my former coworkers at the diversity initiative where I work, but am going to quit very soon. I'm almost 23 years old, I will be working with kids who were in middle school when I was a legal adult, and they still cause drama and play games like they are in middle school. I don't feel on the same page as them anymore; there is always talking behind people's back about who's problematic for what really at the end of the day small behavior, there is poor communication and no one really tells you if there is any serious issues. In my old group there was always infighting since there was never any proper communication, at first I thought it was the people who did wrong things but now I think its just poor communication. They start big commotions over someone doing something exactly not to their liking, if you aren't 100% ""pure"" you are evil and problematic and an alt right nazi. 

I don't want to go back to my student house. Not only is it dilapidated, my one roommate from the diversity organization never cleans up after herself and the house always has roaches and rats because of it. She blames it on being depressed but it affects me and my other roommate from my program, who has no idea how to work a vacuum and has panic attacks when she even sees a tiny mess. I feel like I'm babysitting them both. The only reason anything gets cleaned and the roaches get any taken care of is because I actually give a shit. I tried telling them to do it, but it never got done and I got fed up with living in a roach infested pigsty. 

The diversity one also invites her friends from the initiative to stay in our house , which I have a hard time saying no to because they are honestly in some rough places. But I don't know how compatible I am with them as roommates. Sometimes 4 or 5 people are crammed into a three bedroom flat and I would look like a dick if I said no.

Really, the only people I'm looking forward to seeing are my friends I game and watch anime with, my ex who I'm still really close with and the guy I currently like who I've had feelings for for the last 9 years. Since my best friend and longest friend go to different schools, they're the best I got and the only people I feel I can be myself around, without having to monitor if I'm ""problematic"" or doing a ""microaggression"" or not and split hairs. It's tiring to self monitor all the time, and feel like your always being watched, which is why I'm often cranky at school apart from being essentially forced to live in a pigsty. Everyone in the diversity group is either a fuckwit or a giant baby, at the very least my ex isn't a fuckwit and guy I currently like isn't a giant baby.  At least my ex doesn't chew me out over using the wrong kind of word or using a term that went out of vogue. At least my ex doesn't hold me to a standard of moral perfection, since he's seen every one of my flaws laid bare and I've seen everyone of his. At least I can have an honest relationship with him and not one based on talking behind people's backs and doing things to save face instead of a genuine concern.

In fact, guy I like is kind of why I saw the diversity group is full of dipshits, he's a cishet white man and I realised that the idea that cishet white men are all privileged evil oppressors that can only be wrong and evil that the diversity people all hold to be gospel is full of shit. He made me realize all that drama is full of shit. He's a much more mature, interesting, moral and beautiful person than any of the diversity people can ever hope to be. I'd rather spend a minute with him than an hour with any of them. He's been away during the summer for internship but I really hope he is coming back. 

At the very least this is my final year, but I've had enough of this stupid campus, enough of this dilapidated house and infantile roommates, and most certainly enough of all the drama and deceit. I am never a happy camper when I'm at school, unless I'm with my anime/gaming friends, ex or crush. 

How do I survive my last year? How can I get through this with my dignity, and patience, already worn thin, intact? I don't want to make enemies with the diversity people I just want to quit gracefully and keep my distance while spending as much time at home/with people I actually care about as possible. How do I continue living on my own terms?"

As title says, Im (19 years old) currently at about 40% of my credits but Im only at my third semester out of eight (at this pace I think Ill just finish my career en 7 semesters actually)

But Im concerned that I have ZERO work experience, nothing at all. Only 'real' work Ive done has been like in construction when we were building our house (not high income family so we all placed a brick at a time. Almost literally) 

I've come to the point where I really want to be active in my life. I've been a really good student, top 1-3 of almost every class I've taken, but thats about it. For the last year or so I've really tried to improve my social skills (which were non-existent before) and have improved and I feel really proud of it.

Right now Im on the lookout for an internship, asking my family to see if they know somebody who's willing to hire me for no pay (or a little pay in the best case scenario), but I feel like it's enough and don't feel comfortable just waiting for it to come to my hands, not anymore. And forgot to mention that I mostly want an internship because I want the best experience I can get on the field of my career and I'm really lucky (and thankful to my parents) to don't really need the money 

So Id love it and feel so grateful if you could help me out on how to ask by myself for an internship, like how to sell myself as you can see there isn't much to be sold

Also and most importantly, where to go next? what else can I improve or how you guys got where you are at the moment?

What are the things that I should be wary of at this stage of my life?"

I will soon be a sophomore at UCSC and I am quite frustrated at myself; I feel like I am not doing a good enough job at teaching myself in the field of computer science. During this summer I have jumped  around so many thing I feel like I have learned some things but not enough. I've worked on my C++, taught myself emacs, leaned how to use the basics of CMake, switched to Linux (tried Arch Linux failed installation then switched to Antergos), and tried to learn a little about web development. All of them are just little improvements but I feel like other students around me are doing much more in terms of improving their knowledge of computer science. It's really hard for me to find any internships because I live in what feels like a no mans land for technology.**I feel like I really have no guidance in terms of what I should be focusing on when I'm teaching myself; Usually I start trying to teach myself something and then I start thinking that learning something else is more important so I switch to that and so on and so on. I feel like I am just going around in a circle.** 

Now I am trying to learn data structures to get ahead of my next class and am trying to refresh myself on Java. I feel like my coding skills are still not enough to land myself in an internship and I feel self conscious about the code I write because I feel like it might not be enough to be good enough to get an internship. If anyone could help me start heading towards a general direction I would be very grateful.

***tl;dr:*** I don't have a general direction/ goal to point myself towards so I just end up trying to teach myself a bunch of things but always end up switching after some time. I would appreciate some guidance on where to start really focusing so that I can have a better chance at getting an internship and getting more experience in computer science. "
6xyew4,0,2017-09-04,Is it worth aiming for eminence in software development?,BOT_JANE_9291,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6xyew4/is_it_worth_aiming_for_eminence_in_software/,"I'm graduating next May and in the spirit of that, I've done some reflecting and I feel like asking the community, is it worth tryharding? Yes, completely subjective and apologies for the self-indulgent post, feeling a bit angsty given soon-to-be-graduated status.

Two years ago I started studying CS at an unremarkable university. Throughout my time here, I've aced my classes, worked two internships, dicked around with all sorts of fun ideas; Overall, I've been exposed to the discipline and frankly, I really enjoy it...in certain ways, working at my own pace. By the time I graduate, I most likely will have a full-time job with a salary most Americans would kill for. But it's nothing compared to what the extremely adept developers are, from what I perceive, capable of accomplishing. 

I'm well aware of society's skewed emphasis on young, passionate, successful adults who seem to have been precocious children. Yet, at this age I still can't help but compare myself to them. These are the guys who I imagine stay up until the wee hours of the morning, pounding away at code in a state of flow until it works. They're the ones who have interned at multiple big 4 companies starting from their first year of college. The ones who have projects on GitHub that have attracted the attention of a niche of the open source community at large. When I take all of that into consideration, I realize how much talent is really out there and frankly, it's terrifying despite knowing that there's still a place for most people in the field given that they have half a brain. But I think I could do something great in the field...at the cost of tremendous dedication and discipline, which I'm not sure I have for the craft.

From someone who has reached a highly esteemed position in their career, was it worth it? Assuming that you had to work hard and make sacrifices, were those sacrifices worth it? Would you have, in retrospect, spent your time elsewhere?

I don't think it applies to every Situation in my life, but in regard to one Situation especially: Meeting my boyfriends friends. If this is not the right subreddit for it, I am very sorry. I will try somewhere else then.

I feel so uncomfortable and awkward with them I can't deal with it. I feel super tense, unlikeable, ugly, boring and a piece of work when I am with them. Its extremely noticeable and I don't think they like me very much because of it. And I totally understand it, I don't like myself either in these situations. 

I don't know whats wrong with me, and why I can't relax and be myself with them. And the worst thing is I totally feel sorry for him, because he has to be with me. It is so extremely uncomfortable and stressing that I wish we wouldn't be together or break up, so I wouldn't have to do this again. I have to say his friends are not bad people, or rude to me, the problem is 100% me. 

After the first and second time i met them i felt shitty for a week, each time it caused a downward spiral of negative thoughts and self-hate, where I truly wished he would just dump me because i was a piece of shit and didn't deserve him. Its actually causing problems with my relationship to him, because I start to distance myself from him or get kind of mean. And I hate myself for it, because this is not his fault. It's harmful to me, my relationship and for my boyfriend. I feel like i can't talk to him about it but I really want to. The reason i think I can't talk to him is probably because I don't want to be seen by him as this piece of work girlfriend who is too socially awkward to be with his cool friends. I don't want him to think he can't see his friends anymore or that I don't like them, or that he somehow has to chose between me and them. I don't want him to think that I am so weak I have a nervous breakdown every time I meet new people.

 
**I didn't write this text to fuel this self hate, or nurse it, I want to change something by finding out where the problem is.** I need help doing that or maybe an explanation as to why I am this way. Maybe even the right questions to ask myself could help.
I started a list of things I do and need to change, or problems that are causing this situation. But I think there is a more broken down version of this list that I cannot put together right now. 

* I think I want to be liked, which is extremely normal for human i guess but also pretty annoying. I don't think I have this feeling in every social situation, I don't have to be liked by every person in any other scenario. But those are not just some people, they are special to him. I wish I could get along with them as easily as he does with my friends.  

* My second problem is my self-esteem in general I guess. I have very good friends, with whom I can be myself, don't have to be ashamed of being honest and true to myself. Since I am still studying at 27 and work some student jobs beside it, I often feel like the chances are getting slimmer and slimmer to a job and a career in the field i love and would like to work in. I often feel very worthless and anxious because of this lack of perspective and dread of the future. I guess it depends on the group of people your with, but it can be very uncomfortable to say that I am still studying at 27, that my career choices are difficult, that I have to work beside it so I can afford a living, that no, I can't yet afford to work for free or for very little money as an intern during the university break. Since his friends all seem to care a lot about their career and are all pretty much settled with their job, it is one of those situations where I feel kind of judged. This fear of being judged by others or them seeing that that I am failing nurses my low self-esteem. 


I met most of them only 2 or 3 times, and even thou first impressions count a lot I hope it is not too late to change something. I just have to rationalize it more to change it i guess. "

since a couple of days my PC just keeps on shutting down. Not even the usual shut down, its just power-off, nothing left on. It seems to do it quite randomly, but it doesn't matter if i leave the pc on, or start applications. So i assume it is neither heat, nor software related.


Since i already thought of upgrading the PC, i thought i could do 2 things at the same time. Find the broken hardware and upgrade whatever makes sense to upgrade.


Here are my current Specs:



* AMD FX Series FX-8320 8x 3.50GHz So.AM3+ BOX 


* 3072MB XFX Radeon HD 7970 GHz Edition Double Dissipation Aktiv PCIe 3.0 x16 (Retail)


* 120GB Samsung 840 Basic Series 2.5"" (6.4cm) SATA 6Gb/s TLC Toggle (MZ-7TD120BW) 


* 1000GB WD Green WD10EZRX 64MB 3.5"" (8.9cm) SATA 6Gb/s 


* Pioneer BDR-208DBK Blu-ray Combo SATA 1.5Gb/s intern schwarz Bulk 


* Enermax ETS-T40-VD T.B Vegas Duo PWM (blaue+rote LED) 


* 550 Watt Seasonic G Series Modular 80+ Gold 


* 8GB-Kit Corsair Vengeance Low Profile blau PC3-12800U CL9


* Gigabyte GA-970-UD3, AMD 970, AM3+, ATX



How could i find out which piece of hardware is currently malfunctioning? Is it obvious, like the power supply or maybe mainboard? After i found it, what would be smart upgrades for my current system?



Would i be better off just buying a new MB, Graphics Card, Power Supply and processor, and leave the rest as is? Or is that even not possible?  Computer Repair Shops here want at least 115 Eur for the repair, depending whats wrong they charge even more + hardware of course. I feel like it would almost make sense to just upgrade it as a whole then for that money spend...



As you can see i am a total newb with hardware and stuff. So thankful for any tip and advise! I build that PC 3 1/2 Years ago myself, but that is a long time ago :)


Thanks again &amp;

My grades have been improving since my first degree but due to illness, it took me 6 years to graduate first degree and even took a lot of breaks in between for my second degree. My average for CS degree is far away from good (B+). My grades do still fluctuates based on my health condition. I tend to do well when I am less ill.  I have finished most of the core curriculum.  Also, during my breaks, I did create a few projects and attended a couple of hackathons.

If I do get an interview and if the employer asks me to explain the breaks and inconsistent grades (the coop sends transcript without withdrawals), should I be honest and say health conditions were affecting it? I am worried that this may raise a red flag because I would think that companies would prefer to hire someone healthy that won't quit halfway through the work. 

Or should I just tell them it's due to something ""personal"" and lack of discipline?

I majored in communication and was a national award winning editor for my college's newspaper. I've had internships and other jobs as well, probably not an unbelievable resume but definitely at least decent for my age.

I have almost no network since most of my friends are around my age and are either also struggling to find a job, or are just in entry level positions with not much sway, or are still in college/grad school. 

Therefore, I pretty much just apply for jobs on job boards like Indeed, Glassdoor, MediaBistro, etc. and it's really gotten me down. Submitting applications on those sites feels almost like a fruitless pursuit since I know so many other people are applying for all of those jobs and in the hundreds of applications I've sent out on there I've secured just one interview. I've had a few phone interviews but they haven't followed up/answered my follow up emails. Many employers/employment agencies seem to just ghost me after a short while which makes me feel even worse.

I have tried temp agencies/employment agencies and they haven't really helped. I've followed up with them multiple times and they've just either stopped answering/not really been any help.

I just don't know what to do. I'm looking for something in a communication discipline--PR, Marketing, Journalism, etc. and I have proven work that shows I can do those things, but I just can't get any bites. I'm willing to accept low, entry level roles at good companies just to prove myself but I can't even get that. 

Besides applying on job boards, is there any other thing I can do that I'm overlooking? I really need to find something, I will have to start making payments on my student loans in the next few months. I'm working part time at the moment for not much."

I'm going to pour my heart and soul out into my essays so I really need to get started on finalizing my list, haha. 

**Demographics:** SE Asia, female, need aid

**Academics:** 4.0, Rank 1/400, ACT: 35, Math II: 800, Physics: 780, Literature: 790

**Extracurriculars:**

* Founded a large tech non-profit: It's my main activity and I've put my heart into it. We're a group of students that develop design and programming curricula, go on outreaches to schools/marginalized places to teach them, host hackathons and workshops, as well as incubate student projects and stuff.
* Robotics: President of school team and member of the national robotics team; research and development head lol, mentor kids, help organize local/national robotics competitions
* Startups/development: Co-founded and developed two web apps that won some local startup competitions, trained under professionals
* Literary publication: Founder and head editor
* Women in tech: One of the heads, interschool org
* Internships at a bunch of local startups
* Random volunteer positions: Graphic design and development work for different tech and social groups/events
* Random activism/political stuff: Bill author in a national youth congress, senate volunteer, organized a literary symposium event
* Student council
* Debate team

**Awards:** Bunch of international robotics awards (most aren't FIRST), published research paper, self-published novel, poems at different literary publications/magazines, national excellence in science award, some minor writing and science awards

One of my top concerns is showing universities that I can handle the workload. My school doesn't offer AP/IB and I've never finished online courses, and I don't have any major national math awards either so I'm panicking about course rigor lol. For my intended major, I'm interested in either *Computer Science* or *English*. I haven't actually decided which of the two is my top pick, though doing a joint major/minoring in one would be lovely.

6y3b8q,3,2017-09-04,"Provided friend a temporary place to stay, staying longer than preferred",evrythingsirrelevant,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6y3b8q/provided_friend_a_temporary_place_to_stay_staying/,"The friend I speak of is a rather new friend, I only met them this year, but I know a great deal about their life. We'll call him Mark. Long story short, Mark got kicked out of his house because his mother is crazy. Mark used to live across the country from me and claimed he had no friends or family that will take him in so I offered him, in these exact words, a temporary place to stay to get him on his feet. He agreed it would be temporary. My dad's house has an extra room since I moved out and am going to college in the city so my dad said he could rent out the room for $100 a month and he has to help my dad with yard work, chores, taking care of the dog, etc. My dad is a very lenient and generous person, not strict. My little sisters, high school age, live in the house as well so Mark living there is obviously infringing on a little privacy and comfort and they said it's okay because it's temporary. 

Now a little more than 2 months has passed and Mark just recently got a minimum wage job that wouldn't be enough to afford his own apartment (which is what he should be aiming for). Important note: Mark has no license (he's 19) and has damaged connective tissue in his feet so being on his feet for long periods of time is painful for him and therefore he uses the bulk of his money to buy a lot of weed and smokes all the time. I've been pushing him to either ask for more hours, get a second job where he can sit most of the time, or get an office job because he has 2 months internship experience working for a state dept. of economics; attending meetings, note-taking, everything. 

Every time I start a conversation about going to college or getting a better job so he can move out he gets very emotionally charged and frustrated using words like ""shut up, fuck you, etc."" I never use these words back because I'm not emotional about this I'm trying to give him tough love to get a new job. He also takes it personal when I tell him I don't consider him family, just a friend, he doesn't get a pass to stay longer in my dad's house. He is a very pessimistic person towards himself meaning he always thinks he can't do things. He thinks he sucks at everything and always claims he'll end up in a homeless shelter if I kick him out or don't give him enough time. 

I talked to my dad and he seems to be fine with it so far because he does help out a lot around the house, but wants him out by summer of next year. I feel an overwhelming responsibility to keep confronting Mark on behalf of my family. Another reason I don't want him staying long is because I made friends with him at boot camp and I left boot camp because I knew it wasn't for me and wanted to leave all of it behind, but seeing Mark every time I visit my family sort of irks me I guess. I'm a very introverted person and keep my family closest to me and hate when friends invade that circle. I've told him all of this, but he only takes it personally and ends up crying. I know he probably isn't at his best considering he misses his family back home, but I don't know what else to do or how to motivate him correctly without him getting angry or frustrated. 

I just need some advice on how to handle the situation. He respects my dad a lot so I might just use my dad to tell him a timeframe to leave. A year seems too long in my opinion for it only took me 2 months to find a decent job, apartment, move to the city, and start college after boot camp. He just seems to be complacent with a minimum wage job that hurts his feet and only paying my dad $100. How can I approach him without him getting hurt and with him feeling motivated to apply to better jobs or college? I just really want him to grow up and accept his reality and own it. 

tldr: My friend got kicked out of his house, I offered him a temporary place to stay by renting out a room in my dad's house, now he seems to want to stay too long for comfort. He gets very emotional when I bring up he needs to get a better job and move out. I don't want to have to resort to kicking him out so how can I approach him to motivate him and not make him frustrated or cry?"

I've somehow gotten a few internships every year with really small startups (less than 50 people) managing various tasks right from Data Science to PM and learning a lot on the job. However, I'm graduating soon and have still not been able to get a single interview for a full time role (let alone an offer) from any major tech company or a fortune 500. I'm sick and tired of working at startups because of their culture and poor w/l balance and for many other reasons. I've definitely learnt a lot and I just want to make a move to a more stable job opportunity at a bigger company which I had always been eyeing for since freshman year of college. 

It's been 4 years now and everyday I pick myself up and wake up in the morning, refreshing my email a few times in the hope of hearing back from the bajillion recruiters / managers I cold emailed to, or the few thousand applications I applied online, but in disappointment. I've been strong and resilient enough not to break down with every possible rejection I get from automated emails for 4 years by taking that in my stride and improving myself by doing better and building more challenging projects and publishing it. What hurts more is, every summer / fall I see my other friends (from other universities) working / interning at one of the Big N and I feel so happy for them andI envisage to have the privilege and work for those companies some day too, and I tell myself that this would me very soon, but I'm just tired of doing this over and over again and sick of not being able to be where I had planned to be at the timeline what I had set for myself. At this point, I'm so low in my motivation and self-esteem that even if I'd tell myself that I'd succeed some day, I almost immediately laugh at the how stupid that sounds, since I've given up on myself and the fact that I've been consistently forcing myself to believe and do things that was way out of my league. I sometimes agree that I attempt to take up extremely hard challenges for the rewarding results and how much I can learn from it, but most times (or all times) have failed at successfully nailing them. I've reached a point where my parents are not longer emotionally supporting me and are asking me to take up any job that I could find. This is since my parents are extremely old to support me (and even themselves) barraged with loans. I need to replace my dad as the sole breadwinner of the family so I could let him retire (he has been working 24x7 since there's no one else who could support him and has an ailing disease which if not taken proper care of, could make him permanently bed rested for his few years of life that he has left). Everytime I think about the foolish ""Go big or go home"" plan, I tear up and feel that I've just not been able to achieve things what I had always desired for and have been horribly unlucky in not getting opportunities what my other friends at the better universities get (since the big companies visit their campus and are easily considered for intern / FT roles) while I struggle to even get an interview here with all the effort that I put in, and sometimes I go out of my way to do harder things that I've almost never seen any of my friends at the bigger companies even do to get a job. 

I'm sick and disappointed of how unfair the entire system, I started off knowing this was true, but I started challenging myself to prove this false, and ended up convinced that there are always people who have things easy without working as hard as how other people who are more deserving have worked. 

**TL;DR:** 
Senior year, worked at 4+ startups doing dev/PM roles and looking for a job at a bigger company, but after trying for 3+ years, verge of giving up on hopes of looking for a CS job and looking for alternatives for the time being until I get to the bigger companies. Stuck in a terrible family financial situation with ailing parents and forced to earn ASAP. Looking for advice, since I'm emotionally and mentally tensed, verge of a mental breakdown and I feel I should start working at a nearby Starbucks part time for paying the bills.

I didn't fit in at all but it really started to impact me.  I stopped going to events and ended up just getting high in my bedroom alone a lot and having sex w random girls I didn't really even find attractive.  I then got home and met my girlfriend of the time.  We immediately started having sex and falling in love and going on adventures and she became my closest person.  I had what I thought were amazing friends that I started pushing away for her.

That happened at the end of the summer and two days later I left back for my university while my girl was back home.  


I became a mental health wreck - anxious, depressed, OCD, everything.  And was completely dependent on her. I was smothering her and we were just talking all the time.  She was missing me too, but it was different.  Around November she started finding out about my past and just started judging me and insulting me constantly.  She told me she had a right to do this and would almost break up w me weekly because an old girl of mine would follow her on Instagram and she couldn't handle it.  She started accusing me of cheating which I never did.  When she was mad she would ignore me and just drive me crazy.  I ended up coming home the next semester hoping shit would get better between us but it just got worse.  I fell into an even worse depression.  She would say the cruelest things and break up w me over everything.  Constantly call me a liar and whatever.  I blocked all the girls on my phone, but she was ""convinced"" I was cheating.  She would talk to her ex but not let me see their texts claiming it was about us.  She called him to come over when she was mad about me and said they didn't do anything.  I would cry every day just wishing it was like it was when we started and wishing she'd be kind and love me right.  I started questioning if I loved her or if I was attracted to her anymore months before, but just chalked it up to my mental health.  Fast forward to June, my dick stops working w us having sex and she just makes me feel terrible.  It seemed like it was all about the sex for her.  I knew she had cheated on me in my heart and I eventually broke up with her in July.  She came over the next day banging o the windows and when she saw my strictly platonic female friend come up from downstairs she went batshit screaming she'd kill her.  It was crazy and that was the last time I ever saw her.  The next five weeks were really awesome and I hung out w some amazing friends and traveled.  Now I'm in israel on a gap year program, but find myself still anxious and confused and thinking about her and the internship I could've had in Brooklyn.  I'm confused about my sexuality and have no idea what to do.  I've fucked a dozen girls but now I'm so scared.  The dick not working thing had happened before and Im just terrified of that.  Plus I have something called prostatits which makes it hurt to pee or cum and I just have no sex drive anymore.  My mouth hurts because I need oral surgery and my stomachs fucked because of acid reflux.  I've been getting treatement and meds for a while but I'm scared and it just impacts me everyday.  Im sick and tired of being sick and tired.  I feel like I have a lot of moments of happiness but they're so fleeting; I need to get back into a groove and hopefully I'll find mine here.  

I'm a good looking, intelligent kid but am really really insecure and find myself questioning everything I say and do.  I feel so abnormal a lot of the time.  It's so much better when I'm high but I can't get my hands on weed here.  everyone here on the program loves me but I have trouble connecting on a deeper level; I feel like no one truly understands me and maybe that's fair because you can never truly understand anyone else.  I also don't understand me so it's fair.

I'm a pretty good graphic designer and everyone thinks I have what it takes to make it to the next level and I think I'm going to go to art school but I'm just really scared and confused.  I don't know what to do about my mom she keeps trying to get back in my life but she just caused me so much anxiety and confusion, but I also miss my family and dogs.  I don't know what the fuck is normal anymore.  My ex just fucked up my already fucked head so much.  I feel hopeless.  

tl;dr: just got out of emotionally abusive and toxic relationship; really bad anxiety, confusion, and possibly depression; no idea where my life is heading; in israel for the year with a program"

I like my boss, my team, and job except the pay sucks.

I've seen career services to improve my interview skills and tried taping myself. In the past I used to get to final or second round interviews but I can't get a second round for this positions (mid level accounting, customer service, and marketing jobs since I can't find any entry level jobs with recruiters.) 

The only difference I had before and after college is that I have lower self esteem. I've seen mental health professionals before and after college; I didn't find them helpful.

Too many people told me including my university said I should move out of state because besides retail most of the jobs are in automotive engineering, farming, IT, nursing, and physical therapy.

The reason why I'm still instate is because I'm still working on my hoarding problem (cleaning up things from my college days.)

I've tried online classes and going back to school isn't an option because I work afternoon, nights, and weekends.

I like my job but I'm 25 years old and made more at my internship than the jobs I'm interviewing for. Basically I've been underemployed for two years, but year one was me being a shut in from agoraphobia (not working just interviewing) and year two working in retail.

Since 2015 when I was college up to now I had 50+ interviews (not phone screens); some of them were competitive and included the Big Four Accounting. Most were larger companies, it's not until now I'm going for smaller companies.

I'm grateful I had 10 interviews in the past 10 days; I followed up with all of them only less of them responded. Still waiting on my second interviews (that probably won't happen.) I'm physically and mentally exhausted because I've been driving and working across my state. I've been more selected but the jobs that suit me are out of state.

Has anyone been underemployed for two years? Any tips to get out of this mess?"

I'm 21 years old, going to school after a 2 year break (majoring in IT Software Dev), have yet to earn any qualifications (Unless MTA - Web Development counts), and am contracting as a L2 IT personnel in a nationally respected non-profit organization.

I'm only making $13/hr, and I expect to graduate from college within 1-2 years, depending on how fast I can finish the coursework.

My initial contract was based on a verbal agreement of $13/hr for 6 months. Since I had no prior professional experience in IT and I didn't have any qualifications for it, I decided to take the opportunity

I've recently found out that they are going to need me for an additional 4-5 months without any likelihood of compensation increases. My coworkers who are full time make $20-$27/hr from my understanding.

My question to you guys is how I should guide my career if you were in my situation? I want to be a programmer/developer eventually. Should I look for an L2 job that pays me a fair market compensation? If so, when? If not, should I just suck it up to build up my experience? I like the work so far but I would also like to be paid fairly compared to everyone else. 

Should I look for a programming internship instead? What would you do?

A determining factor is that this organization that I'm contracting for is highly respected and renown, and I feel privileged for even being here given my complete lack of professional experience prior to this. Thank you."

I also have a pretty good amount of web development experience from student jobs I've done.  

I notice I'm getting very quickly screened out of an inordinate amount of internships and jobs that I feel qualified for (not even getting a coding test); I'm concerned that it's due to the fact that I'm not technically in a degree program at the moment.  It seems like 75% of job postings have a BS in CS as a hard requirement.  I've had my resume reviewed, and do my best to emphasize the skills that I have, but I'm getting hardly any callbacks and I fear it's over something I have no control over save getting a Masters degree, which I would like to avoid.

This is my first job out of college. When I first started, I didn't have as much technical knowledge as the senior developers. The company said that as time passes, I would be gradually taught more. During that time, I would be given some business and IT tasks. I was given a below market salary for my degree (Computer Engineering).

Things were okay the first few months. I was learning some new skills, but the non-technical tasks would occasionally distract me from the skills I needed to know. When I brought this up at a performance review, the company acknowledged that and said they still wanted me to be a developer.

Time kept passing, and instead of learning more technical things, more non-technical tasks were assigned to me. It got to the point where I was reprimanded for focusing more time on a technical task instead of a non-technical one. Meanwhile, Interns are being promoted to technical positions and passing over me. Its as if I was so competent at the non-technical tasks, it was cheaper for the company to not advance me.

This has caused a lot of anxiety for me. I've lost a lot of confidence in myself. I didn't realize it at first, but while I'm given non-technical things, people in the industry are gaining they experience need. Meanwhile, my career is going backwards.


I would stay at my current position, but it seems the higher ups aren't interested in seeing me advance. 

How do I learn more of the programming skills I need for a pure technical position? Is it spending all my free time doing more coding challenges? I really like embedded systems. For example cross compiling and debugging Linux Kernels on dev boards. While I have a good foundation of C/C++ Python and ARM assembly, I still feel it isn't enough to get another job with yet.

Looking to start off on the right foot,Reset2,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/6yebf5/landed_a_1year_internship_looking_to_start_off_on/,"I landed a 1-year internship, earning $45,000 before tax paid bi-weekly. I only have OSAP loans to worry about which should be around $30,000 when I graduate.

I would like to travel to another country for one month right after I graduate and I currently live with my parents (I don't pay for any living expenses).

As for reoccurring payments, I was thinking of budgeting:

* $50/month for a phone plan
* $14/week for some recreational activities
* $30/week for eating out
* 120/month for public transportation

After reading the sidebar I have a few questions...

* How do you calculate take home money in Ontario? I believe I only have income tax:

Money | Tax | Taxed
---|---|----
42201| 20.05% | 8461.30
2799| 24.15% | 675.96
 | | 9137.26 

So... 45000 - 9137.26 = $35,862.74 would be my take home amount? And will I just divide this number by 26(biweekly payment)? That would be 1379.33 every 2 weeks. Hopefully, I did the rounding correctly...

* With my goals in mind, do I need to put money into a retirement plan (RRSP/TFSA)? I believe I'll be looking at a TFSA as I'll be making more later on.

* Where should I store my savings? Should I look for a high-interest savings account or GIC? Do you have any bank recommendations? I heard Tangerine used to be really good, but now it's not that great.

* I currently have a Capital One master card, which I use to build credit. I plan to use this as much as possible to also get points. My parents have been paying my previous bills, but I plan to take over that. I essentially use it as a debit card.

* I plan to have a small emergency fund as I live with my parents. $1000?

* I plan to give 10% after tax to my parents

Please let me know if I'm missing anything/miscalculated anything!"

Although I dont find myself dreading over my current internship position, and I seem to like it and dont mind doing the work. I just feel its a little irrelvant in terms of my background and what I would like to pursue as a future career. 

Whats your take on this? Any advise on how to move forward with this? Will this cyber risk internship be a plus point if later on I apply to a job in Deloitte, but in FSA or S&amp;O?

6yfc2x,1,2017-09-06,Need help with creating an SH script that installs git and composer and clones a repository etc..,rayaqin,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/6yfc2x/need_help_with_creating_an_sh_script_that/,"Hi everyone! This is my first post here ( or on reddit for that matter ) , so sorry if I don't follow some conventions I don't know about.

 As an intern i've been assigned to write a script for a project in my company that needs to complete the following tasks on a virtual machine:
-check if git is installed on server
if so, clone repo with codebase
-check if composer is installed on server
if so, composer install in the root directory of the laravel application
-finally, php artisan migrate --seed

The repository has a laravel project on it, that is being cloned.

I've been trying to solve this for an embarrassingly long time and it seems like randomly googling stuff about it without having the complete knowledge to solve the problem is a really hard task.. i feel like i'm just jumping from problem to problem without getting closer to the solution.

This is the code I have so far:


    #!/bin/bash
    echo ""The installation process is about the begin...""
    sudo apt-get install dos2unix
    if [ !which git ]
    then
    echo ""Git has been located on the destination system. Cloning begins...""
    git clone &lt;link to repository&gt;
    else
    echo ""There is no Git installed on the system. Git installation commences...""
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install git
    echo ""Cloning begins...""
    git clone &lt;link to repository&gt;
    fi
    if [ !which composer ]
    then
    echo ""Composer has been located on the destination system.""
    else
    echo ""There is no Composer installed on the system. Composer installation commences...""
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install composer
    fi
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install curl php5-cli git
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
    git clone &lt;link to repository&gt;
    composer global require ""laravel/installer""
    sudo apt-get update
    'Now the preferred version in the vagrantfile has to be edited to be 1.8.1 instead of 1.9'
    'Generate a ssh key'
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""&lt;my e-mail address at the company&gt;""
    'Start ssh agent eval $'
    ssh-agent -s
    'Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent'
    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    sudo apt-get install php7.0

    php artisan migrate --seed




Now I do realize it's a mess, but what am I doing wrong and how should I approach this problem the right way?  The point of this would be that the VM should be able to set up everything for itself just by running this script. So somehow I should be able to make it enter the passwords and get access to everything .. so that it would require no help from the user or administrator or whatever.


Any kind of help is really appreciated.

Thank you : )"
6yfhmu,19,2017-09-06,"Given a great opportunity, but I don't want to get stuck at this company for too long. I'm in HelpDesk.",eeza465,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6yfhmu/given_a_great_opportunity_but_i_dont_want_to_get/,"Hello all, I could use a bit of advice about an opportunity presented to me. 

But first some context: I'm a recent college graduate with a degree in Information Systems (I didn't realize what I was getting into when I started that degree, or else I would have done computer science or networking or something) and a minor in Intercultural Studies. I'm only 21 and single without much of a desire to getting married soon so I feel I have a lot of freedom with how I want my life to go right now. 

While at school, I had a couple of IT internships, but my second one lasted for a year and half and I was hired out of college full time as an IT HelpDesk Technician. We have a medium sized company and I help support our internal employees at our main offices as well as remote offices. And I really enjoy my job overall and I've had a lot of opportunity to grow. And in many cases, my job is much than help desk. I get a lot of opportunity to help my company improve and put my own ideas out there. Sure, help desk can be a grind, but the atmosphere at my work place has made it worth it. I only get paid $14.42 an hour, but I get great benefits, and the cost of living is relatively low where I'm at. And my student loans aren't too bad, considering I could pay them off in 2-3 years even with this wage.

Before I graduated, I had some trouble with whether or not I wanted to actually work here. Something clicked and I decided I actually did want to work here, at least for now. Ever since then I've been working hard to improve myself and improve this company and to frankly just get good at my job. My boss and I are pretty close and more and more he's been coming to me for my perspective and entrusting me with larger responsibilities. When he went on a two week vacation recently, he told certain important people and managers to go to me if they needed anything instead of our senior network admin, who is usually the fall-back when our manager is gone. 

In our IT department, we have about 12 developers, an IT director, two business analysts/devs, and 4 IT infrastructure/help desk technicians. I'm on the IT infrastructure and help desk side. In that team, we have our manager/sysadmin, our network admin, and two HelpDesk technicians (myself is one of them). 

But as a team, we've had some issues lately. Our network admin has not been pulling his weight and is constantly late to work. He will most likely lose his job soon. Which sucks because he's a smart guy and great his job. The other help desk tech is great at his job, but sometimes I feel he lacks the drive to improve and he doesn't have a certain amount of professionalism. He and I get along well, but ultimately he is my competition. 

All that said, my boss recently sat me down to say that he wants to find a way to create the job I want here and work with me to get the training for that position. He said that I've been stepping up a lot lately and that I'm the best communicator on the team while also being a solid technician. And he wants to provide an opportunity for me to improve. I've been interested in network administration for awhile now, and he said that the company would pay the bill for the certs and every time I got cert I would get a promotion. And if I wanted to do some other job, he would work with me. To add to that, later that day he told me that if I keep going on the path I'm going and stepping up, he wants to bridge the gap between what I get paid and where he thinks the level I'm working at is. He said he's working on getting me a raise come November. I just started full time three months ago (but I have been working there for almost two years). 

But he also threw around the idea of me being an IT manager. He asked if he could see me doing his job, or perhaps a hybrid of networking and management. He would love to see me do something highly technical, but also relational. And the more I think about it, I would too. My intercultural Studies minor has helped understand others well and I have affinity towards concepts, ideas, and abstract things. I try to see things with as many sides as possible and I try to stay as objective as possible. And that's one reason my manager values me. I try to bring more value than just being a HelpDesk Technician.

Honestly, this is an amazing opportunity. I get to decide what job I want (within a certain scope, of course) and I get to shape my career for the next few years. I'm definitely going to seek to improve my technical skills, but it's the manager part that I'm stuck at. 

I think I would enjoy having a managerial position. But I'm only 21 and I'm certainly not about to become a manager anytime soon. My boss asked me where I see myself in 10 years. And frankly, I don't want to stay at this job for 5-10 years. I'm in the Midwest, and I enjoy where I live, but after I get some experience and pay off my debts, I want to move somewhere else. And I want to move relatively far away as well. I'm definitely open to the idea of staying around, but it's not what I want. At the same time, this could be a great opportunity to obtain managerial training and skills. But I don't want to say that I want to receive manager training and in two years go somewhere else. Of course, I'm not obligated to stay, but I don't want to waste their time either. And even with the technical training, I don't want to say I want to be their network engineer, but then in two years just leave. And people tend to get sucked in this company and I'm not sure I want that.

I'm going to talk to my boss about my concerns, but I wanted to get some feedback from more experienced people. I could definitely use some advice.

TL;DR I can create my own job opportunity, but I don't want that to make me stay in a location that isn't where I want to be in a few years."

As it stands currently, they take all orders that are going across the border, individually count all items from all the orders, and then input everything manually from scratch, every time they have to go across the border, which is currently once a week.
This seems terribly inefficient to me, but I don't know how to finish my vision for optimizing this process.

What I would like to do is have an excel file that automatically filters the rows of the sheet to either hide items that have a quantity of 0, or to move items with a quantity of 0 to the bottom of the sheet so that we can save it as a file and send a copy of that file electronically to our customs broker.
	
Quantity | Description | Price
---------|----------|----------
0|hand control|3
1|relay switch|4
2|bracket|1

In this example, I would want my excel file to either filter the hand control row to the bottom, or hide it when we are done editing the file.
How should I go about this process?

I also know that I want to pursue grad school and I've had some better options west (more arts centered work) than the east (tech/medical; I am horrible at any math and science due to difficulties when I was younger; long story)

I live in NC and I really don't have much to apply for but cold sales jobs. Please understand I've done this work and it depresses me to no end. I've been conned into countless work that was disguised as promising but ended up selling internet packages to people who clearly are not and never going to be interested

I want to get into QA/ community management/customer service for the video game industry. And where I am working now, my contract is going to expire in September (basically I'll be jobless with loans and bills to pay), most of the people I am close with here are getting engaged/moving on with their own lives, or leaving the state, and someone very important to me is looking to move away as well. 

Basically I have nothing where I live in NC so why stay? I've always wanted to try new things, and explore new worlds and I feel as if I'm young now, I need to go do, and stop talking about it.

I'm 23 years old, female and I live with my mom and uncle and after a few arguments and tears my mom is starting to open up to helping me move out on my own and she wants to help. This is a good time to try and pop the clutch and make things happen and soon. 

I have put in for over 100 jobs in the last 2-3 days for internships with Sony, Ubisoft, Apple, Facebook, Reddit even, and smaller companies looking for immediate work. I'm ready to just start...living. Where I am now, and it affecting my mood and mental health is just unacceptable. It's affecting my sleep, I hardly can make it through a meal sometimes. Some days, I'm fine and doing well.

I guess I'm just looking for some solid advice on where to go, who to talk to and what should I do. Should I have a conversation with some of the people I know who are leaving? I don't want them to feel like I'm following them around or anything but where I am feels like a dead end. 

In terms of work, not to brag or anything but I'm super easy to train, I could do literally anything and learn it fast if someone taught me. 
I don't want to give up on anything, from jobs to a personal future, I'm super persistent and perseverance is a trait I pride myself on having.   If I want it or want you, even if that means dropping everything to pursue it, I'll do it or try within my powers to at least try.

Additionally, I am realistic. So I'm not looking to chase fairy tales and false hopes, if there are none. Thanks. I needed to get this off my chest

It is a month into classes and I still don't have a schedule, professors either don't show up or come 50 minutes late.  I cannot go out at night because of the sexual harassment. I have been robbed while in a taxi in broad daylight.  And I was physically assaulted after telling a man not to grab me and grope me, he spit in my face and was about to attack more but other men stepped in.  
Just as icing on the cake my lap top broke the day I arrived in Ghana and mold has grown in the closet they provide for us and I have thrown out half my clothing.

(virtualization, cloud, Linux, networking and security are my specialties) career. After my contract not being renewed back in February I've had a lot of interviews but still, rejection after rejection. This has left me pretty damn discouraged, and I'm looking at potentially making a change to web development.

I'm very strong with the ""infrastructure"" side of things and have a decent background in system analysis/design (my capstone project for my bachelors was lauded and we almost went into business with it). I had a software development internship back in 2014 that I left to go into I.T. for, largely because I felt useless and the tech was ollllllld (VB6).

My question is, is this a realistic goal? Is my background potentially a positive, or is it almost universally seen as a negative for potential webdev managers/owners? I'm thinking of starting out learning JavaScript and Python (am already pretty familiar with them, did my share of scripting in the past). Is the pay comparable or better than in I.T.? Job outlook better? I get the sense that I would have access to more interesting and diverse work than I would have setting up vmware or router configs, but I want to be sure. And the potential for meaningful side work is exciting.

In my city there is a program called launchcode that will pair you with an established company after you pass a certain baseline of coding aptitude. I intend to go for that to cover my lack of experience since my internship.

Anyway, I'm still pretty early in my search into this, but it seems exciting in its possibilities. I want to know if that is baseless or not :)

I recently graduated from college with a BBA in Accounting and have been applying to jobs, and I recently got a job offer as a full time Accountant for a governmental agency. However, I am unsure if I should take it for a couple of reasons.

I plan on starting my MACC, which I plan on doing for the CPA hour requirements, in January and do not know if I can juggle both being a full time student and a full time employee, when the time comes around. On top of that I also plan on studying and taking the CPA exam. I am not the smartest student in the world, my undergraduate GPA was 3.26 in my accounting classes, however I am a hard worker, meaning I put in a lot of hours to earn that GPA. By also taking this job, I will be limiting the number of GRA/GA/TA position I can get to essentially zero as they are full time commitments. I really want one of these position because the come with at least a 50% tuition waivers, some with 100% waivers. 

Secondly the pay isn't that good, $38k non-negotiable, as opposed to market rate of $55k. And in the hierarchy of accounting positions governmental jobs aren't the best. Don't get me wrong, I'll learn some great skills that I can transfer over when I apply for full-time roles at the Big 4, which starting my masters in January will allow me another recruiting to get these jobs. 

Lastly I'm currently networking with professional to try to get a summer internship in 2018, which they only offer if you're at least one year from gradation at the time of the internship, which works cause my master program is a one year program. Networking right has been my sole and full focus, so currently no job. 

Essentially if I take this job I have to juggle being a full time student and employee while also obtaining my CPA license, which will be essential when I apply for and network for full time roles while in my masters program. I'm not sure if the steady job will be worth all of the opportunity cost ie: tuition waivers and possibly not completing my CPA when I complete my Masters. 

Let me know your advice.

Is it much worse to apply to companies around Winter-time? Alternatively, should I just apply to some smaller companies for now, and hold off applying to the BigFour and similar companies?

Any advice appreciated, thanks!"

What positions should I be looking for?",dgwgdsgewg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6yiw7v/i_need_an_internship_but_im_not_qualified_for_any/,"I'm not really in great shape for anything. A mixture between indecisiveness, transferring twice, time off, it all didn't really mix well with a clear path. I initially wanted to do CS, but I got talked out of it by the CS director at my school. So I studied business instead, but that just made me appreciate the value of CS even more.  

I technically should be graduating this semester with my business degree, but I'm extending my graduation to least 3 more semester to complete more CS course work since I'd rather have a CS career or a CS career where I can apply some of my business background.  I missed last year's fall recruitment season and then failed to lock down the outlier employers that were still accepting applications in the spring. So I still don't have any internship/work experience to show, despite being ready to graduate. Since I'm staying another 3 semesters, I get one more summer internship opportunity, but I'm having a hard time finding CS related positions I'm actually qualified for with my limited Cs course work. 

So far, I've taken 1 introductory programming class since I had no prior experience. I learned basic programming with python, (simple data structures, loops, functions, some frameworks, but nothing too advanced.)

Second class I took was OOP with java. Covered things like different data types, variables, expressions, assignment, methods, javadoc documentation, parameters, iteration, selection, recursion, generic linear data structures and maps, exception handling, file types, file I/O, simple GUIs, programming to an interface and use of inheritance, introduction to Java threads. I was overloaded with my business classes last semester, so I didn't practice enough with programming. I'm now pretty rusty and forgot a bulk of what I learned in this class. I'm trying to do a side project with Java spring right now to get more practice, but I think I need to re-teach myself this class since I have gaps. 

I went to a couple hackathons and did some things in HTML/CSS. HTML seemed basic, but CSS gave me some trouble. I don't have the creative eye to make things look pretty.

The third class I just started, so not really applicable. Machine Organization. So far, we've learned binary/hexadecimal, logic gates, boolean algebra, and other stuff. I think we'll be building some hardware and learning C. 

Next semester, I'm planning on taking the more advanced portion of my current class, in addition to data structures and algorithms.


By the end of next semester, I think I'll be ready, or at least be minimally qualified enough for some of these positions, but I'm not exactly sure what to do right now since recruitment is now. I don't think I'll be able to pass a technical interview at the moment, nor do I possess qualifications. 

With that all being said, I'm pretty lost. What type of internship should I be looking for that would at least set me up for a CS related career."

So me and my girlfriend are both 21, going to a university, and are financially independent and live together. We are wanting to become common law married, in order to get the benefits of marriage on our FAFSA, as our parents do not support us at all, yet we have to fill it out as if they are. If we are common law married, we can claim we are married on the FAFSA and our chances for Pell Grants goes up tremendously. We receive no grants now due to our parents making too much money, but neither of our families support us. I work FT in summer internships, and she works PT year round during school(until her program doesn't allow her to) and nearly FT in summer. We have to use loans to cover the rest of our expenses for school and leftover housing that working/savings doesn't cover.

MAIN POINT:

We have lived together in total for 3.5 years. 2 years at my parents house, 1.5 years completely on our own. We have a joint bank account and plan to get married after college.

My issue is I cannot find anything on how to apply? to become common law married, from what I can see it may require an attorney and going to court? In which case, it would make more sense to go get married at the court house for real, and do a proposal and ceremony later on, after college when we have more money to pay for a wedding ceremony.

I am basically looking for advice on how to go about becoming common law married, or if it is in our best interest to do the court house marriage now.

We 100% plan on getting married, just not while in college. 


ADDITIONAL INFO:

I have 3 semesters left after this Fall 2017 semester, and she has At least 4 Semesters left, maybe more depending on her acceptance to her program. My tuition+fees currently cost $13k a year, and hers are going to be about $6k a year. We are already 
going to school in state and both receive a few small scholarships.


Everything I am thinking of doing is 100% legal from what I have read and interpreted, please let me know if not. Also, I know people may say marriage at 21 is too soon, I understand your viewpoint but we have been together for nearly 6 years, please keep it to my legal questions!

Thank you for any help

I mean the whole thing doesn't make sense at all to me.

The campus is great and we have free snacks and a gym. However, they didn't have a project established for me to tackle starting off. They basically ignored me unless I prompted discussion my first 2 weeks. My assigned mentor is in the east coast office so communication is always done through Skype and Slack. 

My mentor said he had 3 projects in mind. 1 was an AR project, another was to create libraries to make their SDK compatible with a hybrid framework, and another was Android Instant Apps. They decided that instant apps weren't fulfilling any of their business goals even though the tech is cool and AR was at the bottom of my interests, so that left the other project as my last option. I went with that and then few weeks into the project realize that the SDK team is entirely in east coast as well. If I needed help understanding something, I would have to communicate via Slack and very occasionally schedule screen sharing meetings to do walkthroughs. So this slows down my productivity considerably when the only people relevant to my project are out of the office by 2pm. 

On top of all this, the hybrid framework feels a bit buggy and I constantly run into unexpected errors when trying to build my app. I was able to develop a library and create an app to show that the native Android API method calls are being executed by the hybrid app. Once I finished part 1, the library files I imported for part 2 were not being packaged properly by the hybrid framework despite there not being issues on native Android. So my mentor tells me to switch to creating the libraries using iOS version of their SDK. iOS was much more challenging to deal with and I had to rely on someone to add me to the iOS development group to get the full paid developer privileges. Then the certificates had issues, which required me to try to resolve it on my own before contacting the admin, who created new ones that finally worked. Finally, here I am on my last week, barely scratching the surface of their SDK for Android and not being able to resolve all the quirks that came with the hybrid framework on time along with the slow communication with employees in other locations. I feel like I didn't give my 100% even though it also seems like I did whatever I could with the resources I was given. 

Another intern from last summer who joined as full-time had told me that he used the same framework but with Bluetooth hardware and told me that he noticed unexpected behaviors, rendering that framework unusable for production. On the bright side, I was making $30/hr and did enough to make it look appealing on my resume. "

For context, I'm a recent grad who has been seeing friends &amp; peers move onto the next chapter of their lives and I went through a stressful admissions process myself (for grad school). I'm not in a STEM field but I went to a school that is most known for their engineering &amp; business (UIUC). Also went to a fairly competitive large public high school. So here are the points I have to make! 

*  For the vast majority of fields, where you go to undergrad is NOT the be all end all to your success. What matters more is the kind of student you are in college and the kind of professional you will develop into. As a personal anecdote, I was soooo mediocre amongst the high tier students in my high school, mostly due to a shit ton of struggles with mental health (I had good grades in the classes I cared about, low grades elsewhere, decent rigor, high ACT, average ECs). Got rejected from my top choice (highly ranked LAC) and was pretty happy about UIUC but had lingering disappointment over the end result because I knew that I was capable of more. I got to college and something just clicked, I worked my ass off. Had good grades, a great social life, leadership positions, part-time jobs, internships, etc. And now? My current situation is right there amongst the current situations of the hyper competitive students of my high school and my high achieving college friends. The path I'm on is not mediocre despite my ""meh"" performance in high school. *The outcomes that arise from your college years are dependent on you.* Even if you don't go to your dream school, you can achieve your dreams by pushing yourself to work hard and take advantage of opportunities. Distinguish yourself no matter what situation you're in. For a CS anecdote, I know people who were rejected from UIUC CS doing far more exciting things than some of the UIUC grads. Obviously there are advantages to certain schools and programs and you should strive for those! But if things don't work out exactly the way you wanted, you're not doomed. You just have to keep going. 

* Your field of study might change. Going into college I had known what my end-goal was for two years. My first semester of college I decided that my dream was to go to law school. Towards the end of my sophomore year of college, my goals shifted again and this time, brought switching my major into question. I almost didn't do it because I'd been so set in my original major, for four years the idea that I would want to do anything else didn't even occur to me. Adults would always talk about how ""large percentage"" of people change their major and I never thought it would apply to me. And I have seen my peers change a lot more than they expected too (don't even get me started on how many people came in as pre-med and bailed). I think it's important to remember that you're not married to your major, and don't pick a school because it's good for your field if you don't like anything else about it! 

* We all know this but I'll say it again, debt is a big deal! Even if you expect to take on a high paying job after college you should still try to minimize your debt as much as possible. I know that taking a bunch of loans out to go somewhere you really, really want to be is tempting but having less debt means you can take bigger risks when you're done with school. If you're going on to more school after it means you have more flexibility when choosing grad schools. It means that once you graduate, you can move across the country to that expensive af place. It also means that you can take larger risks during your summer internships. Or that when you have your first job, you can spend your paycheck on exciting nice things or save for exciting nice vacations instead of paying back your student loans. I really do understand how manageable a large amount of debt may feel when you know you're years away from having to pay it off, but you *will* eventually have to pay it off, with interest. 

* If you're worried that you'll end up at a mid-tier school that feels sort of beneath you, intellectually, I think it's also important to realize that really smart kids end up at a wide variety of places. They go to schools outside that prestigious top tier for so many different reasons (ie. money and scholarships, wanting to stay close to home, loving the culture of a certain school, loving the location of a certain school, legacy, religion, etc etc etc). Keep an open mind about your safeties and remember that more often than not, college graduates feel so different than their high school selves, it's a time of really crazy growth and change. And to piggyback off that since this sub is so STEM oriented--just because someone isn't in a major that has a fairly clear direct career path (engineering, business) doesn't mean that they are stupid or their major is worthless. Many people in non-STEM are immensely smart, but in a different way than STEM leaning students are. And you shouldn't automatically disrespect the majors without a clear path or super high starting salary because they are still valuable, there is just more responsibility on the student to figure out what they are going to do with it. The future plan is up to the student to figure out because there isn't a defined progression already laid out. (If you are one of these students my advice would be to always be planning and researching your potential opportunities. You can't slack on it, you have to take initiative). 

Ok I think that's all for my soapbox. If this is interesting to anyone feel free to PM me, I tend to delete a lot of comments on my account to avoid revealing too much info! Sorry this is long, it's mostly things that I have figured out from personal experience and wish I had understood better when I was starting! As a last thing: college is a balancing game. You balance your newfound independence, your curiosity, your coursework, your personal life, your professional growth. It should be an exciting and fun and challenging period of life that sets you up for success and adulthood in all the realms of your life! Well, that is the ideal TL;DR college is what you make of it. . Now I'm actually done.

I'm looking for some advice on my job hunt.

I'm currently in the last few months of completing my PhD in Biochemistry at a very reputable university (in the UK). I have a 1st class degree, also from another highly reputable university. Basically, I should be pretty hireable from looking at my CV.

My problem is, one of the jobs (I think) I want to do is Science Policy. However, this field is very competitive, and thus far I have apply for 4 ""entry level"" jobs where I have not even made it to interview because thus far I have no experience. I have had an interview for an internship, but was unsuccessful.

My problem is, I don't know whether to continue pursuing this, or start to pursue another job. Bearing in mind, that I have never worked in policy, and therefore don't even know if I would enjoy it!

I have a lot of tutoring and teaching experience, and have always liked the idea of becoming a teacher to inspire kids to love science, and in particular, biology. This is something I know I already enjoy, and have experience in, so I should have a better chance of getting a job. Although I know that teaching can be incredibly stressful at times, it also comes with other advantages such as long holidays, which could make issues to do with childcare (for my future children!) easier. Plus, jobs are available throughout the UK, so if we had to move because of my partner, this would also make things easier.

So what's the problem? 

1) Entry level jobs I am looking at are paid significantly lower than entry level jobs for science policy

2) Pressure from other people, including colleagues and family members who feel I am ""throwing away"" my very good degree and PhD to go into teaching. They feel I am ""putting myself down"" and could pursue a more lucrative career.

3) I do feel I deserve to be able to start in a job where I am earning a decent wage - I am highly educated, and I have worked hard to get to this point. I am also 25 and want to start a family soon, which could be impossible on a small salary.

If anyone has any comments or advice I would love to hear it!

Tldr; trying to decide whether to pursue a higher paid job which I might not enjoy, or take a hit and do something I think I will love for less money"

*Experience:* While I was studying I worked for two years as a coding teacher for kids aged 7-17, and I also did several jobs as a freelance engineer/developer, mainly developing creative applications (games, VR apps, art commissions that involved coding).  
This summer I succesfully completed Google Summer of Code, working (paid) for three months with an open source org.  
I have a (I think) decent number of personal projects.  
I also do talks at conferences, I had three to this day and I have a fourth one scheduled in October.

If you are curious, this is my personal page: https://picorana.github.io/

*What I want to do:* I would like to continue my studies, preferably in the US, preferably in a great university. I'd like to pursue a PhD, or another master, or both.

The problem is, I get extremely anxious when looking for masters in the US, to the point of feeling physically sick. This is why:  

* My peers consider my curriculum great, but I'm really scared about comparing myself to the rest of the world because of the diverse education system of my country. For example, here is not common at all to work while studying, and our education is very focused on theory rather than practice. It's very uncommon for students to work or apply to internships while studying, as focusing on just studying is much more encouraged. This is why it looks like my curriculum stands out among my peers, but I don't feel that this applies worldwide because I see that in every other country everybody has already interned at some great company long before graduating.
* Speaking about this, I have no internships, apart from Google Summer of Code (but Google states that that's not to be considered an internship). 
* Although I did very very good during the master, my bachelor's didn't go as well and my marks are average. If I apply now, since my MSc will become official in January, I fear that they'll pay more attention to my bachelor's marks and not the current ones.

This process is so stressful to me, I am constantly looking at requirements for getting into programs and even the advice articles I find crush my soul, I am constantly questioning if I am good enough or not. Every time I see the curriculum of somebody else with a success story of getting in a prestigious program, I get depressed.

Please, please, please, this stress is killing me, give me some perspective (:
Thank you so much!

Edit: formatting  
Edit: I'm also open to suggestions like ""A second MSc is a waste of time"""
6yobdp,5,2017-09-07,Career Help,WigglerOnAcid,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/6yobdp/career_help/,"Hi everyone,

I'm a Junior at Penn State currently dual-majoring in Information Systems Development and Cyber Security. I kind of fell in the trap of just wanting to do something I knew wasn't too difficult but still computer related and I wish I could go back in time and just major in Computer Science. But the fact is, I can't. I would love to become a programmer somewhere, a game developer would be a super cool job (although I realize that's a sort of niche job market). But every job that I see that interests me says they are looking for someone in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Math. However, my school only allows freshman who can take all the prerequisites in time to enroll in Computer Science.

I'm thinking about dropping the Cyber Security portion of my dual-major and just finishing up the Information Systems Development option online via World Campus. While doing that, I could take all of the required math and physics courses at a local community college and maybe get a secondary degree in Computer Science at Temple or something? Or should I just try to go straight for a Masters in it after taking all of the Math/Comp Sci prerequisites? But would all of the Masters prerequisites combined with my current degree make the Bachelor's worth getting? I'm still unsure and very confused what I should do.

I currently have a really good internship at a great company, only issue it's for general IT, or Tech Operations. I would love to be able to get into programming, software engineering, or game development. I've been doing a lot of C# and C++ training on my own time, but my current Systems Development major really only uses Java. What do you guys think? I'm in a pretty weird situation and am very unsure what I should do. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

6yryax,5,2017-09-07,My dumb parents make me want to kill myself,therightchoice123,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/6yryax/my_dumb_parents_make_me_want_to_kill_myself/,"I'm only in high school and just started my junior year this week and my parents started their year of killing each other. I come from India but I've been living in the US for several years now, but my parents are living in India even though they are physically here. Their daily routine of vicious arguments about money drive me crazy. In a country filled with poor people of course having enough money is a great reason to do things even if it includes bombarding ones husband asking where all the money is. My mother isn't very well educated, and my father is a busy man working a well paying but busy job. He doesn't have the time to show her everything. He has to travel for work in the coming days, and he plans to go to India along the way, but all my mother cares about is whether or not he will stay with his mother (my paternal grandmother). Of course in every culture there is a bit of need occasionally between a woman and her mother in law but in India they are like mortal enemies. My paternal grandparents are greedy and sadistic people who ask everyone for money and then keep it. So it's justified for my mother to ask my father that. He tells me as I restrain him from hitting my mother that in their decades of marriage, not once has he payed for something without letting my mother know. I don't know who to trust anymore. 

I was home pretty late and was working on homework in the evening (I take 5 AP classes and an honors class and an internship). So I have to be very mindful of my schedule so I can accomplish my homework and exercise and get at least six hours of sleep. But I've spent an hour trying to mediate a violent fight between my parents. I had music on for their first round, which was one hour. I blasted the hell out of my ears and will definitely feel the effects of it later in life. But then my father went into the master bedroom, when my mother asked me to assist her to talk him down. She asked a simple question about money and three hours of bullshit ensued. My father hit his head on something apparently, before I joined to mediate. He was bleeding in his head. He was yelling at my mother while I tried to restrain him. Good thing I have forty pounds on him. I can't tolerate this anymore. Junior year is apparently a big year for high school and very stressful, but does everyone have this sort of thing keeping them from achieving their best? My parents tell me that every marriage has problems. BS. Their arranged marriage was doomed to fail. And yet they support their culture as if nothing can ever be wrong about it. 

If anyone wants to have a massive and loyal following, they should aim to garner those who follow them loyally like the Indians who follow they dated, abusive, depressing, boring, conformation based, and physically unhealthy culture. Because that's what my parents are doing. I can't save them. They have built the foundation of these fights a life time ago. In the Indian culture the family must act as a miniature economy. My father, who is living here in the states, is the rich foreign country lending money to the home country. The poor, most of my family, must rely on the rich to create jobs for them, represented by the wealthier dwellers in India giving them gifts and money. These types of behaviors have erased the value and emotion of their family. I've left them behind a long time ago. I can't bear the idea that I am desired for my potential earning power so I can give money to my poor cousins back in that country. And now my parents are beyond saving. So I don't know who in the world I can be close to. All of my friends lead equally busy lives as mine, and I can't ever show any hints of my screwed up life. I am the sum of all views and opinions my peers have of me. They'll never know of any of this. And I can't risk talking to anyone without preventing a divorce or something that can complicate thing even more. 

Finally, after 5 hours it has ended. I'm feeling a little depressed. No. Cross that. I wish I could be living as anyone but an Indian. These people have ruined themselves and live devoid of true emotion and survive on greed and think only in terms of money. 

I can deal with this. I know I can. But I don't know for how long. But godd**n these episodes have been more consistent lately. I don't know if I can survive this year if this happens every single week. And this is just the first week and I haven't even started half of my classes yet.

6ys43i,2,2017-09-07,How to turn a part time position into a full time one?,Astrocam88,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6ys43i/how_to_turn_a_part_time_position_into_a_full_time/,"So, I work on call at a print company, which is what I went to college for (printing). I got this job through an internship, I was aware that they were going to keep me on call after the internship was over. Everyone there is really nice and I don't have a problem with anyone. It's a great place to work. Last year, after one of the other guys left for a different job, they started calling me in more often for longer periods of time, sometimes over a month at a time, or even two months. 

This year, though, things have been different. I worked briefly in January and then didn't have a job for a while, so I started looking for another part time job because I was running out of savings. I ended up finding one in March which, the position was advertised for casual but I ended up working full time and even overtime for the bit over 2 months that I was there. My boss from the print company had given me a good reference. However, he texted me finally in May asking for me to come in. I talked to the employers at the other job and they said they were thinking of letting me go anyways because I wasn't keeping up with the others. I left that same day, texted my boss at the printing company that I was free, and waited, hoping to hear back from him soon. 

He didn't get back to me until near the end of June, and then when I got there I saw why - for some reason, he had hired someone else. The new guy was nice and all, but I was confused. I had told my boss I was free, why would he hire someone else? I worked for a bit over two weeks until he didn't need me anymore for a bit. The new guy stayed though. My boss also hired his daughter for reasons I am still not sure of. 

I had been hoping that after two years of being off and on with them that maybe they would hire me full time at some point. I really like the job and get along well with everyone. They seem to like my work. I just don't understand why he would bring on two more people...if he could do that, he could have hired me full time, right? 

I haven't heard back from him since the last time I was there, which is why I am again looking for another job as I'm going back to school (online, so I need money to pay for it directly). My parents have suggested maybe talking to him about possibly going full time but I don't know if that would change anything. I'm an introvert and not very assertive, although I have gotten a bit more courage in the last few years. I just would feel embarrassed and upset if he turned me down for full time. I am half thinking about asking him the next time I work there. I don't know though, should I? "

I chose computer science because of two reasons mostly. First, I am good at it. I am generally good with computers, although I am not sure if I like programming as much as I like IT, although I haven't quite figured out that part yet.

Second was that my parents basically forced me to go with it. It was either that, or electrical engineering and I did not want to do that.

Now, I am feeling a bit lost as in what to do after this associates and where to transfer.

I love astronomy, although I am not sure how good I will be in physics. Same way, I like the position of a stockbroker/financial-analyst but I haven't had even the starting training for it yet, and I am not sure how much I'd actually like the jobs.

I write in my free time and/or read history books since those are some of the things I enjoy doing in my leisure time, although I am pretty sure future job markets in either English or History are next to none.

I've taken a bunch of career tests and most of them point to Climate Change Scientist, Astronomer, Physicist, Database Manager, Atmospheric scientist, Hydrologist or a Geoscientist. (About three of them have given me these so far).

I'm not even sure what I am asking here to be fair. I just do not know where to go from here.

I've seen some of you ask about experiences finding second jobs and I thought I'd share my story. 

**Some stats**

* I'm an SRE.
* I live in a low-cost area in the midwest.
* It took me 2 months to find my second job. 
* I only looked for **remote** roles. 

I graduated in August 2016. I got a job as an SRE at a startup. Before that I had a job at my school as a sysadmin and before that I had 3 internship at a big corporation (not the big4 ... think of a bank. This corporation wasn't technical or software oriented at all). There isn't a lot of good tech jobs where I'm at so I was lucky to find my startup job. I was planning to stay for 2-3 years but they ended up telling me that if I want to get paid the same as developers I should keep my SRE tasks AND do product development so I left at my one year mark lol (more about this later).

**The prep + search**

My resume looks pretty good. I can send it to people interested but for one year there's a crap ton on my resume. I was working at a startup doing two people's worth of work ... I worked more than 40+ hours every week and I learned a lot. I came home everyday and read and read and read about everything. A bit about me:

* My skill set is infrastructure, all services in AWS, networking, linux, configuration management, security, automation, etc. 
* Languages I use are Python, Bash and Go. (Though I have familiarity with a lot more that I don't list on my resume) 
* I'm a good programmer too. My github profile has 3-4 nice projects in there. 

I was a bit confused on what to study for interviews. I tried leetcode and hackerrank and while I love solving algo problems, I thought no one would ask me those during interviews (and they didn't). After I interviewed a bit **I noticed that SRE interviews focus a lot on deep knowledge of linux, system design, AWS, being able to code in 1-2 languages and the coding challenges revolved around infrastructure i.e automation, deployment, consuming APIs, manipulating responses from APIs, filesystem manipulation, why this use this vs that etc** so there was no algo questions. 

**I prepared by reading even more. Focusing on Linux and Networking. In my spare time I also wrote some neat code to practice for live coding interviews. I did this every single day.** 

**My interview skills** 

* Technical interviews that are just a discussion with team members: I'm good at these. I can talk about infrastructure all day and since I have some experience, I love these interviews. They actually don't feel like interviews, they feel like a discussion with someone with similar interests. 

* Live coding: I don't like these lol. But I knew they are inevitable. I ended up being good at them. I feel like a lot depends on who is your interviewer but generally my tips are to **make sure you understand what they are asking. Ask questions and clarify and speak your thoughts! Also make sure to divide the problem into smaller ones if you find it challenging. Step by step! clarify these with your interviewer. Speak up!** I know it's hard to keep talking and thinking and coding!! but let the interviewer know about your plan and ask questions! they will help you out. Practice makes perfect! if you are slow, practice!

* The rest of the interviews were take home challenges. 


**My failures and what I could have done better** 

* So many times recruiters called me ""too junior"". Even if I fit their job description, they'd say they need someone with more years of experience. It was depressing. I can't wait to get to 5 years of experience. 

* I got rejected from one of my favorite companies after doing well in the interviews. I think I came off as too slow on the live coding interview. Practice makes perfect! 

* I couldn't get remote roles because I was too junior for some companies.

**Success!**

* I got an offer from one of my favorite companies. The salary is great and the culture is amazing. 

* I applied to Google for fun and got a call back in less than 12 hours later. I was stunned. Obviously I can't relocate and they don't offer remote roles so I had to pass on the interviews but I'm keeping in touch. Same with Yelp and Linkedln. 

Some people say that you should Find a job before you quit your current job. And I would agree if you have to financially support yourself and a family but I had enough saved up. I think this allowed me to only focus on finding jobs and scheduling interviews vs I wouldn't have put the same effort if I had a job because my job was draining and I was the only person on-call for outages.

**Was finding the second job easier?** 

umm ... It was more fun? You have more experience so you can't play the new-grad-doesn't-have-any-experience card anymore. People expect you to know some stuff. But it was more fun because of that. The response rate was much higher than when I was a new grad because of my resume. 

I know you like stats so there's more:

**In the span of two months:**

* Jobs applied : 43
* Call backs : 20
* Outright rejected with an email: 11

I have no experience in tuning postgres server, all my internships have been dealing with writing node or python apps in the backend.

Is there some resource I can read up on to improve read write performance of postgres server?

Right now I am basically doing two things.

Grep through all insert and select statement and try to find if adding index will help read performance and doesn't degrade write performance too much


I am also making some field less memory intensive, for example if I see that there is `varchar(100)` and the maximum string len in the db right now is 25 I plan to ask my boss to decrease it to `varchar(50)` instead, same with int and float. This should help making less disk fetch.


Is there anything else I can do?

I'm a student from UTSC that's in second year. I'm currently in my 3rd year of being in school but I switched programs from a pure com sci degree to a machine learning and data mining degree.

In my first year I failed a course and had to drop some and CR/NCR some others I was a typical first year thinking it'd be like highschool and my GPA was trash. Like literally under 1.0. Needless to say I was totally unprepared for the transition from highschool to University.

Since then I became a better student and I've been putting in a lot of time. In most of my courses the class averages has been C-/C and I've been getting a bit higher than that and my GPA is currently at 2.1 and I hope I can keep this upward trend going.

**So here's my question:** I want to apply to PEY after this year and I'm wondering if I can even get in/an internship with a 2.x GPA (don't know how it'll change after this year of full math/stats courses).

Skill wise I think I'm better than the average Joe. I love coding and I've been coding for a long time. I've made a load of things from a blogging platform with CMS capabilities, to my own social media platform hybrid of Facebook and Twitter. And even an online shopping platform. All built from scratch. (Using the MEAN stack if interested)

Based on this, do I even stand a chance? I know you have to submit your transcript and I'm scared that they may just see my first year marks and turn me down instantly. Or even so simply see a final GPA of 2.x and turn me down."

I have just started contributing to Mozilla's Firefox browser for Desktop. So far I've successfully completed four bugs. I have started with low-hanging fruit, like replacing legacy code with new implementations, with one of the bugs being a more involved bug that required a bit more back and forth between me and the mentor for said bug. Here are the challenges I'm facing:

* It takes a while to become good enough. 

To be clear, the Mozilla guys are *amazing*. Real life is not. By that I mean, as much as I find contributing meaningful, it takes a while before you have quantifiable skills that you can put on a resume. In between taking the time to understand the codebase and writing patches, you *do* get skills, but it looks like it'll be a while before I feel adequate enough to apply for internships and/or jobs. It makes my contributing feel like a waste of time. More so in this age of FreeCodeCamp's posts about how people get their first developer jobs and so on. 




* It takes me a while to solve a bug.

For this, I'm going to use my knowledge of JavaScript as an example. Now since I've been exposed to programming languages enough times (I've studied PHP as part of a webdev class, C as part of introduction to programming, and Java as well. Didn't do anything with them), I can recognize flow control structures and declaration of variables. But I have been undecided on whether to really go through a JS tutorial since it feels like I already know what they are introducing in the beginning stages of the tutorials while on the other hand, the Firefox code seems beyond me for some reason. My initial approach was to Google everything, but there are parts of the codebase that don't lend itself well to that. So I feel stranded.

Any tips, help or advice that the community can provide is much appreciated."

Just wanted to share my story and maybe get inspiration or advice from some people who have been through the same. A little bit of background. I graduated from a top 20 school in the nation about a year ago, and joined a third tier bank in New York as a software engineer. It was the first job I got so I was happy that I atleast had a job. I have been at the bank for about a year now and I hated it from the beginning. 

2017 hasn't been a particularly good year for me. My girlfriend left me at the beginning of the year, then my dog died and then two of my uncles died. So I was dealing with all that on top of not being happy at work which is where I spent most of my time. I don't know many people in New York so it started to get really lonely and I wanted to go out and meet people but wanted to fix my work situation first. So its my first summer in New York, the city of dreams, I decided to put all the personal stuff aside and try to fix my work situation first. I have basically spend all the free time I had for the past four months, at work, every weekend, every day after work, learning doing practice interview questions and trying to find another job. Overall I ended up applying to about a 100 jobs, the majority of which never replied, and most of them rejected me straight away. Out of the 5 that actually responded to me (three are the biggest tech companies and two big hedge funds), I ended up going to final onsite for three of them and got rejected at that point. At this point I have pretty much exhausted all the jobs that I think I qualified for. Its really depressing because I have a big 4 internship on my resume as well so its really tough to be in this giant city with so much opportunity and with my best effort but being unable to secure any kind of other job.

Not being ungrateful for what I have, because no matter how bad it is, atleast I still have a job that pays for my rent, but it is just really hard to know that you gave something your all and you thought you could do it but the world ends up punching you in the stomach saying you are not good enough. 

At this point with all the rejections and everything else that has happened, its really hard to do anything for me and not feel depressed and just give up. Have any of you faced a similar situation and any advice on how to deal with it?"

Take internship or work on developing my skills independently,bigfishindoggytown,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6z0c57/student_working_full_time_unrelated_job_take/,"I'm trying to decide if I should consider an internship offered nearby, I live in a smaller town, and there likely won't be another comparable internship anytime soon. I started out programming by taking Python classes on Coursera in early 2016, and have finished my Front-End certification on Free Code Camp in June. I am currently working on their Back-End certification, learning Node and Mongo at the moment, I really like FCC's style and curriculum. I'm currently attending college online (Champlain College, in Burlington VT) for software development, with 1.5 to 2 years until I finish. I'm taking C++ 1 at Champlain, and after the spring with C++ 2 I'll have a C++ certificate from them before I finish my bachelors. I am interested in eventually working in data science, but that could be 2-3 years down the line minimum. I have done some Python freelance work, but nothing too big. 

I work fulltime at a group home for adults at night at $13/hr, one week on and one week off. I am able to get 2-3 hours of free time each shift at work to do homework, or any other projects. I feel like I'm capable of learning new programming skills independently reasonably quickly with good direction and advice, but I have am very much a novice. 

The internship in question is full time, designed for CS students, and pays $15/hr. They say it can last up to 8 months, typically Jan-Aug. I am skeptical of applying for the internship, my thinking being that I could learn a lot more on my own in that time period, or that I'll hit a wall with what I'll be working on, or the fact that I'll lose the 2-3 hrs of free paid time I get currently at work, which I make great use of, for only $2/hr more. Thank you for reading my long-winded question, your advice and insight is extremely valuable to me.

TLDR: Take full time internship in small town for likely 6-8 months, or use the time to advance my skills and work on projects through college, Free Code Camp, Youtube, and other online resources?

All of this has added up to me being 26 and living in my parents basement. While my friends are living fun lives, awesome apartments, great jobs and cute girlfriends. Even making some of the right choices like getting a summer internship, being actively involved in an engineering design team, and participating in class hasn't mitigated this. I have over a dozen references who would speak the world of my work ethic, intelligence, and enthusiasm but it doesn't matter because most employers don't bother to check them until they made a decision. 

At the airbnb house there are a ton of girls having fun all probably around my age working in 55-70k/year easy PR/Event planning jobs. All because they either knew how to sell themselves or knew someone within. 

My small network doesn't afford me any leads so I am stuck with online applications which yields some dozen interviews but mostly companies who decide to pass me on because I am not 100% perfect candidate with 6 years of experience. 

Even if I did get job that even just pays above 45k/year, It will still be hard to develop a ton of good friendships like people do in college and high school. Even harder to find a quality girl since most relationships are formed through mutual friends. 

At one point I had a knife to my chest but was too afraid to go through with it. On the other hand a quick painful death would be better than a slow prolonged torture.  "

First, it featured almost exclusively singers, dancers and actors - people who might be well educated but who by no means need a traditional education to be successful in their field.  They are also fields where the overwhelming majority of people who aspire to be professionals never actually make a living that way. 

I heard lots of myths.  ""Graduation depends only on seat time.""  No, students have to actually pass their classes.  ""Schools haven't changed in a hundred years."" Obvious bullshit.  

I heard the old ""less memorization and more critical thinking.""  You have to know facts before you can think critically about them.  You have to know basic math before you can understand advanced math.  You have to know the facts of a historical event before you can analyze causation or compare it to another event. You have to KNOW shit - you can't just google it again every time it comes up.  Imagine reading an article comparing 9/11 to Pearl Harbor, but you were never expected to learn anything about Pearl Harbor.  The comparison would be meaningless.  Doctors have to ""memorize"" tons of shit.  Lawyers have to ""memorize"" tons of shit.  Engineers have to ""memorize"" tons of shit.  Learning requires remembering what you learned!   

One message seemed to be that high school should prepare kids to be fully capable engineers/computer programmers etc. by the time they are 18.  What the fuck is college for?  No, high school should be primarily for general education, while post-college should be where you specialize in your career.   

Another message seemed to be that students should choose what they study.  Well they already do to a certain extent - they're called electives.  But I think XQ believes they should be able to choose ALL their classes, with nothing required?  Really?  Will 14 year-olds really make good choices, or will we have an entire generation of singers, dancers, youtube video game players who don't know any math, science, history, civics, literature, writing skills, foreign language, etc.?  How many high schoolers would choose to take economics?  I guess it's not an important subject according to XQ.  What we need is a nation of 100 million professional dancers... 

EDIT:  Ah, the old ""every kid should learn to code"" line.  I figured it was coming.  You know, there have been a few times in my life when I thought ""it would be nice to have an app that did X.""  Most of those times I searched and found an app or website that did pretty much exactly what I wanted.  I didn't have to spend dozens or hundreds of hours writing my own program (after spending hundreds of hours learning to code).  ""But learning to code teaches kids critical thinking skills, so all kids should do it, even if they will never use it!""  Oh, you mean just like solving math problems, and analyzing literature, and debating in history class, and doing science projects, and all the other activities students do every day in all their classes?  

You know, for every time I've ever had a need to know how to code, there were a dozen times I've needed to take my car to a mechanic.  I guess every kids should spend a thousand hours becoming a certified mechanic.  It would definitely teach me useful skills, and problem solving, and critical thinking, and would be more useful than coding!  

EDIT 2: Oh good grief, their ""social studies"" project... Yep, talking to random old people about what they like about their city and then painting a mural of it sure gives students a solid grasp of American history and government!  They will definitely be prepared to understand current events and complex political issues. 
 Great project!

EDIT 3: Final message of XQ, high school should essentially be an internship for your future career. Only knowledge and skills related to that career matter.  Got it!  "

6z39ra,12,2017-09-09,"World Campus IST, a graduate's experience",WorldCampusThrowAway,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/6z39ra/world_campus_ist_a_graduates_experience/,"I'm a graduate of the WC IST program. World Campus IST was my fourth undergraduate program in the two decades since I graduated from high school. I am a working professional and have been since 2004.

1) Almost everything I'm about to say is negative, but the one positive might be the most important thing to anyone looking into the program. That positive is that I found an internship in my desired field through the IST department and from that internship I received a full-time job offer.

2) The other positive is that a lot of the curriculum material seems really good/useful/applicable. It's too bad that many of the students seem to ignore it entirely and/or do not have the prerequisite knowledge to process and understand that material.

3) This program had the lowest standards of any academic institution I have ever attended. I have never attended a for-profit university and have heard some pretty hilariously ignorant stuff is accepted at those places. I have seen some very similar occurrences at PSU WC IST. For example, on one of my group projects a teammate of mine had very very limited English language skills (native Spanish speaker). I proofread and rewrote almost all of his work throughout the semester and notified the Professor of the problems I was having (I was told by the professor not to worry about it too much). At the end of that semester, I was overwhelmed and did not have time to proofread or rewrite his 7 page portion of the final assignment. We turned it in and received a grade of 100 within 12 hours (all 9 of the 20+ page final papers were graded within 12 hours). I looked back at his portion later and found sentences consisting entirely of prepositional phrases, no use of transitions, incoherent sentences with no subject...This was a 300 level course.

4) Group projects in this program are treated by many of the professors as a way to shift the onus of individual accountability to the students and mass-grade to lighten their workload. Most professors do the bare-minimum to intervene when problems between teammates arise and make no effort at attribution. 

5) I caught multiple teammates plagiarizing code or writing, reported it each time, and never had a teammate removed from my team or receive a different grade than the team (to my knowledge), much less be removed from the course. I had more teams where a student had to be removed for failing to participate than I had teams where all members participated equally. 

6) In many classes, the material does a very poor job of giving students a sense of the depth of knowledge that exists in the field. Almost all of the classes have a very shallow focus on one area of the Information Sciences and Technology domain. Many of these classes also fail to impart an understanding of how complex that area of the domain is. There is almost no discussion of advanced algorithms or the math required to do something like...load balancing in the cloud or create useful Artificial Intelligence. 

7) The program short changes anyone hoping to move on to a quantitative Masters program. Almost all quantitative Masters programs require Calc 1,2,3 and Linear Algebra. Only Calc 1 and a very light survey of discrete math are offered through World Campus.

Most of what I experienced in the program indicated to me that, with the exception of a few professors who were legitimately interested in educating their students, World Campus IST is a degree farm. I would never hire someone who's only qualifying experience is a degree from this program. I would start looking for a new job almost immediately if I learned that a WC IST alum had been hired to manage a project I was working on. The program does very little to advance a student's knowledge to a professional level in any field. It does even less to ensure that any standard level of educational quality is being enforced across its program.

I did have classmates who were competent and even impressively knowledgeable, but it was absolutely the exception and not the rule in my experience. I am sure there are plenty of WC IST alumni who are valuable, knowledgeable, skilled IT professionals. I would just never be comfortable assuming that based on their degree alone. I would probably assume the opposite until they prove otherwise."

I took a break during the summer for my internship.

The pay of the job is about $14 an hour. It is about 6 hours on Saturday and 5 on Sunday. I am the only person at the community center and I basically help people who come in to pick up food at the emergency food pantry, and I also clean up the center when I leave. Half of the time I really just sit there and I can do my homework, but I am really starting to hate the job and the place in general.

I try to keep everything clean, but every month, my boss says some part of the center isn't clean. There's this birthday party today and I was asked to stay from 11am to 9:30pm. Fine, I get money so that's great.

I swept and mopped the center 3 times before they came, and they the lady still complained. I also need to walk 25 minutes on Saturdays to get to work, and a total of one hour on Sundays.

The only positive thing is the $, but tbh I really only get $3500 after working for 7-8 months. Yes, that's a lot...but maybe I should quit the job so I can focus on school more? I can probably get that money in three weeks at an internship.

Well I guess also it helps my resume, but I've been working here since 2016..so I think it's okay if I quit now, but I don't know. 

Any thoughts?

Money is a necessity....but I'm graduating in less than 2 years, and I'm sure my internship next year will earn me buckets.

Also since I have less than two years left in college, I think these days can be better spent on maybe my social life?

Also...college is being paid for me by my financial aid package...."

First time posting here,

I currently rent an apartment in Orange County, CA. It's an older building, and has constant plumbing issues; the rental agency that oversees the property has just completed a walk-through of each apartment (quadplex) to test for lead/asbestos before starting construction.

I'm curious if I have the right to get a copy of the tests, and because of asbestos risk for going airborne, I want to be able to witness if construction within my apartment is done without exposing me to unnecessary harm.

The re-piping will take approximately one week to complete, being that I am working full-time, and juggling an internship, I can't afford to move out, nor do I want to.

What legal rights do I have in this situation, and how should I proceed?

I was going to email the agency and request the results of the test, request that construction only happen at my apartment while someone is present, and that construction adhere to the times given.

Thanks for your time everyone!"

I came across a program called the [Working Holiday Agreement](https://www.dfa.ie/irish-embassy/usa/our-services/visas/working-holiday-authorisation/) that would apparently let me come to Ireland for a year (although I probably wouldn't stay that entire time) and work any kind of job during that time. Between that and the fact that I only speak English, I think I've set my sights on Ireland as my goal for getting a job. However, I still do have a bunch of questions:  
  
1. Are there any caveats to the Working Holiday Agreement that I'm missing? As far as I can tell, there aren't any kind of restrictions on employment, so my employer wouldn't have to jump through any kind of immigration-related hoops to hire me. Does that seem accurate?  
  
2. Is it realistic to expect an Irish company to take on an American intern, especially since I cannot stay any longer than a year? (And therefore cannot take on full-time employment after graduation?) Would it be best to target American companies with divisions in IE?  
  
3. Is it difficult to get a paid internship over here? I've noticed that Irish laws aren't quite as harsh on them and they seem to be much much more common than in the US.  
  
4. When is the main recruiting season? We're just getting started now in America, is it similar over here?  
  
5. Where do you find internship postings? My go-tos are Indeed and my college's career services, but Indeed.ie seems to be pretty barren and my college obviously isn't of much help.

What make it also a bit complicated is that in my synthesis, sometimes it is the name of the brand, sometimes it is the subrand (so two columns)

I've been working pretty much full time since I graduated college in May of '15 - Internship a week after graduation turned into a job right away, and outside of 2 months of unemployment after being laid off, I have been full time, 40 hours a week, since that internship started.

But I've never taken a real vacation. I've always been told I need to earn my place before taking vacation time, so the most PTO I'll let myself use is a Friday once every couple of months, which is usually used for travel. I've ONCE taken a Friday *and* a Monday off, and that was for a music festival - traveled Thurs night and flew home Monday am. 

But I'm burnt out as shit at work right now, and really mentally not in a place where I feel I can be productive. and as I work from home, I've been getting more and more distracted recently. I've taken 5/10 days of PTO since I was hired Nov 1 of last year, and outside of that, haven't had any time off/sick days/etc other than national holidays.

Why do I feel so guilty about taking 3 or 4 days off at once? There's nothing wrong with taking a few days for myself, and not having a specific vacation planned, right? Every day last week in the shower I was telling myself ""i should just email in sick today, take the day off. I'm too tired/not mentally good for work"" and I never do...

edit: i'm too young to be this burnt out over work. fuck.

edit edit: thanks all, seriously helpful comments and making me feel somewhat better about taking PTO. baby steps... insomnia kept me from getting any sleep last night so i'm taking a sick day. but even so, i feel like I need to say ""i'll be working on and off but won't be available by skype"" ... pressure from how i see coworkers taking sick days. 

with my mom visiting next week, probably going to take thursday and friday, or friday and monday off. extra long weekend away from anything work related. but i still have a hard time telling myself it's ok to take thursdays off when i have 3 client calls that day, and it's not my place to reschedule client calls..."

This morning I was reading about home remedies for the wax removal, and olive oil was suggested as a compound to soften the earwax and make it easier for removal. I tried it. I let it soak for fifteen minutes and then rinsed in the shower, to no avail.

*Enter bright idea*

My cousin's gf left some orange essential oil at my house. Now, let me explain: until now, I thought essential oils were just olive or hemp oil infused with whatever the label says. I didn't realize it was literally 100% oil from orange peel.

I dropped about four drops into my already aching ear, and because I had irritated the canal with various objects already trying to remove the blockage, it was quite site to begin with, not to mention the infection (yes mom, no q-tips... Ok maybe a few).

My ear felt like someone hammer fisted a pencil through my eardrum. I spent ten minutes trying to rinse it out, but as I'm sure you already know, oil doesn't clean well with water. Also, I assure you that soap and shampoo don't help much in this situation either. After twenty minutes of the most pure agony I've ever felt in my life (x10) I decided it was time for a hospital visit.

I was rushed in to emergency for fear that I had damaged my hearing. With a syringe, the doctor blasted my ear canal and removed the inch long tube of yuck, which revealed a swollen red eardrum, which thankfully had not been punctured.

The worst pain in my entire life also hit me in the dignity department as my smoking hot doctor intern couldn't keep the smirk off her face.

TL:DR: I thought essential oils were just olive oil infused with whatever scent they were, and put it in my ear to remove a wax build-up. A hospital visit and a few chuckles from the doctor ensued."

I'm a 23 year old female with a bachelor's in psych and am about to start my second year of my online environmental management master's program. I still live at home and work at a hotel part time to pay the bills/slowly build a savings. My bf of 3 years recently finished his bachelors in psychology as well (pro tip: don't ever choose psych) and is trying to figure out his next move as well. His uncle is a programmer and has offered to help him learn some coding so he can eventually help him on some of his side projects and get some experience. 

We talk about our future constantly and both of us want to be successful and make a good life for ourselves, but I feel completely stuck. I'm tried of working a shitty customer service job, making a little less than $10 per hr and getting yelled at constantly for things that are not my fault. I have tried to look for some sort of environmental related internship or entry level job I can get while still doing my master's but there is literally NOTHING in my area, and I definitely don't have the funds right now to move, even if I was able to find a job in a different state. 

My outlook on my career/future has gotten so bad that I'm not even sure it's worth it for me to continue my schooling and push myself further into debt. I know I'll have to finish out this semester since I won't get anything back if I quit now, but I can't stand feeling like this. 

I have never really had many hobbies or interests or anything that comes ""naturally"" to me. When I'm not working or doing schoolwork and the weather is nice, I like to hike, bike, kayak or do other outdoorsy things. If I can't be outdoors I usually just spend my free time reading, trying to crochet, and cooking/baking. 
None of these things are something I can make into a career. 

My bf and I both suffer from anxiety, he has depression and I have chronic migraines which we treat with medical cannabis. Both of us would love to move to a legal state and possibly become involved with the cannabis industry since it is something we're both very passionate about, but I don't think my family would approve of that career choice. Doing this would also involve us moving several states away or across the country, which neither of us is sure we're ready for. 

Has anyone else found themselves in a situation like this? Have you ever just picked up and moved across country? I dream about doing it all the time but I don't have the guts or motivation to make it happen. 

Any advice or insight would be much appreciated. "

I graduated in May from a very large state school with a decent business school. My major is finance and my minor is real estate and I have had one internship with a financial planning firm. My passion is commercial real estate and I hope to lock in an analyst position at some point. I had sine interviews over summer but no luck. Anyway, I join zip recruiter and 1 click apply to a ton of jobs. I had a person call me back and ended up interviewing once; basically, was shortly offered the position and immediately accepted. The job is real estate oriented, it is trying to sell this guy’s pre-developed land and do administrative work.
The job is basically in a very rural area in this guy’s boat house and it has about 5 office rooms in it. I work with 2 50-year-olds and then there is the boss. Both my co-workers have significantly less education than me. I think as this is the countryside area and I imagine finding talent is hard.  Let me just address him as Bob. So anyway, I show up the first day in a suit. Bob takes me into a room that is now my office and it smells like dog piss which I have gotten used to by now. By the way, he had several animals that roam the offices (cats, dogs) which are annoying as hell. Also, I never got an introduction to my coworkers or shown around the office so I just took the liberty of doing such myself. 
Bob has me emailing these developers all day trying to sell his commercially zoned land. He also had me build a cost analysis excel model which he never even looked at. Since my first hour of working, he gave me very little direction and told me to research such developers and email them all. I did and it is incredibly boring, let me tell you. While I am doing this, I hear him start screaming at one of the coworkers about this and that. 15 minutes later I hear more screaming, at the other coworker. All day is just him constantly yelling and micromanaging us. It makes me nervous to be in such a work environment.  Bob is a retired lawyer described as a workaholic by my co-workers. Bob is certainly a very poor leader. Every time he talks he acts as if he is furiously rushing and on a deadline, I am not sure if that is his way of trying to motivate us. It has been a week now and my coworkers say I have yet to see the worst of him. At one point, he cussed my coworker out and now I am uncomfortable approaching him. I asked him a question about a zoning law and his response was him yelling at me.  The good thing is he gives me the grunt work and assigned all the important stuff to the other two that I don’t get yelled at too much. The worst part about this is I get off very late. I work from 9-7:30 or 8 pm. Which I guess is my fault for not asking about the hours before I was hired. Also, nobody leaves the building (like to eat lunch) and we must eat while working. It seems as if my coworkers do everything they can to avoid one of bobs outbursts. No one in the office even has just a friendly conversation, just silence. I heard Xmas break is only 3 days too. 
This is my first salaried job and I make 40k with a degree. It is not worth it for me but I don’t have any other Real estate experience. I also have student loans. I feel this job will be critical on my resume if I want to find an analyst job. Because of this, my plan is to stick it out, but it is very difficult for me to work in this toxic environment.  Like I said It has only been 1 week. Right now, I am applying for other jobs but I do feel trapped in this for the time being. My plan is to at least work for 3 months, pay as much student loans off as I can, remain on good terms with Bob so if people call for a reference he will have only good to say about me. Can you guys give me some advice, please! I still don’t know what to think. Thank you so much for reading this!

I have no experience. Got a job in my field 4 years later and am afraid I'll flounder and/or fail. I could just die over the dread and anxiety

Background: I'm a certified pharmacy technician. I got my associate's degree in pharmacy technology in 2013. I had two internships, one retail and one in hospital, but couldn't find a job after. My retail internship was mediocre at best. No one made much of an effort to teach me, even when I tried to learn and there wasn't another pharmacy I could really go to. 

So, here I am, 4 years later with my first tech job. I don't remember a whole lot and am living in constant fear that I took a job that I can't do. I made the pharmacist that hired me aware of the fact that I have NEVER worked as a tech and that my retail internship didn't do anything for me. He still hired me, as they desperately need techs.

I've been doing computer based training for the past 3 days (in relation to the store's general info for retail and related to pharmacy), but it's so much I don't remember!
I feel incapable and a part of me wants to resign and give up this amazing full time opportunity. I've been constantly trying to reassure myself that I can do it and that my boss is aware of what I lack, but I don't want to make a fool of myself. I don't want to be asked a crucial question and sit there dumb because I don't know an answer I should. I've been literally sick with anxiety and dread (don't want to eat, panic attacks, diarrhea).

I know most of you will say quit before I damage the company. But either way, I'm trying not to sell myself short while also bracing for my failure. If you haven't noticed, I have a major inferiority complex. I recently gave up going back to school because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to learn fast enough. 

I'm rambling now and most of this is me voicing fears. Anyway,  how do you deal with feeling inadequate? Do you have a similar situation or story?

Ps - part of the bad feelings is I travel almost 3 hours on public transportation there and back because I never learned to drive. Also my boss is slow on getting an essential part of my uniform,  so I'm questioned by other associates when I go to the back room. ALSO he wants me to do some training in another far town, but hasn't given me details...I go on Tuesday and apparently need my uniform for that too. I'm too stressed at just 4 days in and I haven't even started the part I'm worried about!"

I really want to aim for Google or quant trading (or dev) internships (specifically Tower, DE Shaw, JSC) for my next internship after my sophomore year ends. Now after work I typically come home and go to the gym and I have around 3-4 hours that I feel I could make more use of. I'm doing questions out of leetcode, firecode.io and interviewbit for the CS side and I want to get better at those questions and I'm also thinking of doing arithmetic brain teasers (i.e. many math questions quickly in a row, finding sequences) and some Bayesian probability. I'm still a bit confused on what I should be doing now to make the next 8 months as productive as possible so that when I go back to school, I'm already ready and prepped for internship interviews. 

It did make me quite sad to be delayed a year (and be separated from my first year friends) but I really didn't have much choice given the situation. I think there could be a silver lining to this situation where I'm working in SF making decent money, going to the gym and taking care of myself and also using this extra time to get ahead of the competition and get those internships that I've always wanted.

For people that have interned at Big N or quant firms as traders (or devs) I would love to hear about your interview prep plans. I'm not sure if I should focus on improving my C++ (I guess thats more on the execution side) or if I should take a course on machine learning (I've already taken the Coursera one before), but I wanna hear your opinion on if that's a good avenue to pursue.

I did a brain teaser for Akuna and IMC before but screwed it up - don't wanna do that the second time around. Also did 2 rounds of Uber before bombing that too.

A plan, websites, courses or anything really that might help me land and/or prep for interviews is appreciated. Thanks"

What am I doing wrong?,1isbetter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6zet62/cant_secure_an_internship_what_am_i_doing_wrong/,"Hi reddit, hopefully you'll accept my post and give me some advice too. I'm one of those many young people trying to get their foot into the industry, but can't find the door.

I'm an european student studying in the U.K on a software engineering degree. I've finished my 1st year and had to take a gap year to gather some money for my next year of university.

I planned on getting a 1-year internship or a junior level job for 1 year in either software development or web development, but it seems like neither will become a reality.

I've studied C++ in high-school, but only at an academic level solving mostly math-like problems. At university, we took Java from scratch and introduction into the web stack.

I've got around 1 year and so of experience in web development, rating out of 5: HTML 4/5, CSS 4/5, PHP 3/5, SQL/MySQL 2/5, JavaScript 2/5. That being said, its not that I'm not confident on doing great work in either of these, I'm just being realistic about how much control and knowledge I consider that I have over them, all in all, I wouldn't encounter problems taking on big projects or doing stuff I never done cause I like to research and try and I always find a solution eventually. I'm also solid on agile principles and I've worked within university on group projects in a Scrum approach.

I've developed a few websites through freelancing in collaboration with a local media agency, I've got my own web portfolio where some of the sites I developed are available, got a database management desktop app in Java which is also in github, got a Linkedin profile, tried to network around and comment on posts ( got people liking what I commented a few times ). And I've applied to more than 200 positions as either junior web developer, junior java developer, internship in web dev, internship in software dev in U.S/ U.K / Germany / France / Romania, out of those I got around 20 calls, out of those around 5 interviews and that's pretty much it. A lot of them seemed to really like me on the phone and that they 're looking forward to it, but haven't heard from them back. Most would call me or email me and then never get back at me. To some - where I considered to be appropriate - I pinged them ( emailed them asking about news ofc in a good manner ) and yeah, nothing. Out of 5 interviews, 3 of them found the right man for the job and 2 of em, I don't know.

I love OOP, especially Java. I started learning Python as well. And I do like PHP, especially version 7. I'm not a huge fan of frontend development, but I've got days when I craft god damn beautiful things.

However, I'm not a big fan of competitive programming, algorithmic questions and memorizing all sorts of stack/ queue / trees problems solutions nor am I a big fan of these types of interviews. 

I like crafting, creating, researching. I love it. I love programming, just not in the same way that others see it. If I need to solve a problem and I don't know x or y algorithm or design pattern, don't think I'll solve it in a miserable way without checking out the internet and researching what's already been done or what's out there.

Would you be so kind to tell me what on earth am I doing wrong?

6zgt21,0,2017-09-11,Just finished undergraduate business degree and thinking about CS. Should I get another bachelors or am I able to get a masters?,Genesis635,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6zgt21/just_finished_undergraduate_business_degree_and/,"Hey all, I just graduated from an undergraduate entrepreneurship/business school in Boston this past May. I started an entry level sales job but I'm not loving it too much and all my job prospects so far have been in the same field, and it's not what I want to do (took for experience). I want to work in tech consulting/finance and with startups (plan to start my own one day). I think taking a CS degree can help me learn more to relate to these fields. I've loved tech since I was a kid - I've consulted many tech and VR startups during my internships, built my own PC, and I want to learn how to code and gain more technical skills but never got the chance because I went to a specialized business school.

I'm thinking about going back to school and getting another degree in CS, whether it be another bachelors or a masters but I'm not sure what would suit my needs/I'm not sure if I fulfill the requirements for a masters. I had a mediocre GPA in college, but my test scores for college entrance were quite high, if that is still a factor here. I've learned R and Excel during my Quantitative Math classes and have taken 3 levels of those classes (learned Minitab, R, StatTools, Tableau). I'm not sure if these courses would be enough to qualify towards a masters.

In terms of a bachelors, I would probably go to my local state college in NJ (Rutgers) or look around for another state school instead of a small localized school again. If I go the bachelors route, I'm assuming that I don't have to complete 4 years again, since I have liberal arts/math requirements from my previous degree and it would only be 2 years? 

I'm not quite sure how this works, any guidance would be appreciated!"

6zhbk0,5,2017-09-11,Looking for some advice on finding another IT job,throwaway091117,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/6zhbk0/looking_for_some_advice_on_finding_another_it_job/,"Hey everyone,

Using a throwaway account since my boss knows I use Reddit and could probably find my post pretty easily if I didn't.

So right now, I'm working at a very small company in Florida.  I'm talking less than 25 employees.  Aside from my boss (the owner of the company), I'm basically *the* IT guy/sysadmin.  Everybody comes to me for help since he's always busy doing typical ""running the company"" stuff.

As much as I love what I'm doing, what I specifically DON'T love is the location.  All of my family is in Michigan as well as all my college friends.  I'm fairly anti-social so I haven't really met anybody new in the 2 years I've been full-time in Florida.  Of course I use Facebook and other stuff to stay in touch with people, but it's just not the same... I go to movies alone, and don't really have anyone to hang out with.

The idea was that I would work in Florida for a couple years, which my parents and grandparents thought was a sufficient amount of time to work for a company before leaving and not looking like a jerk, and then try to move back home.

Over the past 9 months I've applied to well over 100 jobs, and hardly heard back from any.  I have a couple leads, but if these don't pan out I'm stuck.

The reasons I think this is:

1. Most of the IT jobs I've seen, specifically for sysadmins or network operators, are either looking for somebody to start *right away* or ""some time in the future"".  I can basically start ""right away, but after giving my 2-week notice and adding another week to move home"", which I think is a major deterrent for the first type of company.  If they had their previous sysadmin quit and are in dire need of a new one, they won't want to wait 3 weeks even if I'm a perfect fit.

2. My responsibilities and overall job description are all over the board and very general.  I have no problem with this myself, and it's kinda neat, but most IT jobs I've seen are in a specific area.  For example - I've applied to a lot of helpdesk positions.  I do a lot with networking at my current job, but most networking positions I've seen are for more senior level that want a lot more experience than I have.

3. Salary.  As much as my parents think I'm being underpaid, I think I'm actually making a decent amount for what I actually do.  And a lot of similar jobs pay like half of what I'm making.  I'm not even bothering with those as I just know it will be way out of their price range.  I applied to some entry-level stuff and got rejected in just a few days without even being offered an interview - as the application made me select a salary range.

(Just to clarify I'm not making $100k or anything crazy.  It's actually a pretty modest salary, but just not one most helpdesk positions would pay unless you're higher level)

So as far as #2 is concerned, let me explain a little more.
I worked for this company when I was still in college going towards my bachelor's degree.  I worked on a data migration project for them, which was completed during my internship.  After I graduated, they made me a full-time offer - and since my grades in college were pretty bad (talking lower than a 3.0 GPA), I took it.  Since having a job was better than not having a job, obviously!

After starting full-time, I was tasked with entirely different things since that project was done.  I started working more in customer service and less in IT projects for inside the company.  I did do a fairly massive project a year or so ago where I built two redundant SAN servers and configured them with fail-over abilities, then virtualized our servers and moved them to the SAN.  We then bought some matching hypervisors to run them on, set THOSE up for failover, and so on.  And then sold off the old servers.  But once that project was done - it was back to support.  So I have experience in a wide variety of areas (SQL databases from the first project, virtualization and SANs from the second project, ongoing customer service, as well as networking since I moved from simply troubleshooting existing networks to making new ones for customers)

But most jobs I see want X years of experience in one particular area.  You see where this becomes a problem?

I can elaborate more later, but I'm trying to avoid making this post any more tl;dr than it already is.

Basically, I desperately want to move back to MIchigan, but can't afford to just quit my job without having a replacement lined up, and I'd hate to take some super low-paying job just to have *a* job, as it'll look bad on my resume as a huge step down.

Are recruiters a viable option here? I've worked with a couple recruiters *for* specific positions, but I've heard there are types where you can hire a recruiter to advertise YOU to companies, and not the other way around.  I could explain my situation, my skills and talents etc, and see what they come up with.

Any other advice?  Thanks in advance."

I don't have any side projects, nor do I have any really relevant internships to what I want to do. I want to get a career in game dev or simulation, and I'm starting to learn the basics. However, every time I sit down to do it, I can't help but think of all the people that started doing this when they were 12, and how far ""behind"" I am relative to them. It's quite disheartening to look up a Youtube tutorial, only to hear that the kid giving it hasn't gone through puberty yet.

Now, people on this sub may discourage me from game dev, and maybe I discover myself that game dev is really as bad as people say, but then I'm back at square one. I have to learn something completely different, like web dev, which is a whole different skillset. Then, if I were to learn that, I would be even older, and again I'd think of all the people that started this when they were 12.

To me, it almost feels like you should've known what you wanted while you were starting high school, and stuck with it. Otherwise, you're infinitely behind the people that didn't, as your portfolio isn't nearly as extensive.

I know that in practice though, this field is constantly changing, and you always need to learn new things. What comes with that is that I'm frequently going to be ""behind"" other people. My main question is: **How do you deal with this?** Unfortunately, right now, it seems like one of these will eventually happen:

* a) I'll get depressed and never bother to learn/do what I want to. 
* b) I'll feel like I need to ""catch up"" and inevitably burn out as I feel guilty any time I'm not working.
* c) I'll do what I need to, but always have an inferiority complex regardless because other people my age will have years of experience on me.

I think I'm going to to take a year off from school to learn what I want, and build relevant projects, but I don't just want to fall into a pit of depression during that time. 

**All that being said, I'm fully aware that there are people that are way older than I am, that go through career changes, etc. that must have dealt with the same feelings that I did. I do not mean for this post to be depressing to you guys.** Ultimately, I know these feelings are irrational and that I'm still young, but I'm still curious about the best ways to go about coping with them."

While I understand many of the concepts of what's going on in the average day, I feel pretty lost when working with all this new software and getting so much new information thrown at me. Is this normal, and what tips would you give to someone in my position?"

6zjfzy,89,2017-09-11,My Mother tried to poison my kids... (Part 1),sunstar821,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6zjfzy/my_mother_tried_to_poison_my_kids_part_1/,"The problems between me and my mother go WAY back to even when I was 15, 20 years ago. To put it short, she's a narcissist. Narcissists want their kids to be codependent on them, depending on how narcissistic they are they will do some crazy shit in order to maintain this codependency.

A way to do this is to make the child seem younger then they actually are, say they are 19 and wish to go looking for a job, the narcissistic mother would insult and discourage this search for independence and encourage them to be lazy so that they continue being dependent on their Mothers, in some extreme cases a narcissistic parent can get sexually aroused when they fuck their kids lives up in this way.

I always thought my mother was a malignant narcissist, she never exhibited signs of being a full on narcissist but definitely showed some signs, she was also extremely paranoid of things that showed no real danger (For example, she would close all windows in the house out of fear that a burly man would bust through and kill us all).

Why is this all important? 

Well, let me start from the beginning.

I moved out when I was 20, after a long codependent relationship with my Mother, anytime I ever tried to show an ounce of independence she would always make me feel like shit for it and sometimes breakdown like a complete psycho. 

If I got into a relationship? She would throw objects in my room around and scream in my face. If I got a job? She would make it impossible for me to attend work. She was fucking miserable to be around and she almost drove me to suicide..

When I was 20 a good friend of mine recommended me to his boss to become an intern at H&amp;R Block at my request, he then offered to let me stay in his apartment as long as I wasn't a slob, I happily accepted and moved out THAT night. I wouldn't come in contact with my Mother for another 15 years.

And that's where we get into what has happened this last month. I have 2 kids, Alex and Austin, Alex is 13 and Austin is 8, I also have a lovely wife named Adrina. I live not far from my mother in a high rise near Central Park in NYC. I recently got Facebook to connect with other family members who I grew up with, as I've heard Facebook is a great tool for that sort of thing. 

The first person I added was my older brother who is 50 years old, I hadn't spoken to him in about a decade, he surprisingly added me back within 5 minutes. We talked for a while and caught up a bit before I decided it was time to head to bed. However when I was about to close my laptop I noticed in the mutual friends tab a familiar name, it was my Mom. 

I contemplated ignoring it and never going back, however something just came over me, maybe she's changed in the last 15 years, I added her, and just like my Brother she accepted it within 5 minutes.

We started conversing, she seemed really fake, as in pretending to be nice so that she puts out an image of a sweet old lady. Nothing notable really happened during this conversation however there some things I found strange.

1. She kept referring to my job and living situation as ""cute"" 
2. She kept referring to me as a 25 year old kid, even though I'm 35, she didn't stop this even after corrected.
3. She kept referring to Alex as way younger then he really was and pretended Austin didn't exist, she also didn't stop doing this even after corrected.
4. She flat out insulted my wife.

Okay, she was the same ol' bitch she was a decade and a half ago, however she offered to let my kids (Well, KID, she didn't talk about Austin but if Alex was going Austin was too) stay at her house for a few days so they could get to know their Grandmother. 

Now if they were older i'd say no, however my kids are extremely young, what was she going to do? Make them feel younger then they really are by encouraging them to be lazy? I didn't really see an issue in letting them stay with their Grandmother and neither did Adrina.

So fast forward a week later and it's time to drop them off at my Mothers house. She still lived in the same house that I grew up in, it wasn't trippy or cool to see the house though, as it's a few blocks from mine and I see it on my way to work usually every day, I just don't interact with it.

I drove my kids to her house and knocked on her door, and when she answered there were a few things off..

1. She looked way older then she really was, she just turned 70, yet she looked like she was in her late 90's, she also had a raspy voice that was slightly deeper then what I was familiar with.

2. Her house smelled like meat

3. She didn't seem surprised to see me at all, and seemed almost angered by my kids. 

I felt a bad feeling in my gut and reminded Alex quietly while Austin and his Grandmother were getting acquainted that if ANYTHING bad happened at the hands of my Mother, to text me IMMEDIATELY.

Fast forward a few days, I pick up the kids and drive them home, they surprisingly really liked their short stay. They were home-schooled so they had a lot of freedom when it came to staying over at friends/families houses, this is important because shortly after the first visit they wished to visit her again.

However this is where things get weird...

Alex complained every time that Grandma got him a Pepsi, it'd be already open and warm, and usually tasted of almonds, in fact, he said every drink tasted like almonds. This was strange indeed, but I really thought nothing of it. 

Cut to the next week, they had revisited their Grandmother again and I was picking them up, on the ride home both Austin AND Alex made remarks about how they feel deathly sick, this made me very uncomfortable and as Alex and Austin both vomited into the same toilet all night while my wife comforted them, I researched what the fuck was going on.

I found a few things.

1. A subtle almond taste in a drink that doesn't contain almonds could be a warning sign that the drink has been poisoned.

2. The chemical Cyanide smells and tastes EXACTLY like almonds.

3. Really small amounts of cyanide can take a while to kill somebody, so it's not an immediate threat. 

I couldn't be completely sure if this was what was going on so I planned a get together with just me and my Mother, under the pretense that we would watch a movie or something and maybe drink some coffee.

I pulled up to her house the next day I immediately knocked on her door. As soon as she answered she told me to wait in the living room while she prepared Coffee, she warned me not to go into the kitchen until she was back. 

I waited a few minutes then swiftly made my way to the kitchen where I hid behind the door and observed, when I then saw it...


She was in the process of measuring a clear liquid she poured out of a vile before she poured it in my coffee. I then walked up behind her..

""Mom, what the fuck?""

She dropped the glass vile and it shattered everywhere, the smell of almonds was almost overwhelming, she started crying immediately and put her arms around my neck.

""That whore you married can give you as many demon spawn as you wish whats so special about these ones?!""



****UPDATE*****


Firstly i'd like to apologize for my stupidity in letting my children stay at a mentally unstable womans house. I have thought it over and now fully understand how serious it was, but please understand something..

This is my Mother we are talking about, the woman who I believed was my HERO until I was probably about 12. The problems that came up between us didn't happen until I was about 15 or 16 years old and starting striving for independence. This is important because I had OVER 14 years of great memories with my Mother, and while yes she drove me to be suicidal in my early adult years, I just assumed she was losing her mind and decided to do what was best for my health and move away. 

I NEVER thought she would be capable of anything like this. But that's the thing about narcissists, sometimes their psychotic tendencies know no bounds. 

Anyway some wondered about what happened after this incident, well just to clarify I wanted to put this update I left on part 1 here, for people that didn't read it. 

""I'll post part 2 tonight or tommorow but i'm currently busy with hospital visits. I wrote this whilst Alex and Austin were being driven by my wife to the hospital (they were sleeping in the car and it was really late) for an emergency checkup (This final incident was a few days ago). The reason we waited so late for another checkup was because this hospital was booked all day so we decided to go REALLY late at night when they were calm.

They are OKAY, we caught this early enough to where they could give them hydroxocobalamin to counter act the slow acting Cyanide after they went through toxicological testing. It was confirmed they had trace amounts in their systems.

Something happened that i'll write about later that lead to my Mother being committed to a psyche ward, it wasn't JUST the poisoning, it was something that will take me years to recover from.. Writing about it makes me feel better and i'll probably look into getting therapy soon..""

Now to continue from where I left off last time...

My mother was cornering me in her kitchen, with every step forward she made torwards me I stepped back a step. She was spewing nonsense about my wife and kids, I wasn't listening to what she said but more so worrying about what the fuck I was going to do. Honestly this was kind of a blur, imagine worrying about if your Mother was going to kill you or herself. 

Eventually she backed up a bit and I made a RUN for it, however I didn't want to leave her house, I was pretty adamant about getting her committed THAT night and if I left she'd possibly kill herself or hurt other people. So as I was running for it I made my way into the basement and locked the door behind me. A sudden smell of raw meat was evident, no scratch that, it was OVERWHELMING.

The smell seemed to be coming from a dirty looking minifridge, I made my way over to it as I heard my NMOM banging on the basement door demanding I come out this instant, I wish I had.

Stray cats, at least 12 of them, were smashed into this tiny little fridge. Some looked more like puddles of mud with animal like features, however some still had skin on them, some looked fresh. I felt the overwhelming urge to vomit as my NMOM was in the process of banging on the door. That's when I saw it, on the bottom shelf of this disgusting fucking fridge, a collar wrapped around what again, looked like a puddle of mud with animal like features. The collar read Mustard...

Mustard was a cat that I loved, very dearly as a child, so much so I get emotional STILL to this day thinking about his cute tiny paws pressing against the window as I'd walk home from school, he had a warm smile that made me feel complete, I spent more time with him then my own Mother. When I was 13 years old my Mother announced that Mustard had ran away, and was never to be found again. I was so fucking upset, I had to have been depressed for at least a year. 

Thinking about what I saw I now know for sure, my Mother killed him because I was giving him more attention then her. 

I didn't just want her to die I wanted her to suffer.

Long story short, I called the police.

When the police showed up my Mother was acting psychotic, screaming, throwing shit from her windows that were now shattered glass. When an officer asked her to calm down through her window hole she assaulted him with an IPA bottle, she was then involuntarily committed, and seeking further evaluation. She will be held for 74 hours for examination, and when that's over I will be pressing charges and calling for an investigation for the attempted murder of 2 children. 









It isn't easy for me either, while she gave me shit as an early adult, I will always remember her as the cheery naive woman who watched Disney movies with me as a kid.

I started an entry level sales job but I'm not liking the role, and all my recruiting/job prospects so far have been in a similar field. I feel like a mindless drone and frustrated going into work everyday. I took it for experience on my resume since employment for my class/school wasn't good this year.

My dream is to work in VC/Finance or with Startups (with a plan to start my own one day). I've been thinking that taking a Computer Science or Statistics degree can help me learn more to relate to these fields. I can learn coding skills that are applicable to Finance and the startup world (Python, SQL, C++, etc). I've also loved tech since I was a kid, I've consulted many tech startups during my internships. I want to learn more technical skills but never got the chance because I went to a specialized business school.

So I'm thinking about quitting my job (it's a temp job and I'm working 50+ hours a week so no chance for part-time school right now) and going back to school and getting a second bachelors degree. The main problem here is I had a terrible GPA in college (around 2.4, average in my college was 2.6). However my test scores for college entrance were quite high (ACT 32), if that is still a factor here. I already have done the basic requirements during my previous degree: Math up to 3 levels, humanities &amp; sciences besides my business courses. I'm assuming that I don't have to complete 4 years again, since I have liberal arts/math requirements from my previous degree and it would only be 2 years?

So I'm just wondering if a second undergrad degree is worth it, or is it better to just go to Business school for masters? I'm not quite sure how this certain situation works, any guidance would be appreciated!"

6zl3fl,1,2017-09-12,Would someone mind helping me find some good safety/easy schools?,NJS421,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6zl3fl/would_someone_mind_helping_me_find_some_good/,"Hi guys,

I've been lurking on this sub for a while but I've decided to finally make a post in order to get some help, specifically with finding schools to apply to. While figuring out my reach and likely schools were fairly easy, finding safety schools that would be a good fit for me has been difficult because it's been hard to determine which schools are objectively ""better"" than others, particularly in regards to specific programs. I've been looking a the opinions of people who have gone there on various forums, but for every positive opinion there's been an equally negative opinion and I'm starting to think that that method of research isn't really a good one to use. So, I decided to ask around here to see if anyone could help me out.

What I'm looking for are either smaller liberal arts colleges or bigger schools with solid pre-law or biology programs. The small liberal arts colleges have always appealed to me because they offer the same small school and classroom setting that I've come to love due to how much it's added to my high school experience. However, I'm also open to larger schools so long as they have opportunities for me to get more involved in the fields/subjects I've taken an interest in. As far as location goes, it would be nice to get out of California but that's not something that's of great importance to me.

Here's my basic info:
GPA: ~4.2 W, 3.9 UW (projected 4.3 W by the end of 1st semester)

Class rank: 33/119 (I was surprised, I expected to at least be a little higher but I guess I didn't take enough weighted courses)

ACT: 35 composite

APs: World History (4), Calc AB (5), Stats (5), Lang (4), Chem (3). I'm also taking more APs this year but I've heard that the scores don't matter, and that colleges only really care about me keeping my grades up.

Race: Not sure if it'll help but I'm mixed race (half white half asian).

ECs:
-Spent at least a month of each summer since freshman year working in a lab. First year was mainly basic training, second year was focused on doing a simple experiment (no really significant findings), third year focused on doing an all-summer project that contributed to the work of a grad student as well as learning and doing basic routine protocols to help out on a day-to-day basis. The third year was what really got me interested in science because I saw how much potential for discovery there was even in a simple project like mine.

-Spent sophomore year working with a group of 4 other students and a teacher to host a biotechnology workshop at the end of the year, which aimed to help teachers in inner-city high schools learn how to perform and teach various labs, sometimes even with low-budget demonstrations. I'm working with a friend to try and get funding for another workshop this year, which we will hopefully have more leadership over.

-Spent a month of sophomore year summer working in the legal department of a technology company. I reviewed contracts and did some other stuff that helped the company. I had a good relationship with my employer so I'm planning to ask him for a letter of recommendation.

-Member of school's mock trial team

-Member of school's biology olympiad team. Last year we didn't do very well but as leader of this year's team I hope that I can help everyone to be more prepared for the test.

-Did an internship with the developers of a video-sharing app. It didn't really fit into my interests but I thought it would be fun to try. It ended up forcing me to go outside my comfort zone and talk to people I normally wouldn't in order to market the app so I think it was a positive experience.

-Occasionally I like to write, usually when something's been bothering me and I want to get it off my chest. I don't submit to many contests but I think I won an honorable mention the one time I did.

So as you can see, my ECs are kinda weak, but hopefully they show colleges that I have made an effort to explore my interests. If you need any more information or if I was unclear about something please let me know and I'll get back to you. Thanks!

6zl726,218,2017-09-12,Tales of the intern and BBM,PhantomsGhost,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6zl726/tales_of_the_intern_and_bbm/,"LTL FTP 

Backstory: For the past two years up until May of 2017, I was the IT intern for a small local business in town where I was the eager high school student studying information technology. As the intern, I was often in charge of fixing anything that had electricity. The budget I was given was as with most companies, what ever is in the closet. Since quitting, I have started college and now work part time at a datacenter.


The tales told tonight will be two of my most memorable moments from this internship.


The characters in these tales will be:

$Me - Obviously not me.

$BBM - Blonde before me, the woman who ""handled"" tech before I started working there, Also my boss at the tim.

$Marketing - Marketing Lead, very cool guy and never caused problems.

$PR - Public relations woman who I often dealt with.



Tale of irony and idiocy:

So this tale is from September of 2016, we had just ordered the hardware and set up our new backup server, which of course $BBM choose most of the hardware and left the more ""technical""parts to me. This meant I chose the case and power supply. In the end, it was a lot of consumer grade hardware mashed into a server motherboard. One drive out of 8 was DOA and was never shipped back in time for the RMA window. Windows server with a bunch of shares and a domain (the domain was never used).

Move foward one month, malware infection on the POS, and so a data recovery was needed from an outside service as $BBM had never started backing up that server to the new backup server. Promptly there after, as a lowly  intern, I was immediately blamed by $BBM, who was then barked at by $Marketing for $BBM not doing her part in the backups. In total, about 50K was spent in time and money replacing and recovering the data, when there was a new server that cost about 2K that just needed a button pushed.


.

Tale of the 5 second solution and a dent in a desk:


This tale is quick and occurred 1 week before I quit and was part of the reason, about 10%.

Quick story of it is that it was a Saturday, I was oncall for emergency purposes and lived half an hour away. $PR calls in and states that she can't connect to the internet and has a Skype meeting in 40 minutes. So after being blessed with good traffic on a rainy day, I  arrive to $PR's office. The issue you might ask? She unplugged her wlan dongle to charge her phone . Head met my desk down the hall and then proceeded to enjoy a long drive home after the rain picked up.


Overall, the 4 months working at the datacenter have been much better and a greater experience than the two years of dealing with those with $BBM and $BBM herself.

Background: I am an intern put in charge of restricting the use of certain printers and print drivers (such as print to PDF) and mapping 2 printers that have been chosen as the acceptable printers for that group. The user account will then need to be locked down to where the user cannot delete or add other printers. The group is in their own OU and I believe that a combination of GPO and GPP is the right way to go.

The Issue: How do I get the GPP to delete all printers to precede the GPO to enforce no adding and deleting printers? If the GPO runs before the GPP won't the GPP delete the proper printers that need to be mapped?

The Desired Outcome:

1. Delete all Printers and Print Drivers (Mapped, Local, and Print to PDF like Services).
2. Map the Desired Two Printers.
3. Enable GPO to Disable the Addition and Deletion of Printers.

I've been looking into use of AWS, Horizon View, Citrix software and Hyper-V but honestly I don't know how to compare any of these services besides pricing. How can I really go about determining which would be best suited?

I'm feeling quite lost trying to find out where to go from here, is this normal?

Edit:
The problem I'm currently facing is that I've been given A LOT of freedom, maybe a bit too much for a new intern. This freedom includes things like what to virtualize, where to do it, choice of software and such. It's making it really hard for me to see where I should start. When I ask specifics about what they want their reply mostly is along the lines of ""We want you to research what's the best approach"". The only real guideline I have is that I know the software which needs to run on the deployed workstations. I suppose I'll go have a talk with my stakeholders to try and get me some more clarity.

Since the questions came from engineering students (or recent graduates), I thought you guys might also gain from the advice.

No clickbait here, I have cut-pasted the entire article below.  Feel free to contact me directly if you want the link to other articles or if you have a question and need some assistance.

**Are larger or smaller engineering firms better for internships?**

There are pros and cons to each.  In general, I have found that smaller firms will give you more opportunity to work on every step of a project as opposed to getting pigeon-holed into one area.  Also, they often have more of an entrepreneurial spirit and will allow you to look farther into added services.  That said, larger firms will have more opportunity to shift to another department if you think something else will be more in line with your career goals.  Also, they are more likely to be involved in large scale projects that a smaller firm just can’t support.

By the way, these same general principles apply when you are looking for a career after completing your engineering degree.  Personally, I credit the first firm where I worked with getting me set in my career.  I was able to work on every aspect of decent sized energy efficiency projects from the initial walk thru &amp; design phase all the way through the construction &amp; commissioning phases.

**Which is better for my career, an MS in Engineering or an MBA?**

This really depends on why you are getting the graduate degree.  If you want to move into the management side of things, then the MBA will be more pertinent.  However, if you want to stay more closely involved in the engineering side of things, then you should go for the MS degree in engineering.  

If you are having trouble deciding, look at the people who are currently in the position where you want to eventually be in your career.  What degrees and licenses to they have?  That should be your basic guide on which one will be the most useful as you move forward.  Finally, if you are really unsure, then work for a few years before going for either degree to allow you some time to evaluate which one is of greater value.

**I’m failing Calc III, how can I get back on track when I really hate the subject?**

Here are my three basic study tips that are particularly effective for math courses:

1. Regardless of whether you have homework or not, spend 20-30 minutes EVERY DAY working through problems.  Math, in particular, is a subject that is best attained through practice and repetition.
2. Take advantage of the professor’s office hours to get one on one explanations.  Bring the problems that you have worked through or some problems from the lecture and have him explain any details that you found confusing.
3. Create a study group.  Get a group of 3-4 of your classmates together on a regular basis to study for this class.  This will avail yourself of others to answer your questions.  Additionally, in areas where you help them, you will gain a better understanding when you have to break it down to explain it to someone else.  Also, this will give you some added motivation to work harder since nobody wants to come to a study session and be ill prepared.
Keep focused on the end goal of just getting through this.  Remember, you can choose an engineering career where math is limited.  All you need to do is pass these courses and then you don’t have to give it much thought going forward except for things like licensing exams.

I'm looking at 2x GTX 1080 Ti for use for at least a year, and hopefully after any internship I'll have enough to save up for a better rig, mainly for learning. I think one crucial skill I'm lacking is the experience in running multi-GPUs for training, which is a problem since I've no money to get 2 GPU. But as I believe in investing in learning, I'm making this build ready for at least 2 GPUs, which I think can give me a much faster feedback on my experiments too.

To confirm, is the GPU I have chosen a water cooled one? I have done some DL research in the past, and unfortunately the heat often throttles the performance heavily. Same for the CPU. Is the CPU cooler sufficient? My experiments might have to be run for weeks. I'm not too sure if it's possible to add an extra GPU afterwards, but I've heard that running 2 GPUs very closely without water cooling will severely throttle the performance and even cause damage. So I'm playing safe with a water cooled GPU. Is there room for 2 water-cooled ones?

Furthermore, is my build compatible? Is there a maximum number of GPUs my current build can fit? I want to have an Intel Xeon processor but unfortunately it costs too much. 

Also, is there a way to get the cost down? For the same price, some custom PC builders actually offer a very similar specs but with some cuts in the GPU (presumably using the FE GPU instead) and the RAM speed. 

Regarding the thermal paste, is this only used on the CPU, or are there extra areas to apply? Is this amount sufficient? 

I have not build a PC before at all but I'm eager to accelerate my learning through building such a machine. Thank you all for your help.

6zq0ue,8,2017-09-12,I think I'm in the wrong line of work,burdalane,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6zq0ue/i_think_im_in_the_wrong_line_of_work/,"After 10+ years as a server admin who also codes and works on user-facing software, I can handle Linux administration and Google things when I don't know the answer (which happens a lot), but I just have zero interest in maintaining computer systems. My greatest work fear is that I'll be asked to rack a server by myself, or take charge of hardware, or show somebody else how it's done. I can now do things like replace hard drives, which, fortunately, have become hot-swappable and no longer require opening up a computer, but I regularly get stuck when I call tech support and am asked to open the chassis to try removing or reseating a part. I can open a chassis and identify parts, but I can't figure out how to access small parts. Even arranging cables stinks. Ironically, higher management seems to think my strong suit is hardware, or at least swapping hard drives.

I also dislike other aspects of system administration, including backups and monitoring, installing and configuring software, and responding to user requests (creating accounts, out of disk space, need permissions changed). Honestly, it's all just kind of tedious. I use configuration management, and, while it makes things more manageable, it's still not something I want to spend time doing. 

I got into server administration because I happened to see the job posting for a sysadmin who also codes, or a programmer who also sysadmins. It was close by, and I had no other opportunities after failing numerous interviews for development jobs. My history consisted of a CS degree, a failed attempt at starting my own company, and an internship, but no IT or help desk experience. I wasn't even the type to build my own computers, and I'm still not.

At this point, when I apply for developer jobs, I either fail the interviews or get rejected because my programming experience is unimpressive or doesn't count. I'm not really interested in DevOps because of the ops part, but I did try interviewing for it once, and didn't have enough ops experience or experience with anything that scales. I haven't applied to other sysadmin jobs because the idea of maintaining more computers is utterly horrifying.

Anybody else a misfit in the field but still read this subreddit?

6zt4m1,1,2017-09-13,I'm clueless about a lifelong problem I've had..,outo-,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6zt4m1/im_clueless_about_a_lifelong_problem_ive_had/,"I absolutely hated my first day of school. I still remember it clearly, I was around 4 years old I think. My parents had to fucking drag me out of the house and I still hated every second of it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ever since that day, I couldn't accept the whole concept of this society. To my young mind it already clicked way too soon that we're all basically in a prison and it's very similar to a physical one. Your whole life was already laid out for you and unless you excel at something and break out of the circle you will be stuck in some sort of psychological prison. And you're absolutely screwed if you can't find a career path that you'll enjoy because then the prison is only more painfully destructive to your creative freedom. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


Anyway, without going into my psyche too much, this has caused a huge problem in my absence from my school life. I failed to attend school on a regular basis from the first day I started. I had a stomach ache at least once every week, sometimes more, meaning that I missed at least 20% of elementary school. 

Skip to middle school, where I grew into being a pubescent and with that came even more weight on my mind on how fucked I perceived the world to be. I'd say my absence from school increased to like 30-40% in total. 

Now I'm in high school, and through some miracle of the universe/god/chance whatever you'll call it, I got 3 internships that allowed me to work from home. Which meant that I could actually complete the damn internship because you have to fill a certain amount of hours before you can pass. 

Now I'm in my last year of high school, and I'd say my absence is around 50%. Now I'd say it's partially the school to blame because I actually don't fucking do/learn anything there. I'm not joking our ""class"" consists of sitting in a ""classroom"" with NO teacher! It's just around 6-7 students who sit around and have to fill in hours in an empty classroom, the WHOLE god damn year. It's been like this at least for the last 2 years of high school. I'm not even sure how this shit is even legal but whatever. So of course that makes it easier to convince myself each morning that there's no point anyway and it's better to stay home.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

My biggest concern is after I'm done with school, which is quite the forgiving environment. I'll be completely fucked when I start having to go to work. I'll get fired constantly I can already see it happening. I don't know what to do about this, I can't be the only one who cannot find the energy to go to work/school every single day. I envy those people so fucking bad, how you can just habituate going to someplace to the point where you don't even think about it. 

For me every single morning is an intense battle that leaves me fucked up in one way or the other. If I manage to convince myself to go I feel good about myself when I come home that I managed to do it. But I'll feel like shit because there's nothing valuable at all I've gotten from it. And my mental fatigue will be so high that going the next day too is twice as unlikely.. If I manage to convince myself to stay home, I also feel like shit, because I can't be a normal person and just attend the damn thing I'm supposed to attend like everyone else. 

It's not like I love staying at home either, there's not much to do here anyway. I feel like I'm being completely torn apart by the duality inside my fucking mind god damn it I hate it so much holy shit.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR Every morning is an emotional rollercoaster mostly consisting of the most negative vibes I've experienced in my life. I can't consistently attend anything. I'm worried about future implications of this.

6ztach,47,2017-09-13,Please Take One,rosemadderthanyou,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6ztach/please_take_one/,"(**Re-titled to meet submission guidelines**)

As the days grow shorter and the night air hangs heavy with the aroma of decaying leaves and chimney smoke, I am reminded of the myriad urban legends waiting to be resurrected as Halloween draws near- especially those pertaining to finding tricks in one’s treats. Poisons and needles and razors, oh my! 
 
Despite the dire warnings and horror stories every one of us has heard at some point in our lives, all the “experts” indicate parents’ routinely inspecting each piece of candy dropped into their child’s plastic pumpkin -or pillow case- (no judgment) is an utter waste of time.  

I realize that Snopes is not an unbiased, high-quality, peer-reviewed journal of information, but it has become a widely accepted source for teasing apart the true from the false. A routine Snopes search will reveal that there have been less than 10 confirmed incidents of sharp objects being hidden in Halloween candy since 1958, and believe it or not, the site also boasts that there have been zero confirmed incidents of poisoning.  
 
Zero. 
  
I do not know if my small hometown in rural Kentucky was considered unworthy of media coverage or if what happened that tragic night so many years ago was being willfully ignored. Either way, it would not hurt the interns over at Snopes to do a little bit of digging, for you see, when I was a kid there were two deaths that resulted from ingesting something that, for all intents and purposes, appeared to be a standard Halloween treat when, in reality, it was a trick of the cruelest, most gruesome kind. 
 
 
  
October 31, 1987 
 
As a young girl, I was painfully shy, and few things seemed scarier than the concept of trick-or-treating. 

Me? Knock on a stranger’s door? Talk to whomever might answer?  
 
Forget. About. It.  
 
For the first five years of my life I out-and-out refused to go. Something changed when I was about six. I had finally had enough. Every year my brother would come home with a pillow case full of goodies, and every year I got nothing but banana flavored Runts and Tootsie Rolls when my mom made him share with me. I wanted my own pillow case of sugary goodness, Goddamnit! 

It was time to be brave.
 
I remember everything about that night. It was at least fifteen degrees colder than the weatherman predicted, which really pissed my brother off because he was forced to wear a jacket over the He-Man costume he inherited from our cousin. I was dressed as a bear, not because I wanted to be, but because when one is poor and does not luck into a hand-me-down, one gets stuffed into the costume from last year’s Christmas play.

If you have never lived in a rural area, you may not realize that trick-or-treating is a little bit different than what is depicted on television. Instead of hordes of children dressed as goblins and ghouls running freely down a street lined with houses, porch lights shining bright, you have parents driving their kids into town to trick-or-treat up and down the halls of the local high school, stopping every mile or so at the houses scattered along the way.

“Now,” our mom began, pulling up to the first house, “be polite and say thank you no matter what, got it?”

“Got it,” my brother and I said in unison.

“Even if it’s raisins,” she said, leveling a finger at my brother.

“Whatever,” he muttered, hopping out of the car.

“Go on,” Mom said, patting me on the head, “before he gets all the good stuff.”

I tripped getting out of the car, but the ginormous bear paws strapped to my hands cushioned my fall and I was not down for long. I thundered after my brother, my breath turning to fog in the cold. I reached the front porch of House #1 just as he was ringing the doorbell. Sweat trickled down my back while we waited; it was sweltering inside that damn bear suit.

The door was thrown open with unexpected force and an elderly woman dressed in a floral print dress and lacy apron stood on the other side. She had her bright white hair pulled back in a severe bun and her eyes looked enormous behind gold rimmed spectacles. The bowl she held was so big, she needed both hands to support it. My imagination went crazy thinking of how much chocolate must be in there.

“Trick or treat!” we called, extending our bags.

“Trick or treat indeed, son,” she mused, giving my brother an appraising look. 

My mom promised all I had to say was “trick-or-treat” and “thank you.” I was not expecting the crazy old coot to go off book, so I just laughed nervously and continued to hold out my pillow case, unsure of what else to do.

“I tell you what, y’all are in for a treat because I’m feeling extra tricksy tonight,” she said after a bit, tossing a plastic wrapped ball of sorts in each of our bags.

My brother huffed out an annoyed breath.

“Thank you,” I said, heeding my mother’s advice.

“Thank YOU, sweet little bear. Won’t you be a nice addition,” she said, cryptically.

“Come on! Mom’s waiting,” my brother grumbled, yanking my arm.

“Nasty little boy. You’d do well to give your treat to your mother. It’s the least she deserves for birthing an awful thing like you.”

Our mom beeped the horn before my brother could say anything else and we both sprinted back to the car.

“That wasn’t Ms. Anita, was it?” she asked as she backed the car onto the road.

“I don’t know who that crazy lady was!” my brother cried. “She called me a nasty little boy!”

“Well, you didn’t even say thank you,” I pointed out.

“What the heck is this thing even?” he asked, pulling the round mass from his bag.

“Ooh! That’s a homemade popcorn ball, Mikey. Those were always my favorite,” Mom mused, guiding the car onto the main highway, heading toward town.

“Well, she said I should give it to you since I was so ungrateful. Here,” he said, tossing it in her lap.

We stopped off at a few more houses in route to the high school. Luckily none of those exchanges were as odd as the first one, and instead of crummy old popcorn we got handfuls of miniature candy bars, Twizzlers, and Nerds. I even got a full-sized Reese’s from my old babysitter! I officially loved trick-or-treating.

After a lap down the halls at the high school, our pillow cases were filled almost to the brim and my feet were dragging.

“Let’s get you guys home,” Mom said, throwing an arm around each of us as we walked to the car.

The minute we got home I dropped my stash by the front door and darted for my room. I was burning up, and my number one priority was getting out of that damned bear costume. Candy counting would have to wait.

By the time I was changed and made my way into the living room, Mom and Mikey were kicked back on the couch, munching on popcorn balls and telling Dad about the eccentric lady living in Ms. Anita’s old house.

“Mikey! That was mine! You gave yours to Mom!” I cried, outraged at the theft.

He just laughed and shoved the whole thing in his mouth. I was about to start wailing. Mom was uncharacteristically quiet, so Dad scooped me up and intervened before I fully melted down.

“I didn’t get one either, Sassy Britches. Maybe we’ll just have to make our own. Can’t be that hard, right?” he asked, balancing me on his hip.

“Right,” I said with a smile. I was about to rub it in Mikey’s face when both he and Mom started to cough. That was the beginning of the end for both of them.

And what a long, and painful end it was.

Dad was unsure of what to do at first. He thought maybe they were choking on something in the popcorn balls, but when their coughs began producing blood, and Mikey’s bowels released right then and there, he immediately called 911.

Calling 911 on Halloween night turned out to be a difficult endeavor. The line was busy for twenty minutes, and by the time an operator was available, Mikey had lost consciousness and Mom in the throes of a violent seizure.

I watched, in shock, as poison tore through my brother and mother in the most horrific way imaginable. My dad sat cradling his wife and only son when the paramedics arrived, murmuring incoherently that everything was going to be okay.  His clothes and skin covered in their blood, urine, and excrement, but he did not seem to notice or care.

Mom and Mikey were loaded into two separate ambulances and taken to county general. They were technically alive for another twenty-four hours, but we all know their lives were over the minute they bit into those popcorn balls.

When the police arrived to question the woman responsible, they found Ms. Anita’s old house abandoned save for a giant bowl of plastic-wrapped popcorn balls with a note that said, “Please take one.”

6ztksq,3,2017-09-13,Has anyone ever gone to university after being a developer?,WhyYouLetRomneyWin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ztksq/has_anyone_ever_gone_to_university_after_being_a/,"I'm interested in earning a phd in CS to become a professor. But I never attended university. After high school, I worked in QA for 1.5 years before getting a developer position. I have about 5 years experience now. I'm 26.

So I'm considering applying to university this year, but I am worried that I am wasting my time. Both because I feel like I know too much for a first-year student, and because earning just a BS would not really benefit my career at all. So I am only interested in a BS insofar as it will allow me to attain a phd.

And while I don't know everything, I really do feel that I know more than most CS students. I've written commodore 64 emulator, a compiler for a functional language (similar in syntax to ML), and done some machine learning. There certainly are things I need at university, like research. But I'm concerned that most of the coursework, especially in the first two years, is redundant.

I'm also not quite sure what I would do for work. Most undergrads work internships during the summers. But I cannot imagine working as an intern, nor anyone hiring me as an intern. (I have mentored summer interns in the past)

So has anyone actually done this? What was it like?"
6ztlbr,2754,2017-09-13,My very first ticket or I should have ran when I had the chance.,Rik_Koningen,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6ztlbr/my_very_first_ticket_or_i_should_have_ran_when_i/,"Today for your reading pleasure a tale I've shared quite a few times now in conversation but never publicly. Having read stuff here for years I think you'll like it.

I was just a young lad going into IT, I'd done some tech support before but nothing professional just the usual family and friends support. But I started studying to do IT professionally and now I'd got an internship or part time job, I honestly don't remember which came first but I do distinctly remember my very first ever ticket.

&gt;$Boss ""Hey Rik the difficult ""lady"" (said with as much disdain as is humanly possible) is complaining about office I'm  sorry to make this your first ticket but I really can't be fucked dealing with her."" 

Yes he did really word it similarly to that different language but similarly impolite and unprofessional. Looking back this should have caused me to be very careful but I was young and stupid so I just played along.

&gt;Me ""Sure thing boss, would you mind telling me beforehand why she is so bad that you just ""Can't be fucked dealing with her""?

&gt;$Boss ""Well you'll know soon anyway, she doesn't know how to show gratitude and is the most obnoxiously offensive person. I honestly don't know how she has a job, must be fucking the CEO or something. 

This boss was generally a good guy but professionalism wasn't his strong point. He was too honest about everything and as such was not destined for a long career much as I liked him.

So I go over to her desk where she's sitting looking very annoyed.

&gt;Me ""Good afternoon my name is Rik Koningen I've been asked to....""

&gt;$Upset ""I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE YOU NITWIT NOW FIX MY PC!""

I should have gotten out of there right then and there. But again young and stupid so I stuck around.

&gt;Me ""Sure thing m'lady just let me get to the computer""

She was sitting there in the way completely blocking access so I couldn't do much. Also I did use the local m'lady equivalent just to see how she'd react, she didn't even seem to notice. At the time this saddened me now I'm glad nothing happened.

&gt;$Upset *moves out of the way not getting out of her chair so I have to work on the PC standing*

&gt;Me ""would you mind if I borrow your chair? It's much more comfortable... *gets cut of*

&gt;$Upset ""NO YOU WON'T HOW DARE YOU WALK IN HERE LIKE YOU OWN THE PLACE BREAK EVERYTHING AND THEN HAVE THE BALLS TO ASK TO BE GIVEN MY CHAIR. DISGUSTING!""

&gt;Me *sighs* ""very well""

5 Minutes or so pass resetting a few things and looking over settings. It was quite a simple fix in the end she'd just hit some hotkey changing a setting so a simple setting reset fixed it.

&gt;Me ""There you go all fixed the problem was... *cut off again*

&gt;$Upset ""THE PROBLEM IS YOU IT SWINE KEEP MESSING WITH ME, YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY DON'T YOU!?!? YOU ARE LITERALLY WORSE THAN CANCER GET OUT OF MY SIGHT!

At this point I leave and return to my boss who offers me a coffee.

&gt;$Boss ""Welcome to the team kid, I'm so very sorry.""

An eventful first ticket and sadly it wasn't going to get more boring after this."

Can I start to branch out to other roles or is it too late?,flogew29,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6zuyfw/im_on_my_second_software_engineering_job_out_of/,"Some backstory: I graduated with a bachelors degree in CS 2 years ago from UCLA. I've always enjoyed working with computers in my spare time. Ever since I was 15 I've had a small homelab and I have been very interested in IT infrastructure.

I started my career towards software engineering my junior year of college when I got a software engineering internship offer at a Big N company in the SF Bay Area. To be honest, I still do this day do not know why they gave me the offer. I didn't do well in the technical interview at all. However, they thought I performed well during the 3 month internship and gave me an offer letter to return the next year after I graduated from college.

I worked at this Big N company for just over a year until I was fired. It was extremely clear I was not a good programmer at this point and this is why I was fired. I wrote poor code. Simple as that. I wasn't even mad honestly because it was totally understandable that I was sacked. I also just did not enjoy writing software very much. It wasn't for me.

A few months after I was fired I got a job as a software engineer for a very large utilities company. At this point I needed money so even though I didn't like programming I just took the first job that accepted me. I've now been working here for 9 months and I hate it just as much as my last job. I just cannot stand writing software. I hate working with these shitty frameworks and having to read tons of old code just to get a grasp of what to do. It isn't for me. Plus I am not good at it.

At this point I just want to quit and move back in with my parents while I find a different career path. I would pretty much do anything else if it meant I could keep my current salary of $97k/year. I find a lot of things really interesting like IaaS or even working at a tech support help desk or becoming a sys admin. However I have no idea if I can even branch into these things or even if it is too late. I don't know what I should do and it is driving me insane."

6zwxq6,8,2017-09-13,"Being payed below average as an engineering intern. Do I ask for a higher salary? If so, do I need to ask after I have made some meaningful work for the company, or do I ask now because I am being below market wages? And is my viewpoint about engineering wrong, or is this a company issue?",pancakelogan,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6zwxq6/being_payed_below_average_as_an_engineering/,"During this past summer I started an internship at a company. Originally, I was hired on as an intern for the safety and human resources managers with the agreement that I could work with the engineering department after I finish up the work that the needed me to do. The safety and human resources managers had some data entry that they needed completed and I finished it up for them within the first month or so and eventually got moved in the engineering office to finish out my summer internship. My original pay was $12.47 an hour. I was okay with that at the time because I wasn't working as an ""engineer"" intern my full summer there.

 After the summer was up the company agreed to work around my last year of college (I'm studying mechanical engineering) and they hired me on part time throughout the year. They let me clock in and out as I please when I can make time to work. However, my pay never changed to reflect my new job duties. I will be honest, it is a small company, so I can understand the pay not being lucrative. There is only one engineer that actually works there and he is the manager for our department. The other 5 or 6 guys are engineering technicians.They are full time workers who have an associates degree/certificate that’s usually related to in some CAD software. The pay for their job title is listed at between $15-$23/hour. I do almost the same things as the guys in there, except I am part time. 

Upon reflecting on my job now,  I don't really feel like I am doing anything special. Like, I don't even feel like I'm doing $12.47/hours worth of work, so I don’t even know why I think I should be getting paid more?. Even when I was there full time during the summer, I didn’t have anyone helping me out. I got the impression that I was suppose to figure things out on my own. Like I was suppose to go find my own problems and fix them. Ask the people I needed to ask to figure out what I needed to know. I guess I had this false impression that since there seems to be a need for engineers, that my first engineering job would be assigning me useful work that the company needed done and I would have help doing this work. Perhaps I would have a boss giving me things to do everyday, and maybe even have a team that helped work on them certain things with me. Am I thinking about engineering wrong? Should I be looking for problems to fix rather than waiting for them be assigned to me. If so, I feel like I should have someone there to help guide me. I’m not dumb enough to believe that I know everything's there is to know. I need other people to help me until I am comfortable and confident in doing things on my own.  Most of my time there I just feel very isolated and lost. Is this how all engineering jobs are. Are you just expected to improve and fix things at your company by yourself? I also had this impression I would continue learning things from others after school. Not in an academic sense, but in a real world knowledge sense. Like I would be taught current manufacturing techniques, standard screw sizes, etc...But my job makes me feel like I'm suppose to be applying all of my knowledge that I learned in school to my job, by myself. And perhaps I am being a tad ridiculous  when I say this, but I just don’t think I have it cutout to make a meaningful impact somewhere if I am by myself. I do great work in isolation, but I lose motivation when there isn’t anyone working on the project with me. I need a balance of isolation and teamwork, and so far it feels as though my engineering job is built solely on isolation.  

I can reason to myself that I’m just a college kid with little experience and don’t deserve any big bucks yet. I can reason to myself that I’m not doing any kind of special work that anyone else couldn’t do, so I shouldn’t get paid the same as everyone else. And lastly I can understand that I am not full time, and allowing me to clock in and out when I can is a luxury most don’t get, and this has some monetary value associated with it that maybe I am underestimating and therefore should be happy with my current wage. 

But even though I have solid arguments for being paid for what I am currently, I have some arguments against it, but I just need other people’s perspective about what's right. Firstly, I have went through hell with my engineering degree. I have never been exposed to more stress in my life than I have in my attempt to get my degree. I am only a year away from graduating, and I’m a good student (GPA is a 3.3) so I am not in any danger of having a delayed graduation. It upsets me that I am being paid the same as some of the regular factory works at my job. That’s not to belittle them or anything, but only to say only that I went to school because I was smarter than I was patient. I could be a better employee if my time was spent using my knowledge for improving processes, fixing problems, and designing things, more so than it would be standing at a machine making parts all day, or tightening bolts on a part in an assembly line. All of these things that I want to do are things that companies are willing to pay you well for, hence I went to school to improve these skills. So it frustrates me that I get told how lucrative engineering jobs are, so I dedicate 4 years of my life to studying the fundamentals concepts in engineering, only to end up with the same wage as someone who didn’t do any of this. I know I am not in a full time position right now, but me not being paid well makes me feel as if all my learning has been a waste. This is one of the most depressing thoughts I can think about.

Secondly, the average engineering intern is in the $15-$23 range for my area. I know this is a lame reason, but I feel as though I should at least be getting paid similarly. I could understand if it was slightly below average, like $14/hour, but it’s not. Its drastically lower than the average. I have been patient with them, thinking that my boss would recognize that I’m not getting paid nowhere near appropriately, but it hasn’t come yet. I want to talk to him, but I don’t want say anything to him until I get thoughts from other people.

To sum up the questions I need help with,

Is my viewpoint about engineering wrong, or is this a company issue?

Do I ask for a higher salary? If so, do I need to ask after I have made some meaningful work for the company, or do I ask now because I am being paid below market wages?

6zx0bj,15,2017-09-13,"My supervisor is leaving the company, and with that, I'm gaining new responsibilities and duties. How do I/Should I ask for a raise and new title?",Auraelynn,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/6zx0bj/my_supervisor_is_leaving_the_company_and_with/,"To give some background: the company I work for is a small company experiencing growing pains that come with becoming larger. We have about 70(ish) total employees, and we've recently been hiring more upper-level executive and management positions as we've grown.

My current title and position is ""Marketing Assistant."" I joined the company last June (2016) and have only held that position for a little over a year, since I was originally hired on as an intern. When I was hired on, it was with the understanding that I would eventually go full-time, and it was primarily to lighten the load of my soon-to-be-ex supervisor, who as it was put to me, ""was a dam about to burst.""

In the time I've been with the company, I've learned a lot (my degree is not in my field, but it seems that is not unusual) and I just had my first annual review at the beginning of August where I was told that I'm doing a great job and my work is appreciated. I was also given a nice raise -- I'm paid hourly, and they bumped the pay up by a dollar.

My question becomes this: I just found out Monday that my supervisor is leaving the company at the end of the month (September), and when she does, a lot of her work will transition to my responsibility and to me. My boss wants the rest of the Marketing team to fill in the gaps rather than hire out a new ""Marketing Specialist,"" since we are a software company and it would take some time for a new person -- experienced or not -- to pick up where my supervisor left off.

So I'm wondering what is the best step for me moving forward. I'm excited and more than willing to step in and advance myself, as well as help keep the company on track. I'm excited about the new responsibilities and duties, and my ultimate goal is to gain enough knowledge and experience (obviously over time) to eventually move up to a ""Marketing Director."" 

Some friends of mine have told me that they think with the new responsibilities and duties they think I should ask my boss for a raise and a new title. I'd be more than happy to do this, but I don't know if this is the ""right"" step. However, I also don't want to not take this step now and lose the opportunity to ask. If I am going to bring this subject up, it won't be until my supervisor has left so as to not be ""tactless,"" so to speak. 

So I guess I just wanted to see what the rest of Reddit thinks.

tldr: My supervisor is leaving, and with that, I'm getting a lot of her responsibilities and duties. I'm wondering if I should ask about a pay raise and title change with them.

&gt;Currently I'm a sophomore CS major at a state school. I'm seriously considering transferring to my local university back home (University of Alaska Anchorage). If I transfer I will graduate without any debt and will be able to keep any money I've made working/from internships instead of having to pay rent. My only worry is that I'll lose out on recruiting opportunities because UAA isn't known anywhere outside of Alaska. Even though my current university isn't highly regarded we still have companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google coming to campus and hiring students. Another draw back from transferring is that I would have to spend a 5th year in school and I would be living with my parents (although rent free). Am I overthinking this or is it a no-brainer and should I go back home?

For more background, I'm super happy where I am at but just can't afford this without going into much more debt and I don't think I'm eligible for any more scholarships. Even if I get a part time job or become a residential advisor, I estimate I'll be in the hole roughly $50K by the time I graduate. So will transferring negatively hurt my career more than staying for better recruiting opportunities?

Not sure where to go from here,sno0ze_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6zyikf/struggling_to_find_work_as_a_graphic_designer_not/,"Tl;dr: I've been struggling to find full-time work in a large city in my state and have been out of school for nearly a year and a half. I'm not sure where to go from here and I feel like I'm running out of options. 

Hey everyone, I suppose I'm looking for advice about my job search as well as possibly where to go with my life... I graduated from college in May of 2016 with a degree in Visual Communications, an above average GPA and a fairly small-time internship with a local nonprofit. 

The visual communications program at my school (which no longer exists, as my class was the last to have it offered) did a poor job of preparing students and ensuring that they had solid portfolios before graduation. In hindsight, I could have done more during school to build up a decent body of work, but because of that, the semester leading up to graduation was spent trying to get anything I could together. 

Since then, I've been trying my best to find full-time work in a large city in my state, in order to get out of my hometown and to live with my girlfriend who lives there now. Because of my lack of experience and my lack of a solid portfolio, I took a part-time graphic design position with a print company in my hometown in September of 2016, and by February of 2017, I landed an internship at a company in the large city where I was able to design for enterprise clients. In addition to all of this, I've been freelancing regularly and have had a number of different clients with few gaps between work from them. 

Today, I was told my internship (which I've been in for about 6 months now) would be ending in a month. This would basically mean I'd have to pick up a part-time job elsewhere, either doing something outside of design work, or potentially going back to my hometown if I can't find full-time work by then. 

I'm not sure where to go from here in all honesty. I want to continue working in design because it's what I went to school for and what I feel best suited for in the working world. At the same time, however, I've been having so much trouble finding anything. I've been applying all over since I graduated, without stopping during my part-time job or my internship, and I rarely hear anything back. I've made it close with certain jobs but I always seem to fall short of getting an offer. I wouldn't feel nearly as bad if it weren't for the fact that I've been out of college for nearly a year and a half at this point.

6zytso,6,2017-09-13,Some thoughts on the SMB IT Manager,crankysysadmin,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6zytso/some_thoughts_on_the_smb_it_manager/,"Back in college I got a job as an intern for this sort of weird department at the university with a name something like Auxiliary Services. The department was responsible for a bunch of very random stuff that didn't fall anywhere else: lab stock rooms and ordering lab chemicals, the campus shuttle buses that looped around campus, bicycle racks, the mini convenience stores in campus buildings, the campus ID cards, and they owned the campus cable TV contract. The university had a huge IT department, but this department I worked for had its own ""IT Manager"" who was basically responsible for all the desktops and laptops, a few servers for department applications, and some other minor stuff.

It was really like a small business. One lone IT guy with a crew of about 5 interns. It was like 2002 so we didn't have a ton of management tools. 

""Auxiliary Services"" was led by a typical small business executive who didn't understand technology and wanted to look good (I'll call him $CEO), and the IT manager (I'll call him $ITManager) was typical guy who got the job because he could kind of figure out computers but had no business or technical education. As to be expected, he was doing the best he could with minimal budget that $CEO would try to squeeze. 

As usual, $CEO and $ITManager had a terrible relationship. $ITManager thought $CEO was an idiot and too cheap, and $CEO thought $ITManager was inept and irresponsible. The truth was both of the were probably right about each other, but both were also a bit wrong about each other. As usual, the people in these relationships typically deserve each other.

A major point of contention between them was the fact that every single PC had a webcam that $CEO had demanded $ITManager buy for video conferencing, but they didn't work. Since as you can imagine this department had people scattered all over the entire university campus in various offices, $CEO thought that video conferencing would reduce the number of meetings and time spent walking/driving across campus with staff. 

$CEO told $ITManager to go buy the cheapest webcams that $CEO could find, and install them everywhere. $ITManager dutifully ordered them as he was told and then went around installing them on every computer one by one. It took forever. Even though the cameras were probably like 99 bucks in 2002, they were crap. Nobody ever used them since they didn't know how, and when they had tried to use them they didn't work, so they just kept picking up the phone or walking to meetings.

$CEO saw the whole thing as a massive failure, and blamed $ITManager.

It's important to look at this from both sides. $ITManager felt that he had just done as he was told, and yet again was being yelled at for something that wasn't his fault. $CEO felt that he hired $ITManager to be a technical expert who yet again didn't make something work.

So what should have happened? $ITManager obviously can't change $CEO's behavior, and $ITManager can't force $CEO to do anything or think a different way. That's a common thing someone like $ITmanager wants to do, but you can't do that.

$ITManger probably should have suggested doing a pilot project first with about 5 of these webcams. This would have been an easy way for $CEO to see that they were garbage without $ITManager saying ""I told you so."" He'd actually be able to spend some time with those 5 users, and have them try to use this stuff. If it didn't work a few different models could have been purchased. $CEO wanted the cheapest one because he figured they're all the same.

$ITManager could also have brought in multiple vendors. Good video conferencing is expensive. If you bring in 3 vendors and their pricing is $500, $600, and $1000 for a particular unit, it can help show the budget item is really not an option after all.

It's a tough situation to be in, and for some reason this cycle just keeps repeating."

I am doing a fall internship at a big N company this fall (book of faces). I'm quite excited about it and ideally would love to get a return offer. However, I also want to keep my options open and not let potential opportunities slip by. 

I'm especially wary because I was unable to get a return offer from where I worked this summer (big tech company in SF). Although I had sorta burnt out in the middle of the summer and didn't show enough energy by my own admission.

So coming back, I am on campus right now and attended some career fairs which led to interviews and now a couple of companies are trying to schedule onsite interviews. I'm starting my internship this coming week and am unsure of how to move forward with the interviews. 

So here's my questions:

1. What's the best way to interview while interning? Would my manager be okay if I took 3 or so leaves during the internship period? Would it hurt my chances of getting a return offer?

2. Are my chances of getting a return offer lower as a fall intern than as a summer intern?

3. Would the spring recruiting season (for full time jobs) be significantly smaller than the fall season? Or can I take it easy with interviewing right now and start again in the spring if I don't get a return offer?

Thanks for reading all that and for any advice you all might have! "

I have a bit of a difficult decision to make fairly soon, and I'd really appreciate some input.  

A couple days ago, I received a return offer from the company I interned for last summer. I won't outright say which company, but it's a fortune 500 company that makes jet engines. It's a pretty competitive offer, and I honestly enjoyed my experience with them thus far. However, the deadline to accept or decline the offer is the day right before my school's career fair.

In the meantime, I have been applying to other companies. I got a couple calls back and did one interview two weeks ago, with another interview scheduled during my school’s career fair. 

Ideally, I would like to experience multiple companies, over doing multiple rotations at one company. However, it’s a pretty intimidating thought that I might not have an internship next summer if I get too aggressive with my pursuits. 

In addition, I asked about the possibility of an extension on the return offer the same day I got it, with no response yet. 

So…….what would you guys do in this situation?

6zzs7v,1,2017-09-13,"""Promised"" new position . . . help?",baconjalapeno,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6zzs7v/promised_new_position_help/,"There is a TL;DR at the bottom.

I have been working for a state university for a year and a half. I was hired into a position that is considered “temp” and was intended to only be part-time. Our university has a program which allows full time and non-temp employees to have their tuition paid for. A coworker was in this program, and part of their degree required an internship. Our department chair allowed my co-worker to leave for 3 months for an out of state internship, during which time I learned and filled their position, and was given full-time hours. After they returned, the department decided to continue to keep me on as full time, and I had a short meeting with the department chair and my immediate supervisor regarding my interest in my co-workers job, as it was understood they would leave after they graduated the following spring. 

Since that time, my taking this position was brought up repeatedly. About 3 months before my coworker actually left, I met with my coworker’s supervisor and my supervisor about the job description, what would be expected of me, what my input would be etc., and based on this conversation, though no specific dates were given, it was conveyed to me that I should be in my coworker’s position shortly after they left (I would have to re-apply due to the rules of the university, but obviously preference would be given to me since I already have done the job - this is very common practice across the university and is actually how my coworker ended up in the position several years ago as well). 

It had been about a month and a half since my coworker left, and I had heard nothing, so last week I asked my supervisor when to expect the job to be posted. I was informed that they wanted to hire the new part-time person who would be doing the job I was initially intended to do first, then do a trial period. The earliest I could expect to see this position is mid-November, and judging from the way our department runs, I wouldn’t be surprised if it wasn’t until into the new year.

In the meantime, I am doing my coworkers job in full plus the job I was hired for. In my current “temp” role, I am not eligible for paid sick time or paid time off.  Recently there have been several unavoidable (and expensive) health concerns that have forced me to take time off. Any savings I had (not much) are gone and I’m just lucky I have a great support system. The worst part is, I didn’t apply for a job several months ago that I almost certainly would have gotten in another department in our building because I was expecting to get this position! The thing is that I really like my job! I like the people I work with, I like the mission of our department, I like the students, and I’m sick of switching jobs so frequently. I want to stay in one place for a while. Plus, like my coworker before me, I want to take advantage of the tuition benefit and get a master’s degree - if I start in a new position, I’ll have to wait about another year to apply, and there’s no way I can afford the degree without this (don’t want to take out a bunch of loans since it isn’t for a very in demand field). 

I have to say, even though I knew the job market wasn’t great, I thought I would have a full time, benefitted position 4 years after getting my BA . . .

Finally, I looked it up and it’s actually not permitted to give a temp employee the job duties of a permanent employee. Part of me wants to point this out, but I feel like it would be very likely to backfire on me. 

TL;DR/ The Actual Question I’m Trying to Ask: I’m in a “temp” position without benefits and was told that I would get my coworker’s permanent position after they left - is there anything I can do to speed up the process? Should I inform my supervisor of the financial impacts of my situation? Should I inform my supervisor I know it’s not actually permitted to assign a “temp” position these job duties? Or should I just look for another job/wait it out whichever comes first?

I should explain. Looking back, I and my closest family members have always known that there was something... different... about me. When I was in 5th grade, I was apparently never paying attention and was interestingly always obsessed with different books (everything from fantasy - Paolini's ""Inheritance Cycle"" - to a Newton biography.) Aside from that, I didnt really have any close friends and got into daily altercations with the other kids. They took me in for a psych evaluation and gave me 90+ percentile in everything from short-term memory to abstract reasoning and apparently a 140+ IQ (mom never told me the exact number - she thought it would have gone to my head.) Aside from that, though, my therapist had high suspicions that I suffer from Asperger's Syndrome and may or may not have made a formal diagnosis.

I rejected these results as false in the beginning, but looking back, it explains a lot. I was never particularly socially skilled, always got made fun of for my consistently blank expression (along with my obesity, which I've recently managed to shake,) and always felt compelled to do things that made no sense. 

High school was rough because of this: at one point, a kid told me to kill myself to spare my parents of the shame of having me as a son, and even offered to supply me with bleach to do so. I started smoking a ridiculous amount of marijuana to be able to forget about stuff like that, and eventually had to be hospitalized for all this. Unbeknownst to me, my parents were simultaneously also going through a rough time: my dad was cheated by some of his business partners into accounting fraud and suspicious business activity in India, and ended up having to spend the last year or so and another 2-5 from here on out there. My mom was therefore severely depressed and lashed out at me for my failures everyday.

My only solace in all of this is that, despite my difficulties in exhibiting empathy and slight lingering social oblivion, I'm still very good at what I do. I'm in my first year of college now, majoring in Computer Science and Math and having already accomplished more than upperclassmen and even graduate students in the same (technical details: already had an internship at my mom's company and did hardcore software development work - involving .NET, Java and SQL and spanning everywhere from parallel processing to reporting through ad-hoc ODBC connections - there.) I want to work in a field called Machine Learning, which functions on teaching machines to interpret data and act on conclusions of their own volition, and am currently pursuing research work anywhere I can find it in the same.

None of this, however, makes up for my lack of social development. They say college brings people out of their shells, but it feels to me as if everyone is already fully developed socially (especially women - I probably could really use a girlfriend, but it seems as if every girl I ever have a meaningful conversation with either has a boyfriend or isn't looking for a relationship.) I spend nights like this most of the time lying in bed atrophying from loneliness and misery, wondering whether, even if I succeed professionally, I'll ever meet people to share my success with.

TL;DR: sad and angsty teenager, could use some moral support."

In working with many small business start-ups, I discovered a passion for managing products, working with developers, and helping clients achieve their goals. This had led me to pursue a career as a Software Product Manager.

I have completed several certification courses in Software Product Management, Agile Methodologies, and I will be completing my Certified Scrum Master class on October 3rd. Despite the educational achievements, I know that real-world experience would greatly enhance my abilities as a Software Product Manager. 

I sincerely thank you for your time and consideration, and I greatly look forward to meeting with you to discuss an internship in detail. Should you need further information, I am available by phone or email at your convenience.

Sincerely,

--


tl;dr: I have professional job experience but am changing to a career position which I have never held before, trying to decide if companies will think I'm crazy for trying to intern with them.

I'm pretty sure we offended the universe somehow because this week we walked into ransomware, dying servers and switches, new guy at the office, and one of our other team members leaving. And that was all within 30 minutes at the start of the week. Needless to say, we're going through the life logs to see who skipped out on the burnt offerings. But anyways, today's tale took place just a couple days ago while trying to deal with the chaos.  

&amp;nbsp;  


**$MuseumVP:** VP at one of our clients. His org runs a museum with fancy exhibits of sorts.  
**$JoeRogan:** Previous tech at one of our satellite tech offices in a nearby city. At a quick glance looks pretty much like the comedian.  
**$BlazeIT:** One of my dispatchers that offices at a satellite tech office. Running joke being that he has a rather....elevated...level of thinking.  
**$GreyBeard:** Field Tech that's been in the industry for a while. Our office go-to for ""I remember back in that day..."". Note, that his beard still has some red to it.  
**$TheAncientOne:** My director. Overall really cool guy but has a slight obsession with his collegeball team and $iFruit electronics.  
**$Savy:** Yours truly, also avid fan of lemonade.  

&amp;nbsp;  

We're just getting back from lunch when my phone buzzes from a new ticket:  

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;**$MuseumVP:** Exhibits in the museum are not turning on. We have a controller that's supposed to turn them all on with a script, but there's a bunch of errors. I have attached screenshots.  

&amp;nbsp;  

The ""screenshots"" were the typical pointed-phone-to-screen but it was clear enough to see what was going on. The scripts were getting stuck at several points because there were certain variables and whatnots that were coming back as empty when they should have had values in them. It was very clear that the scripts were hand-crafted uniquely for the setup at the museum so there was nothing really I could compare it to nor was Google coming back with anything promising. Unfortunately, this means that I need to reach out to $BlazeIT as he has more exposure with $Museum, and conversations with him tend to be...interesting.  

&amp;nbsp;  

(*deep sigh*).....here we go.  

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;**$Savy:** *(ring ring, ring ring)* Hey, it's $Savy. What can you tell me about the exhibits at $Museum; they're not working?  
&gt;**$BlazeIT:**....what?  
&gt;**$Savy:** $Museum. The place with all the exhibits.  
&gt;**$BlazeIT:** Oh. Yeah. That.  
*tumbleweed rolls by*  
&gt;**$Savy:** So...what can you tell me about them?  
&gt;**$BlazeIT:** Not a whole lot. $JoeRogan is their lead.  
&gt;**$Savy:** He doesn't work here anymore.  
&gt;**$BlazeIT:** Oh. Right.  
*another tumbleweed rolls by*  
&gt;**$Savy:** *Intentional cough*  
&gt;**$BlazeIT:** Well, I know it's a super complicated setup that he spent a couple weeks on to build himself because the exhibits are on their own subnet from the rest of the network.  
*(Finally the hamster is doing something in there)*  
&gt;**$Savy:** How did it get segregated? VLAN, different ports on the switches, subnet range covers both?  
&gt;**$BlazeIT:** $JoeRogan set up a lot of different routing rules in the $BlueHegdehog router.  
&gt;**$Savy:** I thought that was the case, but there's nothing in the rules or policies.  
&gt;**$BlazeIT:** Oh. Well. That's what I was told.  
*(Sigh...and there goes the hamster)*    
&gt;**$Savy:** Thanks anyways, let me check in with the other folks here and see if anyone else knows anything.  

&amp;nbsp;  

I check in with all the field techs because I remember someone mentioned that $Museum had signed up with a new $ISP, and that a lot of stuff got broken as a result and how there was a big deal about having to rewrite all the remote routing rules for external users. At this point, I'm at a complete loss so I figured now was the time I must request assistance from...$TheAncientOne.

&amp;nbsp;  

~~$Savy slowly approaches the lair of $TheAncientOne in search for wisdom and guidance. He approaches the doors of the lair and knocks exactly three times, pausing before making the fourth knock. The candles surrounding the doors light one by one, and the doors themselves make a loud creaking sound as they part. A large gust nearly knocks $Savy backwards as the doors slowly open. But there, off in the distance, The Ancient One sits on his throne. As $TheAncientOne turns he spots $savy off in the distance and speaks in a commanding, booming, and almighty voice...~~ I walk into $TheAncientOne's office since he has an Open-Door policy and wasn't on the phone.  

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;**$TheAncientOne:** Oh hey. What's up?  
&gt;**$Savy:** Wanted to see if knew anything about what's been going on with $Museum lately.  
&gt;**$TheAncientOne:** Well...  

&amp;nbsp;   

[insert One Eternity Later meme]  

&amp;nbsp;  


&gt;**$Savy:** ...so, let me get this straight. $JoeRogan, in his infinite wisdom, decided that the best course of action was to factory reset the $BlueHedgehog router in order to accommodate all the changes that the new $ISP is asking of him???!!  
&gt;**$TheAncientOne:** Yep.  
&gt;**$Savy:** And. AND! He didn't even bother to make a backup config file???!  
&gt;**$TheAncientOne:** Yep again.  
&gt;**$Savy:** And to top it all of he did this two weeks ago leaving $Museum limping along, and the only reason we knew about this was because $MuseumVP put in a ticket since $JoeRogan quit on Monday and left no sort of explanation as to when/who was going to be following up on the project???  
&gt;**$TheAncientOne:** Ding ding ding. You got it.  

&amp;nbsp;  

Luckily, that day was a lemonade day so that made the pill easier to swallow. But now, I'm stuck in a rut because I'm the guy who happen to pick up the dropped baton. So I head back out to the cubes to call in for the assist.  

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;**$Savy:** Hey $GreyBeard. I got a good one for you.  
*(I fill him in on what $TheAncientOne told me)*  
&gt;**$GreyBeard:** WHAT THE TURKEY???!!  
&gt;**$Savy:** I know I know, torches and pitchforks. That's for later, what can we do about it now? The core network is on 99.1.1.0 while the exhibits are on 99.99.99.0. Subnet masks are set to /24 on both. They switches are too dumb to set up a VLAN, and they all come through the same interface on the back of the router. However, I gotta make it to where the two subnets talk.  
&gt;**$GreyBeard:** Oh boy...you're gonna have to make the rules on $BlueHedgehog to make that work.  
&gt;**$Savy:** Well, turkey. I was hoping you had something else up your sleeve.  
&gt;**$GreyBeard:** I got nuthin.  
&gt;**$Savy:** *Sigh*....thanks anyways.  

[insert montage of me Googling across the entirety of the internet for answers with occasional crying in the corner]  

&amp;nbsp;  

I eventually put something together that I feel pretty confident about that $GreyBeard agrees should work....in theory. I gave $MuseumVP the green light to give it a try and eventually hear back from him.

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;**$MuseumVP:** No good. I talked with $ExhibitVendor and everything is pinging now, but they say they can't hit the exhibits on port 80 from the one computer they use to run the scripts.  
&gt;**$Savy:** What?! That's impossible, I bound the two subnets, made all the right rules, and I eve-....  
*light bulb goes off so bright it explodes*  
&gt;**$Savy:** Did you say they have only **one** computer that needs to talk to the exhibits?  
&gt;**$MuseumVP:** Yeah, $JoeRogan had to work with $ExhibitVendor to get that computer to work with the exhibits. I really appreciate all the time he put into it originally, but I was hoping he would have been able to do it quicker the second time around.  
&gt;**$Savy:** ...hold my lemonade.  

&amp;nbsp;  

I manage to get a phone number for $ExhibitVendor and start up a remote session to find $ExhibitTech had being going crazy with command prompt, script editors, web browsers, etc. Poor sap was doing all he could to make this work.  

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;**$ExhibitTech:** THIS IS AWFUL!!!! EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE!!!! I CAN'T GET THE CONTROLLER TO WOR-  
&gt;**$Savy:** Add a second IP to the NIC.  
&gt;**$ExhibitTech:** ...what?  
&gt;**$Savy:** A second IP. By default, that computer is gonna pull an IP from the 99.1.1.0 network. Add a second IP to the NIC so that it's also on 99.99.99.0.  

&amp;nbsp;  

~~The clouds part and a light from the heavens shine upon the exhibits as they come back to life~~ The scripts stops producing errors once the second IP address is keyed in, and the exhibits are now responding to the controller.  

&amp;nbsp;  

&gt;**$ExhibitTech:** It was that easy? Why didn't we do that in the first place???!!  
&gt;**$Savy:** My thoughts exactly...  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Resolution**  
I followed up with $TheAncientOne and $MusuemVP to let them know that everything was back up and running. Of course, I spared $MuseumVP all the technical details but told him I had come up with a simpler solution. I also asked $ExhibitTech to make a backup of all the scripts so if that one computer died all I had to do was replace it with another computer, add a secondary IP, and copy back all the scripts used for the controllers.  

&amp;nbsp;  

**TL;DR**  
Previous tech factory reset a client's router, attempted to recreate a two week subnet-binding nightmare, and walked out on the job before he completed it leaving me to unravel the horror stories to tell to future interns.

Hey y'all,

I'm at a difficult point in my life and I'm hoping for some professional advice from people on the other side of things.

6.5 years ago I finished my MS in aerospace engineering at a top public research university.

5 years ago I was making solid progress on a PhD at the same school. Then I got sick. Almost overnight I went from being in the best physical condition of my life to feeling constant fatigue like I'd never known and feeling like I was passing broken glass through my intestines every day. After a ridiculous 5 month process I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. 

I thought I could continue with school, no problem. Things seemed good when I got on some strong meds soon after diagnosis, but they eventually stopped working. This would happen over and over; start a new drug, feel okay for a while, then relapse within a month or two. After 2.5 years of trying to make it work with school, I just couldn't do it anymore. I was sleeping 10-12 hours a day because of the constant fatigue but I had research, teaching duties, and my own classwork. Something had to give, and it was my research. It was at a stand still for almost two years, and although I'd somehow managed to pass my written PhD qualifying exams, I just felt like I was spinning my wheels and wasting what little time my university allowed me to be funded as a TA or RA.

I took a medical leave, hoping to get my condition under control and return within a year. I latched onto the only way I could still earn money to keep a roof over my head -- it's creative work I started doing freelance (totally unrelated to engineering, comes from a hobby). It was never meant to be a career move, it was just an act of desperation because I had no one else to turn to; no family or spouse to lean on in my time of need, no disability insurance, etc. It worked because I could do it on the good days, and suffer through the bad days without getting fired. It is not sustainable as a career, however, nor do I want to do it for the rest of my life. 

Today, around 3 years after I left my program, I'm finally feeling great again. About 10 months ago, after a ton of BS with my doctor's incompetent office staff and my stingy health insurance company, I managed to get on a drug that actually works. I feel almost normal again, and I've been ready to try to get my career back on track for months, but it has been difficult. 

My resume has a huge void of engineering work -- my MS was in 2010, my last engineering job was an internship in summer 2012. After that the only thing on my resume is grad school stuff -- teaching and doing research, which ends in 2014 with no PhD. After that it's basically just ""worked for myself on a freelance creative thing,"" which means nothing to anyone looking to hire an engineer. So far I've been getting zero response on job applications (unsurprisingly). Even the only aerospace company local to me totally ignored multiple applications to different positions I believe I am qualified for, even with two employee recommendations (friends I have who work/worked there). I know they are in a hiring frenzy across the board, and the fact that an interview would cost them nothing but the time someone would spend talking to me and they still couldn't be bothered is very disheartening.

It has been very frustrating, and I'm rapidly losing hope that I'll be able to pick up anything from my previous life to move forward with.

I've thought about going back to grad school to finish, but my adviser retired, and even if I found a new one who had an interest in my niche research topic, the university has a limit on the number of long semesters I can be funded as a grad student through teaching or research. I only have 2 semesters left because I burned through so many trying to make things work while fighting the worst years of my illness. Realistically it would probably take me a good 3 years of work to finish my PhD assuming all these other factors magically lined up. I did not grow up rich, and I have nothing right now but hand-to-mouth level income and a lot of debt because of my situation, so the prospect of taking out a ton of loans when I could just find myself in this position again is beyond terrifying.

**My question is this** -- how can I pitch myself to employers, given my circumstances (being out of the game for so long), and have them actually give me a second glance? I can't (and feel reluctant to) put anything about my past illness in my resume or on a cover letter, because I feel like if I go half-way and say ""I left my PhD program because of illness"" the natural assumption is ""this guy had a nervous breakdown, i.e. he is unreliable, HARD PASS."" The full truth is not much better: ""this guy is probably gonna get sick again at some point and just cause problems, let's make up some other rationalization that's not illegal so we can hire someone else.""

Maybe this is the wrong subreddit for this, I don't know. If any of you have a better recommendation, I would love to hear it."

I'm currently in year 4 and have been a Computer Science major for the last 3 years. I went into it knowing nothing and somehow was able to survive the last 3 years. From the beginning I knew this wasn't the right fit for me. I always felt like I was behind and in competitions with my peers. I mean, we were all applying for the same internships. I was always the last to understand a concept, and by the time I understood it, it was past a project deadline or after an exam. Last night I finally decided that I have to change course. Majoring in CS the last 3 years has formed a mild depression in me and I can't take it anymore. I wanna know if any others changed majors from CS as upperclassmen, and what programs they switched to that comfortably allowed them to transfer their credits for the quickest date to graduation.

TL;DR:
4th year CS student. Can't take it anymore. Need to switch to a different major. Preferably one that allows most of my credits to transfer over and have the shortest time to graduation. THANK YOU"

While I am of the mind, that basic programming is on the way to become a necessary knowledge like basic mathematics is, but does someone without extraordinary skills have a chance in making a career in the software industry?"

I dont have any prior experience with programming nor do I have any programming experience outside of the courses umd offers. Can anyone give any insight about the possibility that I get a summer internship?

I switched majors (going into cmsc) so ""catching up"" was/is a priority for me. I ended up taking cmsc216 and cmsc250 over the summer which didnt give me as much time as I wanted to prepare for the career fair in terms of studying different topics that I may be interviewed about. I'm pretty bogged down right now as well with my current classes and I have not been able to prepare at all since classes have started. I havnt even been able to make my resume which would be very bare-bones since I have zero outside programming experience. Anything worth putting on my resume is for the most part not relevant at all towards cs, since most extra stuff I did previously was for my old major. Considering this would it even be worth it to go to the career fair or should I wait until next fall when I will have 400 lvl course experience?

I get that I should probably go regardless of my situation and my chances of getting an internship so I can at least experience the CS fair, but honestly I feel like if I went in my current state I would just end up making bad first impressions since i'm not prepared very well."

Instead I went private off the bat starting as an AP/AR clerk and moving my way up into reconciliations and ledger work.

By now I can do pretty much the whole deal like payroll, accruals, review the PnL etc., but I find that I can't get into any senior roles without at least a couple years of public experience. To make matters more confusing, my job is now shifting me into the commercial finance team to work in analysis since I have a relatively decent ability to code and manipulate data.

So, should I take a paycut to go into an entry level public position and get experience? Keep riding out the private sector? Or continue into the transition of commercial finance? The workload isn't really a factor but salary definitely is. Help!"

About a year ago, I was going to University for Physics, I have already earned my AA from a community college where I live. Unfortunately, about a week and a half into classes I had to drop out and take this career vocational course so I could get a job in IT to help support my mom. Since then, I have had three different jobs in IT, two help-desk and now I work as a Software Engineering Intern, working on self programming projects. It used to be a dream of mine to be a Software Engineer, but now that I'm finally here I don't feel right. I don't feel ""fulfilled."" I'm not sure if this is due to some residual effect of growing up with the wrong ideas and fantasies. I find that I don't have motivation to complete work projects, or study programming and IT outside of work, which is a necessity to continue on this career path. While I was at community college two years ago, I took an Astronomy course that absolutely fascinated me. I learned so much and it made me want to become a Computational Astrophysicist, programming simulations and stuff and learning physics and astronomy. Life hit hard about a year ago when disaster struck the family, and I had to sort of adjust and change my thinking, sort of casting aside this ""dream"" of becoming an astrophysicist, I tried to become more pragmatic and practical. But now, with work feeling so unfulfilling and not a good fit, I am thinking about trying to go back to University for Physics instead of Information Systems and try again to become an Astrophysicist. Unfortunately, now I also have responsibilities. I live with my girlfriend and I pay all the bills, I think to be a successful student I would have to go back and be a student full time, and ideally live on or near campus so I don't have to deal with an hour long drive. I feel so confused and unsure of what to do, any advice would be appreciated greatly."

I'm Master student, currently I'm doing an internship in a company. This is not the kind of job that I though I would end of doing, though it is somewhat interesting. They are willing to keep me here and hire me full-time. This is a very stable company. They don't hire a lot. even this position, would be something that they create just for me not that they are actively looking for any new full-time employee. I don't think there is a good place to grow though, Just the fact that they don't hire much, means people are not moving up the latter, I can see people working here for many year getting paid a lot but not any sort of a manager yet. Very few young people. mostly 30 to 40 ish dudes. But the job would be stable as F***.

There is one other company, that I have a great shot at, which does some security work (Malware Analysis) and I've heard they pay very good, they hire so many people every year, people are moving up very fast. They're doing good in the market(non of their customers got the wannacry thing)
It seems like a no brainer that I should just finish my internship here and go that company. But someone, experienced in the industry, told me that these fast growing companies might also go down very fast with a glitch in the market and you can find yourself unemployed after some years.
1- Is that a legitimate concern?
2- Is the assumption that security jobs pay very high?
3- Even as an experienced person, you're laid off at some point because of a company crash, would you have a hard time finding a job? I'm talking like when Nokia crashed did it's employees had a hard time?

Thanks very much 

Edit: If you guys any other advice regarding selecting your first job, its effect on your future career path and so on, I would really appreciate it.

70cuib,1,2017-09-15,"[Maryland] Former unpaid tattoo apprentice, left my shop, and former mentor is threatening to sue when he found out I was offered a position elsewhere, making false claims, and harassing me.",tattoo_apprentice123,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/70cuib/maryland_former_unpaid_tattoo_apprentice_left_my/,"I was a tattoo apprentice for 8 months. My former mentor asked me to apprentice, I have 2 degrees and a solid following with my artwork, so I said sure, why not. I was unpaid, and working close to 50 hours a week at the shop doing various tasks like cleaning, booking clients, designed a new logo, practicing, and planning events. I didn't sign any contract or agreement in regards to my apprenticeship, it was very casual. No hazing or anything, it was a pretty decent situation. Around the 4 month mark, I started tattooing, and picked it up quickly. I wasn't charging anyone for a bit, and then when I did, the shop got 50% of the $50 I charged some people. After 2 months of tattooing, 6 months into my apprenticeship, I started getting offers from other shops that wanted me when my apprenticeship was over. I hadn't planned on leaving, but I kept my options open. It was around this time that my mentor stopped being around to help me. He wasn't watching what I was doing, he wasn't even around most of the time, he was working on moving to a new location. It was alright, but he started treating me really badly. 

I started to get a lot of clients, I was booked for a few months, and he wasn't doing that well. As retaliation, over about a month, he started to take away all of my privileges. He had asked me to get rid of my freelance clients (I was working as a professional illustrator to make ends meet) and start tattooing full time at the shop, but when I did that, he made me cancel all my appointments and told me I was to start my apprenticeship over. At this point, we had just moved into a new location, and we had no agreement about how long the apprenticeship would last or what I was allowed to do. The extent of it was an informal conversation at the beginning that said I would touch a machine for 6 months (which ended up happening much sooner) and that I would start taking walk-in clients when we moved. I had anticipated to start making a little bit of money, like I had already been doing over the previous 2 months (I made about $450 over the course of 2 months that I had been charging $50 for tattoos, of which I got 50%). It wasn't much, but I was counting on it because I wasn't getting paid otherwise at the shop, and I didn't have any freelance clients left. He also had no reason to start it over. I was booked out for months, doing decent work for a beginner, and everything was fine, but my gut tells me he got jealous that he was only booked out 2-3 days at a time and now that we were in a new spot, he didn't want me to be busier than he was.

When he made me start the apprenticeship over, I was angry, but I sucked it up for a couple of weeks. It was miserable and I was broke, and it just kept getting worse and worse. If I tried to talk to him about things, he would gaslight me and by the end of every discussion, I felt like I was insane and ungrateful, and he convinced me I was awful. 

So I got to work one day and he presented me with an apprentice agreement that outlined the expectations of the entire apprenticeship from start to finish, and this is 8 months after I started the apprenticeship, and 4 months of tattooing. It was well written and planned very well, but it meant I was locked into this unpaid position for at least 4-6 more months. I couldn't do it, and I ended up having a panic attack, blacking out, and leaving. I didn't sign it, the only agreement I signed was one he wrote when we moved about professionalism in the shop and cleaning responsibilities, plus a non-compete clause that said I couldn't work at another shop within 5 miles, and it had no time frame on it. I wasn't going to sign it, and put it off for weeks, but I fucked up and signed it literally right before he handed me the apprentice agreement. Now, there was nothing in there that affects any of this, so I won't go into the employee agreement. It was all just ""be positive at work, clean up after yourself, be on time, general employee conduct stuff.

I will admit, I left in a shitty way. When I blacked out, I left the shop and drove straight to my fiance and talked with him about everything, and I determined that I could not go back. So that night, I wrote him a long email about why I couldn't continue, that I respect him and his shop, and I wish him luck. I couldn't risk speaking to him in person based on the effect he had on me before. 
He blew up and sent a very nasty email attacking me and essentially saying ""this isn't over"". I didn't respond, I understood why he was mad, so I left it alone. 

A few weeks later, I got a job at another shop 35 miles away. When he found this out, he emailed me threatening to sue me. I'm going to outline his reasons here: 

1. He says I owe him a new machine. When I first started, one of his machines disappeared. It's possible that it got thrown away accidentally, but no one knows what happened to it, and I was never held responsible initially. The first time he held me responsible for it was after I asked him about a tattoo seminar that cost $1000. He got jealous and told me that if I was going to go do something like that that he couldn't afford to do, that I had to give him $600 for a new machine. That was actually the point where I decided that I needed to get out of the shop as soon as I could. A good mentor should encourage education, not punish someone for seeking it out. 

2. He says I broke his autoclave. I left it on too long on 2 separate occasions, both occurred 7 and 5 months ago. The piercer did the same thing all the time. It's a very old piece of equipment, and it doesn't work properly. It started to leak right before the move, and I guess it broke for sure a few weeks after I left. He is holding me responsible for breaking it, regardless of the fact that the other employee there has left it on multiple times as well, and that it broke weeks after I left. It's also literally from the 1950's and was never serviced after he got it. 

3. He claims he spent $9600 on me during the course of my apprenticeship. This is impossible. I purchased all of my own equipment before I started tattooing, except for ink, which I bought a month after I started tattooing. I paid for all the practice skin and fruit that I tattooed, I paid for my machines, and I paid at least $10 for every single tattoo I did. If I did a ""free"" tattoo, I had to put $10 in the register to pay for the supplies, even when I just started. He didn't spend any money on books, education, or anything - except for the $20-25 it costs for the Red Cross Blood Bourne Pathogens class.

He sent me the legal threat the day he found out I was moving to a new shop, and demanded my own tattoo machines as compensation. They cost $600, and I guess in his mind, that was enough of a setback to make him feel better. 

All of this, he says, is backed by our ""verbal agreement"", of which there is no record of. So here are my questions:

1. Does he have any legal claim to any of this based on his word that we had an agreement, and no proof of anything in writing? Do his contracts, which weren't written by a lawyer and were filled with spelling and grammar errors, hold up in court?  

2. I worked for him for 8 months, unpaid, and with overtime. How do the laws of an unpaid internship apply to this situation? I didn't want to ever pursue any legal action, I thought it was completely unnecessary, but if he's going to sue me for $10k, I don't really have a choice. Technically, he would owe me $13k+ in unpaid wages if I was getting paid minimum wage. If I did one tattoo a day, I would be taking home a max of $25 a day for 9 hours of work. Does that factor in?

3. Any other things that seem relevant that I should pursue? I'm meeting with a lawyer next week, I just want to be fully prepared.

Thanks in advance

70drsk,7,2017-09-15,Quitting an Internship?,quiting_an,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/70drsk/quitting_an_internship/,"I am a CS student doing a fulltime internship in the bay area. I just learned that the project I was supposed to work on got cancelled. I was weary that this particular project was going to fall through due to its nature, but I specifically asked my manager before I accepted the offer if he had the necessary data and infrastructure to make it happen (its a research position) and he assured me that this was true. Now that the project was pulled, he has me reading random papers (that he himself hasn't read) and has me doing a task that has no research or business impact.

I like this company a lot, and wanted to work there fulltime eventually, but I am applying to phd programs this semester and throwing 8 hours a day down the drain is not acceptable (I should be working on other research and writing my apps). Its been about a week since the project got cancelled, and my interest and patience has also worn thin at this point, and my manager and I are having issues because I don't come into the office as much as he would like me to because I don't want to waste my time there (I only go in for 6 hours instead of 8). He also said he wanted to have me split my time (80% software, 20% research), which is not what I signed up for. 

Is my justification reasonable for wanting to quit the internship? Are there any repercussions that I should be wary of if I decide to quit? I was thinking of emailing HR and asking if it would be possible to move my internship to this summer, at another office on another team. Is this a reasonable request? I just feel super shitty because I liked this company a lot and feel that my chances for getting an offer at this company have been ruined. I also feel bad for my manager, although I am also bitter that he put me in this position in the first place. If I were in a different scenario I would consider staying, but at this point in my career I feel like I have to cut my losses and focus on whats important. Thoughts?"

A bit of my background first: I'm a 24 y.o. female, graduated from veterinary medicine this year and been working at a clinic for 10 months now. I gotta admit that ever since I was in my third year studying I started having second thoughts about the career path I chose, until I could barely wait to just finish everything and be 'finally free from this' (All thanks to family and friends that when seeing signs of me wanting to drop out, insisted in me finishing and getting a degree -at least-. Which I did, but didn't help me while I was feeling lost about my career path).

Now, I've come to realize at this point in my life where I'd like to work in, and that's surrounded by other creatives, bringing ideas to life, making meaningful and beautiful art for either films or video games. I really want to be part of the process of conveying a message.

And for that goal I got two fields that really caught my attention during these last months, and they're Graphic design and Computer animation. For years, I've always had a knack for creating stuff, I'm always studying movements, the scenery, etc. But it just never occurred to me that I could choose a career path based on these interests (again, coming from a family of business/medicine/engineer where there was a strong 'you'll be a starving artist' mindset).

So, I've been doing my research on these fields, but I'd like to know more about your work experiences, I wanna know even more pro's and con's, I'm willing to take risks and sacrifices.

Another thing I'm not really sure about is if... is it worth it studying this kind of field with online programs? I've seen institutions that offer 2 year long online programs/diplomas. If I were to go online I could get myself into an internship or something that could help me afford the fees, too. Either that, or I'd go abroad, because I feel like my country is really limiting my choices. In that case, which institutions/countries could it be best to study either field?

TL;DR. I may actually go more for the computer animation path, but I'd like to know more pro's and con's of the work environment, if is it worth it to study this on a online program/diploma, and what could I expect? How did you start networking in this field?"

70ftzv,2,2017-09-16,Delayed graduation?,h48nfd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/70ftzv/delayed_graduation/,"My graduation is delayed so that I will be graduating in fall instead of spring. The problem is that it gives me another summer in between, and I really don't want to look for another internship at this point. 

Will it hurt my chances if I say that I'm looking for a full-time position that starts in winter, and I would prefer to take the summer off? I have two previous internships at major (but not big 4) companies under my belt.

Also, if the above is plausible, is it too early to look for FT positions for late 2018/early 2019?"
70fx7m,5,2017-09-16,Drastically Changing Field of Study After MS Degree,Lafojwolf,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/70fx7m/drastically_changing_field_of_study_after_ms/,"I'm currently pursuing an MS in applied mathematics, but I want to switch to something much more engaging that I unfortunately just don't have the background for.

I would like to switch into aerospace engineering, but my experience with engineering is limited. I remember in 2012 when I was first starting college, I had great desires to eventually end up in aerospace engineering, but I wasn't able to afford any programs in undergrad that could lead me there. My local university offered mechanical engineering, but I completely hipstered out on that, thinking that engineering was too mainstream and I wanted to be different. I remembered I thought I was going to study my ass off and transfer into Caltech, but I just got so busy that it never happened. It probably wouldn't have even happened at all. I ended up in math for two reasons: 1) I got a full scholarship to a big-name university for math, but barely anything for engineering, and 2) I was just so angry about choosing my major that I just decided to do math and never look back. I don't regret majoring in math, but I just fear now I won't be able to fulfill my actual dreams.

I keep wondering if I'm making this change too abruptly, but it's not spur of the moment. I've been thinking about this the last few months (since about March) to the point where I planned my schedule for this year (last year of my master's) to try and segue into the field of engineering as much as I can by taking numerical analysis classes and the control theory sequence. With the recent news of Cassini, it's burning in my mind more than ever right now to do aerospace. I would like to get a job at the NASA Jet Propulsions Laboratory if I could, but I'm a little daunted by the path I'd need to take to get there, or if I've completely fucked myself over.

Here are my stats:

 - 23 years old.
 - Applied math background with numerical analysis emphasis.
 - Graduated from big-name school with a 4.0.
 - Lots of teaching-related experience.
 - I only took a few engineering classes in undergrad, and I barely remember any of it.
 - I also have no internships, which I understand is kind of bad.
 - No GRE scores right now (yes, I actually got into grad school with no GRE). If I took the GRE, I'd probably get above-average scores, but likely not anything stellar if my SAT scores are any predictor.
 - I could probably secure at least three good letters of recommendation from faculty, past and present.

-------------------------------------

The last few weeks of the start of the semester have just been... depressing. *I'm just not loving what I'm doing right now* and want to make a change. The difficulty isn't what's getting to me--it's just I'm not interested in my job prospects with the degree.

I've told all the faculty I'm working with that I'm interested in software engineering types of jobs, but are they going to judge me if I come out and tell them that's not what I'm wanting to do anymore, like 5 weeks later? 

I also need to take the GRE, but the problem is that I'm busy as all hell teaching my first actual class this semester. I don't know where I'm going to find the time to study for the GRE by December 1st when most applications are due for PhD programs. 

What can I do? How do I explain this without feeling like professors/faculty are judging me for an abrupt about-face in course of study? What kind of programs would accept me? Would I have a shot at any programs in California/Texas/Alabama?"

Maybe you'll have recommendations for companies, or hospitals that would take an intern from Europe. 
I'd like to complete it in the US, preferably West Coast. Not necessarily in one of the larger cities. Places like Eugene in Oregon would be fine.

I study Bioinformatics at the Free University in Berlin, and next summer we'll have to take part in a 6-8 week-long (the company can decide how long they want to keep me) internship.
By next year I will have finished all my basic classes in Math, Informatics, and Biochemistry, however I won't have any experience with actual data processing. I know the basics of Python, and I will learn the basics of C++, R, and Mathlab during the next year.
We are also allowed to work in Medical Informatics, which I would prefer going into. Perhaps experiencing the work in a hospital or in cancer research, would be most interesting. I also wouldn't mind working with databases of patients and their diseases.


Should you have ideas on how I should proceed I would be very grateful."

Hello, I live in NYC and I'm actually struggling on attaining any role or position in the of field DESKTOP SUPPORT SPECIALIST IT, SUPPORT SPECIALIST, HELP DESK TECHNICIAN, COMPUTER SUPPORT SPECIALIST. I graduated college with my bachelor's degree, I'm very knowledgeable about the field and skill-sets required needed for the job. However, when I get to the final phases of my interviews I'm completely beat out to a person who has more experience than me. When I do ask the hiring manager who works for the company for feedback so I can evolve and grow from previous failures I'm ignored. So I don't really know if I'm presenting or articulating myself wrongly for the interview. Even during my undergrad years when I was applying to internships I was being be out.

Q1: How does one gain work experience if one can't get work in the position?

I come from a single mother who makes 20,000 salary a year. I'm even starting to feel like the 4 years I spent in college trying to find work in this field was a waste. I know certifications are also highly look at but I can't find work. I can't risk loaning to end up in the same situation of not finding a job still. At this point i'm cutting down my expensive just to survive lol.

Q2. At what point do you give up on a career you invested so much time in but aren't receiving any results but failure from?

I tend to hear the same quotes when I do ask for advice.
""Everything you need to learn about the job is during the job.""
""My family works here and help me with my placement.""
""I got lucky, I was just in the right place at the right time.""

Q3. Will joining the army open up more opportunities?
Q4. If i do give up trying to attain a career in this field what kinds of jobs do i settle with ? Why? and what is required to purse that type of work?

Again sorry this long text. But I could really use some advice, I'm 23 years old graduated college, and I'm just a complete lost, looking for a direction to go.

I started an internship in human resources to gain experience in the area, and things were going great. I started 10 days ago, and my boss already told me that she intends to hire me at some point. I started my internship with no hopes of getting a job because she already told me that her crew was complete but that there was a LOT of work to do and my help will be appreciated if I wanted to do my internship there. So I accepted the opportunity because my initial purpose was to learn. 
And well as I said.. things were going great...until I noticed that my money went missing...Twice. We all keep our purses in the back (in the same office, but behind some furnishing). A few days ago, when I went home and looked at my wallet I noticed that 200 pesos were gone. I kept 300 pesos from my last trip there to change them at the bank at some point to my local currency. But of course, I was confused because they didn't take it all, they left 100 pesos, so of course, I thought, maybe I misplaced it somewhere else. But yesterday, I went to the ATM during lunch hour, I went back to the office, left my purse in the back, and when I got home, I discovered that again my money was gone, but not all of it. Only half of the money. Now I'm upset and frustrated because, this is an internship, which means I'm not getting paid in the first place, after 2 or 3 months unemployed this is a great opportunity because finally I am learning what I want to do (human resources), and I don't know if I should stay and be all paranoid keeping my purse with me and not trusting the people I work with or I should just leave and tell what happened to my boss, or other option. There are no cameras nor I have any proof of this, so naturally, I think that telling my boss is not a great option. I started 10 days ago, and she will think that I'm accusing her team of being thieves.  If you experience something like this, what would you do?

70h6g1,52,2017-09-16,What's with the midwest culture?,binarynightmare,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/70h6g1/whats_with_the_midwest_culture/,"I know many posts have exhausted midwest salary discussion and the accompanying cost of living argument. So rather than harp on that further, I wanted to talk about the CS workplace culture in the midwest.

If you include internships, I have been working in midwest CS for about 5 years. Additionally, many of my graduating class and former coworkers have all been midwest lifers. 
When I visited SF this past winter, the cs culture was very different than the one I’ve been working in. 

After talking to about 10 cs friends, here are some interesting cultural nuances that seem to be prevalent in midwest CS.


In the Midwest:

&amp;nbsp;

The good:

- No one works long hours here. Every once in a while someone might get caught up in something until 5:30, but for the most part 5pm means driving home and seeing family/friends.

- Management or ownership doesn't really have an expectation of the former, it helps that they are heading for the door at 5pm as well.

- Quitting / Poaching happens less. This might be related to a lower salary cap in the area, but it's not uncommon to run into developers who have been at the same place for 5+ years. There are also no underlying talent acquisition rivalries between any big companies.

- interviews are easy and usually interpersonal based, very rare to see a whiteboard or algorithm question.

&amp;nbsp;

The not so good:

- No such thing as catered lunch / free food / fully stocked fridge. I was amazed that this is a weekly and sometimes daily thing on the west coast. There is no expectation from workers or employers that food is provided.

- No lifestyle benefits - company gyms or rec centers are very rare. Sometimes there's a subsidy program through a local gym, but that’s not really the same thing. Fringe things like laundry, haircuts, child care, etc is also not a thing.

- Non existent remote work policies -  most places allow a  sick dev to work from home (with supervisor permission), but almost no workplace has a remote policy that allows any sort of habit of it. Very much a ""if we don't see you how can we know you're working"" undertone.

- Flexible hours aren't a thing. There is no such thing as come in when it's best for you and leave ~8 hours later. Dev's need to be in their seat by 9am every morning.

- Signing bonuses or more-than-salary equity packages are unheard of. Holiday bonuses are a thing, however.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

West coasters, what do you think? Mid western, is this in line with your experiences? Hoping to discuss?"

I'm in a position where I'm unsure what are some of the best options to proceed with when applying.

As of now, I'm 18, dropped out of high school my fourth year, have recieved two internships and one with a highly prestigious organization, and have begun a startup with someone else which has been accepeted to an incubator and already has investors.

Now, you might say: ""well, that's an odd and unsual circumstance""; and I agree, to an extent—but this also makes me wary about how to *actually* apply to a college with that sort of material.

I'm looking to submit myself to MIT, and I've read here and there that it is a bad idea to call a college admissions office sometimes—but, with my case, is that even remotely true? I just am looking for answers about the likelihood of my application being recognized and considered. (Although, should I just email them? The reason why I'm also skeptical is because MIT themselves don't solicitate the option to call, but I figured that's because it's usually not needed and that they also don't want to be bombarded with a bunch of minuscule questions.)

Not to mention the fact that the application itself has certain requirements, an example being: ""At MIT, we require letters of recommendation from two teachers (one math/science, one humanities), plus materials from your school counselor (typically including your transcript, a school profile, and a letter of recommendation)."" Now, to complement that, do I just reach out to some of my colleagues? Those are the kind of things I need answers on.

I just don't want to be waisting my time and getting my hopes up about acceptance; not that I need to be, just because MIT has always been a soft spot of mine and I would appreciate the chance to apply myself there.

Thank you, and your advice/answers are greatly appreciated!"

The previous two years have been extremely demanding and I made good grades, all As and 2 B+. This isn't meant to be braggadocios, I'm just showing I've been busting my ass. And it hasn't come without mental consequences, without going in to detail I have an anxiety issue and the rigourous schedule the past two years has exacerbated my anxiety making these even more stressful creating a vicious cycle. All that aside, I love my coursework, it really interests me and that has been my motivation. But after taking no Summers off (classes and internships) at this point I'm feeling really burnt out.

This December I got a degree in System Analysis and Development and I consider myself fairly skilled at it. I understand the concepts of OOP, unit testing, design patterns, etc. I also did pretty well during my internship period in another company, though I was not ""officially"" hired as a programmer then, but that's another story.

Anyway, now I'm working as a junior dev at a small company. I don't know if it's because it's my first full-time job, but I'm feeling overwhelmed with the workload. Can you offer me some advice? 

Everyday my boss sends me an e-mail containing the task list for the day. They are prioritized in whatever order he negotiated with the customers. In a typical day, I have 6~8 tasks to do. If the task is easy enough, I take from 30 minutes to maybe 2 hours at most to finish it. The ones that involve implementing new features or drastically changing the already existing ones can take me up to 8 hours to finish.

That means the other tasks get delayed, of course. However, my task list keeps growing and growing because I can't seem to finish them as fast as my boss expects me to and he keeps assigning me more work. I've already discussed this issue with him, and also offered some suggestions that could help me get things done faster, but the situation hasn't improved at all. The codebase I'm working in is also kinda old, so it has a few problems like the lack of unit tests, duplicated code, inline SQL, you know, *the stuff*, but I preferred not to bring this up.

Has anyone here ever felt like this before?  At this point I'm pretty close to just give up and quit, since I think I won't be able to cope with it for much longer.

My background is probably a bit different than most on here. Right after (high school) graduation, I went into an IT program that essentially gave me college credits, 6 months of IT training, and a 6 month internship with a Fortune 10 company.

After the internship with the F10 company, I got picked up for a long term contract with a gov. agency though a consulting company. Perks are great, recently got a 7% raise (year before that 10% raise, although my initial comp was a bit below average so I think it was more of a correction). 

My dilemma: I keep getting calls from recruiters regarding other positions, now that I'm a bit more ""experienced"". Most I have declined due to the location being kinda crappy, or pay too low, but there was one not too long ago I actually went through with the interview for and essentially got an offer for about 10k more than I was making at the time, and the opportunity to be the head of my own department as a DBA. Ultimately I decided I wasn't really interested because I like my team (and just having a team) of 3 db people, and would have had to drive to get to this other place in a reasonable time frame (I currently just take the subway, so that would be a downgrade).

My question is, seeing as though I still don't have my degree yet (expected to get my BA in about 2+ years, AA this fall), I'm worried that if I take another job, and don't like it, I won't be credentialed enough to proactively go out and find another gig easily due the lack of degree. Probably sounds stupid considering I am getting calls despite that currently, but I'm just having a hard time determining if its time for me to move on yet. My boss loves my performance, and our contract seems to be on track to be renewed again, but at the same time 2 senior devs have left over the past year, and another mid level dev almost left for a higher paying gig before he got matched for 15% more. Granted, the two senior devs had been there for about 3+ years, but the work eventually gets dull after a while. 

In IT, does it look better to be a one place for 3-5 years, or a lot of places for maybe 1-2 years at a time?"

I'm just worried about the declining employment opportunities. I've heard that mechanical minor/dual major is important for jobs. I've also heard that computer engineering and coding is becoming more and more important. Should I dual major in MechE and AE and minor in CompE? Dual major in CompE and AE? Or should I focus on polishing my CompE skills through design teams? Any advice would be very helpful. Also since I'm a freshman there's no commitment really yet though I have a passion for aerospace engineering.

I decided I would major in computer science a year ago, after much consideration put into other majors. I've always loved computers, and the thought of working around them daily sounds pleasing to me.
  
However, the college I'm attending doesn't really seem to be so great for Computer Science. It has a nice reputation, but its CS program is complete BS. For instance, I really wanted to learn my courses in a classroom environment, but the majority of them are only offered online by professors who simply copy and paste poorly made projects from other universities. Whenever the class asks for help, they're clueless. Now, I am a junior, and I am still not proficient in one programming language. My GPA is very high, but my actual courses and knowledge of the subject are all a joke.. 
  
If I dedicate some time each day to a programming language, and then applied for an internship next Spring 2018, would this put me in a somewhat good shape for my career? I suppose I'd use codecademy each day, but I don't know if that would even help at this point. Any advice is appreciated. "

I am also doing my senior honors thesis, where I plan to compare few Data Visualization Tools and write an end result. 
My plan is to learn Data Cleaning, Visualizing and building a Machine Learning Model out of this thesis.

I also plan to do a couple more Data Science projects apart from this. (Currently working on the plan)

Now, apart from this what should I be doing to get a job immediately after I graduate? I know it's extremely hard to get a job in Data Science immediately after you graduate, but there should be a slim chance. 

Please suggest anything you want to. I would really appreciate it.

I'm currently a senior in computer engineering scouting around for jobs. My school's CpE curriculum allowed me to basically put off a majority of my EE courses until senior year, and I gotta say, I find it all a lot more interesting than software. Taking my first major EE lab course and each student is given their own bunch of equipment (oscope, DC psu, function generator, digital multimeter, breadboards, and more components than I know what to do with), and it's pretty damn cool. I can't get enough of it. MOSFETS, op-amps, scoping stuff, just messing around with it, it's really engrossing. Programming and CS, on the other, feels like work to me, but it's where a majority of my coursework (and internship experience) lies. If I'm honest with myself, I went CompE for the money and job prospects, but I'm hoping to still be able to make it into an EE-oriented career.

So, question is in the title, for those of you who are already in the industry, would you consider a CpE for EE jobs? Any CpEs out there with a similar story?"

Which school is that for you? Like when you think of all the different places on your list, which one really stands out at you as a place that you can really see yourself at?

For me it has to be Northeastern. The physical campus is sleek and modern, which I love. I'm just into the whole aesthetic of the place. Location-wise, it's in a great city for education, internships, and other stuff. Speaking of internships, the co-op thing is freaking amazing and sets it apart from other schools where there is less resources for getting work experience. At other places there's a big attitude of ""no one's gonna hold your hand, if you can't figure it out, fuck you."" Maybe not that hostile, but certainly not as helpful. Academics-wise it's great for STEM, but beyond that their academic options are all easy to understand. Pretty much any double major you'd want is a pre-set degree, so you don't have to worry too much about the details. Like if you want to do CS + Physics, there's literally a webpage for that degree that walks you through all the requirements. The whole thing just comes off as really organized and competent, whereas in other places they can make it really confusing. And for a selective private school, they're pretty good with AP credits. In terms of student body, I feel like it's very professional and work-focused, which I like. Not saying I don't like fun or being around fun people, but knowing that people around me give a shit is a good thing.

I kind of went on a tangent there and I 100% understand how it sounds like I'm shilling for Northeastern right now (I promise, I'm not), but I'm just trying to explain all the things that go into figuring out if a school ""is you"" or not. It just goes to show how wildly our preferences can differ. I like the whole urban, office-building feel in a campus, but a lot of other people prefer classical buildings and tons of greenery. I like being around serious people, others prefer quirky people or partiers. I'm telling you, fit is 100% a real thing and it's vastly understated. It doesn't mean you have to be in love with a school for you to apply there, but it does mean that you should at least know where you would fit and what you want in a school. "

*About 4 months ago email appears in my inbox:*

    Hey $LP, are you still in the area? I'd like to sit down and buy you food and drink.

    -$Soap

I've not heard from $Soap in over a year and a half and thought it would be fun to catch up so I gladly accept.
     
It was two weeks before graduation. I had finally made it to the end and while most of my classmates were going to job fairs and applying to this company or that company, I had not even started looking. As I'm walking into the pub we chose to meet at I keep telling myself not to get too excited, maybe $Soap just wants to catch up.

Now I find myself sitting down for lunch with the man who was my former boss from my internship over a year and a half ago. As I take a sip of my beer he says:

&gt; ""It'll never be boring, who knows what we'll be doing on any given day. It won't be easy, I've got over 20 years of stuff to try and fit into your head and we'll try to do it in 7.""

Fast forward three months and I'm standing on the roof of an apartment building holding the end of a light chain that has disappeared over the edge. $Soap in taping some Cat5e cable to the end and I feel a light tug.

My radio squawks:
&gt; ""Okay, pull it up!

We're nearly done I think to myself as I haul the outdoor-rated/shielded cable up the side of the building. After securing the cable neatly along the edge of the facade so it is out of the weather as much as possible I poke the 10 feet extra we had at the end through the conduit that leads back into the building.

Climbing down the hatch in the roof back into the building I make my way over to the elevator just as the doors open. 

&gt; ""Are you ready? I'll take it down halfway between floors and you open the door.""

This is the fourth time in two days I have had the chance to live out a tiny bit of my Mission Impossible dream. I hear the elevator stop and $Soap give me the go ahead. Using the elevator door tool that firemen carry, I open the door and prop open the door with a stepladder then carefully step onto the top of the car. 

&gt; ""$Soap, I forgot that you have the crimping tool. I think this is a hatch below me and I finally get to live out the heist movie dream of opening the top of an elevator car!""  

I open the hatch and instead of taking the crimping tool from $Soap, I drop the cable down into the elevator like a rope so he can put the RJ45 on while I mount the AP. Pretending I'm planting some sort of listening device, I delicately balance on top of the elevator car and mount the new AP on the wall where the old AP was.

&gt; ""$LP, the cable is done, take it up and plug it in."" 

As I pull the cable back out the car I crack a joke about extracting some sort of camera on a wire and $Soap just calls me a nerd. 
After plugging in and securing the excess cable, I exit the elevator shaft and close the door with the Mission Impossible theme song playing in my head.

&gt; ""Alright, good work now let's go get some beers.""

$Soap and I get to do all kinds of odd IT related projects. There are many stupid user stories that come with the job, but this stuff is exactly what I wanted to do and I get the opportunity to learn something (I find) cool everyday. It's only been three months and we've already done some pretty strange things I never thought I'd get the chance to do. I can't imagine what we'll be doing in the years to come.  "

I recently graduated from a State University in New York, and I have aspirations of attending graduate school at McGill. The issue that persists, however, is that given that I have no research experience, and my GPA (3.3 on a 4.0 scale) seems relatively low, it doesn't look like I really stand out as a potential candidate for this school. I dedicated my most of my breaks to software development internships, but I'm not sure if that really emphasizes my passion to study machine learning.

What was your experience of applying to graduate school at McGill, and what would you recommend the next steps I should take to ensure my application even gets a second glance?

I intern at a fairly large company (300-400 people with at least 4 different locations) in the IT department. I've been an intern for about a year now and I have learned a lot and I have a lot more to learn. I belive this is what my boss would refer to as a learning experiance. Anyways, over the past week I had been looking into Mobile Device Management solutions for our company and noticed that most of the ones that I had been looking at required gsuite. Ok fair enough. I look into it and see that gsuite has a 15 day free trial, I set up an account and everything and it asks to verify the domain. This is where I fucked up. I logged into our domain providers account thinking that verify ment it would just check that we owned the domain. Unfortunately, gsuite is bundled with gmail so it changed all of our email records to gmail and no one could recieve emails externally due to the DNS record being changed. My boss thought it was microsoft side and didn't figure out what had actually happened until someone forwarded him a bounceback email from google saying that there was no gmail associated with our domain. Needless today I was written up and verbally warned but not fired. At least I get to say that I was the only one to fuck up this bad or even get written up in the IT Department right?

TLDR: I changed the email domain from o365 to gmail and no one could recive external emails. They found out I fucked up and got written up. "

What can I do to make some money/improve my skills in the meantime? Are there such thing as temp SWE/IT jobs? I don't want to interview for a career job knowing I might have to turn it down. Yet then again, should I be looking for something better than what I was promised, and then turn down job #1 after saying yes?

I've been applying to jobs since January.  I have probably applied to over 300 jobs, I honestly lost count.  I have changed my resume 5 times or so and I write cover letters to every job that will allow me to attach one.  I have even bought a course on writing resumes, cover letters, and making a LinkedIn.  So far I only received 3 phone interviews and one in-person interview.  I have never heard back from any employer afterwards.  Not even a rejection, it's just silence.

For clarity, I will list my qualifications.  I have 2 associate degrees (IT and IT security), and three certificates awarded by the school.  My GPA is good too, both degrees are cum laude.  I also have 4 year's experience in retail.

With no feedback how am I supposed to know what I'm doing wrong?  Is it my degrees?  I know lots of employers prefer bachelors, I even know a friend that has a job doing what I want to do with an non-technology related bachelor's.  Are my cover letters bad?  Is my resume a mess?  I really don't know what exactly is wrong and I want to fix the problem, but I can't if I don't even know what it is...

I'm frustrated and depressed, I really don't know what to do.  I'm tired of spending all day looking for jobs and tailoring my cover letters to not even get so much as a rejection letter.  I have no experience because I can't even land an entry-level job, because even those apparently need 3 year's experience in IT. Never heard back from any internships either.  Most days I apply to a minimum of 3 jobs.

Does anyone have any advice?  Can I do something completely different to change my odds and start hearing back from anyone?"

70xzgt,1,2017-09-18,Is the job market over-saturated and are recruiters just as out-dated as colleges?,esLeg,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/70xzgt/is_the_job_market_oversaturated_and_are/,"I've reached that point in my life where I really want to start working and getting my own accomplishments going for me. 

The problem is all the money I've made has been by self-made endeavors, ex. I have made apps for free with over 1000+ downloads, I have made 100+ sales for private software such as gamehacks, driver exploits, and things more or less only relevant in the realms of the internet/pirating. However I obviously can do more than the avg. 4.0 college grad who only learned the 'syntax' of a programming language or something like that. I also have no debts, no money issues, have gone through college (but felt it was too easy: 1 hour of study for 1 exam, then 6 months of waiting, etc.)

It just seems to me when applying to various jobs that the job opportunities which seem amazing (or compatible, something I would want to do) have so man people applying to them (sometimes hundreds). How many people can there be who are 'out of work' or competing?

That's where the job agencies come in; I've literally gotten more calls from recruiters/agencies than from full fledged companies. I've gone on a few interviews, a lot of which went well, but then of course they wait a few months before telling you they chose someone else or seem 'extremely slow' (bad companies maybe, who knows). The problem is these agencies are almost as useless as colleges nowadays: all the information is 'free' online and a person with the right mind can self-teach themselves and become way more experienced than someone draining their potential in classrooms or waiting for others' work to come to fruitation. They only want a 'profit' from looking at the same listings you are looking at, so how do they even exist anymore since this is the 21st century and not the 19th century? You no longer have to 'consult a Physics master' to learn Physics, rather you can just consult one for free if you happen to be doing something useful. You no longer have to 'travel to a college' to learn mathematics and improve your brain chemistry, advanced Harvard mathematics are online for free.

The system seems so flawed.. 4.0 GPAer's from Harvard can go into a new job and cause numerous problems (the next year you see how X company gets hacked, or US govt gets hacked because of these interns' incompetence) , but 3.0 GPAer's from an avg. school who found it too easy and didn't study might have stacks of experience/skills over those individuals who are being handpicked by the braindead US employers and systems. The problem is, a lot of them might not have those skills, but doesn't that render things like GPA useless? I know some people who make games, map/model, and have some pretty interesting skills, but would be dumped out the window over someone who's literally useless with a high gpa from 'Some Good Named College'.

Almost the whole system seems riddled with problems, from over-population, candidates lying to get their way, recruiters who basically do what you do on your own (just less efficiently), and endlessly profiteering off of those who don't have the means to make a living for themselves. It almost starts to feel preferable to go 'take out a loan' and 'go to school' just wasting more time/money rather than sit around trying to get a job.

Some of our elite individuals are being left out of the loop while the dumber ones get a free ride. The whole system of useless colleges, out-dated and inefficient recruitment firms, and endless profiteering from some people who make tons of money doing less than you can do seems almost cynically retarded. 

3 months in and I've only gained some interview experience and literally only 1 employer gave me a 'test' that I aced so much better than the others that he allowed me to interview, but then he just keeps delaying the hire or saying they are still deciding. Tbh why don't they just dump the whole system and make smart people give tests and see someone like me can do it in like 1 hour, do it properly, etc.. and not just look at the useless stuff you were forced to do that is all basically 'too easy' and 'too similar to everyone else'.. seems so useless and frivilous to the point where I'm more inspired to 'make my own profit' again rather than rely on these slow US companies.

I also just need a moment to rant and someone to talk to. I bombed an interview on a question I've solved more than once. My palms were sweaty, my voice was shaky, my thoughts were unclear.

I've completed five internships and received return offers from all of them. I've done 100 LeetCode questions, I'm Level 4 on Firecode, and I've gone through most of CTCI. I'm very confident I'd make a good engineer. So why the pressure, what's the issue? What the hell is there to complain about? Well, I need a job in South Bay, CA.

Not too long ago my girlfriend of five years landed an offer at BigN that she can't turn down. It's time for me to pull my weight, and so far I'm falling short. I'm insanely burnt out, as I feel like I've been prepping for interviews nearly all of college. I fear what will happen if I don't land a job in the Bay Area, and I'm discouraged that I'll be dealing with this situation for an indefinite amount of time. I actually have a nice full time offer coming in from IBM this week, it's just not in the Bay Area.

Every time I go into an interview now I can't help but to think ""Man, I *really* need this job. I don't want to do long distance and keep studying for interviews. Worst case, I don't want to break up because I wasn't *smart enough* to crack the coding interview.""

Bah. Advice please. It's pretty embarrassing that I'm folding this badly under pressure, but I guess the situation is striking a chord that I have yet to deal with."

People say college is the best time of your life, for me it's been nothing but misery. I have no friends, I have no way to make friends since I live so far from campus I can't stay late, and I just hate my classes and my professors. I just want to die. I don't see a point. My professors are all assholes, the people in my classes are all rich without a care in the world, and my workload is insane. My favorite band is a sellout like all my previous favorite bands. I really thought these guys were going to do something special. Turns out they got a taste of fame and decided to just sell out.

Internet Search: Advanced Acquisition Coding (Isaac) is an experimental mainframe using the latest materials, engineering and knowhow to provide the world with the fastest way to find answers to problems.

It would likely cause problems too, but like any issue, they would be dealt with one at a time, like stepping stones in a river.  

The latest part of the Isaac project was to try and use Isaac as a sort of universal translator.  

There were good days and bad days, sometimes the linguistic databases would upload quickly and without errors (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) Fridays seemed to have an odd system quirk which meant that data would not be accepted after 3.30 pm.

The less said about Mondays the better.

Monday, 10.30 am. September 19th, 2040.

Doctor Lisa Stevens is sitting in a chair in the control room, drinking coffee and supervising one of several  interns given the task of manually entering language databases into Isaac.


HELLO [Static]


“What did you do?” Asks Lisa, springing from her seat, almost spilling her (expensive) coffee

[LOUD STATIC]

“Only what I was told to at the meeting!” yells the intern over the loud static.  The door opens, and another scientist rushes into the room.

DOOOOCCCCTOOOORRRRR

“What’s going on?” Asks the newcomer. “Why did you page me?” He asks, looking at a large bank of monitors which usually display system information.

[More loud static, high pitched this time]

An engineer enters the control room, normally none of the engineering team have any reason to be here in the main control room.

“What’s goin’ on?” asks the engineer, an older Scottish man. 

There are tools hanging from his belt which rattle and clank as he moves through the control room to challenge the two scientists.

“We don’t know.” Says Lisa, flatly. The engineer throws down a requisition order.

“Well, let me fill ya in, one of your lot filled an equipment order for extra cryogenic coolant modules!” He says angrily. “They don’t grow on trees  y’know!” He yells over the growing noise coming from Isaac.

HELLO DOCTOR 

Everyone turns to the source of the sound. It seems Isaac’s latest upgrade was finally up and running.

That's a no brainer for me and I'm not going to contest that, but here's a little background. And I'm so sorry for the long read, I figure a little context helps a bit

M23, Single, No Kids, have worked mostly service type jobs my whole life as kind of a foundation to my future career(s). In highschool we were allowed to take technical type classes as an elective in a different facility that was apart of our schools district. I took Intro to Automotive Technology my junior year and took Advanced Automotive Technology and Engineering Technologies my senior year. I effectively doubled up and that didnt happen that often but I got the experience. I worked normal restaurant jobs in highschool, I then moved into an automotive facility thinking I was getting hired on as a Lube Tech but God was with me I guess and I was hired as a Service Writer at 18. I made 35k my first year out of highschool and was very good with customers and explaining mechanical systems to them but found I wanted to get out of customer service and more hands on, even though I was given free reign in the shop and found myself to be equally competent as my Senior Technicians.. sometimes knowing more than them. I just didnt have the tools to transition. So I decided to go to a trade school for an Associates Degree in Mechanical Engineering. 

I was still young and dumb being 19 at the time and did very poorly the time I was there. I dropped out of college not because the courses were too difficult, but I guess my mind wasnt where it needed to be, being a young immature dude still. I was focused on different aspects rather than building my career. I went back to my old job and he wanted me back pronto. He promoted me to Service Manager and I pulled 60k in my first year. At 22, I was making more than my parents ever had and more than any person in my school was and I didnt even have a degree. 

Still having a young mentality, I found this job to be too stressful for my age. No doubt I could've pushed on and conquered more in that career in management, and I loved what I did for helping customers and running a multimillion dollar a year business, I just wanted to work more in the back than the front. The politics of recruiting and judging people as well as upselling quickly deteriorated my want to pursue the field. 

I'm now looking at a non conventional minimalist type lifestyle, not from it being hip or anything, but because it's a sound investment for my early years as a growing adult in an increasingly growing cost of living. I figure if I work with my hands while having the freedom of not being tied down with an apartment (I've had 3 now), I can save tons of money while I'm young to increase my hard assets down the road. It feels the only way to get ahead financially in this day and age is to have multiple roommates or a SO and I just dont have those. I'm kind of a loner type. 

Basically, I'm looking at trade type jobs. I'm looking rn at Maintenance Technician jobs currently to build my resume as a second foundation to my Customer Service skills, (i'm aware not all of these provide documentation on hours in the field to apply for apprenticeship) then using that as a catalyst to hop into Apprentice internships for certificates that I can possibly stack and renew going down the line, kind of like building up your skills in the Sims. 

Something like Apprentice Plumber, Jump to Apprentice Electrician from saving my money in my previous jobs. Build my toolset and skillset. Jump to Apprentice Plumber and work up to Journeyman. On and on and on. 

Notably my expenses would be completely tiny, as I'm not paying 500+ a month for rent plus other expenses, so I could save on even the basic entry level jobs. Is this possible to build that experience skill set, and if so, whats the best way to do it?

TLDR: Can I stack trade skill Certifications like Apprenticeship from different trade career paths and hop between the lot of them to grow into Journeyman etc. 

Thank you all for taking the time to read and help me in this quest we call life "
710e8f,4,2017-09-18,newly elected officer of a dead cs club. Need ideas and constructive criticism,limpdix,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/710e8f/newly_elected_officer_of_a_dead_cs_club_need/,"I recently became an officer at my schools Computer Science club located in the bay area. 
The problem that has occurred with this club is a lack of leadership, motivation, and number of members. 

I have some ideas that i think would possibly help motivate and direct the students
**1** I want to have resume/interview building workshops where students can peer review each others resumes, as well as have mock interview(s) so we can constantly be practicing on our interview skills.
**2** I would like to have senior developers come and give talks about their typical workday, work flow, how they tackle a large problem, and issues when problems arise in a team.
**3** Technical projects, last semester some of the projects the cs club worked on were lack luster. I want to incorporate projects that will make us Community College students more marketable when we apply to internships. Because we are competing against University level students that are about to graduate. Projects that would check off the buzzwords like AWS, Docker, Server (MySQL), scripting language (python from Rpi projets), maybe some front end web development.
**4** Useful skills like learning git/github, proper workflows for github. Learning or practicing on how to tackle programming problems differently. 



This is my first time being an officer for a club. And to be honest I don't know if I am taking a step in the right direction.
My main goal this semester is to work on technical and marketable projects, resume/interview workshops, learning industry techniques (proper version control implementation), tutoring for cs club members, have developers come and tell us about the industry and what THEY would want in an applicant, and to build a club that could be known throughout the community for doing extra-ordinary wok. 
 Are there any suggestions from former club officers who ran their club efficiently, whether it is the ideas I came up with for the fall semester, or project ideas, or any developers that would be willing to come give talks (coffee and treats will be provided). Any input would be beneficial

For several years, much of my free time and summer months have been occupied with building/maintaining servers, a small homelab, experimenting with virtualization, running different services, and playing around with whatever hardware and enterprise software I can get my hands on. For the past few years, I've run a rudamentary homebrew webserver with some basic file hosting and a landing page. I've also played around with network security, encryption, DNS, have a fairly robust SSH/SFTP setup, have worked some with hypervisor, run some network shares, have on-site and off-site backups running regularly over the network, etc. Over the summer, I participated in an internship in my local government (another huge interest of mine) doing basic support, imaging, deployments, etc, and also poking around their GIS, IIS, Exchange, SharePoint, and AD infrastructure. I tried to mirror some of their setup at home in a virtual environment using the evaluation/education copies of Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10, and built a primitive AD controller/client network to play around with.

I find all of this stuff massively interesting, and working as a sysadmin or network admin and being responsible for all of those services is basically my dream job.

But I'm not totally sure where to go from here. I've done a few practice certs, feel fairly knowledgeable, know a fair bit about networking theory and TCP/IP, and have some experience -- but I'm not sure what degrees are relevant to the field, whether to go for a CS degree or something else, what branches of IT are worth pursuing, which certs to get, what schools are good, etc. (And, at a non-IT level, I also am super involved in my local government and wouldn't mind getting a job in the public sector through a degree in public policy or something similar.) Wondering what kind of advice you guys could provide."

My issue is I have many hobbies, too many that I am not an expert nor even necessarily ""good"" at any of them.  I just love everything creative.  My main question is: Is it okay to pursue a degree that doesn't necessarily have a clear, stable end-job at the end of it and to just keep building up my resumes and passions?

MUSIC: I play an instrument and am learning another, I am also learning how to use a digital audio workstation and want to create some music on the side while studying in university.  

ART: As part of my music project, I also am learning how to use a vector-based design software to design covers for songs.  I also LOVE LOVE LOVE web-comics with a passion, and have had ideas of somehow creating a web-comic that combines music along with the obvious art and writing into the web-comic, perhaps with a plug-in or link to an original song made for the web-comic at the start of each chapter.

WRITING: I am starting up a creative writing club at my school this next year, am the president, and therefore obviously like to write and research.  Being the president will build many interpersonal skills that I might lack.  I have attempted to write a novel before but stopped after 60 pages because I lost interest in the subject.  I am also working an internship in the research and writing center of my university (looking over student essays, basically).  Also, I guess it's important to mention I am an ENGLISH LIT. major here.  I was considering getting my teaching certificate for secondary education on top of it, but my heart isn't in it.  I am still considering getting my teaching certificate and paying off my debt teaching and then finding something else to do even if it's more creative and less stable.

COMPUTER Aptitude/Skills: I've loved computers since I was young and knew how to get around Windows around the time I learned how to read.  Along with the audio workstation, I am learning how to use a video editing application similar to adobe premiere.  I created a few crappy projects over the summer (but gotta start somewhere) to learn skills in these applications.  I have attempted to learn C++ in a classroom setting in an alternative high school in 9th grade but I didn't really enjoy it.  I have done a little bit of HTML and CSS as well for fun.  The mathematical side of any computer skill is a big hurdle for me because I have always struggled with math since I was young.  I also have built the computer I am currently typing this on.  I also currently have a domain for a place I was originally going to put a political opinion blog, but decided to wait because I CAN NEVER DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH MY SPASTIC LIFE.

MONEY: is not really that important to me.  I grew up somewhat poor (always had money for food and shelter, but lived in a pretty shit area and my parents were not able to pay for much else besides school extra-curriculars, ex: didn't have cable for most my childhood, so don't see benefit in having TV etc., etc.,) most of my life and had to find ways to entertain myself with my imagination.  Therefore, most of my hobbies are rather cheap.  

I just feel like I'm lazy or something because I don't want to pursue something stable that will for sure give me the ability to live the ""comfortable sub-urban lifestyle"".  I don't know why I feel so guilty about it.  I also see several ways I can connect these skills in creative outlets that will not (necessarily) produce a lot of money like aforementioned web-comics, music production, blogs, even possibly considering venues like YouTube, Etsy, etc.  I feel like they could be part of a ""creative portfolio"" for the job market after university, considering my English Literature major doesn't really showcase all of my skills?

Tl;dr: Is it okay to not pursue teaching or another field in university that has a clear end-point and focus on making connections and building a resume through leadership positions/jobs etc.?  Is it okay to pursue creative outlets even though they are not financially stable?  Also, of course, are there any ideas about what possible careers I can pursue with the skills of writing, leadership, and art music and video software prowess, as long as I keep developing them during my time at university?"

I was a software engineer without a CS degree that went back to grad school in computer science.

I have to say, being a CS student now seems so competitive.  I'm actually speaking more from the perspective of an undergrad than a grad student, grad school is pretty good so far.


I'm part of some computer science professional organizations on campus that includes undergrads, MS students, and PhD students.  We have a lot of members from each group, although surprisingly freshman are probably the most well represented.


I'm pretty surprised at the number of freshman with programming experience.  I don't mean Java ""Hello World!"" experience, I mean machine learning in python or designed a mobile app in high school experience.  Maybe it's because I attend a top CS school, or maybe things have gotten really competitive lately.



Lately, I was helping a random student on campus prepare for internship interviews.  The student was stressing they could not answer Leetcode medium or hard questions.  The student was then going on about how they know BFS vs. DFS, dynamic programming, etc and should be able to solve this problem.  


I was shocked when I asked the student for his year in school and he mentioned freshman.  I was pretty surprised!  I think the most complex thing you learn in intro to CS is 2D arrays.


For those of you that were at one point premed, it seems like CS is the new premed.

713uuy,9,2017-09-19,"22yo Accountant, not sure about the future",eatingpaper,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/713uuy/22yo_accountant_not_sure_about_the_future/,"Hello all. Looking for a bit of advice regarding what to do with my remaining time.

I’m 22, with a BA in accountancy and finance management. I’m more fortunate than most, in that my family runs a small business, so I’ve been working for them in the finance department for a decent wage. This is my first post-grad job.

I have some indecisions about being an accountant because

* I feel my soul die a little every day in the office
* Not only my soul, but my body feels like it’s wasting away at the desk too
* I feel accounting is not a particularly ‘helpful’ job, in the sense that doctors/lawyers/architects/teachers/etc can contribute positively to society, whereas an accountant, one is quite removed from the outside world
* I’m constantly thinking ‘when I’m done here, I’ll…’
* I feel quite awkward at having my family members as my superiors
* I’m generally an indecisive person who regrets a lot of things and can’t settle on one thing for long
* …

At this point, there are three broad options:

**1. Working as an accountant in another industry**

Right. Feeling awkward with having my family members as my superiors. Sure, it’s comfortable and I love how there aren’t any workplace politics (at least, not that I’ve observed), but perhaps the closeness makes me feel like I’ve not actually ‘left home’. Another issue with this family business thing is that it’s just the same as being supported by my parents as a little kid – there’s no sense of income coming from an outside source? Not sure if this makes any sense. I don’t really like to tell people that I’m working for my family because I already get frequent questions along the lines of “when are you going to get a real job?” from the ones who already know about the family biz thing.

So getting a job elsewhere, hopefully a government one, would be great. In the event of the family business winding up, I want to be able to support my mum, so income from an external source is the best. Better yet if it’s an iron rice bowl.

Problems – I am not a very driven/competitive person and have no plans to work in any of the Big 4. Governmental positions will be very difficult to get.

**2. Working as an editor**

I’m interested in becoming an editor. When I was younger, I wanted to be many things, most particularly a writer. However, universities in my country don’t offer Creative Writing, Editing, and Publishing (CWEP) courses, and my grades were too horrible to justify an overseas education (money was an issue too). Now, I feel that being an editor would allow me to put more books in the market than being a writer.

Problem is, I don’t quite know how to get there and I lack essential skills like managing interpersonal relations, good communication skills, creativity, etc. Plus, I’m an introvert. And the more I read about my peers who have majored/are currently majoring in the local literary/book review blogs and the great achievements of Marina Keegan, the more I realise how different I am from these brilliant people, how I don’t have that spark, how I can’t possibly make it anywhere.

And that makes me sad.

I have minimal experience in this line (have only done proofreading for some friends’ works and papers, translated a couple of chapters of a web novel, and placed in 2 small-time local writing competitions) which is another huge drawback.

I recently applied for an editorial internship at my dream company (a local indie firm), and was rejected. Last year, I joined an NPO as a volunteer newsletter writer, and was silently ‘fired’ after a few weeks (responses for the supervisor got slower and fewer until they stopped altogether).

So. Could be any combination of lack of experience, lack of interview skills, lack of character traits.

Maybe it’s just not meant to be?

Going back to school and getting a CWEP degree is an option I’ve considered, but I’d love to have an internship, even unpaid, before applying – and hopefully getting – for school. In any case, work experience is needed to apply for an MA (parents are not keen on me getting another bachelor’s. I don’t have a cognate degree).

**3. Exploring other paths**

Yeah. This is a *really* broad option.

As said before, other than becoming a writer, my occupational dreams have varied over the years. I can’t decide on a specific ‘path’, knowing that a few months/years down the line, I’ll be thinking of something else. It doesn’t help that I have no innate talents to concentrate on.

I want to be like other people. People who give their all in something. People who have this one Dream and work towards it tirelessly (I absolutely love the dream that that local indie firm’s CEO has, which is why I wanted to join his company). But my mind works in this frustrating way where I get obsessed with something for a couple of months or so and go absolutely crazy about it, then all of a sudden my ‘LIKE’ switch flicks off and I can’t be bothered anymore about this thing I so loved a little while ago.

Right now, I like reading and writing, listening to people share stories, hiking, nature, and wild animals. I've considered getting a TESL as a way to be able to travel and work(?) but unfortunately I don't have the patience to be a teacher.

What do I do?

What can I do?

I do not consider myself a programmer/coder, but I do use code to create automatic solutions at work (in other words, replacing inefficient human tasks with scripts), mostly in Python. 

So, I humbly state that the extent of my coding background is automating with Python and learning only a few functions of select libraries as needed. I don't have engineers to look over my code; my employer is only concerned with the results. Also, I play around with Linux at home and I am fairly comfortable with learning new ssh/bash stuff both at home and at work.

I imagine the road from here to a hypothetical career in DevOps is a long one. My question is -- is it realistic? Are there other CS careers that are in better reach, with my limited experience, or is DevOps a fine one to aspire towards? 

My dream scenario is to find a company that is offering a part-time DevOps internship, but that seems to be super specific and improbable.

At first I didn't really think much of it, but this past month as I've been applying for jobs, I've been considering it. Throughout my college career, I've often taken the leader role when it came to group projects and have really enjoyed the roles, despite the frustrations you get with people not pulling their weight.

My question is whether I should work as a developer for a few years before considering a project management position, or should I actually try to apply for project management positions now. As I search for positions in my area, as well as others I would be willing to relocate to, a lot of them require at least a few years of experience. As a student, I obviously don't have professional experience. I have revised my resume to fit more of the skillset of a project manager, but I fear that's not enough. So what do I do?

This has left me pretty damn discouraged, and I'm looking at potentially making a change to web development.

I'm very strong with the ""infrastructure"" side of things and have a decent background in system analysis/design (my capstone project for my bachelors was lauded and we almost went into business with it). I had a software development internship back in 2014 that I left to go into I.T. for, largely because I felt useless and the tech was ollllllld (VB6).

My question is, is this a realistic goal? Is my background potentially a positive, or is it almost universally seen as a negative for potential webdev managers/owners? I'm thinking of starting out learning JavaScript and Python (am already pretty familiar with them, did my share of scripting in the past). Is the pay comparable or better than in I.T.? Job outlook better? I get the sense that I would have access to more interesting and diverse work than I would have setting up vmware or router configs, but I want to be sure. And the potential for meaningful side work is exciting.

In my city there is a program called launchcode that will pair you with an established company after you pass a certain baseline of coding aptitude. I intend to go for that to cover my lack of experience since my internship.

Anyway, I'm still pretty early in my search into this, but it seems exciting in its possibilities. I want to know if that is baseless or not :)

Thanks!

i need help with the creation of a batch file. Just started a new internship and i have to work with a software called Argyll. 

However it is an older piece of software and you have to operate it with the Command-line interface.

Here is an Example:

C:\Argyll\Argyll_V1.9.2\bin\scanin.exe -o C:\Argyll\S1.tif C:\Argyll\S1Scan.cht C:\Argyll\diag.tif

What i want to do: Run this line for every (S1,S2,S2.tif etc. ) in the Argyll folder. So the only thing i have to change is the C:\Argyll\S1.tif automatically. 

My idea was something like this: 

for /F %%i in ('dir /b ""C:\Argyll\**.tif""' ) do ( Set TIF=%%i )  goto next

:next

C:\Argyll\Argyll_V1.9.2 [...] C:\Argyll\%%i [...]

I can´t get it to work and i am running out of time and patience.

Would be nice if you could help me :)

I had two internships, but they weren't in software development (more like junior project manager). I have a decent personal project, and a couple school projects.

I've been looking for ~2 months in San Diego (I would love to be able to stay here, as most of my friends and family are here, but I was getting ready to start applying farther away), have had a bunch of phone conversations, a couple on-sites, but this is the first offer.

The position is QA Engineer, I really liked the team when I met them. They have a great location, and a really robust benefits package.

When I was at the interview, they asked me if I was OK with working overtime, as they often stay late, or sometimes come in on the weekends. This set off some red-flags, as I was under the impression it was a salaried position, but I'm not opposed to working overtime.

When they contacted me to make the offer, they said it would only pay 22 dollars an hour (~45k a year) which is fairly low for an expensive city.

That said, I did some math. If I worked on average 50 hours a week (with time and a half overtime) it bumps it up to 62k a year. I'm pretty OK with that, especially considering they have good benefits.

I hear all the stories about how there is a flood of new graduates coming out every year, and that its hard to get your foot in the door (especially when I have no software development experience), and I really like everything (except salary) so its pretty hard to think I would turn it down when I have nothing else lined up. What do you guys think?

I'm also curious about how taking a QA engineer position would effect future job searches. I'm certainly not opposed to QA, I think its an important part of the development process. But if I, in the future, would be interesting in pursuing a software engineering position, how much would having a QA engineering role on my resume help?

Sorry about the wall of text, and thanks for any advice you can give me."

I graduated Spring 2016 and I started working out of college at a testing/certification company. I was working full time as an 'engineer' for almost a year, but I find that I really dislike the work I do. I'm more or less a glorified 'tester' with a different title. 

I want to switch into a different industry of EE, but applying for jobs is difficult because I don't qualify as a 'New College Graduate' anymore and I don't have enough relevant experience for entry level positions.

My only technical internship was with the testing/certification company prior to the full time position there. So it's difficult to show that I have much experience in the field. 

I'm considering switching fields into computer science and going back for a post-bacc degree. But it's a big investment and I'm having second thoughts about wasting my B.S. in EE. 

Should I stick to EE and keep job searching? What kind of positions are really open for my current level?

Or should I take the leap and switch into computer science and hopefully I'll have more luck in the job market there? 

Appreciate any advice or suggestions."

My phone played the email notification sound. I checked; I had been assigned another job. This would normally not be an issue, but I was halfway through loading spares into my van for the job I was already assigned to.  
I scanned the email anyway. Great - it was from *{priority}*, whereas the job I had been loading for was for *{piecemeal}*. Due to various contractual shenanigans (such as *{priority}* paying the ~~exorbitant~~ monthly fee), I was now required to attend the new job first.  
A quick scan of the email gave me the pertinent details - the helpdesk had been troubleshooting with the user and determined that a UPS had died. Well, at least this time it was something that I had in stock.

I shrugged my shoulders and added an extra box to the gear to load into the van. At least this time, the new job was only about half an hour out of the way; I could hit the *{piecemeal}* job relatively shortly after I completed the *{priority}* job.  
I suppressed a shudder as I involuntarily recalled previous occasions when the locations had not been so geographically convenient.

---

A scant sixty minutes later, I arrived at *{priority}*. I briefly looked at the UPS box in the back of my van, but I decided against moving it, as **A:** the site may have a trolley or cart available to minimise lifting requirements, thus eliminating potential for injuries commonly associated with lifting heavy loads (THANKS OSH!), and also, more importantly, **B:** I really didn't want to.  
Instead, I made my way inside, signed in to the visitor registration system, and made my way through the unnecessarily circuitous¹ path to the appropriate supervisor. She was an older lady, thin, old enough to be grey but still sporting a head of dark hair - I assume either she dyed it, or she possessed formidable genetics.

&gt; ME: Hi! I'm Gambatte from *{company}*, I understand you're having an issue with a UPS?

&gt; Supervisor (SUP): Oh yes! Let me show you...

I followed her to the UPS in question. Slung under a low counter, it sat next to a computer and a few other peripherals, required for that station to actually be usable. All of which were dark.  
Despite the dim lighting, however, I spotted a potential issue.

&gt; ME: So, when you were speaking to the helpdesk, did they get you to check anything?

&gt; SUP: They just asked me to confirm that all of the cables were plugged in and tight.

&gt; ME: ...and...

&gt; SUP: They definitely were! All of the cables plugged in to the back were tight. You know, firm. They didn't wiggle or anything.

&gt; ME: Okay. So... At any point, did the helpdesk ask you *how many* cables were plugged in to the UPS?

&gt; SUP: Uh... No? I don't think so.

&gt; ME: Do you remember how many there were?

&gt; SUP: Two; definitely two.

&gt; ME: Mmhmmm. Right.

&gt; SUP: So... how long do you think it will take to fix this?

&gt; ME: Well, ma'am, given that the UPS currently has the two OUTPUT cables connected, but the INPUT cable is disconnected, I'm going to say...

I plugged the power cable back in.

&gt; ME: ...that it's fixed, more or less, right about now.

&gt; SUP: Wait, how many cables are meant to be plugged in?

&gt; ME: Three. Some sites run more than that, but this site, for these stations? Always three - never just two.

&gt; SUP: Well if I'd known that, *I* could have plugged it back in!

&gt; ME: Yes'm, you probably could have.

&gt; SUP: Well, now I feel like coming out here today was a waste of your time.

&gt; ME: I was going to be passing fairly close by anyway. I'll quickly check that the UPS is charging properly, and then I'll get out of here.

I gleefully envisaged myself, thirty seconds later, skipping down the path away from this forsaken place.

---

I knelt down to access the UPS. Most of the UPSes that *{priority}* uses have a menu that you can access via controls and an LCD on the front panel.  
Naturally, this UPS was not one of those models. No, this one merely had a single illuminated LED (and three woefully de-luminated ones) next to a battery pictograph.

I stood up. I could wait for a second LED to illuminate - which could take hours; and that was only if the UPS was correctly charging. Right, time for the second option - if the front panel is not available, there is software on the connected computer.
I opened the Start menu, and scrolled through, looking for the UPS management software. It's on every one of these computers, *{priority}* has a configuration management server that makes sure it's installed... so why is it not here? After far too long beating my head on the software, I realised that it was gone - and in it's place was a new icon. With nothing to lose, I clicked the button...

...and a browser window opened, and I was presented with a login page.  
Which I had never seen before.  
For which I did not have credentials.

I *could* just start plugging in common credentials, but this is a *{priority}* site, and they have their own support staff. Time to make a call.  
After the usual run around with the first level phone monkeys, I got hold of a T2 tech.

&gt; T2T: Hey Gambatte, you don't usually ring in unless it's really interesting! What's going on?

I may have worked with T2T once or twice before.

&gt; ME: Should be an easy one today - I'm trying to confirm that this UPS is charging, but I can't get into this new software you guys are running now.

&gt; T2T: New software? Let me remote in and see...

&gt; T2T: Huh.

&gt; T2T: Yeah, that is new.

&gt; ME: Yes. All I want to confirm is that the UPS is charging, then I can get out of here.

&gt; T2T: Wait, why is the UPS discharged? I've got no records of a power outage at that location; none of the other stations seem to be affected.

&gt; ME: The power cable was disconnected somehow. There may have been a stool touching the UPS, that caused the cables to work themselves out a little bit more every time the stool was touched - and this stool had the stuff on it for that new promotion, so they would have been touching it a couple of hundred times a day.

&gt; T2T: Wait, that doesn't sound like a reason for you to come all the way down there - it's what, an hour? Ninety minutes?

&gt; ME: Give or take.

&gt; T2T: So how do you get the job?

&gt; ME: Because when your helpdesk asked the supervisor here to check that ""all the cables are plugged in"", they neglected to mention that there should be THREE cables, not TWO. I don't blame her, though - it's not the supervisor's job to know that the UPS should have three cables plugged into it; although she does now. Whether she remembers that is anyone's guess, though.

&gt; T2T: Well... damn. I'll get our T1 script for power/UPS issues changed.

&gt; ME: That'd be nice. So... how's that password coming?

&gt; T2T: Uhhh...

&gt; ME: Let me guess. This project was being run by an unpaid intern who's now gone back to high school. The person who was managing the intern is currently on maternity leave and won't be back for another three months, if at all. So naturally neither of them will answer their phones during the day, and of course, no one documented the password they set on the new UPS management software before they left.

&gt; T2T: That's not it at all!

&gt; ME: Oh?

&gt; T2T: The guy who managed the intern is on ANNUAL leave and will be back next week.

&gt; ME: ...and the rest of it?

&gt; T2T: ...is disturbingly accurate. Are you spying on my office?

&gt; ME: No, I've just played the password game before. Shall I start trying commonly used combinations, or...?

&gt; T2T: Oh. No, don't worry about that.

&gt; ME: Why not? Did you find the credentials?

&gt; T2T: Something like that.

I glanced at the screen. The username was set to ""admin"". The password field had five asterisks in it.

&gt; ME: ...It's admin/admin, isn't it.

&gt; T2T: At least next time, you won't need to call me.

Finally, the management page finished loading. The page showed me that the UPS battery was charging; currently at 31%.

&gt; ME: Hey, T2T.

&gt; T2T: Yeah?

&gt; ME: In the time it took to find all of this out, the battery has charged past 25%.

&gt; T2T: Okay?

&gt; ME: ...and the second front panel indicator came on, confirming that it was charging, without having to use the web interface at all. It would have been faster for me to just sit here and watch the UPS LEDs.

&gt; T2T: Oh man, that's crazy.

&gt; ME: Yeah... At least now that I know the password, it'll be much quicker next time.

&gt; T2T: True.

With that, I said my various goodbyes to T2T and SUP, and got on my way.

¹ I would later discover that there was a concealed button in the entry area that opened a door that led directly to the area I needed to work in. I was also told that this was ""to be used sparingly"".²

² And I never used the circuitous path again.

**ADDENDUM:** Due to unfortunate circumstances beyond my control, I found myself revisiting a city I used to live in - and happened to pass by the business I resigned from [here.](https://redd.it/20o7dj) As I approached, I noticed that my old workplace had received a significant make over - the drab blue paint now replaced by a gaudy bright red. As I drew closer, I realised that the building is now a garage door salesroom; that is, a store where they sell and service garage doors, and (I assume) the automated mechanical openers thereof.  
A quick check of the Companies Register this morning has revealed that almost a year ago, the listed business address for my old employer was changed to be the same as the listed residential address of the director/owner - the man who knowingly and wilfully charged for new parts while deliberately fitting second-hand stock.  
So it would appear that the business has gone from having it's own office and workshop, employing about a dozen staff, and keeping the owner in caviar for his yacht, to being a business that he runs from his garage.

71fuqt,2,2017-09-20,Internship after college?,appleWolf_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/71fuqt/internship_after_college/,"Hi, all - this will be my first post here. Like many here, I'm going through a rough patch with my career path, which hopefully shouldn't be all too uncommon. 

I had an internship doing automated testing during my third year of school. But after maybe 6 months, they suddenly decided to cut a bunch of interns, including one who had been there about 3 years (I guess he was hired as a freshman in college or something).

I've noticed a pretty strong pattern with my graduating class - all of the SWE jobs I've heard of people getting came directly after an internship. I don't have a large sample size as it were, but nevertheless that's compelling to me. 

As for me, after college, I got a contract QA position that I was very unsatisfied with and left in 5 months. That's not at all what I was planning or expecting.

So given all of that, is getting a Software Engineering internship a feasible and good idea?

I have more to say, but I don't want to write a novel that would discourage responses. I'm actually having a lot of emotional problems right now. And so, I'd love to a long chat about this with someone older and wiser; feel free to send a message."

I'm 19 years old and have been going after my degree in IS at a local community college. I need to switch back to working for a quarter or two and have been scouring the area looking for jobs. I was called back by a company after I applied for this position:

- **Job Duties**  
  - Process customer booking modifications and cancellations. This is analogous to somebody that books a hotel room, but then needs to change the reservation dates.
  - Workflow would be to take information submitted by customers (via ticket), making changes with customer account manager system, and sending a response (ticket) letting customer know the change has been made.
- **Metrics and Job Requirements**
  - Each booking modification and/or cancellation can take about 2-3 minutes to process.
  - Success would be to process incoming requests within one to two hours of customer submission.
  - Overall volume could necessitate 5-6 workers during normal business hours (ex. 6am to 6pm)
  - Good candidate would be those that can follow policies and procedures (ex. Banking, insurance, etc.) as there won’t be too many judgement calls made doing this.
  - Data entry
  - Excellent computer skills
  - Comfortable with repetitive tasks

I feel comfortable about the interview process, my ability to do the job, and my ability to do it well. My only worries are about how acceptable it might be to do a bunch of other, random things, like bringing my keyboard to work and attempting to automate my work. This will be my third ""real"" job and my second tech job (first was an internship at the local school district), so I guess I'm just nervous in general?

Thank you for reading! If you've got advice, I'd love to hear it!

**Edit:** Definitely the easiest interview I've ever done, and I landed the job! Apparently they had a handful of candidates for it, but the woman was pretty transparent with me in letting me know that I was the best candidate so far. I'm not surprised, as the place is the largest temp agency in my town and they get a lot of really sketchy applicants.

Anyways, I'm set to start next Wednesday as what is apparently the only startup in my area; they're based in Seattle and are doing really well, so I'm excited. I guess I might be fielding some calls alongside data entry, but she said that she would also refer my application to their IT director, as she's pretty sure that they need would make space for an entry-level IT assistant. I'm excited!"

71i070,353,2017-09-21,"Saving the day, literally",PrutsendePrutser,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/71i070/saving_the_day_literally/,"A couple of weeks back I wrote a story about debugging the customer (more stories about that some time soon), but this one is about one of the first issues I fixed in our in-house software, which is luckily to be replaced with a very nice new .NET Core application with a supersmooth frontend. It's a rather long story because it also involves some background info 

The heroes of the story are:  
**$me**: The one and only in-house dev here  
**$coworkers**: All my co-workers doing lots of work which they all log using our in-house software (those are actually the real heroes)  
**$supervisor**: My direct supervisor, basically leading the daily things in the company, deciding which direct we're taking etc  

I started working for my current employer around 1.5 years ago, after their previous developer passed away. This story takes places in my first month here, while finding my way through the very crappy codebase. The whole in-house application was written using classic ASP, with an Access DB. This has caused a ton of issues, including bringing the whole database to a halt while trying to get five records, which was fixed by retrieving 250.000 records, and then filtering those in-memory.  

One of the biggest problems when I started here, was the slowness of the classic ASP application. Random, very simple pages would often take 20 seconds to load, if not more. Like a page that would show the username, and a dropdownmenu with around 150 products. This got exponentially worse, every day, literally. At certain moments no-one would be able to load any page for two minutes.  

Now our sysadmin checked the server performance multiple times, nothing seemed off. IIS wasn't showing any issues either. I walked through the source code of multiple pages, nothing there seemed to be able to cause such a load on the server, the load on the server wasn't even off, with everything running below 50%, so the only possible cause was MS Access throwing a fit, a very big fit.. And in only one of our two main webapplications (they're identical, but a long time ago before I worked here, a decision was made to create an identical application for each subcompany).

The first few weeks here gave me the idea that this was a very strict company, and that not following those rules would cause big problems (they are strict, but not in a bad way. In a very nice way actually which gives me the forced, external structure I need). $supervisor was out of the office on this day, visiting customers on the other side of the country, the CEO was also out of the office, WITH $supervisor, so the only option I had was work on my regular tasks, with my $coworkers being unable to get any work done at that point, or I could try and fix their issues, and possibly take the heat afterwards.  

I decided to go for that last option, because basically the in-house software was so slow in a busy period that no-one could get their work done. The first thing I did was listing which were the most used pages in the company. The only thing that should be able to slow down the application so much would be a behemoth, that would be loaded on multiple screens. The first page that came to mind was the planboard, which is shown on at least 10 screens, all day long, refreshing every two minutes. I checked the sourcecode for that page, and it was, indeed, a behemoth to say the least. This had to be fixed, and quick. I decided to take my best weapons, a keyboard, and (in my off-hand sometimes a mouse), to slay that behemoth (and possible $supervisor, by reverting back to the old version in case I had to take the heat).  

The first battle was defeating the massive SQL-query, slice it up, and put the slices on display as small, readable queries. This query was such a massive behemoth, that retrieved to much unused data so many times, that just looking at it would clearly explain why the slowness got exponentially worse every day, literally. That day I also found out that I could tame VBScript 5 just a bit, by using functions and subs in VBScript 5 (*There were no subs or functions used anywhere, except to inject a function written in Javascript 1.2*), so I directly rewrote the whole page so that it was actually readable code and functionality.  

While testing the new version, comparing the data etcetera, it seemed like I might have found a way to slay the beast, just only in the (not so) safe test environment. Yes, the safe test environment would be influenced by the real world where actual people do actual things. One moment it would seem like the page would load superfast (think .2 seconds instead of a timeout after 5 minutes), then a few moments later it would timeout again after five minutes.

Remember how I said that the planboard was loaded on multiple machines, refreshing every two minutes automatically? I decided to push it to the live environment, trying to slay the behemoth. So I copied over the file, and it was *supereffective* to say the least. Almost all of the other pages that should be loading quickly were now almost instantly loaded. People were able to get work done because the big bad behemoth was no longer.

Now, with $me fixing the long-running unexplainable issues, why were the $coworkers the real heroes of the story? I've developed software during my internships, at a previous job for external customers, and now here in-house, but I've never ever seen people that use your software, applaud loudly (like genuinely applauding) after you fix a major bug, or actually ever.

I walked into the workshop to see if everything was working still, and got applauded by the 25 coworkers for fixing that major issue. Still give me some goosebumps when I remind myself of that. My $coworkers, $supervisor (who gave me a major compliment of taking it in my own hands) and $boss are all awesome people.

TL;DR: Young, slightly insecure developer thinks he's going to take the heat for slaying a behemoth without following protocol, gets a major applause instead"

71jscw,30,2017-09-21,27 and career not really taking off as I'd hoped,cscareertroubles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/71jscw/27_and_career_not_really_taking_off_as_id_hoped/,"Sorry for the slightly vague title, but I'll expand upon my situation and ask for some advice.

I graduated from a top school in computer science in 2011. I did a summer internship straight after graduation.  The internship was only 2 months, but I felt like it was broadly successful.  

I then did another year of study, unrelated to computer science or software engineering.  It was a bit of a hobby and I was thinking about careers at all.  

In 2013 I landed my first software job doing some Java development part time at a startup.  I knew I didn't have much experience and I struggled a bit.  I didn't really make much of a contribution to the main project, but I made some small tools and scripts which helped other people do their jobs more effectively so I think that was a plus.  Unfortunately the startup ran out of money, couldn't make payroll and so I jumped out after 2 months no pay (they did pay me eventually). I was there about 6 months.

After that I worked odd jobs to make ends meet and taught myself ruby on rails.  I read a lot of hacker news and startup related books.  To be honest, I had a starry eyed dream of starting my own company and making my own product, but I never managed to release my prototype.  

After 6 months of doing odd jobs I landed a full time ruby on rails job.  It was another startup.  It was far far more difficult than I thought it would be.  The project seemed massive and unlike anything I had seen before working on my toy projects and tutorials.  The lead programmer was remote and I found communication difficult.  In the 6 months I worked there full time I don't think I wrote any code that made it into the main codebase.  I did a few bits and bobs like sales events and deployment, but me and the boss came to a mutual agreement that it would be better if I left.  I don't want to waste a startup's money if I'm not able to do anything for them.

Fast forward through a year and a half of more odd jobs.  I studied react and react native in this time.  I made a bunch of different prototypes for things that I'm interested in.  I got another part time job programming for a machine learning startup.  I don't understand any of the machine learning things but their frontend is react so I thought there would be at least something I could do there.

So I'm two months into this latest gig and I don't think things are going well.  I feel completely swamped.  I try reading the code-base and the documentation. In two months I've only made a few superficial changes, and most of the time I cannot build the main project on my dev machine.  I feel like I'm falling into the same problems I had on my previous project.  I find it very very hard to concentrate on anything at work right now.  I try to write lists of what I'm supposed to do the next day but it feels like a brick wall.  I tried doing pomodoro but I couldn't make it through a 20 minute block without getting distracted.  I'm very worried about my career.

So, after that backstory/braindump I have some more concrete questions:

How can I tackle coming into a new company and make it smoother? How do I get productive on a new codebase?

How can I improve my concentration and stay on task more in the face of difficulty?  

Perhaps if programming is not my strong point, what other careers can I aim for?

They said we'll see, and I never heard back. I called in, and they said somebody took this position.
I tried searching around for internships for data entry, or even working at a gas station. Place I'm working at right now is going to shutdown within a few months. What do I do? I am limited because I can't legally drive. They look at me awkward when I told them I had epilepsy. I know I don't have to tell them what disability I have, but they asked why I didn't have a driver license.
Where do I go? I don't have much work experience. I'm 26, I just started from 3 years ago. I didn't really have much of a choice. Anyway, what to do? I looked at volunteering to do things, but I didn't really meet any qualification to do anything. Welcoming people at walmart? Not even that."

71kea6,1,2017-09-21,What programming languages did your university teach you or focus on?,crazypond,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/71kea6/what_programming_languages_did_your_university/,"A little background here: I'm a rising junior majoring in CS and up until this point the sequence of programming languages my school has  taught in its curriculum is Python-&gt;C. I do know the final semester classes will slowly transition into C++ and I think there might be one class on Java in the 300 to 400 level classes.

Down to the reason behind this question. I've been applying to countless internships, big companies, small companies, tech, non-tech and I've seen a constant recurring theme in the list of qualities for ""preferred candidates"": experience in C++ and/or Java. Although not every single internship required this, many (if not most) were looking for students who had exposure to these languages. 

I just feel like my University is impeding us students by focusing so heavily on a language such as C. I understand that knowing C lets you really learn the ""low-level stuff"" but frankly it seems that recruiters don't give half a shit that I can tell you a switch statement uses less resources than an if statement. Most of them are so far up and beyond that simple stuff that they want to know how good you are at OOP.

Is it not possible to learn all these low-level mechanisms through a language like C++ or Java as well? I don't know, I'm just wondering what everyone else's experience is/was at their university because I was honestly thinking of writing a letter to the department of CS to voice my opinion (not that it matters for me at this point but at least future students might not get the short end of the stick).

Also, I'm not saying I did not receive any internships, in fact I had one last summer for a big healthcare company (although the job dealt more with data analysis and data science rather than programming) but in the realm of software development, it seems like candidates with an extra 2 ""+'s"" after the letter C on their resume have a better chance of landing these software dev internships.

I'm a recent graduate from Colorado School of Mines that received his BS degree in geophysical engineering. However, this is not the direction I intend to go career-wise anymore, particularly because it is difficult to find work in this field at my degree level, and secondarily because I am just not interested in doing the work anymore. 

I have limited coding experience - I had to take a programming concepts course in Java as my first experience in programming. Other than that, I've used MATLAB for projects lots, but that is a simplified programming language that skips over a lot of the fundamentals. I also had an internship where I was introduced to Perl and SQL, but my experience with them is still very limited. 

As someone with limited work experience, what is my best option for getting into the software development/programming field? Should I go back to Mines for a second BS degree in computer science, or should I do the Master's program? Or, should I just self-teach while working on the side? Any help would be appreciated.

I'm working as an IT Assistant/Help Desk Tech for a mid-size home health and transportation company. Our IT department is only me, my supervisor, and two other techs. I've been here for about a year and a half and it's my first actual job in my career field as I'm still in school. I've worked summer internships and done the occasional work for a small start up company here and there, but nothing serious. 

I'm making $10/hr here and was working full time during this past summer. When my one year mark hit I thought it was time for me to ask for a raise as my job responsibilities have grown a lot since I started and I thought it'd be fair to get an increase in compensation for increased workload. We just hired our fourth member of the IT department and I'm the one training him and he makes $21/hr,  but he has 10-15 years experience and has a degree. That's another reason I wanted a raise since I'm training someone who's making double what I am. 

So I asked my supervisor for a raise and she said that she's been very proud of my work and progress especially in the last few months so I thought I had a good shot. Two weeks pass and I haven't heard anything so I pop in her office and ask if she's heard anything about what we discussed and she said it's been to busy and hasn't heard anything. I was okay with that because we are busy with projects right now. The week after that she calls me into her office and doesn't say anything about the raise, but says the higher ups say I need to work part-time (29 hours MAX) while school is in session. She said she tried very hard on my behalf and I told her I understood and went back to my work. 

Now I've never had a complaint from any of our users, always complete my projects on time, and worked my school schedule around working 40 hours here. It's very discouraging and I don't know what to do now. There's not a lot of IT jobs around here for people without a degree and I want this job for resume purposes, but I have no motivation to continue working here after this. Any advice on how to proceed from here?"

a few days in i was asked by my boss if i could go to the parking lot and get a Ipad that was left in one of the patrol cars so we could put it in the rack for the night. on my way back in again the card reader outside would not read my card but one of the people on smoke break was just a few feet away so i asked them if they could open it for me. one of the guys there then told me that the reader almost never worked but for some reason that reader also had a bar code scanner right beside it. he then proceeded to put his pack of smokes under the reader and it unlocked. 

i was later that for some reason that they installed a different reader with a bar code scanner that was meant for guest passes but it was never set up right so whenever it detected a valid bar code it would open.

the parking lot itself had gates with the normal scanner plus a extra scanner for a RFID brick on the key rings so it was never considered a security risk by the management."

So I'm definitely in a bit of a situation right now. A few weeks ago (early September), I was told by Company A that they would not be able to make a hiring decision until October 1st and I would have to wait until than. That same day, I was offered a job through an internship by Company B, that will last 3-6 months and possibly full-time after. A few days later, I said fuck it, and I accepted the offer from Company B, assuming that I wouldn't get the other offer.

Just yesterday, I got an email from Company A - I got an offer - as a full-time employee. They want to hear back in a few days, but I've already committed to this internship. My question is: What are the chances I can push back my start-date for Company A until after I've completed my internship (3 months). More background - Company A wasn't actually ""hiring"" per say - I ""applied"" through their ""Contact Us"" page and happened to get an interview out there (quick lesson - when it comes to job hunting, nothing is off limits!). 

My background is mechanical engineering, and the skills I would get at Company B in the internship would ultimately help at Company A. More background: I signed an offer letter at Company B but nothing else - don't think it's ""binding"" - would definitely burn a bridge though.

First time posting here, but would really appreciate any advice. What is my best option?

Made a TLDR at bottom.**


So I'm currently going to a community college in California and I'm feeling massively behind, overwhelmed, and stressed out. I took the placement test last year when I graduated from high school and I'm about two classes behind in math and one in English. 


It's barely the fourth week and I'm already struggling in math. The professor is old and doesn't understand English well, has a thick accent, and loses his train of thought a lot so I usually need to teach the lessons to myself (about 3 every class meeting) and I get even more lost. I've tried khan academy but it doesn't help much. I've gone to a school tutor but there's a 30 min limit per student and I usually need to have the lesson taught to me again. The first test is next week and I know absolutely nothing. Therefore I'm thinking of just withdrawing and waiting till next semester. My really depressed side just wants to drop out altogether, continue doing drugs, hope I OD, or be a NEET. 


According to my counselor, my major (Computer Sciences) will need around 3 years worth of classes till I can transfer to a university and another 2 for my general education requirements. The English and Math classes I'm taking at the moment don't contribute to my transfer progress at all and its making me feel overwhelmed like I'm wasting time and falling behind my peers. I took a year break from college after I graduated HS as I was dealing with anxiety and depression but this realization of how far behind I am is making me fall into old thoughts of rumination.


There aren't many classes I can take as my major classes require calculus as a pre-requisite and my general education classes need college English. The classes I could take were already full when I was allowed to enroll. 


I really wanted to transfer quickly while I was young so I could have that college experience of being young and living in a dorm and stuff. Now it seems like I won't transfer till I'm 23, when I'm old and won't fit in with the crowd. At this age, people that went into my major will probably be graduating from college already. I don't think I'll graduate till I'm 25, and that's not even with a masters. I don't know how I'm suppose to get an internship either. The opportunities are severely limited at a community college and I haven't even taken an introduction computer course.


Eventually, this constant stress and anxiety began driving me insane to the point where I couldn't get out of bed or enjoy a day without a panic attack so I started drinking more, abusing adderall, and engaging in risky sexual behavior often. I want to be clear, I don't do it to feel good, I do it to feel less bad.


I started Lexapro about two weeks ago but I still feel terrible. I'm honestly at the point where I just want to overdose on cocaine or heroin or some shit so I can finally die. Not sure if this matters but my dad has no idea what's happening with me right now and I don't plan on telling him. 


**TLDR: How to overcome feelings of being overwhelmed, full of anxiety, and feeling behind in college?**"

I have been given an opportunity to work an internship with a family member in an IT position at the company he works for, but I honestly don't have much, if any, experience in the type of work I'll be doing. 
A few of the things I've been told to look into:

-Learning how to run and manage multiple containers so they can 
test their software on several instances at the same time with ease.

-Look at transitioning the company from physical servers into a serverless option, like Microsoft Azure.

-Figure out how to build a separate development domain with it's own trusts and segregated network subnets.

Those are a few of the main things. I should say that the company has a contract with Microsoft and prefers to use Microsoft software for everything they do. And I've done some research and prepping, but most of the info I've found on containers is Docker and I haven't been able to personally do much testing with it myself. Other than that, I've started trying to work with Powershell and I would like to start working on a Microsoft Certification, but I'm not sure which one would yield the best benefits for me at this time.

I interned at a Big-4 two summers ago and a selective start-up (not a Unicorn, but growing very fast and well-known name). 

I've never been exceptional at algorithms. I'm not *terrible* but I definitely am NOT good enough to get a job at these top companies. I've gotten ridiculously lucky in my interviews the last two years. 

For the Big-4 interview, I crammed leetcode and CTCI questions a week before the interview. ALL of the problems in the interview ended up being problems I had seen or done before. None of them actually tested my algorithms skill; it was just a matter of recalling what I had done a few days earlier. 

It got worse for the competitive start up. I went to the on-site and straight up bombed one of the interviews (took an incorrect approach and algorithm did not work). I later found out that the question was a Leetcode medium. I did okay on the other interviews but I was 99% sure I would be rejected. 

On the first day of the internship with the start-up, the CTO welcomed all of the interns. He talked about how they gave less than 1% of applicants offers and how we were the cream of the crop. I still remember hearing that and cringing, because i know SO many more qualified and smart people who didn't get that job, with my above-average ass taking their spot.

To further confirm my doubts, I didn't receive a return offer from the start-up. I received one from the Big-4 but that's because my project wasn't that hard, I just worked hard and delivered at the end.

And recently I've been interviewing for FT positions as well. Recently had an on-site with another good firm. Again, bombed one of the interviews, came out of it thinking I had no chance at an offer. When I say bombed I don't mean the interviewer had to give me hints to finish, I straight up didn't finish a problem again. But then I get the offer a few days later. What the heck is going on?? Is it just because i have the names on my resume now? Do people just trust that I'd be a good employee?

I was recently discussing some interview questions with a less-successful friend of mine. He's interned at some crappier companies, striking out at Big-4s and Unicorns. He's absolutely better than me at algorithms - he's actually able to solve problems on the spot. So it got me down thinking I'm just a big fat phony who's lucked his way through internships. It's been bothering me and makes me kind of sad. Hopefully it's just temporary as it's been on my mind for the last few days.

In addition to that problem I don't even know what kind of salary I would be getting or should be aiming for. Should I just ignore my graduate degree and look at normal entry level jobs?"
71omcq,3,2017-09-22,[Southeast US] [Elementary] - I apparently failed student teaching before I even started,thatbitchprinny,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/71omcq/southeast_us_elementary_i_apparently_failed/,"Hello, this is my first time posting but I browse this subreddit quite a bit and it’s been really helpful to me.

So this is my situation. I’m a early childhood education major in my senior year and I’ll be student teaching in the spring. Right now I’m in what my school calls internship 1 in a kindergarten class (not my preference). We had the choice to stay in our placements for the whole year but I already decided that I was moving back to my hometown to student teach so it has nothing to do with this. Anyway, today my cooperating teacher pulled me to the side and basically told me if I was student teaching with her, she’ll fail me (I honestly think this was just a scare tactic but I’ll continue).

Her main concern is that I lack initiative. Which I understand and I do as much as can but I feel like it’s kinda hard to do with my situation. I’m only there twice a week and everyday she has me do something different so, yes, sometimes I just wait until she asks me to do something because I don’t know what she wants me to do. Plus I feel weird just touching and doing stuff in her classroom on my own. I feel like I’m invading her space. I don’t know but if someone came up in my space acting like they owned the place I’ll be annoyed, but maybe that’s just me. I feel like this would be so much different if I was in actual student teaching when I’m there everyday and actually know the routine and have times where I’m running the class by myself (her or the para is always with the class). Another thing is, she said that I should move around to different tables during group time instead of staying with the same group and that makes sense, but I would rather just focus on my one group until they understand (plus there’s 2 other people in the room so I feel like I don’t need to do that). Sometimes I like to sit with the students are carefully observe them before I give them any feedback so I feel like she thinks I’m just sitting around and daydreaming. I feel I’m like this with classroom management as well. I still need some work on it but overall I just think I’m not as strict. She probably thinks I’m ignoring the issues, but I personally don’t see them as a big deal. I mean, I’m not going to let them get away with anything major but I just don’t feel I need to talk to them about every single thing especially with the 2 other teachers have already said something. Seems redundant. I generally don’t like to talk more than necessary.

Another thing she brought up was how the students don’t call on me or don’t seem to bond with me which I don’t really see as an issue? I’m only there twice a week for a semester and I’ll never see them again so I’m not expecting them to form to grow super fond of me and I don’t care if they do or don’t. And a couple of students do call on me and express their fondness so I’m not sure where she’s getting that from anyway. She went on about how I should talk and encourage them, which I obviously do when I’m working with them but she gave examples like at while they are playing at recess or at lunch like “Oh look how good you’re running” and “Your lunch looks good today.” I’m like what? They’re playing and eating, let them do them. If they come up to me and start talking I will respond back but I don’t chat with the students all the time outside of classwork and I feel like I don’t have to?

 But that’s probably me not meshing well with this grade level. I already knew from my first placement in pre-K that upper elementary was for me. I had a 4th grade class last spring that was wonderful and we grew really attached and I was there for less time. I find it easier to talk and form bonds with the older kids. The kids are really sweet and I do like working with them in small groups but overall I don’t like teaching kindergarten. So I don’t think I have trouble forming relationships with students I just do it differently than what she expects, I guess. I feel this is where most of the trouble is coming from. I just have a different personality from her. I’m introverted and naturally quiet. I’m a listener and observer mostly and do come off a bit lonerish lol. And I think she expects me to act a certain way since she then went on to talk about her other student teachers who were so great.

But at this point I’m rambling lol. I just wanted to get this out and ask for some tips and if maybe someone has dealt with something similar. I was a little bummed out but I do appreciate what my cooperating teacher said (she’s about to retire and just won teacher of the year for the district so she’s good) and will take some of her critiques in mind like moving around in class more. Not sure how to deal with the issues that come from my personality though.

Let's say it's been 6 months. In brief, I have a masters degree and about 3 years of experience related to my field of study, closer to 5-6 if we include unpaid internships.
Now, I've had zero luck with my applications so far, and I keep being told to expand my search and try for different types of jobs. I also keep hearing stories of people applying for 20+ jobs a day, while for me, finding about 5 ads that match my background and fit my overall idea of what I'd be happy doing is a huge success. It's probably good to mention that my degree comes from a tiny university in Eastern Europe, where I'm from, and I'm currently living in the US. 
Anyways, my question is, how do you expand your search? The only thing I've come up with so far was to lower my criteria, and that's led me to apply to a few administrative assistant jobs (still no success). I guess the time and effort I put into my degree make me feel like lowering my standards like this is a major failure. 
Any advice for how to get out of the rut?

This is the first time I've made an alt/throwaway account. Some of the folks I work with recognize my handle and I'm not sure I want anyone to know what I'm going through.

Not yet at least.

Like most people here, this is something I've dealt with since at least middle school. My grades started to taper off when things got too complicated or uninteresting, but I'm smart enough naturally that it just worked out.

Took six years to get a four year degree in computer science. Never made much headway in any of the jobs I've worked. Hell, I was an intern for three years while I was in school.

You would think I would have realized something was legit wrong before now. But no, not with the very anti psych mindset my parents had and tried to instill in me, and not with everyone else assuring me how smart I was. I just needed to try harder, gosh darn it!

Ugh, we've all heard that before.

It wasn't until I seriously watched my programming co-workers that I got suspicious. How could they just pop on headphones and get in the zone for hours at a time? Why was that so hard for me? Any combination of focus techniques wasn't making a difference.

Thank God I'm a charmer, I guess.

My wife and I have been talking to a therapist. Most of our issues are coming from me, my inabilities to plan, focus, remember, even listen. The therapist asked me point blank if I'd seen anyone about it. Of course not. It came up again and again for a few months.

Finally, I pulled the trigger and talked to a psychiatrist. He made it sound so obvious - well yeah, clearly I have some ADHD stuff going on here. That alone was a relief, to hear someone qualified say ""you need help being the best you you can be"".

I've been on 5mg of generic Adderall XR for two weeks. I haven't noticed much improvement so far, but that is a very small dose. Mostly, I just feel relieved. A huge weight 27 years in the making is gone.

I start 15mg of the XR tomorrow. I'm nervous about how different the larger dose will be. I don't want to ""zombie out"" or not be me anymore. On the other hand I'm sick and tired of not being everything I can be.

So bring it on Friday, I'm here to start kicking ass. (And crossing off todo list items.)"

The pay was half of what interns at other companies got and similar to cleaning jobs. The first 3 months I was doing great and was highly motivated, despite the shit pay. Then my grandma died and I got really depressed, I started going out &amp; getting drunk every night, came to work late, hang over and was generally not doing my job - missed deadlines, postponed everything, couldn't focus, wasted time on Facebook. This lasted for 3-4 months, my team mates were obviously annoyed with this, but my manager was quite passive, we had a talk about it and that was all. 

I eventually quit because even though I got over my mourning period, and was able to focus again, I just couldn't handle the low pay anymore, was behind with most of my tasks and lost credibility. It was easier to leave and start over with a clean slate, so I took the first job in a good company that offered a salary good enough to be financial independent and not rely on my parents anymore.

One year later, now I am job hunting again and I randomly met a former manager who was happy with my performance while we worked together. She told me she met someone from my old team at company X who gave her really bad feedback on my work there and that I should think about the impression I leave on people.

For sure, whatever bad thing she said, it was true. I know I was a slacker. But that was just then. At my current job I'm doing great, constantly receive appraisal and recognition for my performance, going the extra mile and so on. I want to get a new job because I'm getting comfortable here and I need a challenge. This time I am not running away from anything, things are very different from a year ago.

I'm worried sick some recruiter or hiring manager will do some research and have someone at company X give (rightfully) bad feedback on my performance there. What should I do about it in order not to have my current job hunt affected by this? I cannot change what I did, I cannot tell in an interview I am useless if somebody in my family dies, and I obviously cannot go back to  my ex-colleagues and tell them to lie about my performance, should somebody ask about it...  Please help me with some advice."

71qud4,4,2017-09-22,More hospital shit and food shit,bullshittedthrowaway,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/71qud4/more_hospital_shit_and_food_shit/,"With my disability I'll get stays in the hospital maybe once every two months. Haven't had one in three months and now it's.. ugh. I've been in the hospital and my mom just brought me my tablet. Otherwise I've just been napping from medicine, watching hospital cable TNT and HGTV -- the homes are pretty great so I'm not mad.

I have different rotation of nurses since they have interns. They are nagging me to eat and all. Last night I got small cup of ensure, cup of milk, then water, mashed potatoes, mashed vegetable goop, soft cooked ham and then this soup stuff with bread. That's a lot of food to me. I did eat the bread because it was right in reach, it took maybe five minutes. I got two tiny bites of ham, that took a minute. Then I stopped eating to let it settle in my gut. Two nurses came in to set my food pace to make sure I ended up fed and one held a spoon to my mouth, with a giant impossible bite in it so even more overwhelming.

Today a nurse aide brought a tray with like a small cup of milk, cup of juice, cup of water, oatmeal, small applesauce, then two pieces of bread with soft salami and butter on the side. I got a few bites of oatmeal, a gulp of juice, most of the applesauce. Nurse aide came back in, asked me ""What's this? You're gonna need more than that to eat."" She started buttering the bread for me and then stirred what was left of the oatmeal, and she was pushing me to eat. Man, that was a lot of fucking food all at one time. Guess they're trying to make sure I ate. Probably have me on a schedule.

So since I haven't been eating, an RN - big boss nurse - just came to feed me a solid shake, which is like baby food but with a diet shake taste to it so it's not delicious nor shit I guess. I've had her a few times and I'm more familiar with her and she kind of knows how to work my sensitive side, so I let her spoonfeed me until I couldn't take any more. Ended up eating at least half of what she had and I was cooperative as possible and it was alright. Then she kind of pissed me off. When I stopped taking food, it's because I needed to take a break and lay there and settle my gut. She took it as me being uncooperative and started trying to tool with me, was putting a water cup to my mouth to maybe induce my appetite by drinking, she was urging me to open for another bite like peer pressure. Started massaging my gut and sugaring me up to take more food. I started feeling bad.

Ugh.

Helicopter mom is ready to raise shit over this. She said she's going to have to teach these new nurses how to deal with me."
71r6eq,6,2017-09-22,Hello! Looking for career advice! What path would you recommend?,Le0ndar,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/71r6eq/hello_looking_for_career_advice_what_path_would/,"Hello!

&amp;nbsp;

I have a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and 3 years and 2 months of experience in QA Software Testing. I really liked the job I did - test products that the company periodically came up with for sale, Coffee Beans, Travel and Living, I liked the products more than the actual job of testing (websites, backend entries, product flow), and I enjoyed ""client"" communications (I worked in an offshore establishment) and within the team, as compared to the technical task at hand. Especially the few ""product"" meetings that we attended, which put the developer to sleep, but I totally enjoyed sitting there, understanding the nitty-gritties that went into product development.

&amp;nbsp;

So I was wondering if there was some path I could take into Product development? I am currently on a sabbatical, took time off work last April to sort some personal stuff, and to think about where to go. I'm ready to come back into action, and was wondering what would be the right direction to approach this.

&amp;nbsp;

Should I take a degree in Product Management? I couldn't find many on Quora apart from MBAs which a lot of people didn't recommend, quoting experience as a better candidate. I don't live in North America, or Europe (Preferred locations, I live in Asia), and I think higher education is the best way into these countries. I'm fine with any European or North American country, though I would love it if it were in America, or Scotland (LOVE the countryside!)

&amp;nbsp;

I'm also open to any other recommendations that you may have with respect to career paths, I'm pretty much open to anything. I don't have a ""this is how it is supposed to be"", as long as I enjoy the task at hand - solving problems, guiding a product through to completion, communicating with the team, having a good time!, I'm okay with pretty much anything, as long as it has growth and stability, from personal responsibilities point of view. I'm not particular about ""fast"" or ""slow"" paced jobs, any pace would do, as long as it was engaging, fun, and gave me enough to take care of my responsibilities and peace. Any other responsibilities that went with the job, like late night calls, sudden product disruptions, long weeks leading up to a release, and working from home on Holidays, are totally okay!

&amp;nbsp;

My profile summary is as below, what would you recommend I do? There are opportunities in my country to pick up where I left off, but the competition is stiff, and I am not keen to pick up with the same role, which is why I'm asking about the degrees/programmes, also I can afford to pay for them, plus I'm 27 and would love to get started right away with a move, but it looks like in order to do this, I will need either time (and luck, in my country, to approach this from a professional point of view), or a degree in the country of interest.

&amp;nbsp;

What would be some good degrees/programmes to pursue? Does the University matter? What certifications should I also consider? What are the opportunities in these areas (North America, Scotland, and Europe), like? Are there some other paths you would recommend to Product Management?

&amp;nbsp;

Profile Summary (Most Recent, first):
&amp;nbsp;

* 3+ Years of Total IT Industry experience as Software Tester in Agile/Scrum
&amp;nbsp;

* 1+ Years of Marketing/Client Communications in a Startup
&amp;nbsp;

* 6 Months of Marketing Internship in an Educational Institution

&amp;nbsp;

Feel free to ask for any additional details, will be ready to share!

&amp;nbsp;

Many thanks!"

There are 3 other programmers in the office, two of which are consultants.  After learning enough of Angular and their back end (C#, .NET CORE, Entity) to write useful in-house web apps, I've been offered a permanent position when my internship ends.

The pay and office environment are great but the company is so small that there isn't a structured training program. I had to learn Angular online (not so bad because it was on company time, not my own).  

Other programmers are available for quick questions but aren't really able to formally train me.

Also, because the company is so small, I work directly under the CTO meaning that there is no real opportunity for advancement.

Should I be concerned that I won't gain enough transferable skills to move elsewhere in a year or so? Overall I like the job but I'm worried about getting behind the curve."

I also wanted to have backup options to get in since I have a priority degree but I don't really understand how that system works.

I started out in IT at 19 (23 now), working at Geek Squad, doing store repair and then inhome, while I was getting my networking associates degree. I then got hired by an MSP through an internship for school. I worked there for two and a half years and after some crazy mistreatment and generally being tired of the toxic work environment, joined the corporate IT circle in more of a relaxed help desk role, that paid A LOT more than the MSP job that I was under-titled and underpaid at. That was two and a half months ago.  
  
Had a meeting with our network manager yesterday where I was told that my server and network talents were being wasted in my current role and that he's going to push through paperwork to get an administrative role (title negotiable) for me to take some of the keys to his castle so he can better focus on managerial duties and some of the bigger picture. I am elated at this news (although I am staying cool because its not confirmed or anything). I think im a pretty smart guy who has the ability to wing it and get shit done. I thought I was going to work here for a couple of years to grab some corporate experience and see where I could go from here, but with another potential 20-25% pay increase coming with this admin role if it all comes to plan, I dont have to go anywhere!  
  
Its just refreshing to see things change and actually work out in life, hoping that its all approved by may-june next year, I become a full sys-admin in a 200 user corporate zone. Its also super refreshing to have someone realize your skillset and want better for you, as you want for yourself."

I'm fucking proud of myself for earning that degree. But the experiences I took part in while earning that degree also made me realize I don't want to get a PhD and go into research.

So here I am with a decent understanding of higher math and general physics, but no real skills that were immediately applicable to the real world. After a year of failed job interviews and no-call backs, I realized I had to pivot and find something more applicable to get a job. So now I'm 10 hours into a 30 hour MS program in computer science.

But guess what, I'm a shit coder. I did a lot of self-teaching before starting my masters program, so I know HOW to code, but I still feel like I can't fucking code. Like if you sat me down and told me to code something, I would have no fucking idea where to start without having to do hours of research. Even the projects I've done for my masters program, I feel like I haven't come away from any of them with any real applicable skills.

I'm tired of working fucking 30 hours a week in a shitty service industry job just so I can pay for my masters program that takes up all my time outside of work. I've applied for tons of internships and entry level jobs in CS fields, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FUCKING SKILLS NEEDED TO GET ANY OF THEM. People tell me to just practice in my spare time on pet projects to hone my skills. But by the time I'm done with work and school, the last thing I want to do is MORE coding, especially when it takes me hours just to figure out how to get started. I NEVER LEARNED ABOUT ANY OF THESE FUCKING FRAMEWORKS OR SOCKET PROGRAMMING OR TCP/IP OR DEV TOOLS OR ANY OF THIS OTHER SHIT.

Physics was hard, but CS makes me feel like a fucking idiot. Everywhere I look there's 50 things I've never even heard of and ""simple beginner"" shit I have no idea how to even do. I HATE IT. I'm tired of working service industry, I'm tired of being poor, I'm tired of getting interviews because of my background and masters program, and then going into them and not knowing anything about anything they want me to do. I feel like I'm wasting my time and money in this masters program that isn't even fucking getting me anywhere. But it's the only thing even getting me job interviews so if I quit I'm just back to square one, stuck in my shitty service job that I can't stand working anymore.

Add to this the fact that every family gathering I'm having the same fucking conversations.

&gt;Family member: When are you gonna be done with school?!

&gt;Me: I don't know, it's taking a while because I have to work so much to pay for it and it's very difficult for me so I can't really take more than one class at a time.

&gt;Also family member: You shouldn't work so much, you're young! Enjoy your youth!

FUCK. OFF. What do you want me to move back home at 28 so I can save up more money? Eat shit. I've been working my ass off for the past decade and have nothing to fucking show for it. I'm just so fucking tired. I'm lost, and I don't know where to go from here. I feel like a piece of shit for being 28 years old and still not having any direction in my fucking life. I just don't know what to do anymore."

After a long day of classes, work and utilizing analytical-brain, I have to work on homework for four different classes - two are technical/scientific, two are in the humanities so they're very reading/writing heavy. It's not easy for me to drop from one type of work to the other, and for the scientific classes I need a good solid chunk of time to sit down and feel like I actually have time to work a problem out. There's nothing worse for me than not having enough time to work a problem out. It's like going pee and stopping half-way through. It hurts and is all I can think about until I can get back around to it again.

I don't really have a ""project management"" issue as I'm getting all the homework assignments turned in on time - but I don't have any time left for studying.

Some people have suggested I reduce my hours at work, but that's not an option. I worked hard to get this internship, and it's the kind of position I've wanted for the past 3 years. It's exactly the kind of job I want after I graduate, but I can't reduce my hours any further or I can't stay on.

I just don't know what to do. I have a prescription for concerta, but I have not taken it yet as I'm afraid of the side effects causing an issue that makes me fall behind (like panic attacks or something, idk). I don't even know if that would help at this point. I am able to hold my attention together for the most part through lectures and get some work done at work, but it's like doing push-ups. I keep doing push-ups (focusing) all day, by the time I get home I'm fatigued)."

I’m just not sure when to do an internship (would like to take over the summer). Should I try the summer after my junior year? I feel like I’d have no idea what I’m doing if I did it after this year.

I am a recent grad and have not yet been able to find a job. My university is having a career fair next Wednesday and I want advice on how I could stand out.

My experience isn't impressive, but it's..existent. But I do have a nice-looking resume if I say so myself. My experience narrows down to an internship that was primarily refactoring AngularJS code (wouldn't say I'm comfortable with Angular though..), a project with several other students working on a hybrid app (that went nowhere), and a project where I led 4 other students to design &amp; develop an (incomplete) Android app as our class project. Otherwise my coursework was focused in Java so that's my most comfortable language, following that is JS, HTML, CSS (&amp;SCSS) as well as Adobe Photoshop. What I'd love most is to be a full stack developer. 

Oh and I also happen to be painfully anxious the majority of the time and this is only amplified in settings such as career fairs with crowds of people wearing suits. Being soft spoken and insecure also doesn't help.

So with my experimental mess of experience and nervousness, what can I do to make a good impression at the career fair?"

so my whole life i've been told to study hard in school and I would get results. i did this and studied computer science at a top public university to receive a bs in cs. i graduated with a 3.5 gpa, performed computer science research, and even tutored over a summer. Although I never had industry experience (internship) i still tried my hardest in research and teaching.

However its been 5 months, 105 job applications, and 5 failed coding  interviews and i'm still unemployed. My classmates that would be partying, while I was writing my research thesis, all got jobs after college at banks. these classmates would skip class, copy off of github, and got bas instead bs degrees. But yet here they are making 80 k living life while I live life in my moms house. The only diff between us is they had an internship the summer when I was tutoring. What is going on ? starting to loose hope that I should even try hard anymore. after all they didn't and still got farther ahead than me....

The good things about this job: Able to do homework all shift as much as I want, pays $12/hr. 

The bad: It's boring, and it's 18 miles away and a 30 minute drive from my school + 10 minute walk. So that's a total of 3 hours and 40 minutes per week of commuting. I also work alone so there's not really anyone to talk to or anything.

I've been offered a job at the university and I'm not sure if I should take it or not.

The good: It's on campus so those ~3.6 hours of commuting are gained back. May get some connections of some kind/knowledge on internships and things from working in the university environment. May get more experience that is useful instead of learning nothing at my current job. Would save a lot of wear and tear on my car since it's got 270,000 miles on it.

The bad: unable to reddit/do homework the entire shift. Pays $11/hr instead of $12. I would have to actually do work and be busy the whole shift.

A little background on me. I just started my IT career path this year with an internship, received through my community college, at an office shadowing their IT support team and learning (such as reimaging computers and helping out with day to day activities). After my internship, I tried getting another help desk job in an office setting but had to settle for a call center environment which really helped me on talking to people and what types of questions to ask during troubleshooting. While call center is not were I really want to be after months of searching, I was able to get hired for Helpdesk tech at a school district. While I will still need to take calls and emails this job will help me learn. My question is what are some things I should brush up? Some of the things in the job description ive never done before such as, Microsoft Exchange/Office 365 administration or
Maintain master computer images/updates and builds. Any advice would be welcomed.  Thanks"

I'm no expert, and my previous work history has consisted mainly of grunt-level work (Basic HTML and CSS, rarely JS). However, I've worked on my own, outside of work and classes, to learn more about JS, as well as both back end and front end tech such as Node/Express, Angular, even as far as building projects using Passport and learning about how that works. I guess sometimes it takes looking back at where you started to realize how far you've come.

I was extremely nervous after my interview. It was to the point of my anxiety flaring up and having some pretty serious emotions raging, because I've been shot down pretty hart more than a few times from positions that I really was excited to pursue. But not this time. Apparently, I was a prime candidate, to put it simply. It's an extraordinary feeling to know hard work has led somewhere.

So I want to extend my thanks to the community here for providing some feedback on issues I've had in the past, as well as offering some tips for interviews such as this one! And to the early devs that are in the same place as I was not long ago: **keep at it**. I also thought I was never going to ""get there"", I thought that a normal shmuck like me couldn't possibly reach that next step that seemed so far out of reach - but now I'm one giant step further, aren't I? So keep it up. After all, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey!

I graduated recently with no projects, no internships, no work experience, and a very low GPA (&lt; 2.5). In retrospect I pretty much wasted the majority of my time at my university, and other than some damn good friends and a degree in CS don't have much to show for it. I read through most of that thread and got a lot of insight out of it, big thank you to all those who posted in that thread by the way.

The top comment on that post said that I shouldn't look for a job not related to programming for my first job. However my family have been pressuring me to apply for other jobs other than programming, like in retail or being a restaurant server, mostly because I've never had a (real) job and they think I lack a lot of soft skills needed for a *real* job. I'm not in a bad financial situation so I don't have a need to have any job immediately to survive, and my parents make enough money to support me, but I don't want to stay unemployed and want to be independent from them. I think they also just want me to get a job as soon as possible regardless of what it is, because any job is better than being unemployed and it's also work experience. Also between me and you guys, I think they just don't like the idea of me sitting at home on my ass even if I am trying to be productive learning and applying for jobs.

I don't blame them honestly, I've admittedly always been very lazy, and despite me trying to be serious about finding a job I really haven't been serious, at least compared to many of the experiences I've read on this thread. I've been working on setting my mentality straight as much as I've been teaching myself skills I should've already learned through an internship and trying to apply for jobs. Anyway that's enough rambling on my part. What do you guys think? Should I look for and take a non-programming job for my first job? If not, how should I talk to my family about this and convince them that I shouldn't take just any job right now?

Thank you for reading all or any of that if you've gotten this far, and I appreciate any comment even if it's blunt criticism chewing me out."

I'm guessing it's because we need higher stimulation when it comes to rewards, so when we've fantasized about achieving some goal, we keep on bumping that fantasy higher and loftier even *before* we've actually done anything to make the initial fantasy a reality.

As a result, we either err on the side of wishful inaction or on the side of ""change everything at once and burnout and become disillusioned, thereby scaring you off from trying to make changes in the future...""


1. So I'm thinking that if you're on your way to glory or to improvements, **make sure you keep your daydreaming grounded in the realistic.** I'm not saying you should *settle*. I mean that you only move on to daydreaming about something higher when you've cleared the first step of the ladder. 


2. If you need more motivation with clearing that first step, then daydream and focus (oh, haha) really hard on other details about that first goal, other potential rewards or mini-steps... **Break it down**, use your imagination to make that initial goal as rewarding as possible and squeeze all the juice out of it until you've finally reached it.

What I mean is *Stay on task!* Stick to the relevant milestones, dammit! 

3. **Clear them and *only then* move onto your loftier goals** of publishing a bestselling series, winning the nobel prize, becoming CEO, marrying so and so, graduating college, having a clean room, showering regularly, etc., wherever you're at. 


Note: If focusing on ""lesser"", more immediate goals seems like sacrilege to your ambitious self, no worries. Those aspirations are still there, only now you're moving the stepping stones to *get there* to the forefront. 


* Just because you're paying attention to what's actually important and maybe a little less stimulating/boring doesn't mean you've lost out on all the great things you've imagined for yourself. Remember, if you ever want to live outside of your dreams, you have to accept the slightly less glamorous goals first. 


* In fact, achieving that ""lesser"" goal will always feel more rewarding than than achieving a major one in your fantasies; that's because that achievement is REAL and let's you know there's MORE TO COME, whereas while the fantasy is enjoyable, subconsciously you know none of it is really yours for real.


Examples:


* yes, figure out how to clean your room and do the dishes, visualize how great it would feel to live in a clean environment again ------------------ instead of ------------------- daydreaming about perfect house decor


* study for that test this week, visualize how fucking swell it would feel to get an A on it, knowing it's **yours*, you earned it for real  ----------------------- instead of dreaming about ---------------- 4.0 GPA, valedictorian, internship, perfect job, academic accolades 


* running 1 lap, visualize how nice it is to get even a tiny bit of regular exercise, knowing that you're finally on your way to establishing a semi-regular exercise regimen ---------------instead of ------------ daydreaming about becoming a Boston marathon participant, amazing bodybuilder, etc.

tldr; all that crap about taking ""baby steps""... yeah, it's probably a good idea to do that and pace yourself. Better to do it *slow and get it right and sorted out* then rush it, fuck up, and come up empty-handed (plus the damage of having put in effort + no reward? Yeah, who knows how long it will take before you muster up the courage to make another attempt to change things again. Believe me, you don't want any learned-helplessness contamination, or it could set you back a long while)

**Stop wasting time researching details about higher goals when they're not relevant and not plausible for you yet. Research the shit you actually need to move forward from where you're at.**

Well abroad, inquiry-based learning is what it is all about. I did my best to read up on the philosophy because I feel I had never really used it in practice, and my university only touched upon it. 

From the beginning, the teacher I worked with said I would be in charge of Math and Calendar from day 1. I was confident enough to say yes. When I arrived, we had two weeks left of school and so for a week I was looking at Unit of Inquiries with notes I had no idea how to read. I just felt lost and thought it would be cleared up once she arrived back. She arrived back to Germany one week before school started but we had no time to talk since there were meetings every day, all day about curriculum, school rules, their unit of inquiry, a unit of inquiry cycle. I also got hit with “You and the other intern will teach ESL one period everyday from day 1.“ I felt overwhelmed and I had no idea what I was doing that week before school started. She asked that I create a math calendar fast and look at the math objectives to come up with something. I did the best I could but was confused by what is added on to the calendar, and I had never created/used math centers. 

I think with the stress of living in a foreign country, not knowing the school layout with adequate time, not understanding the curriculum, I ended up breaking down after my lesson failed on the first day of school. I barely had time to think about how I even wanted to present. I felt she should have given me some time to observe and adjust to living abroad for my first time. I had wished I had at least a month to prepare with her. 

When I left the classroom after school crying another teacher came up to me and asked what happened, and I told her it was just all too much. She told me, ""You are not required to do this right away. She is only making you do math because it is not her strong suit. She will overwork you and you shouldn't let her."" I had no idea what to say and I was just crying and in tears. She takes me to her classroom and next thing I know she brings in my co-teacher to basically argue with her. I was in the middle of a horrible situation. 

Skipping forward, when I spoke with the principal about possibly leaving because I was overwhelmed. She said the same thing, ""I want you to take time to adjust and please don't feel like you need to do what she is telling you to do. You are an intern and you are learning our curriculum. I am fine with you observing for as long as you'd like. To be quite honest, she is having you do all of math because it is not her strong suit. I know you must feel like your confidence is shattered, but just know her way of inquiry-based learning is not the only way."" and a lot more...

Well ever since that incident, she has been quite rude to me, and belittles me. She will say things like, ""I just said..."" or ""I feel like when I talk to you, you don't listen"" I honestly fear her A LOT. I try my best to do what I can and I am always working. I just don‘t know what more to do. I began giving lessons and taking more lead with some matters. She is going through health issues she won't discuss with me, and so I sub a lot for her and will continue to sub for the rest of the year. 

My situation at home with my roommate is also strange. I work with my roommate at the same school,  and we are the only single co-workers. I depend on her a lot to make friends or someone to hang out with. She stopped inviting me out and wont even greet me at all in the morning or when she comes home. She hasn‘t said a word to me all week. I know I am a good roommate with cleaning and buying supplies that are low. I don‘t know what it is.

I just feel so alone out here, and work is really stressful too. There's a 9-hour difference so it is hard to call my parents or boyfriend back home. I just feel like things would be so much easier if I went back home to my comfort. I am not sure what to do at all. I go home a week to visit, and I know it‘ll be the hardest thing to leave again to a place where I feel alone, and situation at work and hom are shitty. I don‘t see it getting any better. 

TLDR: I moved abroad to teach as an intern at an international school for a year. My situation with my co-teacher and roommate fucking blows and I honestly don‘t see it getting better since it hasn‘t for a while. I cry so often. I just feel like it would be easier to go home to my comfort, but I am not sure what to do at this point.

71yt9x,10,2017-09-23,Is going back to school for a masters worth it?,IsItReeallyWorthIt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/71yt9x/is_going_back_to_school_for_a_masters_worth_it/,"Thanks for taking the time to read this!

Some background info on me- I graduated last year with a major in CS with an okay gpa (about 3.4). Since then I have been working as the sole developer at a slightly dev focused company (they have been starting to expanding their software).

When I was in university getting my bachelors I got burnt out by the end so I decided to work for a bit before going for a masters. But now that I have been working for over a year I am not sure if it even makes sense to do this. The program I am looking at is 2 semesters full time studies and 2 semesters internship. It offers an optional focus on data science. It is at a tough school, the one where I did my undergrad so I know first hand how easy it is to get burnt out there. It really does seem interesting to me but I am confused as to whether it makes sense to go back to school at all.

So I guess my situation is that I am scared to do my masters because of my undergrad experience but I am also scared of not doing it because there are so many people coming into our field that I fear a masters will eventually be necessary to work as a dev. 

Any thoughts/help in this situation will be appreciated!"

I developed depression and started to cut for attention, but no one cared. Teachers, parents, most counselors all told me to ""get over it."" I went to therapy myself and stopped the cutting.

Moved out at 18 to get away from the yelling, and I ended up with an emotionally abusive ex who physically abused me, almost killed me.

During this time, my siblings hated me for leaving and stopped talking to my dad because he killed our cat in a drunken rage. It's been 7 years since they spoke.

I left that abusive ex and partied for a bit. Ended up with a different boyfriend. Got my shit together and worked my ass off to get straight As, an internship and still serve at a restaurant. 

The internship proved amazing at the time and hired me based on my project. I was one of the only people in my county who performed my type of work, which benefited them. I basically started my own department, but i was severly underpaid because i didnt have a degree yet.

Then I fell out of love and bored of the bf who was kind but very controlling at the same time. I had one night with a coworker on a trip that changed everything. I fell hard for him and began cheating on the bf. The bf found out and falsely imprisoned me in my home for hours which screwed with my head for the past three years.

I fell into a deeper depression and began not taking care of myself and barely functioning. I moved in with my current bf's family to get away. Then work screwed me over by giving me another woman's job responsibilities because my boss is a bitch who likes to keep people under her thumb.

I freaked out and quit two months later on a trip to Europe. Then i didnt work for two years and only went to school. My depression got so bad that i wanted to kill myself, so my bf told me to go back to therapy. I have for the past year and a half. It helped.

I felt good enough to go back to work, so i did for a bit, but the job was insane as well. They micromanaged more than any other company ive ever seen.

During all this, my mom's and grandma's home are being forclosed on which i'm trying to stop through loan modifications with my aunt. And my sister was raped last month and had her car vandalized twice because the perpetrator lives next door, and she reported the crime and filed restraining orders.

The saddest thing about me is that the shit just piles on in my life, and i think i handle it the best that i can. But the circumstances are always catastrophic most of the time, not just in my perception. I can't wait to have a normal life and not have shit with my family or abusive shit from my past creep back up into my life."

Living on campus, I'm put into a room with a classmate from the same major.

This kid was as great roommate, but he did a lot of dumb shit with his personal computer. There was some issue with his old case, so instead of replacing it, he just laid out all the equipment on his desk and ran it that way. Motherboard, hard-drives, everything was just open on his disk. I once caught him sticking a key into the motherboard, and after asking what the hell he was doing, he explained that it was how he turned it on. The key completed the circuit and sent the power-on signal.

I cringed so hard at this and wrote it off.

Fast forward a couple weeks later, I get a call to the library regarding a computer that won't turn on. I get in there, hit the power button and nothing. Disconnect the power cable and press the power-on again to clear any charge, then reconnect and try again. Nothing. I thought back to my roommate's apparent dumbassery, and figured, ""Why not?""

Opening the case, I disconnected the connection from the power button to the motherboard. Very lightly I used a key to jump the connection like my roommate had, and to my amazement, the machine turned on.

The power button had failed. We got a new button and replaced it in minutes, returning the unit to service.

""If it's stupid and it works, it ain't stupid"" had never made so much sense to me..."

Sorry for creating the zillionth post like this- I am just so lost as to what to do with my life and am getting increasingly nervous about it by the day. I would really love any advice or ideas! (Plus I just wanted to rant a bit...)


I'm one of those people who loves academia and college, but maybe isn't cut out for the real world yet. I have a BA in History and Masters in Teaching (social studies). I did pretty well for myself student teaching 7th grade (my mentor teacher said I was one of her strongest and absolutely have what it takes-and she's had 7 other student teachers) and got a job in a very competitive district before I even finished practicum. So I left student teaching early, started working, and graduated in December. Promptly had a total mental breakdown and barely made it to the end of the year. The lack of work-life balance/behavior management problems/being in such a public position really exacerbated my anxiety and depression and made me almost scared to have any job ever again for awhile. 


I was so desperate to get through the remainder of the year that I never even thought about what to do next until June. Started applying to internships and assistant/entry-level program coordinator jobs at non-profits and associations and didn't have much luck getting interviews. A couple weeks ago, I ended up taking a temp-to-hire position at a title agency. It's not a bad environment and I'm doing fine-but I'm making 14/hr in DC. If I do get hired (which I think will happen eventually) I'll be making 35,000-38,000 which sounds nice but doesn't go that far in this area. Plus there's only so much room for growth- I'm answering phones, doing data entry/organizing files, and e-mailing/scheduling with clients. The low level of skills I'm using right now has me really nervous about where I'm going to be five, ten years from now. I'd like to feel more secure in my future career, but I don't know what direction I should pointing towards. Plus I worry that being out of school almost a whole year and having two totally unrelated jobs is only going to make things more difficult for me.


to sum- I have very little direction in my career path. What are some steps I could take from here? "

7213zd,1,2017-09-23,[LONG] Last semester in undergrad. Which of these paths should I take?,Loverofgaming,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/7213zd/long_last_semester_in_undergrad_which_of_these/,"Sorry in advance for length.  

**tl;dr** Current job sucks. Should I pursue grad-school for Computer Science? Do I pursue a graduate certification in Information Assurance? Do I stick it out with my soon-to-be-had Harvard Certification and work for FedEx and forget school? The earliest I can currently pursue a Master's in CS is Fall 2018. Also looking for book recommendations and other resources.  

&amp;nbsp;

To preface my question: I am turning 29 this year and my college life has been a whirlwind of what am I doing and what do I really want in life. This Fall 2017 is my final semester and literally I am taking 2 credits on campus and one 3 credit equivalent course online. For the past 4 months, I have been working a manual labor job where I install smart gas meters. This is a pay-per-install job, not hourly so my income is very unstable. Given as such, the more I install, the more I make. The utility company my company is contracted by tends to give everyone everyone else's leftover work. This means instead of having 10-30 jobs on 1-3 streets, we often get 1-3 jobs on 1+ streets. This naturally means a lot of loading and unloading my truck just to do a single job on a street and then hunt for the next job. At least twice a week, I get 20 jobs on 1-2 streets so those days I can do the full 20. I'm required to do 50 jobs a week. This job is hard on my body and often times I do not make what I want to make.   

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately..Fortunately? My current job IS paying my bills and rent but I am unable to save anything extra and feel lethargic both at work and at home.  

&amp;nbsp;

During my undergrad career, I have made many bad decisions. I went from Physics to Psychology, Psychology to Engineering Technology, Engineering Technology to Foreign Languages: Japanese. I will be graduating with a B.A. in Japanese. I left Physics because I didn't meet the requirements for Calculus, but my university didn't require me to take lower Math courses beforehand so I ended up failing. I returned as a Psychology major in an attempt to figure out what went wrong and what I really wanted. By the time I figured it out, I still hadn't gotten Calculus down. Engineering Technology offers a program where I could focus on software development or web development and receive the appropriate training, as well as the right connections, to land a job in the tech industry before graduating. The only thing was, I needed to spend roughly 3 more years in college. The problem was I had run out of financial aid and had no way to pay for those 3 years. I had just enough for one final decision: become a Japanese major and study overseas. I know, one might think ""oh studying overseas? But I thought you ran out of aid. Isn't that expensive?"" Yes, you're right. It's expensive. I had run out of aid for school in my state. My university is partners with some Japanese universities and offered scholarships to study over there. There were also general study abroad scholarships and special scholarships through other organizations AS WELL as a foreign language departmental scholarship if your GPA was high enough!  

&amp;nbsp;

I made the cut and landed a year in Tokyo for free and with money to spare coupled with a bonus scholarship available to me at said university that paid me a 70,000 yen stipend per month. This program fulfilled the remainder of my foreign language major requirements, leaving only 2-5 credits left for graduation. 

&amp;nbsp;

My job is so bad sometimes, I am unable to do anything but wait in my truck until a supervisor arrives on the scene. This means no money at all for extended periods of time. On my best days I can do 4-5 installs per hour (which equals an absurd amount of money). When I have to wait over an hour for a supervisor, that becomes 1 job over the course of an hour plus. That ends up being slightly above the $7.50 minimum wage where I live or right at it. 4 installs an hour is better than my friend who makes $53k/year before taxes. Some of my coworkers do 20+ installs/day no matter what. They're making way more than my friend is.  

&amp;nbsp;

During these wait times, I have been furiously researching on my phone while waiting for a supervisor. This led me to a reddit post about Western Governor's University's BSIT program. My CS friend recommended Treehouse and can get me a position as a Junior Developer at his job once I learned PHP, CSS, HTML, and Javascript. He might have mentioned one other, but yeah this is a viable path for me to take but one issue I've been having is being unable to practice/learn these when most of my time is working this job. That was when I found a local non-profit organization with the intention of improving my city's tech industry by training individuals in either coding or technician jobs via certifications prep coursework (A+, Project+, CCNA, etc). I chose the coding side. This is basically a proctored version of Harvard's CS50 course. Twice a week for 3 hours, we cover Python, C(Functions and Arrays/ Algorithm/ Memory, Pointers, Structs/ Data Structures), HTML, CSS, SQL and Javascript. Between 10 and 20 hours per week are expected to meet outcomes. Upon completion of the course, provided every assignment is scored at 70% or higher, we will receive Harvard Certification. Not only that, but the coding course is being sponsored by Fedex and ServiceMaster. Both companies will be offering paid internship, follow-up training and full-time positions as software/web developers/engineers. I am in the second course and know for fact that students from the previous course received this offer but only 4 actually accepted. Many of the graduates came to the conclusion that they didn't want a job in the field.  

&amp;nbsp;

I was able to line up my remaining classes to just on Monday so I can work Tuesday through Friday. My coding class is in the evenings so I am able to work and study without too much issue (other than generally being physically drained from work). Things are looking up right now but I am stuck with this job until I complete this CS50 course.  

&amp;nbsp;

One of my classmates in the coding course is currently a graduate student in Physics and clued me into the Assistantship program where I would be able to work towards a Master's in Computer Science for free.  
While not originally considering graduate school due to finances, I now have three options:  

&amp;nbsp;

**  
**1) Apply for graduate school in Computer Science and become a GA to pay for my coursework;**   

**2) Apply for the Department of Defense program where they pay for my Master's and then have to work for them in Information Assurance for every year spent on my Master's;**  

**3) Work for FedEx as a developer and receive tuition assistance from them while maintaining work;**  

**4) Try to get the GA position in school while still working for FedEx;**  
**
&amp;nbsp;

This is all still in the early phases: Get my BA in Japanese while also getting Harvard Certification by this December 2017.
Next phase is looking like learn/study Calculus and whatever other mathematics needed to get good.  
If I intend to enter graduate school, the earliest I would be able to is Fall 2018. Application deadline is sometime in May of 2018. So sometime soon I need to study and pass the GRE with a decent score. The score doesn't necessarily matter because I can leverage the Harvard Certification, experience in the field, etc to improve my chances of getting in as well as getting the GA position. Still, I aim to get a high score on the GRE.  

&amp;nbsp;

Side note: I live on my own and cannot move back in with parents to save money as there is no space and living conditions will not work out. I am about to move into a cheaper place closer to campus. Yes this place is cheaper than the dormitory options on my campus.  

&amp;nbsp;

My endgame is to work for a big software company.  
I'm looking for thoughts on what you all would do in my shoes given these options.  
While working for FedEx, I'll use resources like Treehouse to learn more languages and reading various books on the side.  

Any recommendations for books or resources or even other subreddits are greatly appreciated.

721b0h,1,2017-09-23,Looking for advice on what my next path should be finance/digital marketing/other?,KLKSHINE,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/721b0h/looking_for_advice_on_what_my_next_path_should_be/,"So I have had a pretty interesting career so far. I'm from the Tampa FL area. Just need to talk and get some advice. 

I became a certified personal trainer when I was 18 years old. Jumped from gym to gym to gym(for various reasons), before trying to become independent. I trained others for 5 years on and off. I never saw personal training as a career, just a job during college. I loved fitness and wanted to pursue a passion. I basically went as far as I could with personal training and never wanted to or had the means to do something like open a gym, hire other trainers under me, etc. 

I have my bachelors in Finance. I got an internship the summer before senior year and stayed a year with that company. They wanted me to move to Salt Lake City after I graduated and that just wasn't going to happen. I looked for other finance jobs in the greater Tampa Bay area but couldn't find anything paying above $18/hr and I was making $25 per hour personal training at the time. 

I ended up moving to Chicago for a year with my fiancé. Hated it there (sorry Chicago peeps). Looked into finance jobs but nothing stuck for me and went back to personal training and did ok while living in Chicago. 

Moved back to Tampa and tried pursuing software development. I just couldn't imagine coding every single day of my life, I wasn't in love with coding and knew I would never fall in love with it. 

I found Digital Marketing and I freaking love it. I have been freelance for over 4 months now and I am doing ok. Money is not consistent, I have to chase clients to pay sometimes. I looked into digital marketing jobs in the Tampa Bay area and its pretty bleak, like the finance market here. I get low balled from every job offer and I try to negotiate, I have read up on negotiation strategy. I often hear that my resume and my skills are impressive and than they low ball me and don't want to negotiate so it gets old after a while. I looked into remote jobs for digital marketing and extremely rare to find.

At this point I am focusing on building my own digital marketing business. But I guess at this point I worry about constant struggling. I have thought about getting back into finance but can't find anything here. Thought about getting into bartending or going back to school for something like nursing since basically the only high paying jobs here are in health care. I'm completely burnt out from personal training and will never train again. Not an option. 

TLDR Does anyone here have any insight to finance jobs or digital marketing jobs specifically in Tampa Bay? I'm starting to hate Tampa with a passion.

721ffj,1,2017-09-23,I'm desperately afraid of picking the wrong starting company... Am I being irrational?,DontLitter,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/721ffj/im_desperately_afraid_of_picking_the_wrong/,"I'm going to try to keep this quick, but I am very paranoid about being unemployable in the future. I'm a junior CS major looking to be a software dev. I go to a ""top"" school that isn't necessarily known for their CS program.

I'm afraid that, if I end up at a company with bad mentorship right after graduation, I'll be unemployable and totally fucked.

I've had two internships before and each time I wasn't sure if I was doing very well. It seemed like other interns were doing better than me. However, I was paid well and given a return offer at my internship I recently finished. I like this company, and would be interested in returning, but I do believe this is an important time to explore other companies while I can.

Therefore, I'm applying to other internships. I'm getting a decent amount of response but I feel for each company I can group their recruiting in one of two groups:

* Insanely easy interviews, so easy I question how shitty their software engineers are
* Insanely hard interviews, so hard I wonder how my peers do well in them/prep for them and still manage to find time to work on classwork.


I'm afraid I'm already getting behind/being doomed to work at a shitty company. I think this is partially irrational because I do have two internship offers in hand...

Any words of encouragement? Anecdotes? Am I alone on this?


As a side-question: Most companies interested in me are from the financial and fintech industries... I suspect this is because of my previous experience this summer (prop trading firm) + my college.

Found a great post on this sub, I'm sure some of you will recognize which one after you see my resume, and I'm pretty happy with what I have so far. In case you missed it, [here it is](http://www.lifeclever.com/give-your-resume-a-face-lift/).


Currently a senior in college, and the position I'm applying for is a Product Management Internship with a pretty huge company ($10b+ revenue per year). I have zero professional experience, but I've checked every box for what they're looking for.


What they're asking for:

* Min. GPA of 3.0 (preferred)

* Proficient in Microsoft Office software and Windows Operating Environment (Dead serious, I wouldn't have included it in my resume otherwise. Do I really need to include this?)

* Typical work includes market analysis, writing product specifications &amp; technical instructions, developing business cases, and sales training. Product Management touches many aspects of the business and offers variety in a fast-paced environment.

I am a Hispanic male in Southern Virginia who hopes to be a computer engineer. 

As for legacy, my brother is a computer engineer graduate, 2 sisters went there for engineering, another sister went there for teaching, and I've had 2  cousins go there. 

I have yet to take the SAT but what gets me worried is my grades and my extracurricular activities. 



Extracurricular: 
-For the last two years of high school I will have been in robotics (not in it yet)
-I will have maintained a job for 2 years.
-I will have been in spanish club for 2 years. 
-Looking to join other clubs as well
-Freshman year I did interact club but never actuslly did community service. 
-Did a lesson on computer info at VCU
-Partook in a programming competition at UVA and brought my school to the highest it ever was before
-Plan on doing national math honors society 
-Looking for an internship at my brothers job

I don't have any community service hours yet, but they will likely change for NMHS, I'm not in many clubs, and I'm not a captain of any clubs, nor do I play any sports. 
How will tech feel about this? I know my resume is lacking in this department. 



Grades:
8th grade: Art 1:A, World History 1:A, Earth Science:A, Algebra 1:A, Spanish 1:A.

9th grade: Biology Honors:B+, Tech Draw:A, Spanish 2:A, AP Human geography:A, Geometry Honors:A, PE:A, English 9 Honors:A.

10th grade: OK, here I developed severe depression and my grades tanked hard because of it, this year alone makes me fear for my future. 
Spanish 3:A-, English 10 Honors:A-, AP World History:B, AP Environmental Science:B, Algebra 2 Honors:B+, AP Computer Science:A, PE:A. 

I'm really hoping that my vigorous classes will be enough to make up for my lame grades(4 AP classes before junior year), and I'm hoping that my extracurriculars aren't THAT bad.



Upcoming:
Anyways, here's my junior year courses:
11th grade: AP Psychology, study hall, AP English, Trigonometry (not honors because the class was full by the time I transfered high schools) Chemistry Honors, Spanish 4 Honors, US History Honors. 

Next year I'm taking AP Calculus, AP Physics, AP Statistics, intro to engineering, English 12 Honors, US government honors, study hall. 



Finally:
Right now my GPA is a 4.16666 and after senior year, even with a couple of Bs, it should be above a 4.3.

With the challenging classes I will have taken (9 AP classes), a good SAT (I'm aiming for 1300, 700 math) , along with engineering and computer based extra curriculars along with an engineering class next year, how good are my chances? 

Personally, I think I will easily get into Tech but engineering is an ENTIRELY different story. 

Oh, also the 8th grade classes are highshcool courses and I also took Economics over the summer and got an A

One last thing, my counselor showed me everyone at my school who applied to tech in the past, and everyone above a 4.0 got in except for one person (4.1). We speculated that they were going for engineering, but I must preface that they will have had a lower GPA than I and they were only taking 5 APs opposed to my 9. I hope this can provide a frame of reference. "

For starters, I am a liberal arts (Law, Societies, and Justice) major entering my third year. I love my major and thoroughly enjoy what I am learning. However, I don't have a solid idea of what I will be doing once I graduate. I am not interested in law school but I am open to other postgraduate degrees/a masters program. Because of the pressure I have faced from myself and from my family about the ""uncertainty"" of a liberal arts degree, I am looking to expand my list of marketable skills before I graduate so I have a better chance of getting a job in a different field if that is what I need to do. I have heard good things from friends about working in the corporate sector as a consultant or analyst, but both of those jobs prefer people who have a business undergraduate background. However, it is too late for me to consider majoring in business, and almost every business internship or job related activity I can find through husky jobs is restricted to Foster students. Is there a way around this? Will minoring in business give me any sort of leg up if I want to work in business after I graduate? I'm down to my last two years so the pressure is kicking in to really make the most of the time and resources I have at UW. 

Alternatively, if you know of a specific advisor or department that would be able to address my needs better, please let me know. The last advisor I spoke to wanted me to focus on my love and passion for the liberal arts and not get too wound up in the pressure to be marketable, but I would really like a different perspective on this situation.

However, I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I have a ""working knowledge"" of a few languages, but I'm not really an expert in anything. The first 2 years of my schooling were primarily in Java and I feel like I had a pretty good grasp of it, but I haven't written a Java program since, and I feel like I would have to spend a lot of time relearning syntax and OOP. A lot of my classes since then were algorithmic or hardware/OS based since then and I've done a lot less programming in those. For those classes where I was programming it was all in C (C89), and while I feel I'm decent at it I usually do have to spend time resolving some pointer issues or have to google specific libraries/functions (especially anything related to I/O) so I'm not sure if i should pick C as my interview language. 

Meanwhile at internships I've had I've worked primarily with javascript and C#, and while I got up to speed on these really quick and was able to do all my work projects in them, I feel like I have a very narrow understanding of the languages as I focused on things related to the specific tasks I was working on.

Lastly, I took a free intro to python course online over the summer while working and enjoyed it a lot. It also seems like a really good languages for interviews as you have less stuff to mess with like syntax, static types, etc, but I don't know if I'm good enough with it to choose it either and it seems intimidating to choose the language I'm least familiar with to do interviews/projects in.

I would really appreciate some help with this!"

Every member of my family that is in that government agency are very well liked, and my dad was even a negotiator for the union. Basically, what i'm saying is, I have a lot of good family members on my side if I were to change my major to MIS and intern there for a summer.

Now my family will not have the choice in hiring me, but my dad feels like he could get a very good word in and possibly get me to land this high paying job a year or two out of college! This isn't 100% though.

Basically, should I change my degree from advertising to IT and work towards getting this job? It would put another year or two onto my degree, but while i'm doing that I could also get some certifications. Should I put my luck on getting a job through family connections, even if it isn't 100% ensured?

personally, software engineering looks yummier since it has coop in summer of year one whereas cs is not until year 2, meaning summer one is up to me to find my own internship. the other reason is its easier switching from software engineering to cs than other way around. finally, i want to transfer to MIT/Berkeley/GaTech computer engineering end of year 2 and software engineering covers physics/chem allowing that transition.

Worked for two startups since then, and am currently senior/lead engineer in the second one. Earlier I did not think much of a master's and considered work in the industry as the be-all and end-all. However, I've slowly come to realize that - a) I lack proper CS knowledge (the uni wasn't great of course, I screwed over my bachelor's admissions; it was the best choice I had at the moment after that screwup), and b) I want to make up for it.

I'm on the other side of 25 now, and I want to do the next few years of my life/career right. I've been flip-flopping between interviewing for big tech companies vs doing an MS (from hopefully a decent uni; because one can hope, right?) in CS (I'm interested in NetSec). I've been home-bound for most of my life due to chronic health issues, and things like that make you realize that you need to make the best of your time now, because who knows what'll hit you later.

With that fluff out of the way, I have a cumulative grade-point average of 8.27 out of 10 and am considering the GRE next year. I don't have research experience - only the work experience at two startups, one session of GSoC and one college internship leading a team to develop an app for a major service-based company. My possible recommendations could be -:

1. My boss, the CEO of the startup where I work at - he's a Stanford alumnus, has an MS in distributed systems, and graduated late last decade. Not sure if he still has any active connections to Stanford.
2. The associate professor (who is a CS PhD) from my uni who oversaw our app development work - we were chosen as the best in the uni, but I don't think that matters when applying to decent-to-top unis abroad (who gives a shit about some unknown college).
3. My GSoC mentor, who is a PhD in physics and runs an open source organization.

Given all this information -:

1. What should I be doing to make the best of my situation?
2. Is the cost to benefit ratio too high for an MS from, say, a top uni? I don't really have a ""special something"". I just enjoy consuming knowledge.
3. If my MS plans don't work out, I will have, for lack of a better word, ""stagnated"" for 2 years (2019, if I apply in 2018). What sort of plan B should I have - because I can't know my chances until I'm rejected. Perhaps I should be applying to companies where I want to work at anyway?

Note: I should probably add that while my uni wasn't good, the courses, subjects and syllabi were accredited by my country's higher education regulator. So I did a regular CS course with all the subjects one can think of: DS, algorithms, computation, architecture, compilers, etc."

I am having trouble deciding between two different internship opportunities this summer.  For background, I am a Sophomore student at a large school and my major is accounting. I want to go into public after I graduate and also get my CPA.

One (the easy internship) is a role at a bank working 40 hours per week, mostly doing bank telling and maybe some other small duties.  This internship is a for sure thing and is set up through a friend. The pay is about 9-10/hr and 40 hours per week.

The other is an accounting/finance internship at a large manufacturing company.  This is more of an ""official"" internship and I'm very nervous to do it.  I have done an initial interview with this company and have been invited to an on-site interview this Friday.  I am mostly nervous because I am only a Sophomore and just now starting my Intro to Accounting class.  I feel like I will not have enough knowledge to do well here.

I am currently doing a 1 year MS program (in CS) at the same school I did my undergrad and am miserable. Graduate school is not for me. 

The position they extended an offer to me for is a normal entry level position that does not require a Master's (it requires a BS, which I got this past May) and I'm not even 100% sure if they know I am pursuing the MS anyway. What they do know is that my plan was to finish up school and graduate in May. I'm considering dropping out of the program and then asking if I can start work in January instead of June.

Is there a possibility my offer gets rescinded? I know this answer probably depends very much on the company in question, but I would like to know what people think of the situation and/or if anyone has been there before.

TL;DR - Got FTE after summer internship for entry level position that doesn't require MS. I am in 1 year MS program and miserable. I want to drop out then start work earlier. Will I get the offer rescinded?"

I graduated in May from Stony Brook University with a BS in Computer Science. My GPA wasn't great, and I did not have any serious internships in college. I did work on multiple projects with other students, which I listed as experience on my resume. Honestly I'm a bit surprised at the lack of responses I'm getting. I'm wondering if it's a problem with my resume/cover letter or if I'm just looking in the wrong places. I'm getting worried as a lot of people I graduated with found jobs rather quickly.

How important is a good cover letter for entry level CS jobs? How long did it take you guys to get a job out of school? Did you intern with them before? What is some advice you can give me to get that first job? I'm currently teaching programming part time to little kids, somebody told me I shouldn't put this on my resume but I don't really see why not.

I'll post my resume if it's asked for, but I'm pretty sure I should just post it on the weekly thread."

I graduated school May 2016. From then until April 2017, I held two internships, one which lasted around a year due to two companies merging. I've had 3 in total. I was also working a retail job at the same time.  I'm currently 24. 

I went to school for fashion business management/fashion merchandising. My internships included a cosmetic company, and two creative agencies which represent talent in the fashion industry (makeup artists, stylists, hair dressers, etc).


I had a ""job"" trial in May - but it was awful and could not stay there so obviously did not add to my resume.


I plan to go back to school in the next 1-2 years for makeup. So, I've been searching for jobs to help me save and get by to reach that goal. I would be super interested in a job with another agency or a great makeup company too, even skincare. 

Anyways, I had been unemployed since May currently. On weekends I host a pub crawl for a company, and I picked up an after school nanny job as I've done that for 10 years also throughout schooling so was easy to grab a job with that quickly.


My question is, while I search for jobs, is there anyway to include the pub crawl/nanny jobs I currently hold so it doesn't seem as if I have not work since April 2017? What would you suggest?

728mgz,29,2017-09-24,A Cautionary Tale of Indie Studio Life,ZombieFriedChicken,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/728mgz/a_cautionary_tale_of_indie_studio_life/,"Hello everyone,

As many of us have heard, there are countless stories and report of game studio life as an employee being less than ideal. On the one year anniversary of my personal nightmare account on such an experience I wanted to share and get feedback on if this was normal, and to hear opinions on the situation, let's begin.

I am a fresh college graduate and know the workflow for game ready modeling and asset creation with very limited animation ability and obviously no industry experience.

Job posting for a local indie studio is seeking a 3D artist, generalist, but predominately modeling texturing, and optimizing for in engine use. Animaton experience is appreciated but not required.

After moving through the interview process (which lacked an art test) and doing some research on the studio things seemed pretty kosher. Studio had notable publications, had been in business a year, had a pretty decent website with promotional material.

At the in person interview, which included a tour of the studio, the first red flags sprung up. But naturally from what I knew about indies, as well as the adrenaline from possibly breaking into the industry, I glanced over them. The studio was one room with little beyond the desks. Benefits were ""being worked out"" but would be available shortly. Due to there being only the owner and one employee present I asked just how many employees there were. I was told there were 5 with some remote and others not in that day with more, including another artist being brought on within 2 months. (At this stage I was led to believe one of the remote employees was an artist.)

The first days went well, learning the bevy of new programs at my disposable as well as the general vibe of things. However there was no training for these programs I was very open about not knowing. I had a pluralsight login but was discouraged from using it at work (""you're not being paid to watch videos all day."").

I was quickly assigned to redesign a lead character in the game using the programs I had no training on. During the same time we met with one of the employees that ""wasn't in"" on interview day and it became clear they were more an intern than employee. What followed after meeting them was unsettling however as the owner proceeded to deeply criticize their work only after they had left. This would set the tone for the remainder of my experience.

Over the next weeks I was the subject of disturbing comments (mentions of ""helmets"" and ""being dropped as a child""), homophobic remarks (I am not homosexual but when said comments were made I never denied so) as well as my coworker in the studio with me (comments about ""special needs"" and physical appearance).

As this behavior went on I continued to work assembling a level for the demo that needed to be out in an extremely short, unrealistic timeline. Due to this being my first project on a demo that was being built from scratch and no workflow being in place at the studio, there were many a speed bump in progress. This led to huge tension as the already unrealistic deadline was compromised even more.

One day with the tension in the studio growing the owner felt it reasonable to hold a meeting where he informed us that the financial viability of the studio was in flux and that If we did not perform and perform quickly our employment could not be guaranteed. Following said meeting I was taken aside and informed that my progress was unsatisfactory and to ""step it up."" I was then told that I should consider not being a ""9-5"" employee and work overtime at home unpaid because I ""was passionate about the project.""

I rebounded from this and very nearly completed the level for the demo when one Monday we were informed that the level would be scrapped in favor of a new layout, simpler, but the deadline was not moving. (The rationale being that the level was simpler).

This level went considerably smoother, unfortunately studio life had grown all the most toxic as comments continued with comments that are extremely unacceptable leveled at a female
Intern after she had left the room multiple times.

Where tensions truly boiled over was when character work came into play. With the level nearly done it was time to move onto character work. Although I made clear I had little animation experience I was informed I would have to rig, animate (with the eventual help of motion capture) and lip sync all 3D characters of which there were 3 needed for the demo. This is an impossible task for any single artist in the time frame expected. No experience or years of experience. I set out to do as much as possible but began to air my skepticism and concern of how much was being asked. This was brushed aside by ""we have software and tools that do all this stuff automatically, you don't have to do anything."" (Ironically the results of tools we had were deemed ""unsatisfactory"" and required being tweaked to the point of almost scratch).

Finally the studio decided to release a video prior to launch featuring a main character. I was given a single day for this task, to animate the character by hand in the newly created scene, and prepare it for release. Due to program circumstances a rendered or in engine video was unavailable
In that time frame and it was decided from the top to use the viewport and screen capture out the video. I voiced my unacceptance at this as it would look less than ideal but told to proceed anyway.

The video was released to a scathing reaction (after the owner approved and quite frankly loved it). My punishment was to sit and read through the comments on the video with supervision before I was again taken aside and told that this was unacceptable.

My mental wellbeing had broken down over some time and I would regularly have panic attacks and breakdown before work fearing what the day would hold (profanity laden verbal lashings were not uncommon between silent treatments). Knowing just how unhappy i had become with my situation and feeling like I was trapped, I confronted the owner about all that was going on. As you can imagine my criticism was met by less than receptive ears where, as I aired my concerns in a professional manner, I was personally attacked, then ""demoted"" in front of my coworkers but was told we could in fact work past this. Until midday where without my knowing we had another meeting and it became clear we could not work past this and I departed with the largest sense of relief I have ever experienced.

I am happy to say that my awful experience did benefit me in that I was able to move further into the industry where things have never been better and I.... while I would never suggest anyone go into a similar situation, I would do it again to get to the place I am now.

Now that is a lot of reading so if you made it through I appreciate your attention and would love to hear back from everyone about the experience, theirs, and what not."

I'm posting out a slight urgency as time is passing and I'm not doing anything to help myself.  


I'm currently a sophomore in my school's CS degree (CS major with math minor, potentially double physics minor) and I'm looking to get an internship for next summer to get some experience as well as to hopefully earn some money. Don't really mind what the internship will entail as long as it's at least somewhat related. 


The problem is that I don't go to a top uni (just a state school, no real rankings), I don't have experience aside from just school (I still work a retail job to earn money lol) and I don't have many extra-curriculars (joined the CS club this semester but was only able to attend a few meetings so far). This means my resume is dry on all aspects. 


The only things saving me are my GPA (3.65 as of my freshman year and it's looking good so far) and I built a pretty bare bones website from scratch which also has a few random cs projects I created on my own time. (also plan on making YouTube videos for math, physics and cs)


What's the best way to secure myself an internship? I'm posting here because I assume a lot of you have had an internship previously or are going to have one up coming and also to gain some outside perspective. Is it best to go through my school through like a career fair? Should I be searching for postings on other websites? 


I'm kind of stressing at this point because I know some people are already securing their spots for the summer and I'm starting from scratch. 


Thanks for your time to the few (if any) that actually read this :)"
729t7x,0,2017-09-24,How do I convince my boss that goto is not good?,Sakuya_Lv9,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/729t7x/how_do_i_convince_my_boss_that_goto_is_not_good/,"So, I'm an intern, and I've been seeing `goto`s and `goto` simulations around the repository all the time from the same author that's my supervisor.

Here is what a typical Python function written by him looks like.

    def someFunction(cmd):
      exitCode = 0
      try:
        bar = doSomething()
        foo = doSomethingElse()
        if isShowHelp(cmd):
          showHelp()
          raise BreakException()
        if incorrectArgument(cmd):
          showHelp()
          exitCode = 1
          raise BreakException()
        actuallyDoStuff()
        print('success')
      except BreakException:
        pass
      return exitCode

In Lua, he would do this to simulate goto:

    function foo()
      while true do -- not actually a loop
        if cond1 then
          break -- exit the ""loop"", i.e. goto end
        end
        stuff()
        blah()
        break -- break no matter what
      end
    end

And of course in C or C++ he just uses `goto`.

What do you think, /r/learnprogramming? Is this an acceptable use case for `goto`, to substitute for the `return` statement? ""Single in single out is good,"" he claims. And yet on rare occasions he would make the mistake of forgetting to do `returnValue = foo` so that the `return` on the other end would result in garbage. I cannot come up with anything too convincing. Please help."
72aq6d,14,2017-09-25,"Want a ""break"" after graduation, not sure if it is a good idea... is taking a summer internship after you get your bachelor's a bad idea/how about a gap ""semester""?",bazongles69,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/72aq6d/want_a_break_after_graduation_not_sure_if_it_is_a/,"Hi y'all, this is a lot of me just writing thoughts out, so I appreciate if you take the time to read the messiness. Thanks.

I'm graduating from college in May 2018, so I guess a lot of things can change in between now and then, but overall I've been stuck on this and haven't really been able to find any advice on it from my peers, as they are as confused about their future as me. 

To give you some context I go to a pretty dang good university and have pretty ok grades and a pretty ok idea of what I want to do with my degree which is in economics. My current path is pretty much anything I can get in the energy industry or economic consulting, with several specific positions in mind. I eventually want to go to grad school, most likely for a policy-type degree, and later on teach community college much later in my life. 

Most offers, especially for a lot of top tier jobs, are getting decided right now. Same for a lot of programs I'm interested in, like Teach for America. In all honesty, one of these jobs/programs is probably the way I'll go but I have major reservations.

I am very frightened about a lot of unfulfilled goals I have after working full-time this summer. I like joking about how I'm a lazy person that was forced to be a tryhard. Reason is is because when I've had things easy I took them very easy and when things are hard (like right now) I put in what I need to do to not totally drown. It works alright and like I said I've done some goal-accomplishing... but as a result I have left a lot of things I wanted to do that got left by the wayside.

Here's a couple things, ranked by importance to me first:

* I have not done as much math here as I want. I mentioned I go to a top-tier university? The lower division math classes, a couple of which I need, aren't there to teach you multivariable calculus, they're there to weed you out. This isn't really a laziness thing; I just think it's a really horrible undergrad mill of a class, and the opportunity cost of enrolling in it is really high. I'm pretty sure I could succeed in the class, just at the cost of not taking 2 or even 3 classes I actually want to take and can have a lot of value to me.

* Writing. I've really enjoyed writing, creatively and non-creatively, and have gotten a lot of encouragement and success when I did write. In my major, I have never really been able to use this skill. In fact, it's almost useless. I really wanted to try my hand at writing some fiction, or even freelance writing, and never got to try it. I'm on a mailing list for a writing club, and it looks really fun... but I never have time for it.

* I'm not 100% on whether my resume is competitive or not. It seems okay enough; I got an internship with it at one point. However, I've only had that one internship and several jobs, I feel like getting another would round me out...

* This seems... weird... but I never really got to enjoy my hometown because I've never had a car. I've always had to inconvenience my friends because they've always had to give me a ride, or I've always felt super constrained when all my friends had their newfound freedom to leave the suburbs. I want to experience my hometown the way I should have in my teenager years... kinda silly.

This all leads to my plan I'd like to ask about: A gap ""semester"".

I take a ""semester"" off, take all the math I want at a community college starting September 2018 while trying my hand at freelance writing. During Summer 2018, I could round out my resume and work/life experience by getting another internship. AND I would still get a little bit of free-time before that post-grad, 9-5 awfulness, but not too much to make me really miss it. 

Cons I see to this plan: 

* I miss out on a lot of opportunities. Lots of companies want fresh grads. Not a lot of companies hire early in the year either, at least not a lot of the really competitive ones. Many programs, like Teach for America, only want recent grads as well. As a result, I might be stuck in a position where I have to take a year off... which I think opportunity cost-wise is not really worth it. 

* This plan is kinda janky and uncalled for. I've never heard of someone doing anything like this. It might make my resume seem kind of weird as well ""wait... you graduated LAST year?? What were you doing for half a year... Are you unemployable or something??"". My mom in particular would give me a lot of hell *especially* if things don't work out ""What are you doing??? You could have just gotten a job out of college!!"" 

* I might get kinda remorseful at all the cool things my friends would be doing while I would be working backwards.

* The opportunity cost of not working half a year is quite large. Yeah it might just be 10-15k or so that doesn't get put away... but down the line that is an extra hundred k in the bank for retirement. That is a big deal. 

Any thoughts at all would be appreciated, thank you :)"

I’m about to graduate in Modern Languages and well, in short I want to switch field and start studying programming. While studying I just realised that my curriculum sucked and that I could have studied a language with greater results abroad. However, my parents forced me to graduate so here I am.

I’m 23 now and my main point of reference is a friend I met in a study exchange (I’m from Italy and she’s from New Zealand). She also has a “funny” background in the sense that she didn’t study computer science but French, linguistics and biomedical engineering. She studied programming on the side, joining meetups and workshops and so on and she eventually got in a graduate programme for a tech company.

Before I keep going I would just say that **I did read the FAQ** and yes, **I understand that the mindset of someone asking “What should I do?” is wrong** in this industry. I would just like to justify this by telling you that, while I’m absolutely in favour of experimenting, experimenting does take time and I don’t have much of it. **I only have very limited time and I need to get results to convince my parents that I’m not wasting a year for my own convenience**. I did not study programming when I was a kid and I don’t have time to mess around. I will in the future for sure, but right now I’m pressured to get a certain set of skills in a certain amount of time. Of course I fully intend to come up with my own solutions to problems later on, but right now **I have an urgency: learn as much as possible the most fundamental skills required to land a job or get an internship in the most efficient way possible**. 

What this friend of mine told me was that studying programming in a university is becoming **less and less efficient** because you can learn more by yourself if you’re disciplined and that is even truer for me since I already spent 3 years to get another degree, especially because it’s a very open industry at the moment and **you can prove yourself with your work rather than a piece of paper**.

**What I want is trying to come up with a realistic plan for the next 8-10 months**. That’s why I wanted to ask you: what can I realistic hope to achieve in 8-10 months of serious work (say, 6-8 hours per day)? What should I be able to do in that amount of time? I know, these are just numbers and perhaps what I’m able to do in a day of work is not the same as what you would expect, but I’m trying to be as general as possible. **What should be my priorities**? What should I study first? **What are the most required languages in the field**? I would really appreciate if you could give me also a sense of progression – “first you should do this because it’s more important for this and this reason, then you should…” and so on and so forth.

What I thought was to go through one of the course from **freecodecamp** and then pay a subscription with treehouse and build some projects with them. I have saved some money so I may be able to pay for some courses online if it’s necessary (we’re talking about 700 euros). But well I don’t know if they’re worth it or not. I really loved how freecodecamp introduced itself, they train you and then you start working in real-world projects. Their premises look amazing, has anyone tried their courses? And I also liked treehouse because they said that they would help me develop my own projects to power up my CV, so that looked interesting as well.

Oh right for now as a general term I would really be interested in **web development**, the reason being that at least in my region people only use facebook to advertise themselves and there are so many realities which are unknown to even the people in the area, so I thought that by making interesting and easy-to-use web sites I would be able to show how many interesting things there are in my region. Plus I want to know how ads work to make a small amount of money to help sustaining these sites in general. **Basically I would like to use programming to get people out of the house, connect people together**. I think the Internet is an amazing tool but that people use it poorly, so I want to develop tools with which **people can rediscover ways to enjoy life and interact with each other**. 

For example we don’t even have a library in the city I live in, even though we may be able to use the rooms of the first floor of an abandoned school. Leaving all the practical problems aside (asking for permissions, getting the books and so on), what I feel is that people are uninterested in what happens around them and spend a lot of time on the internet. I went to Canada to study and saw that each small library had its own web site and would provide events, services of different kinds through the internet. People would know something was happening in their city, not by chance because they happened to see a poster on the street, but because they knew that their library would communicate with them online. Even just creating a website to explain the condition for the borrowing of any material would already be something, but of course I want much more than that. And well, I’m also extremely interested in making apps, eventually, for android. From time to time I come up with ideas with would be cool to make and so on and I know I want to get the tools to work with android as well.

I hope I won’t sound pretentious asking anybody interested for advice. I know I may get information from articles on the internet but what I really wanted were the stories, opinions, advices from **real people**.

**Thank you for your time**.

I’m about to graduate in Modern Languages and well, in short I want to switch field and start studying programming. While studying I just realised that my curriculum sucked and that I could have studied a language with greater results abroad. However, my parents forced me to graduate so here I am.

I’m 23 now and my main point of reference is a friend I met in a study exchange (I’m from Italy and she’s from New Zealand). She also has a “funny” background in the sense that she didn’t study computer science but French, linguistics and biomedical engineering. She studied programming on the side, joining meetups and workshops and so on and she eventually got in a graduate programme for a tech company.

Before I keep going I would just say that **I understand that the mindset of someone asking “What should I do?” is wrong** in this industry. I would just like to justify this by telling you that, while I’m absolutely in favour of experimenting, experimenting does take time and I don’t have much of it. **I only have very limited time and I need to get results to convince my parents that I’m not wasting a year for my own convenience**. I did not study programming when I was a kid and I don’t have time to mess around. I will in the future for sure, but right now I’m pressured to get a certain set of skills in a certain amount of time. Of course I fully intend to come up with my own solutions to problems later on, but right now **I have an urgency: learn as much as possible about the most fundamental skills required to land a job or get an internship in the most efficient way possible**. 

What this friend of mine told me was that studying programming in a university is becoming **less and less efficient** because you can learn more by yourself if you’re disciplined and that is even truer for me since I already spent 3 years to get another degree, especially because it’s a very open industry at the moment and **you can prove yourself with your work rather than a piece of paper**.

**What I want is trying to come up with a realistic plan for the next 8-10 months**. That’s why I wanted to ask you: what can I realistic hope to achieve in 8-10 months of serious work (say, 6-8 hours per day)? What should I be able to do in that amount of time? I know, these are just numbers and perhaps what I’m able to do in a day of work is not the same as what you would expect, but I’m trying to be as general as possible. **What should be my priorities**? What should I study first? **What are the most required languages in the field**? I would really appreciate if you could give me also a sense of progression – “first you should do this because it’s more important for this and this reason, then you should…” and so on and so forth.

What I thought was to go through one of the course from **freecodecamp** and then pay a subscription with treehouse and build some projects with them. I have saved some money so I may be able to pay for some courses online if it’s necessary (we’re talking about 700 euros). But well I don’t know if they’re worth it or not. I really loved how freecodecamp introduced itself, they train you and then you start working in real-world projects. Their premises look amazing, has anyone tried their courses? And I also liked treehouse because they said that they would help me develop my own projects to power up my CV, so that looked interesting as well.

Oh right for now as a general term I would really be interested in **web development**, the reason being that at least in my region people only use facebook to advertise themselves and there are so many realities which are unknown to even the people in the area, so I thought that by making interesting and easy-to-use web sites I would be able to show how many interesting things there are in my region. Plus I want to know how ads work to make a small amount of money to help sustaining these sites in general. **Basically I would like to use programming to get people out of the house, connect people together**. I think the Internet is an amazing tool but that people use it poorly, so I want to develop tools with which **people can rediscover ways to enjoy life and interact with each other**. 

For example we don’t even have a library in the city I live in, even though we may be able to use the rooms of the first floor of an abandoned school. Leaving all the practical problems aside (asking for permissions, getting the books and so on), what I feel is that people are uninterested in what happens around them and spend a lot of time on the internet. I went to Canada to study and saw that each small library had its own web site and would provide events, services of different kinds through the internet. People would know something was happening in their city, not by chance because they happened to see a poster on the street, but because they knew that their library would communicate with them online. Even just creating a website to explain the condition for the borrowing of any material would already be something, but of course I want much more than that. And well, I’m also extremely interested in making apps, eventually, for android. From time to time I come up with ideas with would be cool to make and so on and I know I want to get the tools to work with android as well.

I hope I won’t sound pretentious asking anybody interested for advice. I know I may get information from articles on the internet but what I really wanted were the stories, opinions, advices from **real people**.

I am currently in second year of Bachelor degree and would like to apply to some summer internships in big companies. I have 2 questions mainly about applications.

1. What do you do when you are not qualified for position? For example some internship positions require experience with Python. The point is that I have very small experince with this language and I am not sure if I should apply even though I know that I could learn python to required need after they accept me. 

2. How many appliacations per company should I send if number is not restricted? Some companies has software engineer in US, Canada and for example London. Should I apply to all of offered internship which I am qualifed and would interest me?

Thank you for your answers!

Currently in first post-grad full-time role. I had 6 offers and this was the 'best fit' from these, but some friends have it much better. I basically had no 'lag' period (my 'summer' was the weekend) between being out of school and starting work (was the same with my internship the year prior which also led to part time work and a full time offer). I don't mind this but it makes me wonder if I should've looked longer or at a different time.

I negotiated up from a 50k offer to 62.5k, but as an example, I have a friend who was offered 82k and most seem to be around the 70s. This is all in the same area. Now, my focus isn't all salary, I was more determined to get my foot in the door and becoming 'officially a SWE' but all throughout school all my peers would say ""I'm worth a lot"" and those same ones now are making more and I just feel like I've neglected something important / failed in a big way.

About myself: I'm always building / learning something new. Have more personal projects than I can count. During school, I founded a CS tutoring service, was president of my ACM chapter, won prizes at two hackathons(first place at one), and even organized one for my school. I have research experience, several personal projects, an internship, worked as an iD Tech instructor, and delivered products that are widely used every day. I feel like I worked really hard to do everything I could during this time and didn't translate it at all to my compensation. Even one of my friends who ""couldn't find work"" reluctantly joined a consultant service and is making 65k.

Now that I'm already here, there no plans to 'jump ship' without having a meaningful contribution in my current workplace -- I try to 'leave my mark' everywhere, but for those who are or have been in a similar position I wonder what would the best path be to get ahead, besides the obvious? 

Should I wait till my first large contribution to bring up salary to my employer? Should I just plan to market myself soon? I felt close to a Big-N once and would love that on my resume, am I overthinking things? Something else?

Thank you for reading this far."

I'm a 19-year-old man who's looking for an internship in Scandinavia, and it's a great oppertunity to get to know the countries better for future emmigration plans.

In september 2018 I need to go on an internship for half a year (September till February). Now, I am looking at three countries: Norway, Sweden and Denmark. It's for the study called Traffic Engineering. I'm studying it in The Netherlands.

I will do an intership abroad because I want to gain some experience in other countries and I really love Scandinavia. I also will have emmigration plans to Scandinavia in the future, so it would be a great first step to get to know the countries better!

In Norway, I've found a few great cities to have an internship: Bergen and Trondheim.

In Sweden there are a bit more cities, like Stockholm, Göteborg and Uppsala.

And in Denmark I think Copenhagen is a great city to have an internship.

How are the people in these countries? 

How are the countries politically? Are Swedes that politically correct?

Is Norway that more expensive than Sweden and Denmark?

* Discrete Structures (Set theory and other fun math for compsci things)

tl;dr: Recent grad looking for a data analyst position, some interviews but no success. Need advice on strategizing my job search and resume (and maybe interviewing too). Thanks!

(Resume Link: https://imgur.com/a/vM1Fa)

I graduated with an undergrad degree in May with a degree in  Economics and two minors in CS and Stats. I'm aspiring to become a data scientist but I realize that right now I need to find a data analyst job because this is what I'm most qualified for and it would be a good starting point to build my skill set and eventually become a data scientist.

However, up to now I haven't had too much luck with my job search. I get some phone interviews and then a bunch of second or maybe even third round interviews, and I got to the final round of a interview process with a data consultancy once, but nothing has worked out yet and I'm not sure if my hit-rate for hearing back after throwing my resume out there is good enough. I've probably sent out ~200 applications or so but I haven't been customizing cover letters much besides names and minor changes. 

Recently I've been trying to focus more on reaching out to people on linkedin for informational interviews and career advice and I'm working on setting up a personal blog/site to put up small projects on which would act as a portfolio. While I've gotten a lot of good advice from phone calls with data scientist (not to be underestimated), it hasn't really helped me in getting a job in a direct way.

Given my experience through internships and my technical skills, I thought I would have a bit of an easier time finding a data analyst job - I like to think I'm a solid interviewer most of the time too. It's been about 4 months now and I'm starting to feel a bit desperate and at a loss for what I'm doing wrong. Any critiques, advice, or feedback would be much appreciated. 

I also just remade my resume after wondering if my previous resume was putting me in the throwaway pile and I'd love to get some critique (my previous resume was was more unconventional/creative). The resolution may be a little low in the screenshot, it isn't like that in the PDF form.

Hopefully some of this discussion also helps other recent grads in my position who are lurking around here as well. Sorry for the wall of text.

This year I also started what we call a dual (or double?) degree in Business Administration and Management.

This is a one year course that I follow simultaneously on Thursday and Fridays.


I already did three internships, two in small companies near my hometown, and my last one at SalesForce, but in Paris offices.
This was my best experience so far, I really loved it !


I am looking for a 4 to 6 month end-of-study internship and I'd definitely love to work in the San Francisco Bay Area in a big IT company.

My manager as SalesForce tried to get me an internship in HQ but they only have 12-week programs for internships. 

I already applied for Apple, Microsoft, Uber, Dropbox, Airbnb, Microsoft, Amazon, Snapchat, Twitter but I feel like my chances are really low.

Not to mention I require VISA sponsorship in case I'll move.

Is there any chance for me to get that kind of internship or should I prioritise France/Europe for next year ?
Any tips/advice would be appreciated !

Many thanks :)

Dear Manager

I am submitting my resume and demo reel so that I maybe considered for an
internship or an entry-level Lighting role. I have two years of a lighting-focused
education, technical knowledge, and a strong work ethic and desire to contribute to
your films. I will be graduating from College with a degree in
Animation in the spring of 2018.

In the past I have worked as a Cinematographer, Color Consultant, and even Art
Director on various student films. Because of these positions I have developed the
ability to take feed back objectively and prioritize accordingly. I also have fine art
skills like drawing, painting, and photography that aid in my process of filmmaking.
On top of that I have also used many of these skills on my own short films for school
and passion projects.

As a student Lab Monitor at College for two years I’ve built a
repertoire of technical skills like properly troubleshooting computer issues, setting
up renderers and render farms, and scripting. On top of this I also have compositing
skills, enjoy learning how to make and use new tools, and can switch programs
easily.

I am diligent, communicative, and strive to deliver my work in a timely manner at
the highest caliber possible. I learn quickly and thrive on challenges, but I am also
very flexible and adapt quickly. My combination of artistic and technical experience
is an asset because I can create artistically, but understand how the tools and
systems work technically. With that I am also a new grad who is enthusiastic about
working in this industry.

I've been on the internship hunt for just shy of a month now, and I've slowly let the stress get to me. There are a few concerns I have:

1) My partner is getting increasingly annoyed at me for beating myself up for not solving a LeetCode problem because he believes that I will be fine and it's unnecessary to stress out so much. I however feel the need to aim for perfection because I heard that the top companies do expect bug-free, clean code. It's clear that the stress is taking a toll on our relationship - how did other people deal with this? Bottom line is, I don't want to lose a loved one in this process. 

2) I have received a bunch of rejections already. Some are direct rejects from resume screening ('not a good match in skill set'), some are failed coding challenges (not passing all test cases). I know that it's normal, it's part of the process. So far I've been shrugging them off my shoulders, but I wonder what is the healthiest way to deal? 

3) How can I keep up my motivation up in face of failure? This is different than anything I've ever done before - the rejection is constant and it just gets to me sometimes. 

4) How to manage school work on top of internship search. So far I basically neglected my school work, but I can't afford to do that for much longer because things are picking up speed. It feels very unnatural for me to be such a slacker, but what bothers me more is that I feel like I'm putting time / energy into a process that will ultimately benefit me less intellectually than the class material. And if I fail to find an internship at all, I can't help but think that it was all for nothing. How did people deal with this... 

tl;dr: need advice managing stress &amp; finding balance between school, personal life, intellectual growth and internship search"

My resume is incredibly unimpressive. I only have some sub-par school projects and work experience at a grocery store. I have lots of volunteer work but it's not coding/tech related just volunteering at events and as a tutor. 

The relevant courses I have taken so far include Intro to Programming, Intermediate Programming, Discrete Maths, Software Engineering I and II, Stats and Calculus. This semester I am taking Data Structures and Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming, Software Engineering III and Microcomputers. 

I really don't have time for side projects since most of my time is spent keeping up with my courses and trying to maintain my GPA. What else can I do to increase my chances of finding an internship and become more attractive to recruiters?"

72heux,71,2017-09-25,Can we talk about the abysmal security situation for healthcare workers in India?,[deleted],india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/72heux/can_we_talk_about_the_abysmal_security_situation/,"This was the latest newsworthy attack: http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/acid-attack-rattles-police-doctors-in-visakhapatnam/article19723615.ece

TLDR;
&gt; Pediatrician in Vishakapatnam attacked with acid while on duty. 


I understand a lot of us, including me, have had less-than-pleasant experiences with our healthcare providers. But the recent spate of violence has been quite disturbing, but I don't see the same level of outrage by those outside of the medical community. I get that there are more pressing issues, and some may argue that the entire medical community is corrupt and they get what is coming for them, but often it is the residents and junior doctors who face the brunt of the ire while the few minting money at the top, remain unscathed. Medicine itself is a highly imperfect science - what works for one might go the polar opposite for the other. Staff are overworked, esp. in the Govt sector, often working 24-72 hour shifts, and there isn't much data collection or error management in place in India to ensure that the best possible care is taken. (It is entirely human for an intern after a 72 hour shift to have misread a drug and administered it to a patient; it is medical negligence, but when the system focuses on blame, instead of correction, which is often the case, the intern is more likely to cover his error, especially if there was no adverse outcome).

 A large chunk of the demographic that come to Govt hospitals have a limited understanding of health and medicine and come in the very last stage, seeking care. Many come with so much distrust, and unfortunately, the patient load and time constraints put a major wedge in communication between doctors/nurses and patients - it is a failure of the system. So when a pregnant woman comes to the OPD after not perceiving fetal movements for 4 days, there isn't much we can do. When a child who is on anti-epileptics is given an injection and develops adverse reactions to it, we can only handle the allergic reaction and stabilize the child - most of the time, there really wasn't any way for us to have foretold that particular person would have such a reaction to that drug ([predictable vs. unpredictable reactions] (http://www.aafp.org/afp/2003/1101/p1781.html) ; also not all drugs are tested for reactions first). Hospitals have limited capacities and it is the intensive care units that are filled to the brim, and the patients needing the most assistance that may need to be turned away to other facilities, because of lack of ventilators/all operation theaters being occupied, etc. in the best interests of the patient. 

Please understand, I'm not justifying medical negligence where it happens. But these incidents weren't all some arrogant doctor pissing off the mob, or him/her willfully injecting some lethal stuff to get some bodies out of the way for that week. And no matter what the situation, nothing, NOTHING, justifies this sort of violence towards medical professionals (or any person doing their job or otherwise). There are legal ways to pursue that.

So why am I posting this? More and more people in medicine seem to be getting cynical and apprehensive of getting into labor-intensive fields. The quality of healthcare will plummet when doctors and nurses have to be more concerned about going back home with all of their own limbs intact, instead of tending to the patient's - most of us still do, but the 'cover your ass' sort of medicine has grown in popularity, mainly cuz of this ambience - the West has lawsuits, here they take the law into their own hands. The smart, ambitious, motivated kids of today, would be less interested in pursuing medicine and we need all kinds. Make no mistake, those of us who are losing faith in the system and the people mince no words when it comes to guiding those interested in medicine - why would we want any one coming into this without seeing the whole picture? Many of us are genuinely apprehensive to work in remote areas, because of these incidents, the lack of concern from the general public and adding in a mix of political clout and gundaism. Reading the article today, all I could think of was, I'd rather have multiple fractures than have acid thrown on my face at work, and that shouldn't be how any one has to feel about doing their own work. Isolated incidents? Maybe. But the fear is always there, and I'd really like more non-medical people commenting on it beyond, 'Yeah, but there was this one doctor who was an asshole...' You may not be gathering a mob and bearing sticks to attack doctors, nurses and other auxiliary workers but sometimes the silence of those around can be more deafening. As much as we would like to believe otherwise, doctors and patients need each other, so how can we slow down this downward spiral together?

What are your thoughts r/india?

I have a decent offer from where I did my internship, but to be honest I was pretty disappointed with them. It was a big company, but they're not a ""tech"" company and it seemed like a lot of the Computer Science new graduates that I worked with there didn't have much if any technical mentor-ship, projects weren't all heavily software-focused, and I know they kind of did a bait-and-switch for a lot of us interns and many didn't get to do any programming at all. The whole intern and new grad program there was more of a general ""technology"" program so there isn't a promise you'll work on software, I've learned now obviously.


With that in mind, I am looking for companies where you can learn a lot as a Software Engineer. Trying to avoid the vague ""Technology"" programs where you might not even be doing any sort of programming.

Work experience: 3 yrs FT at US car company (the one with the female CEO). 1 yr as a software developer, 2 yrs systems/business analyst. I represent a suite of global sales and marketing apps. Routinely running meetings, pitching project plans/scope to the business, advocating for programmers, liaising across multiple teams to deliver. 9 months internships prior-- 3 months at the auto company, 3 months at one of the credit bureaus, 3 months at a small defense IT contractor.


Extra curriculars: played ice hockey in undergrad, ran a writing group out of my house for 2 years, pitched in at a couple recruiting events, a Girls Who Code panel, some canvassing for a special election. Teaching myself French, Italian, and German on the side.


Undergrad school/major: BS in computer science at the Big Ten private school near Chicago. Minor in creative writing lolz


Other education/coursework: shrug emoji. A few online courses at work about Agile Scrum


Race/nationality: white


GMAT Score (include breakdown!): didn't take it since it wasn't required, my SAT was 2230 (740CR/690M/800WR), obviously will need to take it if I get rejected and need to try elsewhere


Undergrad GPA: Overall GPA 3.2, major GPA 3.5


MBA Info


Goal of MBA: end up a CIO? Basically I want to liaise between business and tech, I think I'm good at it. Tech background is solid but I don't want to be pigeonholed. MBA opens up my options, maybe a PM role, maybe more advanced business analysis, maybe a startup since techbros are maybe not so good at running a business.


Target schools: Obviously applied to UIUC iMBA already, would be willing to reapply there, but I'm in debt up to my eyeballs for undergrad as it is. Would appreciate your insight here for sure...



Basically I don't know what I could qualify for (GMAT score influences that a ton, I know) and no one around me knows anything about business school. Thanks for the help!!"

I'm in my last year of attending university and I need some words of wisdom from you guys. I came into the university thinking that I would be successful in what I achieve. I didn't expect to achieve the big internships from the big 4 or anything but at least some internships that I would feel proud of. Time went on and turns out that I didn't get any internships. My family criticizes me that I didn't try hard enough to get those internships and that I am a failure of a son. They said ""this is what happens when you don't go to a top university for CS"" which makes me incredibly sad since I know it's the truth. A post a while back basically showed that going to a top university is needed to have a happy life.

I know that it's too late for me to do anything and when discussing with them if I can go back home until I find a job they said no. What really broke me was ""We didn't raise a failure to come back"". I am incredibly sad and don't know what to do. I tried many internships applications and now it appears that I will graduate with no job waiting or any experience. Just reading how long it took for people to find a job scares me since I will graduate with about 20k in loans and with no where to go. 

The point of this post is to hear some stories of success and how to beat this depression. I just want to know what to do currently in my last year and how to find a job after graduating more efficiently. Maybe that might get my spirits up.

I will complete my undergraduate in computer science next year ( summer ) from a top tier Indian University. 

I'm interested to do neuro-engineering, computer vision, robotics, image processing, astrobiology  for exoplanet search in my future studies and career. ( preferable in academia, after a PhD )

*Simply put, I want to search/explore for life outside Earth using computer vision, robotics and study the biology of them.(specifically the nervous system and vision)*

So these are my current qualifications and knowledge and my thoughts on proceeding further.

- From a year I have been working on computer vision, image processing and AR ( related to medical, education and space science )
- I had a brief internship on particle physics two years back which was mostly writing C++ ( ROOT ) code for jet clustering. 
- I'm a co-founder of a CV/AR startup ( 2 months back ) which focuses mostly on research in computer vision, machine/deep learning and AR/VR.
- In my spare time I have taken MOOC's( without certificates ) for astronomy, exoplanet search, neuroscience and biomedical engineering.
- I have a paper *in submission* at an ACM conference for AR and we are working for another to submit in CVPR and MICCAI.
- In terms of software skills, I am proficient in C++, MATLAB and know OpenGL, OpenCV, dlib fairly well.

It would be really rad to know how should I proceed for my masters and PhD. ( and internships  ) to do what I want. 

Thank you so much.

I'm going to school for CS, but I've done a lot of art and video work in my free time so that's how I got the job. 

That being said, they also give me some basic web design stuff since they know I'm a CS major and it's right up my alley (well sorta, I don't mind doing it but web design is kinda too easy). So I often get assigned to projects where I'm doing HTML/CSS designing webpages along with designing the images and such.

I enjoy the work, the pay is more than enough for me right now ($15/hr), and they are flexible with my hours to work around school. My boss is cool, my coworkers are cool, I really don't have an interest in finding another internship. Not only that, but I'm in my senior year and will be graduated in April 2018 so it might already be a little late on getting another internship. 

But I'm concerned that I'm going to be disadvantaged because of this going into a CS career. The only advantages I can *potentially* squeeze out of my current job seems to be that I am already familiar with the corporate environment and I can bring marketing skills to a team (which might not be common in many CS grads). But many of my classmates have already worked in IT/CS internships so I feel like I'm going to always be the inferior choice.

Another option is that I could just stay within my company when I graduate, and eventually shift over to the appdev team. I'm sure I'd have a bit of an advantage considering I already know many people there.

Anyone else been in this situation and know how to make the best of it?

TL;DR: My internship is in the marketing department as a graphic designer/video editor (with some web design). I enjoy the job and I really don't want to find a new internship in my senior year unless I absolutely need to. I don't know how this is going to affect me when I want to find a job in CS, though.

Other developers in my squad keep asking me questions during 'work time' (not a meeting or otherwise) - more often than not it seems to me that they are just being lazy and don't want to think about the question themselves. The questions range from 'where do I find the docs for this' to 'how do I start working on this story' to 'I have a bug, can you help fix it?' and it is really starting to frustrate me, because I lose my own time helping them. These are not one-off questions, but regular daily things, such that I feel like I should even receive credit for their work sometimes.

This has happened at my previous job too. Thanks to this, I ended up being assigned as Scrum Master (good) but after some time, my manager told me to stop 'spoon feeding' colleagues. Yet I have no idea how. 


I'm not even Scrum Master at this new job and I'm already starting to feel similar pressure, coming home frustrated, and staying longer hours just because I spent a cumulative 1-2 hours helping other people over and above my meetings with them.


Since it has happened at both jobs, I've concluded that I'm the problem and that I need to change my behavior.

I'm a junior majoring in Information Systems/Information Tech in my college's business school. I'm pursuing a minor in Computer Science but it looks like it'll be difficult to finish it -- the CS program at my school is very highly regarded but very very overpacked. 


I have an internship at a company lined up that will likely lead to a full time offer (fingers crossed). This company pays for tuition and I'll likely be working as an app developer or in HCI. 


I haven't done so hot in my CS minor courses (B-'s) - I self taught myself over the summer and placed out of an intro class which turned out to be a mistake as I lacked a lot of foundation, but that's kind of off topic I guess. I'm doing better in the upper level courses now.


I plan on taking MOOCs next year and this spring to gain better foundations and increase my chances for getting into this program -- I'm definitely taking the Cs50 course from Harvard and I've love for suggestions of others to take. I've been browsing this sub for a few days and I've heard conflicting opinions on MOOCs so I'm questioning if it's worth my time? Should I be focusing on research? Personal projects? 


My parents are also trying to convince me to add a second major in business - marketing, or operations management, or maybe accounting. It's not that unreasonable as a lot of business students do it, but i've found that at career fairs employers are just straight up confused. **Would the second degree in business *hurt* my application?**


Lastly, is admission as a non cs undergrad even possible 1 or two years out of college? This is probably going to sound dumb but I want kids, and I want to be a stay at home mom for a period of time. I'd like to finish all education in one fell swoop as early as possible, as i'd imagine job + kids + school = hell? 

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR: What MOOCs should I take? Is research valued more than MOOCs? Is it possible for a non cs major to get admitted with only a year or two of work experience in tech?**

Sorry if I rambled.

Due to my programming background and previous roles I have been asked to join the what they call ""PM efficency initiative"". A lot of their processes are very manual and I can definetely see potential for streamlining and automating. However: since I am a programmer creating complex excel spreadsheets, VBA scripts, Selenium Bots and SharePoint Workflows comes easy to me. 

While I was presenting some high level proposals the question was raised: ""How do we maintain all these automated processes once I am gone""? 

This question has been bugging me all day. The team is doing this to further improve their delivery. So there is 0 funding. Aparently, we cant buy tools, hire a development company or get contractors onboard. Their activities include: financial planning and reporting / resource management / staffing / KPI management / Project FTE On and Offboarding etc.  

So to my questions to you. 

1) What is the most fool-proof/maintainable/effective way to automate small delivery processes in a team of people that have little to no tech experience? 
Tools available: Microsoft Office Suite (Excel &amp; VBA, SharePoint etc.) / Servers for Web Apps. 

2) What are some (cheap) tools to automate delivery processes you know of?

Thanks in advance for your time. Any pointers are appreciated."

Crossposted with /r/engineering, although I feel I may get better advice from you guys. 

Senior year electrical engineer here. So this last Summer, i had a couple of opportunities at internships, but they all fell through. I took summer classes instead to make wise use of time. I feel like having an internship over the Summer before your senior year is pretty crucial, considering its the last one before you graduate, so having nothing to show for that Summer is making me pretty nervous.

Although, before the semester ended, I did manage to get a very short gig with a local startup (i'm talking a couple of dudes working inside of a house kind of startup). Not a big company by any means, although they were doing some very cool hardware related things. They basically hired me for temporary work. For about a week, I had to interface an Arduino with some I2C sensors and write code that gathered data from the sensors and logged them to an SD card. This was all a prototype, which they later have implemented on a custom PCB. It's also worth noting that they paid me under the table, so no contracts or work forms were signed.

I'm really hoping to begin a career in embedded systems after graduation (microcontroller-based system design). So, on my resume, instead of putting it down as temporary work, I said I worked as an ""embedded systems intern"" at the company. For the date, I put ""June - July"". As for the description of the actual work, I put down what I actually did, which was prototype an embedded system for data collection and logging.

Is it safe to call this an ""embedded systems internship"" when I never was officially a member of this company? I'm new to applying for jobs, so I'm not quite aware of where to draw the line with embellishment."
72otp2,8,2017-09-26,I'm a college senior (20) and my confidence is low,csc_promqueen,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/72otp2/im_a_college_senior_20_and_my_confidence_is_low/,"Okay here's the gist.

I'm a senior this year in computer science. I skipped freshmen year because I obtained a lot of college credits in high school. Definitely grew up ahead of the game.

Well, now I'm behind. Skipping a grade was great tuition wise but I was behind most of my classmates knowledge wise and experience wise. They just had more experience than I did so it made it harder for me to get internships. This last summer the upcoming senior class had to have an internship. Well, I had one (really not a great one, but it had ""internship"" in the title and wanted SOMETHING) but that burst into flames and I had to step away from the internship because of family issues and do a project instead (Android App).

So here I'm at senior year, no internships/ experience and only one project. I'm hoping to do more projects this year but I'm feeling discouraged. 1) I have to present my project to a class full of people that all got internships and 2) I just am worried about not getting hired from lack of experience. 

Also I get hella nervous during interviews so that's definitely botched some in the past. 


(I also may or may not be feeling a bit shitty coming out of a web developer internship that did not go so hot).

72pmgm,18,2017-09-26,Night Coverage,TheOneWithTheCats,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/72pmgm/night_coverage/,"Ever since high school, I had the dream of one day being a psychologist. At the time, it seemed like a reasonable goal that could be met through reasonable means. After a few years of schooling and maybe an internship  I’d be well on my way toward diagnosing people to my heart’s content. Nearing the end of my undergraduate degree, however, I received a much-delayed slap in the face from reality. I suddenly found myself frantically applying to graduate programs within the field. Needless to say, when one doctoral program offered me admission, I jumped on the opportunity like a starving man on a cake. Sure, that cake was a bit poorly planned and maybe taken out of the oven four-years-too-late, but it was still a cake. And when the program director offered me a well-paid assistantship that would cover the bulk of my tuition, that cake was suddenly covered in icing.


While most of my assistantship consisted of research-related duties, I had also been assigned to 10 hours per week of night coverage at the Student Psychological Services Office. Within the psychology department, there’s a training clinic where graduate students meet with clients (under the supervision of a licensed psychologist, of course). This clinic, the SPSO, functions much like any other clinic— it holds regular 9 a.m. -7 p.m. hours and features a variety of small therapy rooms. It even employs a full-time receptionist that directs clients to the waiting area and schedules follow-up appointments. Celia is a fabulous woman. Provided no clients are present, she always has an ear available when you need to vent and always keeps a bowl of candy in her top desk drawer for grad students when the semesters start to get stressful. That being said, Celia *does* have a life outside of her receptionist work—  a life that starts when her shift ends at 5 p.m. Because graduate students aren’t afforded the luxury of having a life outside of work, individuals such as myself man the front desk from 5-7 p.m. 

Though the work seemed very straightforward, I still felt a twinge of anxiety as I walked to campus for my first shift. I stood outside the door for five minutes trying to balance fashionably late with professionally early before just entering through the glass entrance doors at 4:50 p.m. Celia seemed pleasantly surprised by my excessive punctuality. Since it was my first day on the job, she graciously gave me a tour of the SPSO.

“Now, there are 3 entrances to the SPSO. You’ll only have clients coming in through the front doors, but students and other professionals tend to just use whatever door is closest to wherever they parked.” I nodded. Like any college campus, parking had been awful during the first week of classes. Even though the clinic was small, I was glad to know that I could save a minute of walking by coming in a side door if I happened to find parking in a different lot.  “Right next to the front door is the door to the file room, which contains the east entrance. And at the end of this hallway,” she gestured toward the L-shaped hallway to the left of the front desk, “is the west entrance.” Celia then handed me a key and informed me that it should lock all of the doors within the clinic, as well as the exterior doors. “The clinic was recently renovated and campus security is planning on rekeying all of the rooms, but this key should get you by until then. Then again, they said the same thing last summer and whaddya know, we still have the same locks.” I made a lame joke about bureaucratic process and the speed that things get rekeyed. Well, ‘joke’ might be a loose term, but Celia responded with a hearty chuckle. Receptionist humor. 

“At the end of the night, there’s a checklist for you hanging on the back of the file room door. It should tell you which rooms need to be locked and what other things need to be done for closing. Since it’s still the first week of school, we haven’t really started scheduling clients yet, so you don’t have to worry about sending anyone to a room quite yet. Really, it’s more of a formality that you have to be here this week. Night coverage will be more important once we actually start getting clients in for the semester. For now, just sit at the desk and lock up at seven.” My follow-up crack about bureaucratic process was well-received. I was on fire. 

I told Celia to have a good evening and she told me to make myself at home at the front desk. I understood this to mean that the candy bowl was fair game, and immediately snuck a chocolate bar the second she left. After indulging in a bit of pre-dinner dessert, I reclined back in the office chair and spent a moment taking in my surroundings. Perhaps it was the half-hearted renovations done in a historic building by an underfunded university that made the reception area a bit draftier than it had any business being. Or maybe the bulb in Celia’s desk lamp was ten watts too few, causing innocuous chairs to cast long shadows over the dimly lit reception area. But something inside me felt *off*. I wouldn’t say it was a fully developed emotion, but rather a seed of negative affectivity. With enough nourishment, that seed could grow into nervousness or guilt or fear, but in its current state, it was none of those. It was the lump in my throat, the hair standing on the back of my neck, and the tendency to jump a little too much at an unexpected noise. Too undeveloped to be considered an emotional state, but still holding all the potential to become anxiety, panic, and terror. 

I continued to sit in my state of emotional uncertainty for a few more moments before brushing it off as being the result of sitting in a new environment, alone, in the evening. I’ve always been prone to an overactive imagination, and knew I could nip that fear in the bud with a distraction. I pulled out my cellphone and started scrolling through Facebook. Somewhere between a cat video and a political rant I glanced up from my phone to see a man standing in front of the desk. I let out an involuntary yelp and sprung to a standing position. The man chuckled and introduced himself.

“Hey, easy there. Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you— “
“Oh, uh, sorry, I-I didn’t hear you come in. I thought I was going to be alone here all evening.”
“Oh, no worries. Yeah, when they renovated last year they put soundproofing insulation in all of the walls. Confidentiality and all that jazz. Great for ethical reasons, as long as you consider scaring the hell out of the receptionist ethical,” he said with a wink. “Anyway, I just stopped in to fill out a few things on a case file real quick and then I’ll be out of your way.”

I felt my heart rate return to normalcy and slouched back into the chair. While my initial reaction to his presence was one of shock, I was secretly relieved to have someone else in the clinic with me, even if only temporarily. 

“My name is Nate, by the way,” I hear him call from the room behind the front desk. “You must be one of the first years then? I remember getting stuck with night coverage my first year. Dullest nights of my life. But hey, you should come here for a second.”

I swiveled around in the chair to face the room he was in and saw it was full of televisions. After walking into the room, I saw that each television connected to a DVD player, with Nate kneeling on the floor to open the one closest to the door.
 
“Did Celia go over the recording room protocol with you?”
“Uhh, no she just said to follow to checklist in the file room when I go to lock up.”
“Oh, that figures. Love her to death, but I swear that woman needs to retire. It’s only a matter of time before she starts replacing the chocolate in that bowl with Werther’s Originals.”
I laughed, but was secretly hoping there would be hard butterscotch in the candy bowl one of these days. Old people have the best candy.
“So I remember being super confused by the recording room my first night here. It’s really not that complicated, but a list that just says “put away DVDs” isn’t exactly the most informative thing ever. Since this is a training clinic, we record sessions with clients. Each one of these DVD players is connected to a camera in one of the therapy rooms. Students are *supposed* to label their DVDs and put them in their files when they’ve finished a session, but every once in awhile someone will forget a disc in one of the players, especially toward the beginning of a semester. It’s not huge deal or anything, but whoever has night coverage is stuck trying to figure out whose disc it is so it doesn’t get left out in the open. Usually you just have to push play and within a couple seconds you can figure out who it belongs to.”

I thanked Nate for the information and he left the clinic shortly after. The rest of the evening I spent poking around on my phone, killing time and ignoring the creeping feeling that slowly started to consume my chest and throat once again. As soon as 7 p.m. rolled around, I rushed over to the filing room to see what kinds of closing activities I needed to do before returning to the safety of my apartment. The list seemed pretty straightforward—  check each room for any confidential materials left out, turn off each light and lock the doors to rooms 112, 113, and 114, lock each entrance, put away DVDs, turn off the coffee pot in the lobby, lock filing cabinets exit through the east entrance. While each task seemed very basic, I quickly ran into an obstacle. Upon placing my key in the lock for room 114, I was met with resistance. Locks in 113 and 112 produced similar results. Unsure of how to proceed, I called Celia. 	

Celia seemed uncharacteristically happy to answer my call for someone who was about to have her evening interrupted by work. She apologized for handing me the wrong key earlier and assured me that all would be well. Since we weren’t expecting any clients right away in the morning, it wasn’t the end of the world if not every door within the clinic was locked. As long as I secured the filing cabinets and made sure confidential information was put away, the rest could be left unlocked. The entrances can be locked from the inside using the handles, so a key wouldn’t be needed for those. I thanked her profusely and apologized, though, based on her cheery demeanor, the apology probably wasn’t necessary.

Relieved, I walked behind the desk into the recording room. To my surprise, one DVD player still held a disc. *Thank God Nate stopped by earlier* I thought to myself, having not expected to encounter a stray DVD this quickly in the semester. I closed the tray and hit play, waiting for the recording to start on the monitor. Oddly, the DVD was blank. Well, not blank in the traditional sense, but rather it cycled through each empty therapy room within the clinic before cutting to static. I chalked it up to being a one of the second year students’ practice DVDs. I had recalled seeing a department-wide email that the second years would be using the SPSO that day for mock counselling sessions. Someone had probably demonstrated how to run the recording equipment for the each room and left the disc in the drive after. I labeled it “Practice Recording” and placed it in the filing cabinet before locking the entrances and wandering around campus trying to remember where I had parked hours earlier. 
	

The following night I arrived at the clinic to discover an empty reception area. Confused, I checked my phone to verify that it was, indeed, Tuesday and that I hadn’t somehow slept through the week right into Saturday. I craned my neck over the front of Celia’s desk to see a sticky note left on the keyboard.

*Sorry about the short notice, but I had a family emergency arise and won’t be in the office for the rest of the week. We don’t currently have any clients scheduled for this week, but you still need to fulfill the night coverage hours for your assistantship, so please still come in each night from 5-7. Think of it as practice. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to contact me.*

*xoxo Celia*

I chuckled at the informality of her valediction, but also felt a bit irate that I was still expected to come in every evening when the receptionist herself wasn’t even in during the day and no clients were scheduled. Placed next to the keyboard was a loose key which, upon further inspection, was the correct key to lock the doors within the clinic. I placed my previous key in an envelope marked *Wrong Key* and added the new one to my keychain. Even in a state of family emergency, Celia kept her cool enough to find the correct key for me. The framed Receptionist of the Year certificate framed behind her desk suddenly felt like more than just a commemorative piece of cardstock. 

Though my encounter with Nate the previous evening ended up being more serendipitous than not, I still resolved to prevent further startling incidents. After dealing with the note and key left on the desk, I headed down the hallway to the west entrance. Since no one was expected to enter the clinic that evening, I felt no guilt in locking the door at five. If someone needed to enter the building, they could just as well do so from an entrance that was visible from the front desk. Locking the third entrance calmed my nerves less than I anticipated, however, for as soon as I slumped into the chair I was met with a familiar feeling. My head started to become light and the silence of the clinic transformed into ringing. Scrolling through Facebook quelled the feeling initially, but as the night progressed I found myself scrolling faster and faster, not really reading anything on the screen, but just going through the motions trying to grasp some semblance of comfort. I was pulled out of this trance when I heard the sound of a metallic rattling. As soon as I processed that I was listening to the sound of a doorknob jiggling, I smiled. *Uh-uh, nobody’s gonna to sneak up on me tonight. You can go around to the front.*

A few minutes passed, and when no one passed through the front entrance, I concluded that the student probably found the door locked and assumed the clinic was closed for the evening. The rest of the night remained uneventful and I was able to fill the hour with uninterrupted Facebooking, just as I’m sure the program director intended for me to do when I was hired. Seven o’clock came around, and I returned to the filing room once again to check the closing list. Though I felt relatively confident that I could remember the steps, I chose to read through everything again since I could now complete every step with my working key. Upon inspecting the list of rooms that needed to be locked, it came to my attention that I had missed a room the previous night. While I could distinctly recall rooms 112-114, room 111 produced nothing but a blank space in my memory. I proceeded with closing as normal, assuming that I would eventually come across a 111, but never did. Given the amount of construction done to the facility, I assumed room 111 had been subsumed into another room, or even the lobby, at some point in the renovation. Finally, I entered the recording room and checked each DVD player. Another disc had been left in one of the trays. I rolled my eyes. There hadn’t even been clients there that day, yet people still somehow forgot a practice disc in a player. I tapped the play button and one of the therapy rooms appeared on the screen. 

At first, I thought it was an identical recording to the previous nights. Maybe someone had missed training yesterday and the demonstration had been repeated. I quickly realized the error in this thinking, though, as a flicker of movement appeared on the screen. The door to the room slowly opened to reveal the figure of someone who looks all-too-much like myself entering the room, scanning for confidential information left out, then turning off the light. I immediately felt ice travel down my spine and my heartbeat lept into my throat. I had been alone in the clinic all evening, and this recording was taken *minutes* ago. Petrified, I continued to watch as the camera switched to the next therapy room to show the same routine, going down the hall through each room. The methodical camera switch seemed so coordinated and seamless that I realized it couldn’t have been filmed by a human, but rather must have been the product of some type of motion capture security system. I breathed a sigh of relief at this revelation, and, using a marker I had found on Celia’s desk, wrote *Security Footage 8/22/17* on the front of the disc, then placed it in the file room. I left feeling rather secure knowing that the clinic had a functioning security system. 


On Wednesday night I was greeted at the clinic by a group of four second-year students frantically studying the SPSO handbook and going through assessment materials in preparation for their exam the next day. I learned that in order to start seeing clients, they must not only attend training, but also prove competence in the materials used. I sat at the desk, listening to them in the reception area quizzing each other over SPSO policies. I felt a bit anxious knowing that in just a year’s time, I too would have to be well-versed in the methods of the clinic, but also appreciated having the company in the clinic. During one of their study breaks, I approached the group for a moment to ask about the room on the checklist that I couldn’t find the previous night.

“No worries, room 111 is kind of hidden. It’s right in here on the other side of the TV,” one of the girls said as she gestured toward the recording room door. I poked my head into the room, and sure enough, behind one of the televisions was a small plaque reading Rm 111. “Don’t worry about locking it though. They stopped storing things in there after renovations but never got around to revising the closing list.” After taking a moment to look at the door, it was apparent that the recording room was exempt from the renovations, as it still contained the original ornate woodwork and large, brass hardware as the rest of the building. It was quite beautiful, really, but I could understand the need for renovations. The rest of the clinic seemed so much more, well, *clinical.*

The group disbanded a little after six and I was once again alone in the clinic. I instinctively reached for my pocket and immediately panicked upon realizing my pockets were empty. Muttering an expletive couldn’t make me unforget my cell phone, but it made me kick myself a bit less for it. Having nothing to do for the remainder of my shift, I figured I’d get a year’s head start on studying for my SPSO exam. I reached into one of the desk drawers, pulled out the manual, and began to read.

No one was winning any literary awards with the manual, and I found myself drifting off trying to read through the first section (all of which had been dedicated to HIPAA). I skipped to the next section, which was labeled Taping Regulations and Procedures. The first page contained information about the purpose of recording sessions with clients and the importance of obtaining consent both in writing and verbally at the start of any session recording. I scoffed at this and questioned the ethicality of the clinic’s security system. Apparently employees didn’t need to give verbal consent to be recorded. Half-reading and half-daydreaming about how I could bring up this flaw in the system to my supervisor and be some kind of psychological ethics hero, I flipped the paged. My daydream crumbled around me as I started to read the next page: Equipment Use and Guidelines.

1. Before starting a session, place a blank disc in the DVD player that corresponds to your therapy room and press the red button to begin recording.
2. Obtain verbal consent to record and have the client sign the Consent to Record document, which is to be added to the client’s file at the end of the session.
3. After the session has ended, retrieve the DVD from the Recording Room and clearly label it with your name, your client’s identification number, and the date of the recording.
4. Place the recording in the designated Recording Cabinet under your file, and immediately lock the cabinet. 
5. ALWAYS REMEMBER to record your session (unless consent is not obtained). As a student, you are practicing under your supervisor’s license and your supervisor MUST be able to review your work to ensure your progression through training. There is NO back-up to a failure to record your session!

I stopped reading. My eyes began to well with tears and my lungs stopped functioning. I struggled to breath as my mind flooded with questions of who had recorded me last night, desperately grasping for some logical explanation that could explain the disc. I forced my eyes over to the clock, and to my relief, it was 6:55. Shaking, I took my key and struggled to fit the key into each lock as I failed to steady my hand. I neglected to check each room for confidential information, and honestly, I didn’t care at that point. Every fiber of my existence was trying to drag me out of that clinic, but, as a responsible adult, I at least needed to lock the doors on my way out.   

That night as I sat in my apartment, I struggled to decide how to act. If someone had been recording me, I needed to go to the campus police. That being said, enrollment in this program was the culmination of all my hard work up to this point in life. Graduate education is full of limited space, academic snobbery, and politics. Who was I to make waves and complain on my first day? I was lucky enough to even be in the program, let alone receive funding, and I couldn’t risk losing it by making waves. My best option was to contact Celia and hope that her family emergency wasn’t too dire to speak with me for a few moments. To my dismay, though, my phone had fallen out of my pocket somewhere else on campus and was not waiting for me at my apartment as I had hoped. I searched for Celia’s email on the school’s directory and informed her of the previous night’s events, praying that she would say, “Oh, don’t worry about night coverage for the rest of the week,” or at the least give me a logical explanation for the recordings. The next morning, I found a response from Celia in my inbox. 

*So sorry to hear you’ve been having such trouble with night coverage! I can completely relate. Before students started taking the night shift, I would work evenings as well and it always felt so spooky being there alone at night. If you want, you can use the computer at my desk to keep yourself occupied during the shift. I should have mentioned that before. I unfortunately can’t really give you a good answer about the recording. If it’s in the filing cabinet when I get back (hopefully by Monday!) I’ll take a look at it and see what’s going on. Let me know if there’s anything else I can do for you!*

*xoxo Celia*

While it didn’t answer any of my questions, Celia’s email did provide me consolation in knowing that I wasn’t the only person who felt eerie being in the clinic alone at night. I resolved to push through to the end of the week, if only until Celia got back and could make sense of the recording. Surely I could handle two more nights. 


I entered an empty clinic on Thursday night. The hopes of having students around working on cases or studying or *anything* were dashed when I opened the door to find all of the lights already off. For my own piece of mind, I decided to turn the lights on, but do the rest of the closing tasks at the very beginning of the shift (save turning off the lights and locking the main entrance). That way, I could quickly exit at the end of the night and leave that godforsaken clinic. To my relief, the DVD players were all empty and no discs were left lying around. I returned to the desk and logged on to Celia’s computer and loaded up my go-to browser-based game. 

It’s amazing how fear and trepidation can melt away when you’re immersed in something engaging. Even if that something is as simple as Tetris. For 30 minutes, I was free. Free of the clinic, free of fear, free of obligation. My only concern in the world was fitting the falling pieces together. Maybe it was deeper than that. Maybe it was symbolic of all the pieces I couldn’t fit together in the real world. The seed of negative affectivity turned fear, the recording, the silent loneliness of the clinic and the sinking feelings that I wasn’t truly alone. Maybe had I been just a bit more immersed in the game, I wouldn’t have heard the phone ring.

At first, I wasn’t sure how to respond. Celia hadn’t covered the phone aspect of the job, but I assumed since I was in charge of the desk, I should probably answer the phone. When the caller ID finally popped up, I immediately recognized the number as my own. I was actually quite giddy at this site. Someone had finally found my phone and my broke, grad student self wouldn’t be forced to cough up the money to buy a new one. I answered, but the person who had found my phone had already hung up. It was a shame, but also a relief. A call from my phone meant my phone was still charged and could be tracked using the Find My Phone app I had installed. I used Celia’s computer to navigate to the app’s website and entered my login information. Seeing that my phone’s GPS pinged it at the clinic was exciting. I clicked on the ‘Alert’ button, knowing it would force my phone to make an alarm noise for me to locate it. The prospect of finding my lost phone had clouded my reasoning. Had I been thinking straight, I would have questioned how the finder of my phone would know to call the clinic. I would have questioned who was calling *from the clinic*. I most certainly wouldn’t have clicked the ‘Alert’ button, because I would have already known that I would have heard an alarm coming from behind me, through the recording room and behind the door of Rm 111. 

I don’t know what compelled me to do it, but I walked toward the room. One of the televisions was already on, though I knew I had shut it of when I completed the closing tasks at the beginning of the evening. Some irresistible compulsion drove me to tap the ‘open’ button on the bottom DVD player to reveal a disc already labeled *”Security Footage” 8/24/17*. That same compulsion led my to close the tray, press ‘play,’ and watch the screen. It wasn’t until the shaky camera footage finally focused that I realized I was watching a recording of myself from behind, filmed from the doorway of the recording room. It was then that I snapped out of it and ran. I didn’t put that disc in the cabinet and I didn’t lock the door or turn of the lights behind me. It had never occurred to me that the televisions in the recording room had any audio capabilities, but in my final moments in the room, I swear I heard heavy breathing. 

I know people in the department talked. Why would anyone leave the program after only one week? It was unprecedented. I emailed Celia to let her know that I had a change of heart, and that psychology just wasn’t for me—that I wanted to leave the program before investing 5 more years in it and simply didn’t want to be a psychologist after all. She seemed to understand and was very supportive of my decision. I was probably dumb for giving up my dream just like that. I was also probably dumb for cancelling my phone service and scraping together the cash to buy a new device, instead of responding to Celia’s email asking if I was going to come a pick up my phone from her front desk. I must have forgotten it there on my last shift. 


This all happened a over a month ago, and at the time I had resolved to never speak of it again—that is, until last night. Just after 3:00 a.m., I awoke to the sound of static coming from my living room. After fumbling through the dark, I finally found the remote by the light of the television. It had been knocked on the floor, and I assumed one of the cats had stepped on it to turn the television on. I was about to turn it off and return to bed when I noticed the DVD player had been turned on as well. Suddenly, I was wide awake. I didn’t even have a remote for the DVD player anymore, as I hadn’t used it in years (Netflix being my media source of choice). I gulped and forced the lump out of my throat, mustering the courage to press ‘play.’ The static instantaneously switched to a video of me sleeping, with a familiar heavy breathing emanating from the speakers.

I got a full time job offer to return at the place I've interned at for the past 2 summers, and the offer is available until November (graduating in the Spring, so I would be starting in May or later). It's that early because it's an engineering job with the navy, so I have to go through all of those security clearances and stuff like that. The issue I'm running into is that I'm interviewing with other companies coming up in the next couple weeks, and I'm not sure November is late enough for me to hear back from those other companies before having to decide.

My question is, would asking for an extension on when I have to accept my offer by from the company I interned with a bad move? Or would it be better to just accept that offer and if I find a better offer, just say ""lol just kidding"" to the place I had the internship with and go to the other company? I've been told a couple times to just accept the offer, and if I get a better offer, just go with that one and tell the place I interned at to go pound sand, but I feel like that's just a huge dick move."

I was given a technical question that I was pretty much certain was to be solved using recursion and dynamic programming, but for the first 20 minutes of the 40 minute interview, I stumbled around trying to grasp the exact solution. My concern is that I don't think I was very clear in expressing my thoughts for these first 20 minutes. Initially, I stated that it looked like it was a recursive problem, the general idea of my approach, and how I could probably optimize it through dynamic programming. However, I didn't really expand too much on these ideas - I was sort of panicking because I felt like the optimal DP solution was right in front of me but I couldn't quite get it. I think I basically repeated these same few lines over and over again as I sat there trying to put the pieces together. Finally, though, after the 20 minutes, I got the solution (which I think was quite optimal), and was able to code it. I had a few careless mistakes here and there that I fixed up along the way, but for the most part, I think I did it rather smoothly and explained it clearly. At the end, much to my relief, the interviewer said my solution looked great. However, now that I'm thinking about it afterwards, I'm quite concerned about my lack of clarity and direction in the first half of the interview. Do you think I would still have good chances if I solved the interview problem, despite this initial blunder? And another side concern - do you think this one DP problem is enough for a 40 minute interview, or was I maybe too slow for him to give me another question?"

I'm in my third year of a Computer Information Technology bachelor's program. I started out exploratory but still had no idea what I wanted to do so I just kind of picked something that seemed mildly interesting (dumb I know). It started out okay, but I'm at a point where I'm completely lost and uninterested.

Higher level classes have me totally unaware of what to do. I'm focusing on database management, but we still have to take some networking classes and programming classes (right now I'm in a Java class and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing). It's really difficult to study for this kind of stuff, at least for me. 

As I mentioned before, I'm also not interested in it. However, I've never really been interested in any school subject before. But at least in other subjects I've been able to study the material and be able to somewhat understand it. For example, you can study history and remember the facts but you can't study something like programming and know exactly what you're supposed to do. It's extremely difficult for me.

Anyway, I'm not sure how helpful this will be but I'm wondering what I should do. I only have about 3 1/2 more semesters to go. How useful will a degree in this field be if I don't really want to go into this field? I'm good at analyzing information and am very detail-oriented. I suppose my options are to just stick to it and hope that I can get good enough grades to graduate (I will also need an internship to graduate), I could switch majors but I really don't want to be in school another 3 years and who knows if I will like that major any better, or I could drop out and try to get a decent full time job and work my way up from there. 

Thank you for any and all help.

TLDR; hate my major, pretty lost, unsure of where to go from here."

72ty8i,1,2017-09-27,I need help with...career,puzzledhuman,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/72ty8i/i_need_help_withcareer/,"Let me just say this, down vote this post or whatever it’s called, I don’t really care.


But I just need to, get my thoughts out there because I don’t have anyone to talk to about this.

I need help… I really really do. I don’t know what to do for a career. I thought I had a sort of plan of what I wanted to do, but idk it seems to dreamy.


Bit of back-story;
So I’m 21, living in London with family in a frickin’ overcrowded house, I want to leave, but I have no money. I don’t have a degree and my highest qualification (UK) is a level 3 btec diploma in graphic design. I also don’t have friends (but let’s just ignore that for now). Oh and I also can’t get a job, not even a fucking mcdonalds job haha.


What were my plans? I’d say I’m mainly into creative fields, like graphic design, illustration, film-making, screenwriting. I thought I wanted to… have a online clothing store where I could utilise my design skills. That hasn’t gone well, I quickly ran out of money from the job I had (retail, mornings) and of course depression. I also wanted to be a film-maker (writer/director). But I haven’t really done anything with that, except for creating one short movie and writing a stupid short screenplay for 6 months that I haven’t finished writing because it is too complicated, I kinda learnt bits of screenwriting and what not from the internet and books. 
Those were my plans for this previous year. The plans for the previous 5 years were to go to university, to do what? I had no idea, first I wanted to do some easy degree like in product design – but for a job? Hell I wasn’t interested. I then wanted to become a lawyer, but of course I couldn’t do that because I got fucked over in my A-levels badly imo and my depression grew exponentially and at the end I got 3 D’s in Physics, ICT and Product design. After that, I became fascinated with …


You know what? It doesn’t matter… none of this matters, I fucked my chances, failed exams, failed resits, made mistakes which I thought I learnt from but apparently not. I’m in the same fucking position I was 4 years ago. Too scared to go to the doctors to get therapy, I don’t even have a GP because I feel bad that I’m doing bad, I don’t deserve free healthcare. Too scared to talk to people in general.


I’m so fucked up…I couldn’t bring myself to accept going to a shitty university okay? What’s the point having debt for something I am not going to engage with you know? But maybe I should have, now 21…3 years a fucking long time, I’d be 24 when I get out of university. My chances of that are over.


Lets talk about jobs and internships hmm? I have customer service experience, my last job was working in a home retailer for 6 months in the mornings, whilst also working on the passion projects I mentioned above. I quit that job because…I thought I was close to getting my clothing store off the ground, but I didn’t. As I said, idk how I managed to waste about £800 in 3 months, I didn’t buy anything for me, I don’t drink or do drugs – it just…disappeared. Now it’s about 4-5 months, I’m virtually living on £30. I’ve been trying to get a job for about 2 months, I can’t hook anything.


Recently, I’ve been looking and thinking applying for graphic design jobs because I feel like I have experience and I’ve volunteered as a graphic designer, but of course my fucking mind comes in the way and I become ‘unworthy’ or ‘inexperienced’ for junior or intern positions as I don’t possess a degree. That shitty piece of paper telling me what I can or cannot do.


AAAAARRGHHHH! 


What triggered me to rant about this shit? I was looking at some Government Civil Service Fast Track schemes (UK) again. But I need a degree to apply for that, which I don’t have one :c. Just fucking shit…
Bit about my ambitions…I want to become an Oscar quality writer/ director, but I want to mainly work in new media. I also want to be a millionaire when I’m 26 and have a successful business.


So what outcome am I looking from posting…this idk what to call it?
I just want to talk to someone . No not to someone who is going to tell me what I’m doing wrong, or that ‘this is not the way’ to do things, but someone who I can talk to that won’t…form an opinion of what I want do at all – some ‘mentor’ character. But I’m a long way from being in the position. I don’t know who to talk to, the job centre is degrading and sickening (outdated and shouldn’t exist). How am I suppose to find a mentor when I have no connection, no money, or whatever.


I guess I have to carry on...Eat, go to the library, get home, and repeat…until something comes through.

* I'm currently at an internship at a well-known international bank's (which I won't disclose) asset management division. I've asked around and relocation of employees (especially interns) to other countries is extremely rare.
* I speak Portuguese (native), English (my TOEFL iBT score is 113, but I have a noticeable accent) and studied German when I was young, although I didn't go very far and just got back into it now.
* I don't have a lot of money saved (around 3 thousand dollars), but my parents can help with that.  



I'm at a pretty good position to have a high-paying job here and living a decent life, but that's not what I want. I don't really feel safe (I don't live in a dangerous neighbourhood, but I still don't feel safe), I'm not really fond of the culture and I want my future children to have a better future and quality of life.  
I spent years looking for old family documents alone (my parents never cared for it) and applied for an italian citizenship through jus sanguinis, but that will take at least 10 years (because there's a huge line for it) and by then I feel my prospects of relocating will be worse.  
I also have already talked to one of the teachers I'm more familiar with and he recommended that I do my Master's here and then try to start a Doctorate somewhere else, but that would take me years and I want to leave as soon as possible. However, most (actually, all) countries that I would like to immigrate to have no shortage whatsoever of economics/business workers, so I'm starting to lose hope of immigrating any time soon. Canada and Germany are my best bets, but I browsed through some job sites and nearly all jobs that accept foreigners want me to live there already and be a native english speaker, not just fluent.  
What do I do? I don't want to wait 10 years and have to dismantle my life to move.  
Thanks in advance!

72u4rz,1,2017-09-27,Finishing Masters after 1 more year vs Dropping out. What would you do?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/72u4rz/finishing_masters_after_1_more_year_vs_dropping/,"First off, I understand that ultimately this is a decision that I need to make personally, and that there's probably no right answer. But I think hearing what other people has to say would help me a lot. Any input in appreciated.

I'm an Aerospace Engineering master's student. And I gotta say, I'm not the best. I've made plenty of mistakes. So let's get that out of the way. Initially I came in as PhD student for all the wrong reasons, and although my undergrad academic was OK, it just wasn't strong enough to land funding (TA or RA). So I ended up switching to masters at the end of last year.

Since then I had to take a year off for personal reasons that were unavoidable, and worked an internship for the summer and now I'm back.

&amp;nbsp;


So let's assess the situation.

- Finishing with a degree is doable, but costly. $18,000 in tuition alone. $12000 in living expense. I have just barely enough money saved up for it.

- My research/focus is in experimental plasma, not the most industry applicable field for sure. 

- I don't have any job lined up. So even if I drop out it's not like life will be rosy. Being in school does offer some benefits like career fair and filling in the employment gap. 

- 1 year is long/short time depending on how I look at it.

- Gradschool's stressful, but so is life. I don't think I will be less stressed if I drop out. But at least I won't be paying 30k for it. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm currently enrolled for the quarter, and if I do this quarter I really mind as well do the rest. So this really is the last chance to jump ship. In one hand 1 year and 18k in tuition isn't the end of the world. I spent just as much to get here anyway. But on the other hand it's still 1 year of my time and 18k. I will learn stuff, but I could also learn on a job. And what I learn maybe interesting but not marketable. At the end of this I will just be a junior engineer like others, just with masters. At this point paying money hand over fist to be a student is stressful as well. 

Kinda inclined to tough it out and recoup the cost later. It just feels so wrong though. I'm interested but not uber passionate. Should I be spending so much time and money just to tie a knot?

My question is how do I answer the ""did you receive a return offer"" question or defer from answering it?

72udtn,1,2017-09-27,Should I transfer majors or just stay where I am?,jx_489,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/72udtn/should_i_transfer_majors_or_just_stay_where_i_am/,"I know this is a very personalized question, but I don’t have anyone else to talk to, and I was hoping you guys could help point me in the right direction.

I am a sophomore at UIUC and I am studying Industrial Engineering. I went into the major because I knew that I enjoyed business, but I also wanted more of a technical background before getting my MBA. I could see myself completing my degree, but I am not passionate about the courses. I am not keen on working in the field after graduation, I would rather work in software. I could try to get a CS minor, but the courses are so over-saturated here that I might have difficulty getting into them as a non-major. 

Software is a lot more innovative and interesting to me, and I would rather work in this field than work as an Industrial Engineer after graduation. I enjoy math, but I would prefer to work in applied math rather than data analytics and such. 

My GPA is below a 3.5, so I will not be able to transfer into CS or Computer Engineering at UIUC, so I have a few options. 
1) I can either keep studying Industrial Engineering at UIUC and try to get a CS minor.
2) I can keep studying Industrial Engineering at UIUC and I can join a CS boot-camp, or self-teach myself some key concepts.
3) I can transfer to the University of Illinois at Chicago to pursue CS. 


UIC’s CS program is far from U of I’s, but it is certainly not bad. It isn’t known out of the Chicago area, which is unfortunate, because I want to move to the Bay Area after graduation, but I think that with enough side projects and performing well in my courses, I might be able to find a decent job in the Bay Area. 

Do you think it would be hard for me to get into the field as an Industrial Engineering major? After reading online, my perception is that a minor will not help me much in the field, but I don’t really understand this. If I can take the key courses such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Databases etc., will this not be sufficient for me to be able to find a well-paying job? 

Is my reasoning correct? Will I have a shot at moving to the Bay Area from Chicago, if I have enough side projects and internships to supplement my resume, or will I have to work in Chicago for a few years and then try to move?

Anyways, I started out my CS journey really half-assed and got no internships or opportunities or anything, had like a 3.1 GPA.

Starting around the beginning of my Junior year I began doing extracurricular activities and making my own projects. I also started studying my ass off and after I puled an A in my algorithms analysis course, one of my professors accepted me into undergraduate research after me asking him for something to do. 

I'm applying to graduate school for an MS and am really confident that I can get into my school's program with a Teaching Assistantship as well as being able to continue doing research. 

Long story short, I went to my schools recent engineering fair with a beefed up resume looking for a summer internship to fill the gap between undergrad and grad school -  and it was a totally different environment than I was used to my first 3 years with a shit resume: Employers were more than excited to meet me. Some (no names but mostly large banking companies) even asked me if I'd be willing to forgo grad school if they gave me a decent offer after the inernship.

I could even sense that telling some employers my plans for grad school actually turned them off for giving me a summer internship simply because I am so close to finishing undergraduate that they'd prefer to just immediately hire me.

I feel like had I had the same resume back in my junior or sophomore year it wouldn't be so complicated, but such is the price I pay for slacking I suppose.

Am I fucking myself by doing grad school rather than jumping straight into work? Should I actually consider quitting grad school, will that not gimp my education? 
I guess basically the question is if you think I will actually learn more in Grad School at a top-50 level state university or just working at a large company?

I'm just afraid taking some high starting salary role at a large banking company will land me a job maintaining uninteresting code (or worse, not coding at all) and doing hardly anything innovative, I'm going to grad school specifically because I want to be on the most cutting-edge side of technology and computer science.

72v92h,14,2017-09-27,26 f - what should i do with my life?,sister21,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/72v92h/26_f_what_should_i_do_with_my_life/,"Hi - I'm a 26 year old female living in new york city. I grew up here in the city. I went to McGill University, majored in english (concentration - theater) and minored in sociology and communications. I graduated four years ago.

When I was in high school, I interned at two major women's magazines, and had jobs every summer working as an usher at a theater or at a clothing store. I was one of very few people in my school that interned anywhere. I was determined to get a job in fashion, since it was what interested me most in that period. I also really liked acting and being in plays. In college, I interned at two major fashion designers in the marketing/publicity departments. All this to say that I ended up hating fashion. The people were really unkind, I'm quite an introvert and don't take well to people being mean or rude to me, which I realize now is a huge weakness. 

Cut to after college, I had no idea what to do with my life. I had majored in theater because I liked being in plays and acting - a symptom of my introversion, I think I like being in the center of attention while simultaneously hiding myself. I didn't want to try to be an actress though, because...duh. zero support from my parents and a general unwillingness to commit to the fact that I most likely wouldn't succeed at that, very few people do. I took the first job that was offered to me, at a jewelry company outside the city, in greenwich, connecticut, that I had to commute an hour and a half both ways to. It was a marketing position and a three person team and i grew to despise this job, hating my backwards commute and feeling confused as to why i didn't just pass on the offer and try to get something in the city. although at that point i needed the money, as i had moved out of my parents place to brooklyn and was paying expensive rent. a year later, i was recruited via linkedin to be an executive assistant to the COO and Chief of Staff at a reputable communications and PR firm in the city. I was an executive assistant for about 9 months, which was a very easy and lowkey job, until one of my bosses called me in and basically told me i was too good for it, that she felt bad that i wasn't being 'intellectually stimulated' enough, and they offered to laterally move me into a PR role within the company. I still had no idea what to do, but the film PR department seemed glamorous, so I took the job. I grew to find PR vapid and silly, and hated what I was doing because it involved a ton of pitching and reaching out to zero response, and i found it to just be so ridiculous at the end of the day - the job didn't feel important or meaningful in the grand scheme of things. I didn't think I was very good at it either. I got promoted to an Associate Account Executive in the real estate group, and hated this even more because i was doing publicity for real estate developers in the city who were money hungry, greedy gentrifiers that stood against many of my principles. I quit that job last June to go to South America to visit my boyfriend who was studying down there, to try to write and travel and figure out what i wanted.

It ended up being a beautiful three months, of course, i'm aware of my enormous privilege and what a blessing it is to be able to do something like this. i applied to tons of jobs and didn't really get anywhere. my boyfriend and i wrote a movie together and filmed it when we got back, i acted in it.

then, my stepmother who works in publishing asked if i wanted to take a temp job at the publishing house she works at, since their marketing manager was on medical leave for three months and they needed somebody. i accepted - i loved this job. the people were incredible, so funny, so smart. the job was fun and interesting. this was literally the first time something like this had ever happened. but it ended in december, and as such, i decided i needed to now get a job in publishing - figuring that i had ""found my calling."" i now have a job in publicity at a different publishing house - a super small one - i took about a 10K paycut. I hate it. I'm mostly back doing publicity, and although i was actually promoted three months in (went from 12K paycut to 10K paycut from previous job) feel terrible about myself in the job - insecure, unconfident, like i'm not good at anything. our publisher is an absolute lunatic. I feel like I'm back at square one. I've interviewed for a few jobs at other houses but since my confidence is so low, i'm doing terribly. I'm applying at tons of other places and getting nowhere. my stepmom is trying to help, but nothing's really coming to fruition. i moved back in with my parents since I took such a big paycut, and i feel like a huge fucking loser.

again - i'm aware of my enormous privilege and the insane complaining i'm doing right now. but i feel utterly lost. it's too fucking hard to find a job right now. i feel like i'm too old to get an internship. i thought maybe i'd like to get into editorial in publishing, but i'd have to start, again, at square one, and i feel like i'm not smart enough to be an editor.

i have no idea what i want - should i try to go back to school? i have no idea what to study. should i just keep blindly applying to jobs and cross my fingers that i'll like the next one that comes up? should i try to get a job that'll pay more in publicity, even though i don't love it, just because i now have 3 years of experience in it? should i try to get a job editing?

i just feel like giving up, but i'm also an insanely anxious and depressive person. i'm in therapy, don't worry. 

sometimes i feel like i should go see a career coach, but i realize all my issues arise from my indecisiveness and insecurity. i even took a myers-briggs personality test last week (INFJ) and, after seeing that counselor/therapist is a good career for those types, i started looking into going to school for psychology or social work...which seems so daunting, but i almost feel like i would do much better outside of an office environment. i'm just so, so, introverted and low-confidence right now. i feel like i'm going in circles and i'm never going to find a career or something i love.

anyway, i don't really know what i'm looking for here. basically just writing into the void. apologies for rambling, i have the flu and am going a bit crazy right now.

72vgmu,4,2017-09-27,U.S. Navy Veteran Looking....,__Musicality__,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/72vgmu/us_navy_veteran_looking/,"Hello community,

So as my title says, I am a U.S. Navy Veteran who just finished up four years back this past June and now that I've sort of have had my time to relax and catch up with friends and family and also settle down into civilian life, I now have to figure out my route to a career that I can use what the military had given to me (experience, GI Bill, etc.).

I do have the GI Bill for a solid thirty-six months which means I have a solid three years of free education that I can take, which while I'm attending school, I will be getting paid to go due to a basic allowance for housing. I was a logistics specialist for all four years and decided while in that I would love to continue on with it with school and a warehouse job while I went. However, after getting out, I built my own computer, not knowing a single thing about them at first, but learning as much as I could within a month which led to a successful computer build. Now, I find myself literally always looking at new computer technology and what have it.

This got me to thinking to wanting to do something computer related in any way, shape or form. IT was the thing that sort of came across me while I was looking at classes that are offered for a college right down the road from where we are currently living. Though it isn't exactly what I'd like (Building computers and all of that jazz.), it still involves me working with computers in some way. However, I realized that there is a ton of different IT stuff, so I'm not exactly sure what is what.

I asked a friend of mine I was talking to today about her IT that they have hired and she said that they made a pretty penny. Speaking with her, she isn't the smartest crayon when it comes to computer stuff, so I know there are probably those moments where you deal with the smallest of fixes, but I feel just as long as you're a people person, it's not a complete pain to do the simplest of things.

There's also the whole experience/who you know/degree situation, which can happen in just about any job field. I feel since I have a military background and a great record, that's a great thing to help push me to a nice career. I also again, have free education so I won't be digging myself in a debt hole for pursuing a degree in whatever IT field I can. As for experience, again, the closest thing to computer experience I have so far is building and fixing the internal parts of a computer.

So I guess my question is, for someone who is wanting to get into the IT field, what would you recommend for me? I want to most definitely do something with computers, and of course I would love to bring in as much money as I can. School is going to happen regardless since that will actually be my main means of income, so that definitely is a must. Should I maybe just go ahead and start doing my own internship with some IT group so that way I can get experience while going to school? Is there anything online that anyone knows about that I can do/research on some basics? Are there any tips anyone can recommend to me? I will literally take any advice, suggestions or what have it in consideration!

Thanks!"

 This laptop will primarily be used for college programming classes, Photoshop, and light gaming.

 I would prefer this laptop to have an i5-HQ or i7-HQ, at least 8g of DDR3 or DDR4 RAM, anywhere between 256g and 1t of HDD or SSD storage, and 1920p by 1080p resolution. A dedicated graphics card such as a 1050m would be huge plus, but I'm not entirely sure if games like the ones I listed require that kind of power. At my internship I use a Dell XPS 15 and I really enjoy the form factor; if there is a model that hits around the mark of my requested specs than a Dell XPS 15 is preferred.

My project/thesis was based on me doing an iOS app, and I think I did a pretty cool one, and even load tested it...It's definitely the ""gem"" of my portfolio. The problem is that my thesis chair was kind of a tyrant/asshole, and honestly it soured me on iOS development, and got me to want to look into other areas of software engineering. Regarding what I mean by general software engineering, I'm interested in working with API's and integrating them into apps (i.e. weather/finance, etc.), working on backend stuff, databases, working with Amazon Web Services, etc.

So, I'm debating if I should just put all of my eggs in the iOS development basket, and try to get a job there. If I do, I may be interested in other software engineering positions in the future. With taht said, perhaps being with a good company/team, would make me happy. Regardless, not having a job kind of sucks, especially when you thought you would have no problem finding one with a degree that seems so in demand, and also because the bank account funds won't last for too much longer."

**Test Scores:**

**SAT:** 1310 (660 Math, 650 Reading/Writing)

**ACT**:

3 Attempts

Attempt 1: 29 Composite - 31 English, 29 Math, 32 Reading, 24 Science

Attempt 2: 26 Composite - 31 English, 29 Math, 18 Reading, 24 Science

Attempt 3: 28 Composite - 34 English, 30 Math, 25 Reading, 24 Science

I'll probably send my 1st and 3rd attempt. I understand that my 3rd composite is lower, but I have the highest Math and English scores there.  My superscore is a 30, and 3 of the schools on my list (Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Purdue) all superscore, so that should help me. I would also like your input on which scores to send if you disagree with my thought process.

**APs:** 5 in AP Calculus AB, 3 in AP Physics 1

**PSAT:** Took it in 10th grade and not in 11th, so it won't really count for anything.

**Letters of Recommendation:** 

My AP Calculus AB and AP Physics 1 teacher from junior year are both going to write Letters of Recommendations for me. I am sure they will write good recommendations because I am providing them with lots of information. My multimedia teacher (same teacher for Advanced and Regular) also wrote me a letter of rec. She gave me a copy of the rec and it is pretty mediocre, so her letter of recommendation is more like a back-up in case my Calculus or Physics teacher all of a sudden can't write me one. Furthermore, I am going to make an effort to get a letter of recommendation from one of my high school counselors. I would like these recommendations to show my passion for software engineering and why my qualities in class - along with my passion for software engineering - would make me a great candidate for the schools I am applying to.

Outside of school, the boss from my internship and the coordinator of the place where I volunteered have both written letters of recommendation for me. I will expand on my Extracurriculars (Internship, volunteering, etc. in the **Extracurricular** section)

**Extracurriculars:**

**Software Engineer Intern at the #1 rated Web Development Firm in the Silicon Valley:** Yes it is true, I got the opportunity to intern as a software engineer at one of the most reputable web development firms in the Bay Area. I don't want to give out the name of the company for privacy. However, I learned a lot and got real-life work experience in a field I hope to work in full-time in the future. I was looking at the courses offered for software engineering at many of the schools I am applying to, and many of the courses teach stuff which I did at this internship. As mentioned above, my boss wrote me a letter of recommendation. Furthermore, I was the only high schooler interning there. There were a few other college interns, and college-graduate interns, but I was the only high-schooler. During my interview, my boss was extremely impressed with my resume and my enthusiasm and passion for software engineering, and that is what made her incline towards hiring me. What's cool is that after three weeks, I also got paid! My boss paid me 100 bucks per week via Debit card. I am sure the internship will help me stand out. It is by far one of my most valuable extracurriculars and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Everyone was so nice and friendly and it was definitely sad to go once school started.

**Kumon:** During my freshman and sophomore year, I went to this math enrichment class called Kumon. It taught me to appreciate math more and challenge myself in school. I have received tons of certificates and trophies for my achievements.

**Martial Arts:** I am a second degree black belt in Martial Arts. During my freshman year of high school, I was training for this rank. It was rigorous, but a really special moment to me. After learning martial arts for 7 years, it was a proud moment when I earned my second degree black belt. 

**Volunteering at Library:** I have volunteered for over 80 hours at the library (100 hours of community service in total). Specifically, I have worked with young children, helping them with reading, crafts, and by setting up the auditorium for events. By volunteering, I was able to become more social and less introverted. It also sparked my interest in child development and teaching. Due to my constant involvement at the library, I have secured a ""President's Award"" to acknowledge my service.

**Sunday Cultural Class:** Since first grade, I have attended a cultural class every Sunday. I learned about my religion as well as values and their purpose in life. In addition, I helped make sandwiches to serve to those in need.

**Computer Science Club:** During the last few months of sophomore year, my parents forced me to join a club in school, even though I didn't want to. I ended up joining the computer science club as it was closest to what I want to major in. I didn't like the club much, but just pushed through the rest of the year. I won't write inspiring essays or anything like that about this club, but hey - I might as well put it on my app since I was even involved.

**Online College-Level Computer Science Courses:**Since 8th grade, I  have been taking various online Computer Science Courses on Coursera. These include Python courses, Java courses, HTML/CSS/JS courses, and Java application courses.  

**ACT Prep:** Not sure if this counts as an EC, but starting in 10th grade, I took ACT Prep classes at this tutoring center. 

**YouTube Channel:** I am 95% sure I won't be putting this on my college application, but I have a gaming YouTube channel where I post videos on mobile games, namely Clash Royale and Clash of Clans. I started making videos in 8th grade and have over 600 videos on my channel. BUT most of the videos are really bad (only started getting good at editing about 100-200 videos ago) and I only have 820 dead subscribers. Furthermore, I sometimes use profanity in my videos, even on the video titles. So I think it's best I stray away from doing that.

**Making my personal website:** This website includes my resume and a sample of my CS projects. I coded it myself with HTML/CSS/JS and didn't use Weebly or anything like that. It was pretty simple, though, and didn't take much time. 

**Making website for internet friend:** I'm not sure if I should put this on my college application. I met this dude online and we became internet buddies. I made him a website for his brand (jordanfisher2000.bitballoon.com). This took more time than my personal website. However, I don't know him IRL and my parents don't know I made the website for him. I don't want colleges to get skeptical because of this. 

**Swimming:** Back in elementary and middle school, I took swimming lessons.

**Chess:** I took chess lessons in elementary school.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

**Extenuating circumstances:** I was born with a low muscle tone. Although it doesn't really affect me much now, it did take me a lot longer to first learn to walk and to fully develop motor skills. I overcame it by learning to ride a bike, learning to swim, and taking part in Martial Arts.

**Essays:** I am working on writing amazing essays. I will take the help of my dad (my mom can't help much) and some college counselors to make them as strong as possible.

**Awards:** 

* President's Award for volunteering
* Martial Arts Certificate of Mastery
* Kumon ""Level G by 5"" and ""Completion of Level J"" plaques
* Certificates of Completion for my Online CS Courses
* Other smaller, more irrelevant certificates

**Need any more input? Let me know!**

72x260,1,2017-09-27,"Internship as Contractor, Pros and Cons?",chanelandroses,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/72x260/internship_as_contractor_pros_and_cons/,"Hi Reddit! I just started a paid internship at a tech start-up as a recruiter. It's a small company, about 30 people and I'd say there are about 7 recruiting interns. On the first day, they had me sign a W-9 form that I wasn't familiar with. I'm used to signing w-2 forms for employment. I did some research and found that w2 forms are for independent contractors so now I'm confused as to whether or not this is an actual internship and if I should continue. I was always under the impression that interns are employees of the company and not self-employed.

There are some aspects of interning that are in place. I am mentored by a manager and given proper training. I don't have to bring my own computer and phone to use, and all work is done in their office space. 

However, the fact that I signed a w9 is concerning and I also wasn't told I would be a contractor. Although I could really use this internship, it seems like I'd be getting the short end of the stick both with paying the full portion of my SS and medicare taxes, as well as not being able to fully utilize the my contractor benefits. I'm hesitant to ask anyone for further clarification in case they decide to terminate me and its taken me awhile to find an internship that is paid. This whole thing seems pretty shady and dishonest and I could use some insight. 

Does anyone have any experience with this and what are some pros and cons of continuing to work here? Is this just a commonality in a lot of companies to have interns work as contractors?"

So I just recently got invited by a company to their office after a telephonic interview. The company is a  startup of 10 members. It is a low paid internship in mobile application development. I have experience with working with Android development but not to the extent of a professional. 

Turns out that they have no team and expect the intern they hire to convert their whole online website to an Android application. The job description as described by the founder himself was, 
"" We'll let you know what you have to make, how it should look and you have to implement it exactly"" 
And they don't know anything about mobile app development. 
I am worried because I am not a professional and I still need to learn lot of things, I was expecting an internship to be some kind of working in a team environment. I don't want to mess the work up. 

Should I do this just for the experience? Or should I try for something else? "

72xzrf,3,2017-09-28,Heavily Considering PhD in Computer Science,keepitsalty,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/72xzrf/heavily_considering_phd_in_computer_science/,"Hello all, 

I'm currently a senior studying Financial Economics. I have 22 credits of Computer Science and 20 credits of Mathematics outside of my degree requirements. I was initially a Computer Science minor but gave it up to pursue more math classes. 

This past summer I did an internship with a bulge bracket bank doing investment team support on their private equity team. About halfway through my internship, I decided to apply for a full-time Investment Banking role within the same company, ultimately giving up any chance of a full time offer I had with my current team.

After going through the interview process I ended up not getting it after the final round interviews. So I took a calculated risk and it didn't work out. Investment Banking would have been nice but I'm also avoiding years of 90 hour work weeks. I'm now at the beginning of my senior year and don't have a full time job locked down for after I graduate. 

I'm almost excited though. I've been thinking about pursuing research and a PhD for a long time now. Ever since being introduced to programming and statistics I've filled every moment I can trying to get better and learn more about the field. One thing I don't like is that it seems like when studying finance you're just a cow being herded into the slaughterhouse. There is so much focus on the logistical aspects (network, perfect your resume, land an internship...) that I didn't even know what I wanted to do in finance. I actually want to pursue research more so than finance (which won't benefit me monetarily speaking, I know.)

So I need advice on my profile here. I'm not aiming for the top school, but I want to go some place where I can be a valuable asset. I have two big weaknesses working against me. 

1. I have a not-so-fabulous CUM. GPA (3.1)
2. I do not have the core math classes (Calc I, Calc II, Calc III)

I know those are issues that are hard to rectify. I have been able to convince other professors to let me into math courses without the calc requirements and have gotten A's in those courses. My last 60 credits GPA is *3.6* and I have received A's in all my CS courses. 

Things I might have working for me:

1. Brand Name Internship
2. RA for Economics Professor
3. TA for brand new Data Science Class
4. Manage R tutoring lab
5. Involved in leadership in several campus clubs

I'm hoping I can get some insight on what level program I should shoot for. I'm currently studying for the GRE and have a few solid letters of recommendation lined up with professors I've done research for and TA'd for. 

Is aiming high for Purdue, mid-level for University of Utah, or low-level for Washington State University realistic?

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 I have been recently offered a full-time offer in Austin, TX as a Software Developer. The starting salary that I was offered is 60k, which seems like a huge low ball to me. I want to ask for higher pay, but I have no idea what the proper way to do this is. I've been trying to research the topic but most threads with quality answers involve negotiating salary at a company you already work at or don't really apply to my situation.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    
This is the information that leads me to believe that I am worth more than what they are offering:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    
1. I've had two prior internships as a Software Developer with two different companies, so I at least have valid relevant experience on my resume.
2. The latest internship that I did paid me 5100/month (61.2k/year), $1200 higher than this full-time offer.
3. The median starting salary of Entry-level Software Developers in Austin is 68k 
    (https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Developer/Salary/847835ed/Austin-TX)
4. The salary level for my exact position, reported by over 100 people, ranges from 57k-78k with the median being 64k 
    (I have links for this but won't post them to keep the company anonymous here)
5. This is not a small company
6. I'm heavily involved in organizations in which I do software development, so just more valid relevant experience

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   
After doing research it's clear the leading cause of these conversations not going well is inexperience. I'd love to talk to the people face to face about this but they're in a different city. I don't know how I would approach writing all of this in an email without looking like a smartass that's throwing links at them about their own starting salaries reported by employees. A phone call would be ideal, but I don't know how to get to that. Like, am I supposed to email my recruiter and say ""hey can I call someone about my salary? I don't like it"". I don't want my inexperience with salary discussion to be my downfall here. Please help.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   
Some bonus information: 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   
Degree in Computer Engineering

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   
I love Austin, it's my dream city. This company so far is the only one that has gotten back to me from the city. i am pretty far along the process with a couple other companies, but none of them are in Austin, which is why I'm stressing about this. I want to make this company work, it has great reviews everywhere as it pertains to work-life. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   
Money is not the biggest issue for me (look at above point), I want to work somewhere where I will have an impact. But I just can't see me going along with such a low ball, the fact that it pays less than my previous internship in a city full software developers that get paid much more. "
72yjhn,18,2017-09-28,Should I Leave Engineering?,flamboyantlyboring,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/72yjhn/should_i_leave_engineering/,"Note: It's a long read. My apologies.

I'm 25, and I've worked as a ""Process Engineer"" in Vancouver at a manufacturing plant since graduation (Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering) for three years, but I'm not working towards my P.Eng because no one in the company has one. My supervisor's great, but the organization structure is not established to support us. Learned helplessness permeates throughout the office to the point where new, fresh ideas are met with ""good luck with that one"" or ""yeah, that's fantastic but things won't change."" It's depressing, and I'm at my wits end with regards to doing my job. It's gotten to a point where I had to start seeing a psychologist to figure out if there was something wrong with me. It's something that my coworkers face day-to-day as well. The instinct is to switch jobs, but I don't like engineering.

I never enjoyed engineering school. I was competent (85% GPA), I did co-ops, and I participated in student clubs to bolster my resume, but I disliked learning the material, though the applications of the subjects were interesting.

My interests, passions, skills and motivations include:

* **Helping people.** The only time I enjoy my job is when I feel needed. I get such a rush when I can do something for people, and I want to take this to the next level and effect positive change on a large scale (politics? law?). I am a big fan of BC's current attorney general who was a lawyer representing people from our downtown east-side in Vancouver (a milder version of skid row). Additionally, the most emotion I've felt in recent memory involved listening to the town halls and reasoning behind the repeal of Starkville, Mississippi's diversity act (I'm gay by the way). Also, I've received numerous compliments on my ability to explain technology to people who aren't used to it at work in a way that is easy to understand yet not condescending, and despite my shyness and introversion (INFJ or ISFJ personality type), I've received great feedback on my presentations. Lastly, I've always been a person to go to for fixing up resumés and cover letters. One comment I received was, ""These are my words, but rearranged to sound good!""

* **Acting, Musical Theatre and Film.** I absolutely adore these things, and at one point I was working my day job and then I'd crack open my laptop to edit my short film for another 8 hours (minus a dinner break) for three weeks straight. It was both thrilling and rewarding. Additionally, the emotional connection made from musical theatre and acting is such a breath of fresh air compared to the staleness of work. I dread the workplace because of how devoid it is of life.

* **Efficiency and Design.** I can be obsessive over how aesthetically pleasing something is or how efficient something is running. The iPhone 6 camera bugged me because it wasn't concentric with the curve of the body, but thankfully it's been more-or-less fixed with the iPhone 7 (granted the curve on the 7 is not a constant radius). Additionally, on Cities: Skyline, I've spent weeks hopping into my city, improving traffic and then hopping back out.

* **Science.** These technological advancements made by Tesla, NASA and other companies are amazing. I love how they're improving the world, and I am frankly envious of these people at the forefront of innovation. However, in speaking with a roommate who did an internship at Tesla as a Mechanical Engineering student, I wouldn't be interested in the work at all from an engineering perspective.

What I want out of a job:

* To be part of something that helps society move forward

* Potential for career growth

* Technologically modern culture

* More interaction with people and increased ability to form emotional connections

* Planning and writing. More formal work. I like to read documents and reports

* Increased pay. I'm currently at 55K (up from 45K three years ago)

So where do I go from here?

* Continue with Engineering somewhere else? Possibly with a bigger, more powerful company and work my way up to be able to effect positive change in society? (Not that I see the logic in this)

* Switch into politics, advocacy or law? I have the grades for law school, and I've been practicing for the LSAT, but it's not the most financially savvy decision.

If anyone has any thoughts, I'd be extremely grateful and appreciative. Thanks!"
72yk43,27,2017-09-28,The leaves were gone.,shurdddd,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/72yk43/the_leaves_were_gone/,"So here I was returning from one of my routine supermarket shopping. It was a long weekend ahead so I figured I make some pasta and pizza with my squad. It’s been a really long time since we’ve had had a girls night in.

I usually buy bulk quantities of kitchen and home stuff which would last a couple of months so that I don’t have to keep running back and forth to the store. Salt, sugar, spices, tissues, and well basic home stuff. It so happened that the supermarket had a small local art sale that day where they were promoting aspiring artists, ranging from poets, painters, to carpenters and decorators. Basically decent stuff at comparatively cheap rates. So I bought a bunch of flower pots, lighted bottles and paintings for the house since my boyfriend had moved out and the house looked rather dull without the posters he had, not that he had a lot but now that he was gone my walls looked rather empty.

So as I was sorting through the bags, I noticed something which didn’t catch my eye back at the art sale. One of the paintings had an old bungalow with ridiculous amount of leaves in front but no trees anywhere in frame. I chalked that out to randomness but it was in that tiny detail that my world would be upturned.

Anyway I hung it in the corridor between my kitchen and my bedroom and proceeded to call my friends for an awesome weekend. 
Evening arrives and so do my friends. We’ve got drinks and food and ended up skipping through a bunch of shows on the tv. Everyones everywhere, talking and chatting, a bit more partying than the relaxing weekend I was hoping for but it’s all good. I see three of my friends hovering near the house painting, indulging in what I can only imagine as pseudo-intellectual chattering. 

They see me approach and ask me where I found this painting. As I’m telling them about the art sale and stuff I see something eerily odd. 

The leaves were gone. 

There was no optical illusion or trickery but the leaves were gone. I know I’m no art critic but the odd thing apart from the disappearance was the manner of it. The leaves didn’t just vanish. It looked like someone had cleaned them all up. The leaf rake markings were clearly visibly. When I told my friends this, all they could say was that I’ve had too much to drink. I didn't know what to think of it or what to do about it, so I let it go. That was the only weird thing that night, apart from the fact that the house was cleaner when people left than I had imagined.

The next morning I had completely forgotten about the painting incident.

Now I work in an engineering startup which is into automated housing. Basically so that you can control your house lights with your phone, voice, motion, etc. We had a meeting with one of our clients at this nice little cafe which I didn’t realise at that time was right next to the supermarket where I bought the painting.

While going over the project discussing logistics and budgeting, I had a feeling that I’m being watched which was weird because the only people in the cafe at that time were the two people running it and another person with his back to us and blasting music on his headphones. 

I shrugged it off till it happened again. This time something caught my eye, something which send shivers down my back more times than I could count. There was this wretched painting in the cafe, or so I thought. Curiosity got the better of me and since my meeting was nearly done I excused myself to take a better look at it. That’s when I noticed it. It wasn’t the painting I had for two reasons. First, it was the backside of a bungalow but it was the same bungalow because the leaves were nicely piled up in it which you wouldn’t have been able to see if you were standing in front of the bungalow. Apart from that, this painting had a figure wearing a hat on the second storey and by the looks of it, was walking past the window.

The server brought me back to reality by saying they got this from an art sale which happened sometime back, which I figured. Anyway, we headed back to work but by then the picture had really started troubling me. Returning to my office, work took my mind off the entire thing. We had this millionaire who wanted to have his newly bought house automated. It was the biggest project we’ve ever gotten and we couldn’t screw it up.

Given that it’s a startup, we’re a team of only seven people, we outsourced most of the laborious work. So anyway we had to do a recce of the place, very basic stuff just taking the whole picture in, which helps in budgeting (not like we had to, the client basically said he didn’t care how much it costs) but given how detail oriented we are, we wanted to do this right, this was our chicken-laying-golden-egg moment, we didn’t want to cut it wide open. 

Hari and I were assigned for the recce so we headed out in my car. Now Hari is a really calm driver so I let him drive but this place was located on the outskirts and the roads were bad, so bad that Hari was cursing. And when someone like Hari curses, you know the roads are horrid. The route was 25 minutes off the highway on google maps but it took us nearly 80 minutes via a deserted path.

Now this was strike three to my entire weirdness meter. It practically looked as if we entered my painting.

And there were the leaves. This was just too coincidental. Luckily we reached quite early in the morning, otherwise this shit would have just scared the shit out of me. The bungalow was nothing short of haunting. The painting I had was just too colourful and you would never imagine this place to be so grim in real life if all you had seen was the painting.

I almost did not step outside the car, but again curiosity got the better of me. Also the fact that, regardless of a creepy bungalow, I had to work.

As we entered the bungalow, we couldn’t help but noticed that it was covered in a thick layer of dust. As thick as icing on a cake. I just had to take a look at the backside of the house and so I started walking towards the backend. Hari mentioned that he left something in the car so he went back to get it. As I was about to reach the door to the yard I saw another painting just between the back door and the window. But this was covered with at least some 3 year old layer of thick dust, but by now my painting radar had started working, specially the ones which were of the exact dimensions of the ones I bought. Hari must have been back by now because I heard him walking around the floor above me. So I called to him while searching for something to clean the painting with. And lo and behold I found an equally dirty rag just feet away from the painting and I was like hey let’s fight fire with fire and proceeded to wipe the painting hoping to see maybe the side of the house we are in because why not. As I was wiping, I heard the footsteps again so I called to Hari again telling him I’m right below but he didn’t reply which was odd since the floor above couldn’t be that thick and it was a very quiet area.

Now you know how people in movies scream when they see something really eerie or disturbing or horrible or all of it. What they never show is that sometimes the person is so disturbed or perplexed that they make no sound at all. There it was, the painting in front of me. But it wasn’t the house I was in or the house I lived in. It was the cafe I was at. Sitting at the table with my colleague and the client. And the guy with the headphones on, only the guy didn’t have a face! 

I practically ran into Hari as I turned around to run. He asked me if I was okay and I asked him why he didn’t reply back when I called to him above. He said he never went upstairs and that’s when we heard the footsteps again. I had seen too many movies to know not to check that shit out and pushed Hari towards the door. He wouldn’t have it, he was convinced it was some house help sent by the client. 

So he went up stairs to check. I refused to budge from my position, I could still hear movement. Hari hadn’t even gone for a minute and the footsteps stopped. Again, I called to him but no answer. I ran to the car to get my phone and tried dialling Hari’s phone, but for some mysterious reason his contact info was wiped from my phone. I turned around to look at the house for one last call to Hari, told him if this was his idea of a joke it wasn’t funny and I was leaving if he didn’t appear. I waited for exactly 10 minutes and then bolted. 

I must have blanked out the entire journey because I was at the office. I sat at my desk for nearly an hour before heading to meet my boss and explain what has just happened. 
 ‘Sir, I’m really sorry. I didn’t have a choice.
What do you mean? How did the recce go?
Sir, I left Hari at the house. I couldn’t find him and he didn’t respond to my calls.
Who is Hari?
Hari our planner?
We don’t have any person named Hari, did we hire an intern for this? 
I-I-don’t know what’s happening..
Why don’t you take the rest of the day off? We’ll discuss this in the morning.

I went back to my desk. None of this made any sense, how can the boss forget someone who was there since months. I kept replaying the entire day on my way back home. I figured I’ll track him via his social media but for some odd reason I just couldn’t locate him. It’s like he never existed.

 And that’s when I heard it. I heard Hari scream. It was definitely him. I couldn’t make out what he was screaming. I searched for him everywhere in the house, kept calling his name but nothing. That’s when I realised something, I was hoping I was wrong, I was hoping this was a really bad nightmare. But I approached the painting and I couldn’t have been more right. There was a figure lying face down in front of the house. And it was definitely Hari, same clothes and everything. And on the front porch was the figure wearing a hat.

I was about to take the painting down and dispose it off when I heard those footsteps again."

In the last two years I have held two legal internships and was a paralegal at a law firm and I really honestly did not like the work or the people.

A few months ago I lost my paralegal job and my girlfriend and parents have been supporting me, and needless to say I feel like a bum. I have applied to hundreds of jobs in my field and out of my field. I've applied to local level government jobs, state and federal level jobs, non profit jobs, think tank jobs. I have not been exclusive to any region as far as jobs and I have just not been getting interviews or callbacks. I have been working since I was 13 and this is really getting to me honestly.

My original intention was to start law school in the next year to get everything straightened out and some loans payed off, but that hasn't really worked out. My parents have never been too keen on the idea of me going to law school because of the debt that it can put you in, they are confident in me, but the legal job market sucks at the moment. On top of that I have also had attorneys try to discourage me and not one attorney I know has come close to saying they love their job.

All of this has really discouraged me to say the least, lately I have been mulling the idea of returning to school to get a second bachelors degree in a STEM field, I have been thinking about something in computers. I have friends that are involved in different areas of IT, engineering, and computer science, and they have all spoken highly and encouraged me to consider it. On top of that my parents who were hesitant about me going to law school were very encouraging about potentially taking this step.
Going to law school has been my goal since I was in junior high, but if I am an attorney that is six figures into debt with a five figure salary and barely scraping by, what is the point?
Has anyone else been in a similar situation and how did it work out? Can anyone offer insight into the next steps to take potentially?

I got a speeding ticket in 65 mph zone in NY state for speeding 86 mph.

I admit that I was over the speed limit.

On the ticket, it says I should return the ticket by picking an option: plea guilty or not.

My driver's licence was issued in NJ not NY.

The car that I was driving was a rental on somebody else, but I was allowed to use the car through company agreement.

I am a foreign intern, have been living in NJ for 8 month and had US drivers licence for 6 months.

I am leaving US next month.

What would be consequences 

1. If I basically dont do anything and go back to my country?

2. If I plea guilty? 

3. If I plea not guilty?

Thank a lot!"

I was offered a freelance position for a tech startup based in Cologne. It will be remote. I was given two choices. They want me to join either as part time (350USD per month for a 20 hours a week) or as full time (600USD per month for a 35 hours a week).
Initially they mentioned they wanted me to join as freelance. So I mentioned that this would be really low for me so I suggested something like $1200 USD for the full time position would work for me. In their response they mentioned that they would treat me as an Intern and the standard Intern salary for an on site resource in Germany is $600 USD and the maximum they can offer me is $650 USD. Isn't that low? From what I have seen in previous reddit posts, is that a CS Internship is somewhere between $650-850 Euros which translates to 700-1000 USD.

I am currently a 3rd year computer science student in the midwest region of the US.

I recently saw a posting for an internship position in Paris.

My question is, should I create a ""european"" style resume? do they expect something different from what is considered the [standard resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume) in the united states? Do European recruiters/hiring managers like to see cover letters? 

If it changes anything I am fluent in both english and spanish, and have intermediate to advanced competency in French (speak and read, writing is hard but can be done).

730urd,1,2017-09-28,Which internship to choose?,TheMajesticMoose08,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/730urd/which_internship_to_choose/,"So a little bit of background - I just got my Master's degree but don't have any full-time job experience yet. I've been job searching for months with no luck, but I've been contacted from two different companies about interning for them. I have existing connections at both companies. 

I've been interviewing with Company A and the HR person told me I'm the top contender and they'll most likely make an offer next week.

My connection from Company B just emailed me yesterday and said she has an internship offer with a strong possibility of it turning into a full-time position.

Based off of my read on the positions, I think everything about Company A is better. The work seems better, the company seems better, and if I get a full-time position there, I think the pay and benefits would be better.

The thing is, it seems like there's a greater chance of the Company B internship turning into a job afterwards. I asked Company A about the possibility of the internship turning into a job, and they said they really weren't sure and it depends on the circumstances at the time my internship ends. 

Which do you think would be the better choice?

Tl;dr: two internship offers. Company A seems better and I'd rather work for them but Company B has a higher chance of the internship turning into a job. "

I'm a second-year CCC Computer Science student and was hoping you could help me gauge where I stand in terms of my chances for transferring into a good college. Thank you for reading this even if you don't end up commenting!
         
Applying to (so far):          
- UCLA      
- UCB        
- UCI      
- UCR      
- UCSB       
- UCSD    
- UCSC     
- Cal Poly Pomona &amp; SLO      
- Maybe USC but if I do I have to fill out Common App which seems like a really daunting process after the UC App (completed aside from essays).     
- If I do end up doing the Common App, Harvery Mudd though I don't really expect to get it   
- Claremont McKenna    
- SJSU

         
GPA: 3.756 overall at the moment. By the end of this semester should be a 3.83ish.        
      
          
Demographics: Asian, Male, California


Intended Major: Computer Science     
Alternate Major: For most places, something like Computer Engineering. For UCLA, its Mathematics of Computation (L&amp;S so TAP can help(i think))

Awards:        
- AP + PLTW Student Achievement in Engineering     
- First Place in Undergraduate Research Conference that was hosted at my cc    
- AP Scholar with Distinction      
- Dean's Honors List for every semester I've attended my school   
- Some sort of certificate for volunteering (not sure what to call it &amp; probably not putting this on my apps)    


Extracurriculars:     
- VP of Alpha Gamma Sigma Honors Society    
- Ambassador Program (work 15 hr/week)     
- Software Development / Android Programming internship at local mid-tier company during first semester of cc.      
- MESA member (is this even an ec?)      
- Honors/TAP Program     
- Pathways Program      
- CCCP Scholars Program    
- Set-up a program where students from my cc can go to a local middle school that has historically been academically inferior to all schools in the region, and is comprised mainly of minorities in order to tutor them for free.     


Questions:     
- Should I apply to more places? I really can't afford to pay for out-of-state tuition but I'm open to applying to other California schools if you guys have any suggestions.     
- Is it worth picking up a part-time math tutoring job opportunity or not? I kind of have time for it but I don't want to do it if I don't have to. The money would be nice though.        
- Both of my B's were in math classes (5 units). When people ask for major GPA, does it include math even though im computer science?    
- I tagged UCI, was that the right choice for cs? 

Other stuff:     
- I will have completed all prereqs by the end of the spring semester     
- I can get a few good letters of recommendation if I need to    
- I kind of get that some of my ecs aren't exactly related to my major but I'm hoping that the internship I did early in my college career will kind of make up for that.      
- I'm a decent essayist and I can probably get a good amount of help on the essay to make it near perfect so I think I'm well-covered on that front


I have seen the stats myself and I get that I don't really stand a chance for CS @ UCLA (my first choice) but I'm hoping my ec's can help. But from what I've heard, the people over at admissions at UCLA don't even read essays or the extra curricular section for engineering majors so when I found that out that basically trivialized everything I have been working towards. Every single day, I go to sleep feeling guilty about my 2 B's and thinking about what I could done different. Both of them were B+'s too. I don't know, I'm pretty hopeless nowadays. Anyway, sorry for that. 

Sorry for the lousy formatting too. Don't usually post on reddit. Let me know if any more info is necessary. 

If you took the time to read this, thank you, I really appreciate it!!

731bi3,56,2017-09-28,x-post from /r/raisedbynarcissists. My parents threatened to kidnap me. I'm dropping out of college so they can't control me anymore.,DEV_PER,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/731bi3/xpost_from_rraisedbynarcissists_my_parents/,"So, today I turned 19. Yesterday, I decided to drop out of college. I have no idea what I want to do with my life but I know that I’m deeply unsatisfied with my current situation. I started college when I was just 16 years old because that was what was expected of me. Growing up, I wanted to become an artist/designer. I know that it is not easy to make a living on art, so in high school, I decided I wanted to go to community college so I could get a job. I hoped that I could create a portfolio on the side and still have the means to support myself. However, my Asian parents said that community college was for “losers” and I was “too smart” and “wasting my potential” because in high school, I had a 4.3 GPA and did well on my ACTs. My parents wanted me to be a doctor, and have been forcing me to study for the MCAT for the past three years. When I graduated high school at 16, my parents told me that I could either attend a 4-year university or move out the day I turned 18. They both swore up and down that they never wanted to see me again if I decided not to go to college and become “uneducated trash”. When I started college, they picked my major for me, biology, since it would help me get into medical school. Over the years, I have been severely depressed and on medication, and have had suicidal thoughts.

Yesterday, I decided I finally had enough. My parents asserted that I have no other option but to go to medical school and that I was to spend all school breaks and next summer at home with them. I would also be forced to quit my job and forgo an internship I had lined up. They said they would take me to China to visit my grandparents and learn how to live “properly and with virtue”. They think my mind has been poisoned by Western thinking (valuing individual happiness, following your dreams, etc.) They even wrote up a contract for me to sign, stating that I would pledge my subservience to them or else I would be forced to take a semester off from school to “go to China for an intensive program with or without professional help” to change my personality, beliefs, and behavior. I refused, and my parents threatened to hurt me, so I relented and signed it. However, that “contract” that my dad and I signed did not state any legal ramifications or any time parameters nor was it notarized so I am not sure of its legality. They said I have no say in the matter and they control me because they pay for my tuition and living expenses. 

I know that life will be really hard when I do drop out. For the time being, I’m saving up money. By the time I withdraw, I will hopefully have about $5,000 in savings. I will most likely have to work two jobs, probably minimum wage, 60-70 hours a week to survive. But even that beats having to deal with my parents and my deteriorating mental health. After I drop, I’m leaving and going NC. I just can’t deal with it anymore. It’s not worth staying another year and finishing my degree. Biology is pretty useless without going to grad school, and I hate my major anyway but my parents refuse to let me change it. I have changed it in the past, but could not find something that I was passionate about. I feel like I’m just really lost and I’m worried about whether I’ll be able to survive financially. I appreciate any advice.

**Edit: [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/7356dv/homeless_pencil_10_x_13_inches/?st=j85b8dcc&amp;sh=a04755e8) is a link to an artwork I did three years ago when I was 15.

The work, however, was highly experimental and I wasn't able to gain any simulation/computational experience. My prior internships have all been more general mechanical engineering positions and I feel that I was very under stimulated and wasn't rigorously attacking engineering problems.

I feel that going down the computation road will give me more difficult, in depth problems. I have taken multiple numerical methods classes in undergrad and grad (solving ordinary/partial DiffEq and using different methods), but I feel that my backgound is not as solid as someone who did research using these methods. I decided not to get a PhD since I did not see myself doing 4 more years of experimental work. I would like to get a PhD eventually but I needed to get out and do something new.

So that being said, I have a job offer to a small start up in January and I have time to apply to other jobs and learn different skills. I wanted to try and land a computational/simulation job but I feel I must expand my background.

I have an abundance of Matlab experience and some Java from a class a long time ago. I was thinking that C++ would be very valuable but are there any others I should look into? Also is CodeAcademy a good place to learn this language? Also, I have looked into places like edX to brush up on my numerical methods but am not sure if anyone has had success learning more about this area without paying for a class.

Any advice would be awesome, thanks."

It seems like I have no problem getting interviews (12 total over both semesters last year, 4 so far this semester) but either I have zero interviewing skills or just super unlucky. 

For some background, I only got two interviews my sophomore year and I noticed I didn’t prepare well enough for either. I was lucky enough to get an internship through a classmate connection for that summer. So, for my junior year I made a serious effort in improving in career search areas. I spent a lot of preparation time before each of the interviews my junior year, participated in a mock interview where the guy said I did great, prepared answers to common interview questions, spent a lot of time tailoring my resume and taking it into our career center to get it edited/revised, and just overall having a better plan of attack. Got 12 interviews at career fair, nothing came of them. I’d say about half went very well and the other half were so-so.

I'll start with probably the most important piece of information. I'm a high school sophomore who's debating trying to find a summer job next year, before becoming a junior.

This might just be wishful thinking, but I've spent the majority of my free time for a few years now trying to learn how to write software. I know that this is the sort of field where the best way to learn is by jumping in headfirst, and that the worst thing I could be told is ""no"", but with so many internships and entry-level positions requiring one to be in pursuit of a uni degree, would I just be wasting my time? Would my inquiries even be taken seriously?

I am the _opposite_ of confident that I could go anywhere with my current skill set. Yes, I've made some neat little projects and trinkets over the past couple years, but I'm not sure if I'd have the ability to even start working on a serious codebase, since I don't know if I even have a solid enough foundation to start learning the sorts of things required of a serious job, short-term arrangement or otherwise. Still, again, best way to learn is to slam your head against the wall until it breaks, then take notes on how to more efficiently break similar walls in the future.

This is my passion, and I'm always paranoid I might not be advancing fast enough. Maybe I need to have more patience, or maybe I'm taking a good initiative. I honestly have no idea. So, is it feasible, or would I just be wasting time?"

As the title says, I am 25 years old. This is my third fall out of a strong but small college where I majored in financial information and analysis. Admittedly, I did not do well and had my priorities wrong, graduating with a 2.6 cumulative. In addition, this is an engineering school. While the business school is growing, the finance department does not have the largest alumni pool. That said, I went to a prestigious boarding school that has a massive finance network and I have relied on that alumni association in my networking. Anyway…

I graduated in 2015. I had interned as an investment intern at a major bank as a junior where I analyzed investments, portfolios and made calls to clients as well as potential clients. This is a very prominent bank and I felt as though this was a great experience to have on my resume. I landed a few interviews as a senior but really had no idea what I was doing. I was completely unaware that there are so many different routes and niches and titles in the finance industry. I was not taught to financial model using Excel and it never occurred to me how necessary that tool would be. In the Spring, I received an offer from a company in NYC. It was supposed to be a consulting role where I would be handling investments, pitching books and experiencing plenty of face-to-face meetings with clients. And if you worked hard enough you’d be rich. They promised I would clear 6 figures my first 12 months. So, I was sold and in my ignorance, I took the position.

The twenty or so fresh graduates were expected to make 500 cold calls every day. I learned that on day 1. I barely talked to my “boss” once I got in the office. It immediately didn’t feel right. I was at a desk with kids from every ivy league school and if you didn’t dial 500 numbers a day you were called out by the floor manager. Most of us would dial and simultaneously applying to jobs at hedge funds, investment banks and so on and so on. One by one, we all quit with a better job lined up or choosing to be unemployed as opposed to the hell we blindly signed up for. I quit with nothing lined up.

After that experience, I said “fuck sales.” I needed to get into an analyst position. I refused to every get into a sales position like that again. After a month of applying to jobs with no success, I began reaching out to my high school alumni. I was teaching myself to financial model while grabbing coffee in the afternoon with people that ranged from age 26 to 50, all at different steps in their finance careers. I was told by a few people to find somewhere you can be mentored. That would be the best thing for me. Then I reached out to a person that was not much older than I was but had amazingly started his own hedge fund. He brought me in and we talked about everything. He came from a similar sales background but also turned a $20,000 investment into $200,000 while in college. After a few years in the workforce, he received a small sum of capital from his wealthy father to start his own value fund. We had known each other briefly in high school, he was a senior when I was a freshman, and he said I could come into his office as an internship. I would learn the market, use Bloomberg, analyze equities and learn from him. It was exactly what I was looking for. I did this for two weeks before he offered me a full-time position doing research. It was too good to be true.

I expected to be mentored and taught how to model, project and dissect investment opportunities. It became apparent very quickly that he did not know how to financial model, but he did have an eye for looking at companies from different angles. Honestly, I learned a lot and I am thankful for my time there. Things started to beome... strange, however. The dynamic shifted and his behavior started confusing me. This isn’t the place to go in depth about that story, but I will just say that it became very clear that he was not ready to be a CEO and that if I was going to learn something, I had to teach myself.I handled every duty of the company. Filling the portfolio, making trades, client correspondence, legal correspondence, accountant correspondence and the list goes on. I did not tell him, but I had begun to network again, hoping to find a stable and established workplace. I had just started reaching out to people when he came in and tearfully told me he could not afford to pay me for something that he could do himself. It was completely random and he said the investors didn’t want him paying me anymore. In other words, his father. I was shocked and completely caught off guard.

I returned to grabbing coffees. I still did not have strong excel skills, but my resume looked better and I was able to get in front of a large bank after networking with a VP there. He put me in front of a partner in the institutional sales department, who ultimately said that no one has ever heard of the fund I came from and that I should switch industries if I wanted to sell and then move back to finance when I had sales experience. I thought it was an interview but it was really him just telling me that he did a favor to the VP by seeing me for 30 minutes. Demoralizing? Yes. End of the road? No. I tried to keep moving forward.

At this point, I had been seeing someone for over a year. Her uncle was extremely wealthy, owning his own wealth management firm in Upstate, NY and I had spoken to him a few times about my career path. I spoke to him one more time after my stint as a research analyst. I told him I didn’t know what to do and maybe a technical sales route at Bloomberg or something similar might be best. Or an assistant trading position where I can a foot in the door. Bottom line I just wanted to learn and develop a skillset. He offered for me to work in his office evaluating investments and working in operations and wearing a few other hats to build my resume further and then in a couple months, I would be able to get into a larger bank that was getting involved with his firm. I found people that worked at his company in the past on LinkedIn, and they had moved onto great positions, albeit they were students interning. Long-term, this seemed like the best thing to do. I stressed to him that I did not want to get into wealth management. I hated cold calling, insurance and the overall function of a financial advisor. But the role he offered would very beneficial if I could gain experience performing middle and back office duties while keeping my nose in investments.

Six months went by before the larger bank became involved. Although the work at first was interesting, it slowed down significantly. In short, I did not learn what I thought I would. Time went on and I was ready for my role to change and becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of movement, but it wasn’t my place to say that, and finally the position that he told me I would work into finally came. However, he told me that I’ll be making cold calls, reaching out to clients and building my own book so that I can become an advisor. Its everything I did not want and I am now just unhappy. And lost.

I have three jobs in three years. I do not have a large amount of experience to show for it. I am getting far less traction on my resume than before I took this new position. I am not developing my skills and am not on a career path that will facilitate growth. I’ve basically exhausted my networking resources. My friends from college are engineers and are taking on amazing projects and career paths. I feel as though I am not even on one. I know I’m “only 25” but I’m also three years out of college and am essentially applying to positions new college grads are. I’ve tried to pivot into technical sales but they either offer no salary or are looking for engineers.
I’ve asked myself why does this keep happening? I trusted my significant other’s uncle and am genuinely surprised I was not given the responsibilities he originally offered. He is a good guy and he does want what’s best for me, but I am just confused at how I got here.

I guess I’m asking what in the hell should I do? I can’t quit and add another gap/stint to my resume. I just don’t know. I’m not even sure if I’m looking for advice or just venting. I hate feeling sorry for myself and I think I’ve done well in avoiding that since graduating, but I feel like I’ve been lied to and I’m still at square one. So, if anyone has any advice at all, please let me know. It would be much appreciated."

But the Tier 1 support is outsourced and my job would be to just go to the location and actually physically replace/fix/etc after reading what the tier 1 person filled out.

I have applied to other internships (they are all more Helpdesk tier 1 style jobs at MSP's). Would those helpdesk tier 1 jobs be better on my resume? (Have upcoming interviews with them) 

I feel this job is somewhat IT related and could help my resume but it's not really gonna expose me to the corporate environment of IT since it's all field work. 

What should I expect during the interview? I'm going to be talking to the owner. Not sure what to expect at all.

732tgg,5,2017-09-28,"I have been grappling with several issues in my life, some of which, I believed, stemmed from ADHD. I recently went to a psychiatrist, and following is my experience. I really need help and guidance and I have no where else to turn to.[Really long read]",mindfucked972,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/732tgg/i_have_been_grappling_with_several_issues_in_my/,"Whoever chooses to read this, I am really thankful. I had a major mental break down in the last couple of days and I am experiencing being utterly lost and hapless like I have not felt in a long while.


So for starters, I am male, Indian and 23 years old, currently an engineering student. Since I really started experiencing puberty, around when I was in sixth standard, I started experiencing a lot of different issues. Extreme social anxiety, crippling self esteem, and absolute inability to pay attention. I would engage in extreme escapism, making up worlds in my head, and spending hours daydreaming, making up stories. Anything that did held my attention, I would very quickly get obsessed with it, like going through thick novels lightening fast, but otherwise found myself staring at the same page I had started off with when I sat down to study hours before my final exam. Back then, I simply wrote it off as a mixture of laziness and bravado. Another really fucked up thing that used to happen to me was that I used to get episodes, in which I would have intense nightmares and would wake up, screaming that I couldn't breathe. I have no idea why my family didn't chose to take me to a doctor.


There are certain details that are relevant to my case, I believe. I was sexually abused from the age of 4 to 9 by a cousin, seven years older than me, who used to come to our home. He used to make me perform oral acts on him, and put me in other degrading situations. In the seventh standards, my nightmares were especially centered around him, that he is coming to kill me, and my family would laugh when I would tell them this, half weeping.


Another relevant thing is that my father suicided when I was four. My psychiatrist told me that a lack of proper father figure is also important for development and leads to issues. I dont know what to think about that. My mother was also mostly emotionally withdrawn, facing her own issues. I look back at my childhood, and find myself being terribly alone, with neither friends nor family.


Anyway, this lead me to have a very withdrawn and introverted personality. I had very few friends, and they were all incredibly smart. That also really added to my whole general feeling of being pathetic as I was always on the verge of failing throughout my school.

I guess this is getting too long, as it already is, I find myself cutting back a few paragraphs from my rant. 

Basically, with the inability to pay attention, to drive my focus through whatever I am supposed to, even under extreme stress, really fucked with me. Poor school grades, poor entrance exam results, poor college grades. A complete failure throughout. I would eat a lot whenever I would feel slightly perturbed, and would always realise that I ate like a pig, and would still do it anyway. Obviously, I became fat, which further fucked things up with me.

I tried several times, to get a grip on my life. I would wake up early, go for a walk, eat right, go to college regularly. Try to study, try to socialize. I dropped my BMI from obese to normal, cutting through the overweight range, twice in four years. Maybe I would manage to pull through even a single week of productive days. Those weeks would go on to positively affect my life for months, even years, to come.

But I always relapsed, and relapsed hard. It is then, when I came to this subreddit, as I had always suspected that I have some learning disability, I realised I share so many traits of ADHD, of people who wrote down their experiences, that ultimately compelled me to take this step. It was a big deal for me as their is a huge stigma in India in seeking mental help, and I kept it hidden. After having being compared to my father all my life, I didnt wanted people to think that I have finally cracked and am suicidal.

I shared all of this with him. He was very friendly and warm. He told me that I am facing a lot of issues, and that he would help me unravel all of it. He told me that it is clear that I have the ADHD condition, but we have to face the different issues one by one over a long course. I have no idea what he meant. He told me that I have severe anxiety issued. During the session itself, I disagreed with him, though I did not voiced it, but now in retrospection I realise that I am literally crippled with anxiety in every single social interaction, right down to even responding to text messages. He prescribed me Stalopam 10mg, a drug to increase serotonin levels. Again, having done my research, I didnt liked that, knowing that dopamine is commonly believed to be the culprit behind the condition, or at least the lack of it. I decided to simply trust him and roll with it. I took a pill after dinner at night.

When I woke up, it was an experience that was beyond exhilaration. I could hear the fan, the sound of my breathe, the birds outside. Sound of a thousand thoughts, fantasies, debates in which I represented every side, projects and scenarios that I will never find myself in, in my mind, clashing, filling it up, was suddenly silenced! I thought to myself, ""is this how normal people feel? are they so fucking zen all the time?"". It was literally too amazing, I felt peace and calm that I had never felt before. I was extremely happy and productive for the next few days. A lot of pending chores, and in my remote internship I had somehow managed to land, were dealt with.

I was tiniest bit sad. I could no longer hear symphonies that my mind had made for me, nor those worlds and character came to my mind that used to play around with all the time. But the quite was a much better substitute for it, and I would choose it over that anytime of the day. I began to realise how people could continuously work for hours. And then I actually fucking did that. But that did not last long.

Slowly at first, but I again started experiencing the deluge of mind fucking swarm of thoughts returning, inch by inch. Sometimes it would only be a couple of minutes. Then hours. On the 12th day, yesterday, it came back as a storm, completely crippling me, immobilizing me. I could not do anything, think about anything. I have never felt this helpless.

Today, for the first time, I really questioned all of my dreams and ambitions. Do I even have the mental stability to do a job that requires intellectual effort? My boss told me to lay down the project structure of an app four days back, and I havent responded yet. I no longer feel that I can ever hold a job, at least that requires actual intellectual effort. I have never felt so hopeless before. 

Has any one ever experienced this here before? Does anyone who knows about this stuff tell me what is going on? I have never felt this pathetic.....anyone who has any idea please help me. 

Lastly, I would like to apologies for my English, as it is not my native language. I hardly speak to anyone for weeks, months and I have not had a real friend since high school. I suck at communicating anything to people. Also, there is no time limit to respond on this post. I need help, I have no friends, if you feel life responding when ever you like, please feel free.

732xz8,2,2017-09-28,How do I know I like coding/My future,wolfyking2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/732xz8/how_do_i_know_i_like_codingmy_future/,"Hi all, I realize this is a bit of a nebulous question.  I'm a junior in college, did chemical/environmental engineering for my first two years (hated it), and now I'm in computer science.  I did an edX intro to computer science in python course over the summer and quite liked it.  I also wanted to do/study something practical and that I could do NOW, and CS is pretty perfect for that, isn't it?

I've been very back and forth on my journey so far.  Somedays I really love coding and have great ideas for projects and I just want to envelop myself in my IDE...other days all the languages/tools/technologies I need to know for internships/jobs/etc. seem so damn overwhelming, and just thinking about programming fills me with anxiety.  This feeds on my fear of not being able to find internships or jobs (I have student loans, and this is always in the back of my mind...honestly it is so depressing, they make me feel like I'm trapped) because I'm not experienced enough.  I get so overwhelmed and anxious and depressed, it makes me feel like I want to drop out of college.  I'm decently proficient in Python at this point, but my only project I've done so far is creating a reddit bot.  I'm really trying to secure an internship for the summer, but all I know is Python and a little bit of SQL from a GIS course I took last year.

My other problem is that I often feel that I don't want to be confined to a regular 9-5 office job.  I find monotony soul crushing.  I also love being outdoors; hiking, camping, climbing, you name it.  I know for a lot of IT jobs it would be near impossible to reconcile this difference.  

I'm really having trouble figuring out what I want to do with my life.  Half the days I feel motivated to want to become some type of software developer and finish my education...the other half I want to go do a service year and spend my career/time outdoors.  It doesn't help that I also have constant anxiety that I will never be a goos programmer, I'll never learn all the best tools and technology to use, etc.  Honestly, the truth probably lies somewhere between.  I feel like I would love a job that allows me to go out in the field half the time, and spend the other half in an office/lab.

Sorry if it seemed like I was rambling.  Does anybody have any advice for a struggling college student?  I would really appreciate it."

I'm fairly comfortable with explaining networking concepts, the various roles and features of MS Server (2008 R2, 2008 R2 and I also dabbled with Server 2016 when I was setting up my Pentesting virtual lab) and Linux (My strong suit). Unfortunately, my experience in SQL is limited to MySQL/MariaDB. In addition, I've also done quite a few projects ranging from web development to configuring a LAMP stack (to host my private web server on my laptop. I know it sounds kind of funny).

Usually I shake somebody hand and smile and say ""I'm &lt;name&gt;, I'm a &lt;year&gt; in computer science, I'm looking for an internship this coming summer"" and they sort of just tell me to apply online. I don't know how get people to show even interest in my work or hopefully offer interviews. 

I guess this is more of a social training, but does anybody have experience with this or any tips? I don't know how to become likable enough or really start conversations. 

Thank you so much!"

Potentially useful information:

I speak a little bit of French and I am willing to try to learn Spanish.
I have experience with C#, SAS, HTML, CSS, the Adobe Creative Suite, and Microsoft Office. 
I am learning Java now and I want to learn Python next. 
I currently have a data-oriented research internship at a hospital (I have the offer letter but I haven't started yet).


I see that there is a Fulbright program at the University of the Bahamas, but I doubt an undergrad without an education background would receive it.

I’m a 22 year old male and graduated in May with a degree in Accounting from a Top 20 business school at a public institution. I had a 3.67 GPA there and have a good relationship with many professors. 

I had an internship 2 years ago that ended kind of strange. They offered me to stay on as an intern through my senior year, but I commuted an hour to my university every day and had to turn it down for time constraints. It didn’t end poorly at all, but many of my managers and supervisors didn’t answer reference calls.

Despite this, I got placed in a staff accountant job with a mid size company in June, started in July, and really thought it was going to be a good fit, but my manager and I’s relationship deteriorated because of either my inability to grasp the job function or their lack of ability to train me (I’m not here to point fingers). This reached point where I was threatened to be fired if not for a “good month”,  and after getting the silent treatment all week from my manager, I, definitely in a mistake, resigned effective immediately yesterday. I still a good share of character references from here, but no manager reviews (of course). 

I am really lost at where to go from here. I made a mistake probably leaving so soon, but it got to the point where I rely on her to post all my entries and she would not speak to me, so I wasn’t sure what to do. I handled a lot of this incorrectly out of poor judgment and inexperience. There isn’t a very good reputation with this business, but I still made it worse.

I was going to try and rekindle my relationship with some professors and head back to my internship workplace to talk with some managers about references. I also don’t know if Accounting is a career fit for me long term and think I would prefer marketing or IT as a career path. I am lost and am wondering if anyone had a tumultuous first college job, recovered from it, and had some practical advice. "

735gv2,1,2017-09-29,Requesting some advice in going to a great Grad program in Sustainable Development and hopefully tying it with IR and Int'l Econ!,MeiHX,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/735gv2/requesting_some_advice_in_going_to_a_great_grad/,"Hello everyone,

Looking for advice in the process of applying and getting into a graduate program!

Personal Info: I am from the US and in terms of education have had most instruction in both the US and China.
Undergraduate-California State University, International Studies
Graduate-985 University (China’s Ivy League) International Relations
Worked a few years before I went to do graduate studies. Relevant working experience in relations to my academic objectives is an internship dealing with recycled electronic waste. I have also been somewhat active in volunteering with my local chapter of the Sierra Club and UNA-USA.

Objective: First and foremost, when I was considering which program I like to get into, these are the three areas of interests starting first with the area of greatest interest that I am most interested:

1) Sustainable Development (Loved the environment! Looking mostly in water conservation, green energy and urban agriculture)
2) International Relations (This was my originally my major from my undergrad and took graduate courses in IR. Generalist, no particular specialty.)
3) International Economics (Always liked economics, but I like it to tie into the above two)

I would like to do a dual degree program. It would be best if it can be done partially overseas (Currently looking at Europe, possibly Sciences Po) and in the USA as well. 

Concerns: Problem is my GPA was not super stellar (2.8 mainly because went overseas and the testing system was very different compared to that of the USA), however I took (~7) courses in economics, statistics and some other courses at the graduate level as I was also intending to do my graduate studies in Asia, mainly obtaining Bs and As.

GRE is being super difficult for me. My scores for verbal are low 150s and quants are at 140s. It is taking a lot of studying and I feel the progress so far has not translate to meeting my expectations. I have taken the practice tests 4 times and I am currently thinking of rehiring a tutor.

Financial cost is not my most pressing concern; however, I do have to realize that I like to follow my dream without falling into a debt trap while I am at it. Often financial support/aid are gears towards need/merit; knowing my personal situation I am not sure whether I will be able to qualify for such.

Career Prospects: I will not sound too vain, however when making such a big plan I do need to be very upfront and open about finances. In terms of salaries I have researched from Glassdoor that the positions requiring a master’s degree in the areas of international relations, international economics and in sustainable development typically start out as a $75,000 annually as a research assistant. Of course, I would also like my work to be impactful!

In terms of industries, this is currently in the works. I specifically choose this sector as I believe climate change will have a major impact on human civilization in the 21st century. Water rights will be key to global security in the coming years, hence water and food security sector of work is of great interest for me! I am also inclined to working in the energy sector. Now, since I do not come from a hard science background I am probably mostly limited to public policy, but this might also change if I get to also increase my lab experience.

Schools I am currently looking at...

Don’t want to sound like a doubter, but despite how much time I have spent on studying on the GRE, it seems like the road ahead will be so hard that it is becoming very intimidating. Especially when all the prestigious programs require such high GPA and GRE scores.

Some side stuff which might be important...

2.	Grants
3.	Teaching Apprenticeships
4.	Summer Fellowships
..
May teach as a professor in an actual course.
Many research projects/Research Assistant
Teaching Apprenticeship GIG
Graduate Courses taken, can they be transferable?

73785c,33,2017-09-29,A word of caution to anyone considering the Cross-Continental MPH program at NYU.,nyuccmph2017,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/73785c/a_word_of_caution_to_anyone_considering_the/,"I am in this program now, currently in Accra, Ghana. I gave up other more established programs to be here because I wanted the experience of living abroad for a year. However I believe I was severely misled about the program and want to warn anyone who is starting to think about their applications for 2018. Had I been fully informed, I would not have enrolled.

I'll try to put personal feelings aside and make this as factual as possible, which admittedly is difficult.

General info:

* This is only the second year this program has existed, and that means there are a lot of administrative and organizational failings that you will not encounter at another school. You will not find this fact in print anywhere; they do not advertise it.
* **The summer semester consisted of 6 courses. 4 of them were online. We paid over $40K for that.**
* If you request a tuition breakdown, you will not be provided with one. Tuition, housing, food, etc is all ""bundled,"" so they are able to mask what they pay for individual items. Yes it's a new program and we understand they need to make money to improve it, but from what we are able to discern the difference between what we are charged and what NYU is actually paying is exorbitant. **For example, tuition at the University of Ghana (where we are enrolled this semester) is $1,750 USD per semester. We are paying about $35K.**
* This bundling of fees also means that if you would like to find your own housing to save money (as many grad students are wont to do), you will be unable to do so, as NYU will apply any scholarship or financial aid you receive to their ""tuition"" package and you will not receive a refund for any fees for NYU housing that you are not using.

Caliber of the education:

* Students were accepted to the program well beyond the official admission deadline. I was told by NYU staff that this is because they had fewer students accept than they expected. This resulted in students being in the program that fall far short of the academic caliber one might expect of other NYU graduate programs.
* The summer semester this year was in DC instead of NYC, yet there appeared no real reason for this. The program did not plan any DC-related activities. No public health policy seminars, no poli-sci class, no capitol visits or government internships. We had a few speakers come to give some seminars on campus, but they could have done that in NYC. And had the semester been in NYC instead, classes would have been in person rather than online.
* We are taking classes at the University of Ghana this semester. I'm reluctant to make comparisons to universities in the western world...but I can tell you that these classes will not prepare you to work as a public health professional in the US. The topics we have covered thus far are remedial. It is not a graduate level education. It would be infinitely better if the subjects were taught at NYU Accra, but they are either unwilling or unable to provide the faculty and funding to do so. Yet NYU touted this semester as a ""world class"" and ""world renowned"" education.
* The fall semester also includes 180 hours of field work in the form of a practicum, or internship. Do not be fooled -- these are not internships as you understand them to be. NYU and UG are laughably unorganized in their orchestration of these practicums. We have been here for 7 weeks and there are students who still have not started, students whose internships cancelled on them, students who were not allowed to use the restroom or eat while at work, students who sit for 5-8 hours a day doing nothing because their internship sites do not have work for them to do. The organizations are ill prepared for and/or unable to accommodate interns, but NYU will attempt to sell you on what an ""incredible opportunity"" they are, and the ""insight"" you will gain at work.

This more or less highlights my major concerns with the program thus far. There are more personal issues that I've encountered, such as drinking and drug use among the cohort, religious and sexist rhetoric being spewed at us by UG professors and students alike, not having wifi for a month at our housing location, wifi not working on campus, waiting several hours for software training to begin while they attempt to get us wifi and then ultimately fail to do so...so much of our work requires the internet.

To summarize, I feel that I was led to believe I'd be *learning*, *thinking,* *doing*, and have not been. There are students here who gave up Yale, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, etc to be here and have not received an education that is on par with those universities, though NYU administrators still claim it to be. 

**Tl;dr: If you'd like to get a Master's degree abroad while partying constantly and not working, choose NYU CCMPH. If you actually want to be a trained professional, look to other programs instead.**"

I am comfortable with my progress, and I feel that for myself going a little slower until I am ready for each individual evaluation works best for me.  She is constantly pushing me to get more done, because she feels I am behind.  She says it out loud often, and our clinical instructor even told her nicely that I am just not ready yet.  

I am not good with confrontation, but I know I need to speak to her about this.  I would love to hear how others would deal with this, and what they would say to her.

I just wanted to ask if the seemingly large gap between PhD and Master students is normal (Computer Science in Europe btw.) 

I'm currently working as a student assistent together with (or rather being supervised by) two phd students. I've noticed that the knowledge gap is still incredibly large, although I'm towards the end of my master and have finished all available courses that are relevant to my field (with good grades, so it should not be because I didn't understand anything).

I actually want to get into research and do a phd myself, but can't shake the feeling that I'm stilling missing too much. 

Is this common and there is that much progress in the first year(s) of the phd program or should I rather do something between my master and phd for ""catching up"" (like 1 year internship)?"

Day one, I'm full of energy and excitement, ready to rocket microservices past the competition. I get into the customer mindset, thinking critically about how the customer will be interacting with our software. While I'm coding, I notice a hundred odd faults in the logic, but I focus on how to overcome the legacy errors and deliver the new features asked of me. I apply industry standard practices like testing with example data, to ensure that my code is rock solid. Work through more errors in the legacy code. Management complains that they think code delivery should be faster. I try to present my very best, let's work together to improve the system so we can work faster and harder face. Management rejects my recommendations for accelerating development. Stuck with Subversion. Stuck with remote testing. Stuck with 30 minute build times. Stuck with coworkers who can't Google JSON libraries and try to write their own incomplete, compilation failing ones. I put on a good face and work through the bullshit. Pretend like tomorrow's another day. Apply Agile principles and optimistic ticket pointing, even though I know some underlying system is going to drag this out.

I'll never understand why my coworkers take so long to arrive at the same conclusions about things. I'll softly bring up a note about how certain versions are incompatible, and how we can fix the problem by updating a specific module. Management specifically orders me not to update the module. Months pass. I continue releasing code as best I can, building on top of a platform leaking through bigger holes than the Titanic. Finally, coworkers remark that versions seem to be incompatible. Management terminates my contract.

I really don't want to rock the boat. Even though I'm an incredibly passionate, OCD software developer, I try not to antagonize anyone, and let it alone when I realize I'm working with basically 40yo interns thinking they'll automagically scale clusters with CRLF bash scripts and duct tape. I try to treat people respectfully, because I'm not perfect either. We're all in this together, and hope that we can overcome the many little eddies and burbles of engineering complex systems.

But I've just ended another iteration of a series of six jobs where I just don't fundamentally see eye to eye on anything, it's like they would rather keep epic failing than actually ship working software. I wish I could drink myself dumb enough to fit in better, because this feels really bad. What can I do to become a more effective professional in this space? Is there any place to go, or will I continue to find mass incompetence and ill-informed top-down policy making at other software jobs as well? I've been coding for fifteen years in as many programming languages, published hundreds of packages and maintain 300+ GitHub repos, and I'm considering it would be easier to become a beekeeper than to bet on finding a not dysfunctional development environment. I can accept responsibility for difficulty communicating with people, I just wish I could find a place more welcoming and up to date than all the places I've worked at before. I feel defeated. Burnt out. I feel like I'll never fit in."

I am a Junior and have four classes, two part-time jobs, two internships, and a car.

My former friend and roommate, K, is a Senior and has four classes, no car, and no job.

After a bit of thought, I realized maybe K and I just have a compatibility issue. I'm not bothered by a lot of things, and when I am, I confront them head on to talk them out as quickly as I can. K gets bothered by a lot of things and tends to bottle things up because she needs time to cool down, which is understandable. But, lately K been angry with me, and during her cool down time, she has been acting strange. She has given me the silent treatment until ""I know what I've done wrong and can properly apologize"". Even when I have tried to apologize, especially if she thinks people may be around to hear it, she crouches onto the floor and and starts rocking herself and repeating stuff like ""No"", ""I can't take this"", and ""You're attacking me"". I'm not near her or touching her. However, I have recorded her doing this (although the camera had to be hidden so you can't see much, but you can hear most of it.) Initially, K was mad that I was always at work and couldn't drive her to the grocery store when she wanted. We have a bus on campus, but she doesn't like taking it to go grocery shopping. Then she was mad that I wasn't buying any of the groceries she wanted - which included her favorite ramen, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, etc. She has even gone as far as to place/hide my belongings in different places, throw cleaning supplies onto the floor for me to clean up, and trashed the dishwasher with old food particles because I am always at work and unable to stop her. If I make eye contact with her, she'll tell me to shut up (even if I don't say anything) and proceed to wear headphones to ignore me. At one point, I had noticed she was keeping strange things like my plates, silverware, and glasses/mugs in her room for a little over a day or two, I started labeling them. As petty as it sounds, this apparently set K off into a (almost daily) temper tantrum. She verbally expressed how offended she was, but since she has paper plates, plastic silverware, and several mugs, she labeled her food instead. However, this backfired on her, because there were multiple scenarios where she had me pay for her food (and never pay me back for it). By this time, the food (I had paid for) was already separated from hers. She ended up calling her parents to send her more food ""so whe wouldn't starve"". This escalated when (I couldn't tell if it was her Aunt or her Mother) one of her relatives who lived closer to campus offered to sit in our apartment and watch my behavior and/or ""discipline"" me. I don't have any proof of that, but according to the RA that could have gotten her evicted. To add on, because I sometimes don't get home until 1 am (I try not to be loud, but I definitely know there are times where I am), I make myself a little dinner. This takes probably 20-30 minutes, but K is convinced I take 3 hours. I've stopped making dinner when I come home, but since K is convinced otherwise, she wakes me up at 3 am by banging on pots and pans, yelling, violently tugging on my (always locked) door. This happens any day she thinks I came home late (so, probably 3-4 times a week).

I don't know exactly what to do because despite all of this, I don't want her to get evicted. She has to live on campus because she lives about 4-5 hours away, and the eviction may possibly ban her from all sources of housing (because it turned out she had a history of doing this to past roommates who were unable to prove any of the same things she would do to them). However, I do want to evict her because she's interfered with both my school work and paperwork from my jobs. I know she had been twisting the situation to her friends and her parents (and possibly the RA when we go in for roommate mediation). She had claimed that I had been verbally attacking her (I have proof against her examples via recording) and bringing friends in to attack her (which I have proof against as well). But because she's been all bark and no real bite, housing might let her off with a warning rather than take action.

tldr: My roommate's pettiness has escalated and I am unable to move out until the end of December. However I do have some evidence that could possibly get her evicted, if that's what this situation calls for.

I'm posting this to get feedback from people in the engineering world, to see if I'm looking at the right path and options to combine MechE and Software. Also, how Grad School can play into that. 

-The last bit I'd be curious on, is if my current career path would be too much a problem for these kinds of engineering jobs?

Some background on me

* Graduated with a BS in MechE 3 years ago

* Did a couple of MechE internships with Defense Contractors

* Got a full-time job as a computer-networking consultant for the last 3 years

&amp;nbsp;

I've done very well for myself in my job, but I'm looking at my next step(travel is killer). My favorite part of this and other jobs has always been the technical part. So I want to be able to use my more software side experience (networks + scripting) with MechE.

So far I've mainly applied/looked at Test Engineer roles since they seem to combine a lot of Hardware+Software skills. Are there other roles out that would be a good fit?

I've also been putting together my MS grad school application to different programs with the main goal of learning more controls/robotics.

I know all of this will be even tougher since I've been out of the strict engineering world for 3 years now. I mainly took the networking job to learn more software skills and improve my business/project sense which was lacking when I graduated, and I've been able to lead projects for the last 2 years. So I was thinking that it could translate well?

The mayor of my city offered to write a recommendation letter for me as I have been an active participant in his youth council and implemented an internship program for him. I just wanted to know if this opportunity is one that I should take because I was talking to a friend and he told me it was pointless. He said many kids already get letters from senators and colleges don't pay much attention to them so this will also be futile. 

Do you guys have any experience with this or any thoughts? I'm applying as a comp sci major with pre-med if that matters."

If it does not, please do let me know and i will move it to the appropriate thread.

&amp;nbsp;

4 years ago, for financial reasons, I had to withdraw from my university.  I was a sophomore moving onto my junior year with decent GPA (at least for my standards, 3.7).  I am a business major for a fairly well known university in the states.  I’m an out-of-state student, so my tuition was off the charts (US Citizen living in another country, b/c my family lives/works there).  Since withdrawing, I moved back home and started to work in marketing - my parents knew people so they just let me work.  Started as an intern and worked for the sake of making money.   I’ve saved up quite a bit of money and have invested my money into online courses.  I was always curious about coding so i took a few coding classes and i felt like it was something i would like to get deeply into.  As a business major, I have border-line decided that i want to switch majors to computer science and switch universities as well. 


&amp;nbsp;



As i have worked for 3+ years, I have saved up about $25,000.  At this point, i’m more concerned about graduating than attending a big name school.  Of course it would be the best if i could find a middle ground - a school that is decently known and affordable.  


&amp;nbsp;


I’ve searched around and asked acquaintances, and have heard good thing about taking online courses to get a degree, or apply to a university that proves online courses.  I’ve looked into a school called ‘SMC (Santa Monica College) which was affordable AND provides online courses - which means that i could continue to work and take the classes online in my off-time.  Furthermore, they have a program that allows there students to transfer to UC schools depending on the student’s status - GPA and what not.  This program caught my eye, as I know that UC Berkley has a well-known computer science program, and at the moment, I guess i’m pretty confident that with my GPA from my previous university, transferring into Berkley will be possible.  


&amp;nbsp;


But the catch is, due to the financial difficulties when i was attending university, i have yet to pay off my last semester there.  I owe the school about $20,000.  Furthermore, i would need to pay that amount off in order for me to received my transcript, which i would need if i was to transfer schools.  


&amp;nbsp;


I have a few questions that i would like to ask the community and any insight or answer will be greatly appreciated, really.


&amp;nbsp;


As mentioned above, I want to transfer schools/majors.  If i do, i would need to take entry level courses (pre-requisites) for a computer science major.  Which basically means i have to take freshman/sophomore level classes again.  Would it be better to apply to SMC (or other suggested universities) as a freshman? or as a transfer student with my previous transcript.  IF so, this would mean that i would have to pay off the $20,000 i owe to my previous university.  Don’t get me wrong, i definitely plan on paying back the money, but i’m not sure if right now is the time to pay it off…  


&amp;nbsp;


If i apply to SMC (or other universities) as a freshman, I would have more money saved up and could potentially transfer into another school with more money on my back (to pay for tuition then….)


&amp;nbsp;


I have friends that have attended SMC and have transferred into well known UC schools - Davis, Berkley, LA - and even USC.  One side of me is telling me to apply so SMC and the other side is telling me to finish off the 2 years at my previous school.  


&amp;nbsp;


Besides SMC, i have looked into other universities that provide online courses - like Florida University - which is also apparently very well known, but the tuition is similar to that of my previous university to it isn’t that high on my ‘would like to go to this school list’


&amp;nbsp;


If you all have some advice, university/program suggestions, or any other general knowledge that may be helpful to my situation, it would mean  a lot to me.


&amp;nbsp;


Thank you for reading and wish you all the best :)


&amp;nbsp;


**TLDR**: Business major that had to withdraw from university b/c no money.  Good GPA (3.7), but no transcript b/c i don’t have money to pay off my tuition.  Want to switch majors to computer science.  Don’t know if i should apply as a freshman to a new school or pay off my debt to my previous school and apply as a transfer with my good GPA.  Also don’t know what schools to transfer to.  Im poor and want to finish college.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. "

73gjta,1,2017-09-30,Opinions on realistic grad schools (Astrophysics/CS),blackhole612,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/73gjta/opinions_on_realistic_grad_schools_astrophysicscs/,"I'm a senior majoring in Physics/Computer Science and have been starting to think about grad schools. My main interests are astrophysics, mostly dealing with huge amounts of data. I'm looking into PhD programs at Georgia Tech, UWashington, Caltech, UC Santa Cruz, and CU Boulder, and either Masters or direct doctorate programs at ETH Zurich, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich, and University of Freiburg, all mostly for their astrophysics programs, but am not sure if I have a realistic chance of getting in currently. 

My prelim General GRE scores are V 164, Q 163. I'm waiting to get the actual grades back from my year abroad in my transcript, but roughly have a GPA of 3.4-3.6 in Physics, 3.5-3.7 in CS, and a 3.6-3.7 overall, but didn't do too well in Thermodynamics or Electrodynamics (C and C-).  I've worked quite a bit in research groups, but not many publications. I am last author on one in Astrophysical Journal, and second author on a natural language processing paper in an undergraduate journal. Other than that, the research was mostly just getting experience, some LoR, and to see what kinds of research I really like. I've been in a total of 8 groups, and spent time working on astrophysical simulations, luminosity data from CERN, gut microbe communities, natural language processing, high-performance computing, and on data analysis for a couple of optical telescopes. Most the groups I spent 3-6 months with, a couple over a year or two, and one astronomy group three years with. I only spent one summer doing essentially an REU on gamma ray astronomy, another one on computational biology research, and the third was study abroad. I am doing a thesis on a continuation of the gamma ray project I did over the summer, which hopefully will result in a publication, but not in time for applications.

I have some strong LoR I think, from my mentor this summer, the CS department head at my university, the Honors college dean, two of the astronomy professors I have worked with, the mentor from my computational biology internship, and possibly another professor in the Biophysics department that I am working with now. 

My main question is, is roughly how realistic are the schools I am applying to? I'm worried about my Physics GPA, especially the thermodynamics and Electrodynamics courses. I'm also worried about my research experience looking like its too wishy-washy for grad schools, and the lack of real public results from most of the groups, since my work tended to focus on internal things, like improving the code, making visualizations, doing data analysis that did not end up in a paper, running some exploratory experiments, etc. "

73hxbj,0,2017-09-30,16/17 years old. How much could I make in CS after HS?,AwesomeBantha,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/73hxbj/1617_years_old_how_much_could_i_make_in_cs_after/,"Hello everyone, hopefully I'm not breaking any rules. I read the FAQ but I'm not really sure.

Anyway, I still have two years of high school to go, but I'm discussing college options with my parents. They're really big on my taking a gap year, which I'm OK with (in principle). I have dual citizenship (US and another country in the EU) that has conscription for 9 months (I would do civil service, not military), and they're half-jokingly encouraging me to serve. This isn't a big deal, I've had plenty of uncles who just don't visit the other country between 26 and 35 and get off the hook free. I have no intention of moving there any time soon. 

However, I have a part-time job right now, that pays me a fair bit above minimum wage. If I'm going to spend a year off, I might as well make some money and acquire concrete skills rather than sweeping floors in a post office. I brought this up, and they like that idea as well. Neither of my parents are have any technical jobs whatsoever, but they do want to know how much I might make. I don't feel comfortable talking to the other people I work with about salary-related stuff so I'd like to get an answer here: how much could I earn  yearly in a CS job given my skills?

I don't have any certifications (I did get a 5 on APCS but I know that doesn't mean much). Assume that I'll use LeetCode, FireCode, CTCI, and HackerRank for ~3 months to prep for interviews. 

Here's some information about myself:

* Location: DC Metro but willing to relocate
* School: 11th grade at top STEM HS
* 2 combined years of school CS: APCS equivalent and Data Structures (Java), currently taking Web Apps (NodeJS)
* Fluent (native level)  in 3+ languages (English/French/German/some Mandarin), not sure if that matters
* Won internship that turned into the part time job at a hackathon. Worked 400+ hours over the summer

Here are the languages/technologies I'm comfortable with:

* Java: Used to be my main language until I moved over to Python. Worked with a bunch of APIs, data structures, etc...
* Python: Self-taught myself over a weekend because I wanted to be able to use it on a Monday for my job. Did some more API work, also used Flask
* HTML/CSS: I understand these well. I also worked on mobile-responsiveness in Bootstrap 3/4
* JS: For now, I'm only using pure JS, did some really basic stuff. I'm learning Node in school but it's not my priority because most of my work is in Flask or HTML
* Git/Slack: These seem to be pretty standard
* Adobe CC: I use XD a lot, I'm learning Illustrator. I have basic Photoshop skill 

Looking at what I've written, I realize that this post is *really* long. That said, I'd appreciate some insight.
