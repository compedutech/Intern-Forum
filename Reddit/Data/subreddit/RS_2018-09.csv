Is this a good place to start?",ohmygoshdoitry,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9bypj2/thinking_of_doing_a_fullstack_bootcamp_with/,"Hey everyone, please let me know if there is a better place to post this or to approach the topic!

I currently have an Associate’s and am thinking that before I transfer to a four year for my Bachelor’s in International Affair and Business, it would be great to get a certificate in a field related to technology to market myself more everywhere and have the possibility of finding a job in that field if I can’t in my degree pathway (which am planning for lawyer, paralegal, ambassador, judge, etc)(I am trying to prevent unemployment, but I am aware it may be unavoidable). My ultimate goal is to be in New York, if that tidbit helps in any way.

I plan on trying a bootcamp run by Trilogy (from what I have read isn’t one of the top ones, but doesn’t seem too awful) and will be going into debt of about $12k+ to do it. With no experience in computer science and no higher level math skills (I have not done any calculus and I regret my decision not to have done it in high school), I worry whether this is a good place to start. 

Of course I will definitely do my best to do more projects after the program, take on as many internships and networking opportunities as possible, get a lot of help, and learn more overall about cs theories etc later, but there is definitely a concern of how many corporations and companies out there will take someone like me without a computer science degree to back up the certificate (some do say an equivalent can be accepted with experience, but tend to still have a cs/math/science focused component on it). I would have preferred to work in govt if I got the certificate, but they seem to be set on people with Bachelor’s (as with other major corporations as I’ve looked around job sites). 

I worry if this is a step in the wrong direction. Are the two fields too unrelated and might it be a bad idea to try to pursue a certificate from their full stack bootcamp program as a possible side career?"

The only exposure to sysadmin work I have is when I uploaded my web app and deployed it to Digital Ocean ubuntu server. I say I enjoy web development more than I do sys admin but I am open to getting a job in it to pay the bills while I finish school. My questions are this:

1. How can I make the most out of this internship? I want to be able to code but I am not sure how much coding there will be working with Apache.
2. From the sounds of it most of their stuff is on-prem legacy technology, would this hurt me in the long run if I want to work in cloud technology 
3. How can I make system admin work applicable to CS and if my manager is open to an intern project what should I suggest that I can do that is related (ie. would it be setting up CI tool ? Creating a dashboard to monitor server use? Coding a script for a server that automates something???) 

I would just like to riff off some ideas with you guys. What are some real software needs for a system admin in a linux/apache environment? How do I make the most of my time?"

My current skills are Python (most fluent), JS, React, small amount of Java, and will learn PHP for my internship.

I would want to have at least one good name in my resume before graduation, but will some of the reputable companies out there dismiss my application because I come from a terrible school with a medicore GPA? I also read that the technical interviews involve leetcode easy-mediums, but my school hasn't even touched DS&amp;A yet, (which I am studying on my own) and currently I can only do some leetcode easies.

I only have 1 year of programming experience. I understand that it doesn't hurt to try at good places like FAANGs, Goldman Sachs and Palantir, but since I'm not an avid programmer and come from a shit school, are there any more fitting places for current sophomores I haven't heard of? Or am I just grossly underestimating myself?

In August, I was out of the country and by mid month they still haven’t paid. I was ignored by the girl I usually dealt with, but one of her friends living with her said they needed another week, so I didn’t pursue until August 22. Turns out she basically ran away. Our whole place stinks of cigarettes and weed, which is absolutely not acceptable in our place. My roommate’s stuff was shoved away and her desk stolen. Our entire apartment is filthy and there are several things broken. 

I never got a decent written contract, but I had wrote them tax letters stating how much should be paid. Since they never paid this amount, could they still use it in taxes? I don’t know what to do. The only info I still have on her is her student card and number. I doubt the school would be willing to help out in this matter either.

I recently interviewed at a company on Thursday. It went really well and they sent me a job offer later that afternoon. I told them I needed to get approval for the job from the internship program at school and I would get back to them in a few days. 

I had another interview today (Friday) that also went really well but they said the head engineer who would have the final say was on vacation and would be returning this weekend. And they might have me come in again to meet with him as well. So I'm expecting a timeline of around a week or so regarding a response from this company. 

I am more interested in the job from the second company but I have concerns about making the first company wait for so long. My dad is saying I should just take the offer right now before they find someone else for the position instead of risking losing the first opportunity if the second one doesn't pan out. The start date for the first job is September 10.

Any advice? Would it be bad if I explained I needed a few more days to think about it? Should I tell them I was interviewing at other places or keep it vague?

Tech job: computer science. the lifestyle sounds great, seems like there's variety in the types of jobs there are, and I think it might be cool to work in the tech field. only problem is, I've done some coding on Code Academy, and I don't really like it.

Drawing/Art job: only major I can think of to find a job is graphic design. I like drawing as a hobby, and might like it as a career, idk. could continue as a hobby though. seems like the most fun but I don't like digital drawing much, and graphic design seems like that.

Government job: not a fan of politics and idk if I'd be interested in it, but I'd like to learn about laws and about law makers. maybe wouldn't like a job in it though...

Open a restaurant: am considering this. I wouldn't necessarily need a degree for it, and could plan on it in the future.

Career counseling job: I would like this type of job; helping people with their career choices, since I've looked at just about every career out there. but it seems like there's not many jobs for career counselors as opposed to mental health counseling. also average pay ($40-50k) seems low for me.

does anyone have advice for any of these job fields? I would like variety in my work and would like an interesting work environment (not cubicle). I'm not a fan of client type work - like working with the public, in healthcare or anything, and I'm somewhat introverted. I'd like a good average salary, around $80k after a couple years. any advice or suggestions would be appreciated, thank you :)"

I was abusing hard drugs, flunking classes, and overall living purely for the moment due to mental problems and immaturity . I developed a reputation of being the loser and burn-out amongst my peers/ex's. I regularly overhead people say things like ""he's going nowhere in life"", ""he's such an idiot"", etc. This obviously affected me over time and completely wrecked my self-esteem.

Sometime in college I got my act together and did a complete 180. I snagged great internships, dean's list, got fit, became really social, and landed a 6 figure job right out of college at a top company. Almost every single person I knew who enjoyed looking down on me was now significantly less successful career wise out of college.

Sorry for being so upfront about it, but I got to a point in my life now where I hate the fact that we stigmatize depression so much. By talking openly about my experience, I’ve learned that so many people out there have felt like I felt at some point in their lives. So many more people have battled depression and suicide than I ever could have imagined. I wonder if I had known that, if maybe it would have helped me through back then. If I had known that if I could just be open and talk to someone about my struggles, maybe I would have done that instead of trying to take my own life. But back then, I believed that to be depressed was to be weak, and to be weak was to be broken, and to be broken was to be defective, and to be defective is to be unworthy of living in this world.

A lot of things came crashing down on me all at once. I don’t want to talk too much about it just yet. I haven’t gotten myself there. But I thought I finally reached the end of my rope, so one night, I tried to kill myself. I went in the hallway closet and took every pill I could find. I scavenged through my bathroom and read every label; I took everything that had a poison control warning, put it in a water bottle, and chugged a disgusting suicide smoothie. I wanted to make sure that there was no possible way I would see another day in this ugly, ugly world.

And the worst thing imaginable happened after that night: I woke up the next morning. My alarm for school went off. The sun was shining in my windows. I heard my parents talking amongst themselves in the kitchen downstairs. I was still alive.

I didn’t know how it was possible, but I was still here, and I was pissed. The only sign that all of the crap I had put in my body had any effect on me whatsoever is the dark red clot of blood that I spit out into the sink after I brushed my teeth. Well, maybe some damage had been done. Maybe I’m still alive today, but hopefully that at least considerably shortened my life span.

What could I do? What choice did I have but to keep living this life, to get through one more day, and maybe try again that night? Still, on my way out, I stopped by that hallway closet again and crammed a few more pills down my throat. Maybe I just needed a little something to put me over the edge, and I would black out dead at school. I could hope.

But I didn’t. I made it through the school day. And for some reason, all of the reasons I was dreading it, all of the reasons why I was driven to attempt suicide the day before, they all started to resolve themselves. I tried to kill myself the night before. And then I went to school, and I actually had a really good day.

It was an alarmingly good day, actually. I did well on the test that I didn’t actually study for - I figured I didn’t have to study, because I would be dead for it. The friend I was fighting with wanted to make amends. I had volleyball practice after school, and the coach that I thought hated me informed me that I would be starting our next match. It was the best day I had seen in God knows how long.

And the weird thing is, it didn’t stop there. When I came home that day, I looked at the empty pill bottles and the water bottle I had chugged, and I found that I didn’t really want to try again. And the days kept getting better. I got straight As that semester. I made tons of new friends throughout the rest of my high school career. I became a standout on the volleyball team, and even got attention from college recruiters.

On the surface, this sounds like the classic positive, encouraging message - you know, that suicide doesn’t eliminate the chances of your life getting worse, it eliminates the possibility of it ever getting better. Because I attempted suicide, and it didn’t work, and I should be thankful, because my life is so great now.

But I’m fucking terrified.

I’m terrified, because overnight, my life suddenly got too good to be true. Everything worked out for me. I got into a good college on an athletic scholarship, and I became a starter. I got a 4.0 GPA in college while playing volleyball and working a part-time job in graphic design, a career I always longed to pursue. I got the internship of my dreams. I made amazing friends. I watched amazing movies, and heard amazing music. And before graduation, I landed the perfect job at an incredible salary.

This can’t possibly be real.

There’s no way my life could improve so drastically, so quickly, unless something was up. This can’t be real life.

As things kept getting better, my state of mind kept getting worse, because I grew suspicious of every little thing that went my way. I could neglect to study for an exam, and come away with a near perfect score. I could make a lazy play in a game, and it would somehow land on the other side of the court for a point. No matter what I did, it ended up being the right thing. No matter what I tried, I ended up being good at it. It was like my life was suddenly incapable of being bad.

It was all too good to be true. It couldn’t possibly be true.

Suddenly, the good things in my life gave me panic attacks. Suddenly, I wanted bad things to happen to me, just to prove that they could. Because I had so much worry… I was so terrified. My mind kept going back to that day, that day in high school that I tried to kill myself. There’s only one possibility, one explanation - that I had done it.

The only logical explanation is that my parents found me the next morning, sprawled out in my bed, dead as a doornail. That the people I had grown so close to, the friends I never thought I would have, mourned me at my funeral instead of laughed with me in the halls during our senior year. That my parents sat at the table in grief every year on my birthday, wishing to have me back instead of celebrating with me and going out to eat at all my favorite restaurants. 

The only logical explanation is that I had done it. I had killed myself, and this life I’m living now isn’t real. It’s too good to be real. This has to be heaven.

But how could it be heaven? Because suicide is a sin. If I had killed myself, I would be in hell.

Unless, maybe this is hell. All of this worry, and fear, and panic attacks… maybe hell is giving you all of the good things you always wanted, until you drive yourself crazy wondering what you did to deserve them. I don’t deserve any of these good things. I’m still the same defective kid I was when I took all those pills. Why would god be looking out for me now?

This had to be hell, because the more I thought about it, the more I lost my mind. And I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

I was no longer happy. I was miserable. I laid awake every night and thought over every tiny little thing that has happened in my life since that day I tried to kill myself. I tried to remember anything in my life that had gone wrong. Anything I wanted that I hadn’t received. I couldn’t. Which means this couldn’t be real.

It felt like *Inception*, a little bit. My life felt like that spinning top. If I were dead, it would be spinning forever. If I were alive, it would topple. It wouldn’t topple until I thought of someway my life had gone wrong since that day.

I drifted further and further into this insanity. I took notebooks with me everywhere I went, at the ready, prepared to take note of any tiny little thing that went wrong. Maybe I would step in gum. Maybe I would get caught out in a rainstorm. Maybe I would misplace something important to me. Anything. I wanted anything to go wrong in my life.

I started trying to get things to go wrong in my life. If there was rain in the forecast, I would sit outside and wait to be drenched, but the sky would always clear. I would try to go out of my way to stick my foot in a nice pile of that bright pink bubblegum, only to find out it was dried up and didn’t stick anymore. I couldn’t make bad things happen anymore.

The better my life was, the worse it was getting. This had to be hell.

I kept going back and forth, trying to convince myself that this was real life. Trying to find ways to prove that I was actually alive. When I pinched myself, it hurt - did that count?

I thought about all of the people that I had talked to since deciding that depression shouldn’t be stigmatized anymore. Maybe the reason I had found so many people like me, who have battled depression, who have tried to kill themselves, is because we all succeeded, and we were all paying the price for it in hell, together.

I realized that there was only one way to find out for sure whether or not I was alive. I had to try to die. In a way that couldn’t be denied. No pills or suicide smoothies that I could reasonably wake up from. I had to find a way to make sure that I died. If I didn’t, I would know it was hell all along.

But what if I did? What if I did die, and I had really been alive this whole time? What if I really have just been living this wonderful life, and I should be happy that I stayed alive for it?

But I wasn’t happy. Not even close. I couldn’t keep living like this. I couldn’t live not knowing. I had to know, or I had to die.

There is only one thing left to do. It’s time to climb to the roof and see if I can fly."

I've been at my first job after college for ~1.5 years, and my daily duties lately can be classified as 70% SRE and 30% support engineer tasks to help manage software stacks and resolve some product issues.

My concern with my position is that most of my tasks, though fast-paced and diversified, are mostly operational (vs. engineering work) / ticket work, and it's too close to an Operations role than I'm comfortable with. Having been a SWE in internships and previously, I'd really want to switch back to it.

- When I look at LeetCode problems, I've found that my coding skills have become rusty since I graduated -- and I'm literally panicking and even a bit depressed when realizing how dumb/slow I am; 
- I have little experience with OOP design principles and maintaining any sort of large (10k+ LOC) projects.

I'm concerned that both of the above will hurt my chances in interviews.

What is my recommended course of actions in this case (other than going thru CTCI / LeetCode)? Or am I kind of stuck in my position before I try to pick up more dev work at the current company first?

Thank you!"

9c9u8o,345,2018-09-02,Struggling as a junior engineer on a seemingly elite team full of senior engineers,1934escapes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9c9u8o/struggling_as_a_junior_engineer_on_a_seemingly/,"I just started my first full time job at a large tech company. I interned on the same team I'm on now, but things recently got restructured so that now, the team is made up of nearly all senior engineers. On my immediate team of 7 engineers, we have 4 senior level devs, two really legit level IIs, and then me... a fresh-from-school new grad.

It's not just that they're senior, though, it's that this team and the people on it seem to be highly respected in our organization. For example, when I asked someone from another team how we're perceived, they said my team is ""like the Seal Team 6 of [org]... like, when there's a problem no one can solve, we send it to you guys."" Another time, I opened an email from a guy on my team, and my friend commented, ""Wait, he's on your team? He's like, really high up."" And that guy isn't even the most senior dev on our team!

I know that this is a great opportunity to learn from people who are apparently highly regarded. However, I'm struggling to keep up. The day I got here, my manager gave me a very large, very visible project with very little instruction and no infrastructure in place, and then basically asked me to gather requirements for it and figure out what the architecture for it should look like. I ended up successfully coming up with an architecture for it over the past two weeks, but it was really, really nervewrecking and stressful, and I had to ask for a lot of help, since I don't even know what technologies are options for us to use (I don't have a technical mentor assigned to me or anything).

I think my manager has a lot of perhaps-ungrounded confidence in me--I did really well during my internship when he was my manager (I ended up completing two projects instead of just the one he initially assigned to me). When he went around and introduced me to everyone, he told someone what I was working on, and then commented, ""This is /u/1934escapes, and she's going to be owning [feature] from now on. We're looking to get it done by [deadline in two months] but, you know, it's /u/1934escapes, so it'll probably get done in two days.""

Of course it's nice to hear that sort of compliment, but I feel so much pressure because of it. I panic if I'm not getting pull requests out at least every other day, I felt terrible because I didn't get my first pull request in until my second week, and I'm still freaking out over the sheer scale and visibility of my first project, especially since I'm on it alone.

I think my manager doesn't seem to understand what needs I have as a junior engineer; I feel like I'm being treated the same way the senior engineers are treated. When we get a bug in, he'll be like, ""Who can take this one? How about /u/1934escapes?"" And then I'll be looped in on really intense email threads and people start asking me tons of questions I don't even know where to find the answers to, and then I have to bother the senior engineers, and then they'll explain something to me in a really convoluted way using lots of vocab I don't recognize, so I have to stop them every two minutes and ask a clarifying question, and then when the explanation is over I go back to my desk and quite frankly still don't know basic stuff such as, for example, what the filepath for the feature they want me to look at is even located. So then I have to go back to them again.

I know some of this is normal, but I feel like I'm being given a lot of responsibility with very little support. I just feel so envious of a new hire in the next team over--she got to start off working on a small bug, and her mentor sits right next to her and she can ask them questions whenever! And her mentor is a cool young woman--my mentor is an older dad who's been at this company for 20 years and has his own office down the hall; I have to knock on the door to talk to him, he doesn't seem to understand how much of all of this is new to me when he explains things, and he doesn't even know any technical details about my project--in fact, no one but me does. I don't even think my manager knows what components are going to be necessary for what he's asked me to do. It's only been three weeks and I feel miserable and overwhelmed.

Am I in over my head? I expressed my concerns to my manager in my one-on-one and he told me not to get stressed; I'm not sure he understands just how stressed I am about all the responsibility he's assigned to me so soon. I'm just worried that my manager seems to think that because I did well during my internship, I'm some whiz kid who can play with all these senior engineers, when really I feel like I'm completely floundering. I think I could do it if I had a mentor who understood my project, and whom I could ask for guidance, but right now all of my help is just the result of me going up to people's desks and asking if they can help me with a one-off question.

If you were in this situation, how would you approach it? I want to be able to rise to the challenge, but I just feel like I'm barely hanging on.

TL;DR I'm a new grad engineer on a team full of really legit senior engineers. I was given a very large, very visible project on my first day, and I don't have a technical mentor who I can go to for help; all of my help is just me asking random people on my team questions. I feel overwhelmed and miserable. How can I make the situation better?"

Throughout most of my college life, I've been commuting 4 hours everyday back and forth from home to school and it has started to take a huge toll on me, especially with the fact that my family makes poor life decisions that leads to fights and would always lead to anger no matter what happens. It makes it rather difficult for me to live on with life at times, though the obligation to get my degree remains strong and a high priority for me to keep moving on.

Due to this, I rarely feel truly feel happy as I rarely interact with anyone. I've always been afraid of the amount of loans I'm taking because of school in addition to my sister berating me for the amount of debt I'll be in, hence why I never dorm but now, it's living like this everyday for the past 2 years has really worn me down and I'm not sure what to do as my first step. I do want to establish some sort of income for me on the side so I can financially support myself, not rely on my parents so I can cut them off of my life but with the workload I have this semester, I'm not sure if I'll have the time neither the mentality to tackle school and work. I used to have a part time job during my sophomore year but I didn't save any money from it because I suck at saving and I resort to spending money on expensive food as a way for me to cope (also because my family can't maintain the kitchen well so it's hard to cook at home when there's roaches all around). That job, though my boss was nice and a bit lenient, was really stressful due to the amount of responsibilities that I had to do, serving as a counselor for my boss as well, so I was severely depressed at that time. My work ethic for my job and my workplace was down the drain due to it but through it all, I was able to network with a local city representative through the job and attain a summer internship in government (which was why I quit my job).

I've determined that I'll dorm this semester but from that point on, I'm not sure if I should work on the side. I also really want to get a Master's degree but I'm not sure with where I stand mentally would that be a feasible path. I know that I want to simplify and build up on my work ethic but I'm really not sure what's the right path neither have I felt truly happy with my university as well. "

I have always had a strong interest in *making things* so I know some kind of engineering field should fit me. I also **really** love computers for how much they can enhance our life. I am currently in a dilemma to choose my next path.

I started learning programming when I was 13 and I still work on projects during the weekends. Like most programming teen, I went into the xXxAnonymousHax0rxXx phase, did some shady stuff with my school's management system and I learnt a lot. Recently, I got invited by the president of the Student Council, to *hack* the school's new student report system.  I also frequently troubleshoot my friends' computers, so most people would consider me computer-savvy. In fact, it was an identity that I flaunt so much that my previous senior's told his employer about me and I got myself an internship right after I finish my studies in high school next year.

I have also taught myself 3D modelling (through game development) and graphic design (through web development) in the process.

For the record, I don't have much experience in electrical engineering because I don't really have resources to do so. I find it fascinating to see how companies come up with a new smartphone, laptops, smart TVs and many more devices with better technology each release. I want to be a part of that so I am currently reading the basics of EE, in case I ever choose it as a major.

&amp;#x200B;

I do see myself smelling the solder while working on embedded systems to create new consumer products. I also wouldn't mind staring at a screen all day long to work on a new breakthrough software.

I don't think I care all that much about money since both these majors should get me a decent pay and I'm mostly a money saver. What do you think? Which one should I take?"

To be totally honest, I don't mind it too much, but I dragged my long term gf / soon to be fiance along for the ride and she absolutely hates it due to the fact that outside of the beach and hiking (which is over when the sun goes down), the rest of your social life sucks, or at least that's how it feels coming from a larger metro area where people frequently do things like brunch, happy hour, paint night, intramural sports, etc. ....... which just don't really exist here.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have opportunities to go back to D.C., but I'm not very interested in going back to somewhere I've already been because I feel like that's just putting me in a position to settle down there permanently, plus i'd like to transition out of the government contracting scene into the commercial scene .... because the government projects are usually all web-application projects that are super outdated and not very challenging. 

&amp;#x200B;

For these reasons, I am interested in trying to make the transition now and just moving to SF/SV from here which I believe will be easier to do than moving there from the east coast. However, all I ever see is the ""Big 4"" and honestly I know that's a long shot. I work as a mid-level dev but transitioning into a more challenging environment I believe i'd be better aligned with a junior role. My data structures and algorithms understanding is pretty solid and I can handle most of the problems I look at but I doubt I have the skill set to crack into the Big 4 right now. I have been accepted to OMSCS for the spring and I plan on studying Machine Learning or Computational Perception &amp; Robotics .... basically, I'd like to work with AI in the future. My plan was to transition into SV when I finished, but If i can do it now, I don't see why I should wait. 

&amp;#x200B;

so basically, I am trying to find decent companies or some resources .... like a Reddit post that point out places to land dev gigs at out there that will pay me enough to not be homeless (like low 6 figure range ... maybe high 90's), also, since I don't really know what the actual market rate is out there outside of the Big Companies though i'm looking for some up to date information on that as well, so I kinda know what to push for when discussing pay. I have around 3 years experience primarily Java, Full-Stack, Web-Apps  and I graduated from a state school that nobody cares about w/ a BS in CE .... however, I did get accepted for a NASA internship while I was there which does seem to get my foot in the door quite a bit. Lastly, I'm looking for opinions as to whether or not its even worth it, like is the scene too over-saturated and stuff? YES, I understand its expensive but so is Hawaii .... and its boring here, I'd gladly pay a few extra bucks and live in smaller, uglier space for a better social life, besides, what does it really matter what your apt looks like if there is plenty to do and you're never there?   

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

&amp;#x200B;

**I am looking to relocate to SF/SV and want to ID some commercial companies that I'd actually stand a chance at applying to outside the big 4, the  actual market value for normal programming jobs outside of the Big 4, and is the move worth it ... or a waste of time.**

* student programmer
* getting A.S. in programming end of this year
* slowly building up my network through Meetup and Slack
* have some small projects on Github, nothing big, Js and Angular 2+ based
* Have all that\^ on a resume

Here's my situation:

I live in north central Florida and the closest city with the biggest web dev presence is Gainesville. I live in Ocala. Combined, the two cities offer about 20-40 web dev jobs, with only a handful that are entry level.

I recently went to a meetup of one company who were so far the only ones offering internships, which go out in October. Speaking with the recruiter, he told me that it was a paid internship, and that his company was looking for React, PHP, and Node skills. My skills are mostly novice Js and Angular with familiary in C# and SQL. I told him about my projects but he didn't seem availed to consider me. Don't get me wrong, he was a nice guy, and told me to keep in touch. 

I'm currently still developing my Js and Angular skills on a personal project while continuing school. 

I don't think the chance of his company hiring me is good unless I cram PHP/Node/Reach into my head over the next two months. But be that as it may, they could have a future position opened where I could have acquired the skills needed at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my dilemma:

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned, there aren't many jobs in my area, and the ones that are here have varying tech stacks like one has C#/.net, another is Reach/PHP, a few have Wordpress, another lists everything under the sun, etc.

Going after one position fees like putting all your eggs in one basket

How do I know that said company, if I learn the skills they want, will even hire me, or have the position available by the time I feel qualified to apply?

And if I don't succeed, what do I do? Forget months of investing in learning a technology to chase another company wishes and repeat the risk?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I would hate to abandon my project when I'm just starting to get a better hang of angular, especially when it took days for me to wrap my head around its component and module system.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm stuck in paralysis of the analysis again. Any help would be appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I have a stay at home wife and three kids. Time for investing in a technology is limited, which compounds my dilemma.

9cf6up,9,2018-09-02,On Campus Interviews See Major Decline (~40%) - Colorado School of Mines,Ryan80303,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/9cf6up/on_campus_interviews_see_major_decline_40/,"I graduated with an engineering degree last year and definitely put a lot of time into finding a full time job. Had it not been for pursuing internships early on in college, I don’t think I would have been so fortunate. As we roll into September I want to stress to all students (especially those in their freshman year) to take career development and networking seriously. That is by far the number one piece of advice I wish I would have received my first day of engineering school.

Now into the discussion about some interesting statistics from the Colorado School of Mines 2016-2017 Annual Report (https://3a2vzv37nkuw3esf6a3u2t7s-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/careers/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/05/2016-2017-Mines-Career-Center-Annual-Report-_-Public-with-Appendices_f0518.pdf) 

On page 18 of the report a study was conducted on the number of on campus interviews conducted annually for the last 10 years.

To summarize, interviews have declined to a 10 year low of ~2700, down from ~4500 in 2014. I was accepted into this school, but did not attend and I remember a huge selling point was the strong career services team that was in place at the college. From what I’ve see on this subreddit, struggling to secure jobs/internships isn’t just an issue at CSM.

I want to hear everyone’s thoughts on why there has been such a sharp decline in recruiting over the past 3 years? Is it due to the oil and gas downturn? A rise in online presence of companies deciding to limit university visits? A combination of those and potentially other reasons?

This goes to show that students need to advocate for their own careers and not rely on university career services departments to secure jobs and internships.

I'm currently 21 winters old, and live in the Netherlands. My AOE would be in IT.

Soo.... To keep things short, let me make it clear that I want to start a business because I beleive I could do it better than the competition.. Yes, there would be alot of competition since I'm considering starting my own consultancy firm for Automation of manual IT tasks that are being performed by those company specifically. This means if company 1 does alot of A, F, K, and Z, we will automate that for them. Whereas company 2 might do alot of B, C and P.

Now I actually do have a pretty solid basis experience-wise. Building the proper connections and mailing 1093939292 companies will probably be my boggest challenge. I've worked for Microsoft as a PSE for EMEA, where I gained knowledge of large enterprise environments. I've worked as a ICT consultant on the Microsoft stack, and VOIP etc as well, here i gained great insights since it was a small company, which started with 0, and served the majority og our region woth consultancy and managed services. Currently I work as an Automation engineer for Fujitsu, whom in turn hosts the IT for one of the biggest corporations (think banks, government and financial institutes), where i basically am end to end responsible to develop and demo the automations we create. Beside this i've got minor experience with IT infrastructure within schools, gained during internship of my (low level) IT studies.

Now, dont get me wrong, im not planning on giving up my current career and YOLOing into my own company. I still provide for my younger brothers and single welfare mother, so I want to work, and get the business in its babybeginninng-phase while still working (40 hours, 12hrs travel), and being able to carry the burdens.

So...Yes...I actually do beleive i can help medium to larger sized companies with their infrastructure. Especially since many ""seniors"" are secretly afraid of moving to newer and more futureproof systems, simply because a lack of knowledge, curage, or both.

Reality check incomming:

Now... We all know all of the above doesn't actually mean shit. 

My question to the great audiance (i'm hopefully reaching);

How do I actually go around, gain clients and get people to grab a coffee with me. I also struggle with the fact i'm fairly young. Even in my current job i work with people of age 30+... whom can't phantom true passion.

I would love to hear your storys, advice and suggestions!

Thanks for the time invested in reading my situation. It IS greatly appreciated! :)

9cgfkx,61,2018-09-02,The Sicko Selfie,George_Anna_Leigh,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9cgfkx/the_sicko_selfie/,"A selfie ruined my life.  It did.  It wasn’t a crazy one or even a provocative one, but it ruined my life nonetheless.

Like most people my age, I was looking to make a few extra bucks to pay off my student loans, so I began working mad overtime for the medical examiner’s office. I’m employed as a forensic examiner but took on extra work in crime scene photography.  Besides taking pictures during the autopsy, I now moonlighted after hours.   

In the evening, I accompanied the examiner to a few crime scenes, documented the scene through photographs and made some sweet overtime.  In the morning, I would head back to the lab and work my full-time job.  The doc is a good guy and he knows as well as anybody that student loans can kill you, so he gave me this chance to try to get ahead.

Anyways, about two weeks ago, at a crime scene, I took a selfie.  Before you beat me up, I know it was cheesy and irresponsible to take one during an investigation.  I have a friend who loves the Smoky Mountains, saw a beautiful nature scene behind me, pulled my cell out of my pocket and snapped a quickie to send to a friend.

The selfie was blurry, so I posed and snapped again but became horrified over what I saw.  There was someone coming up behind me. He grabbed my hair and slit my throat with a knife.  A man!  A man bigger than my 6-foot frame.

For a moment, I gasped and couldn’t breathe.  I smelled a strong, cheap cologne.  He threw the empty green bottle from his hands.  Brut! The phone fell from my hands as I needed to put them around my neck.  Chills ran down my spine and the experience felt so real. I bent over at the waist as I thought I would vomit.  A vision of a can of shaving cream and a used razor flashed before my eyes.

Then, the color purple.
“X.  What’s wrong?  The doc asked.  He called me X----short for Xavier.

“I felt dizzy for a minute.”

He came over to me as I started to gain my composure.  I stood up and released a deep breath.

“You okay, buddy?”

“I am alright.  Sorry.” I took another breath and started to calm myself.

“Maybe too many hours this week.  Plus, shit like this will get to you.”

 “I’m okay, doc.  I promise.  I didn’t eat much today and got a little dizzy.”

“Alright,” he said and continued, “Let’s get the pictures of the body and wrap tonight up.

I finished the photographs, went home for the night, but couldn’t sleep.  I didn’t know what happened to me or what that was.  I tried to think if mental illness ran in my family, but I could not recall any incident which led me to believe it did.

After a restless night, I went to work. Much of the staff busted my balls throughout the day, asking if I stayed out all night and partied.  I had to admit, I was looking bad. I felt bad, too.  I still could not make any sense of what happened the night before. 
My inability to comprehend the situation of last evening’s strange occurrence tortured me throughout the day.  My head ached, and my heart hurt.  I would get busy and deep into my work and then BAM!  A flash would fill my head.  My throat being slashed.  The same cheap cologne odor filled my senses.  I felt as if I would vomit.  A can of shaving cream and a used razor.  I would shake it off and get back to work.

I got home about 6 pm, went into the bathroom and flushed my nose with some saline solution.  I couldn’t shake the Brut smell in my nose.   My neck ached, and I felt all around miserable.  I plopped on the couch.  I must have passed out because I noticed the time when the phone rang---3 am and the number---it was the doc.

“Doc?”

“U okay?”

“Yes,” I replied.

“This is an ugly scene.  I’m aware you’re not accustomed to this, so I wanted to warn you.  Young woman. Over at 122 North Street.  You okay to come?”

“I am on my way,” I replied. I was still in my clothes from my hours at the office.  I brushed my teeth and began my drive to the scene.  I felt better than I did when I arrive home earlier and the horrible smell from out of my nose. For some reason, I already knew where to go.  I didn’t need the doc to tell me the address.

From a mile away, I could see the police presence. I often wondered why they needed to scare the entire neighborhood with their lights. People were out and looking.

Upon arrival, I flashed my coroner’s badge and moved under the police barricade. Noise filled the air.  Talk---Screams----Yelling---Crying.  She begged for her life.  It was their first date.  She met him online.

“X!” the doc yelled, as I moved closer to him.

“Hey, Doc.”

“Let’s get this started.  This is appalling.”

“Yes, Sir.”

I admired the doc’s professionalism.  When I was his intern, along with others, he had told us that emotions did not belong at a crime scene or in the autopsy room.  He could forgive the newbies, but he preferred one waited until they arrived home and then cry for the deceased.  

“Let’s get what we need and get out of here.  You know I hate the murder victims and especially the young ones. Even after all these years, this shit disturbs me.  Handle it, X, this is our job,” he said nonchalantly.

“Yes, doc,” I replied. 

“Start with her neck,” he said.

I grabbed my camera and bent over the pretty, young woman.  I remember when I was young, I thought people’s eyes closed when they died.  Now, I know, they do not. Her eyes were so unusual.  They looked purple.  Beautiful eyes. Beautiful face. Not much older than myself. I took the picture of the slash around her neck. Her eyes were purple.  Yes, they were.

I could hear the detectives behind me speaking.  One said, “appears as if the perp came from behind, grabbed her by the hair and slit her throat.

My stomach jumped.  I tried to keep my composure as I saw the razor and shaving cream can.

“Oh God,” I said.

“Yeah,” a voice behind me said, and continued, “Looks like the killer groomed himself. 

I turned around and saw a young detective.  He continued, “We’ll need to figure out whether or not he groomed himself prior to the killing or afterwards.  When did he shave?  When did he cover himself in cologne?” 

“He did it before,” I replied, without thinking.

“How do you know that?” he asked.

My arms became weak, my body felt chilled.  I remember falling to the ground, then I remember being in the back of a police car.  I was wet and covered in a blanket.

“Doc?”

“X.  You feeling okay?”

“What happened?”

“Listen to me, buddy.  We are not all cut out to do this.  You freaked out.”

“I don’t remember.”

“This is a stress in which you are unable to handle.  Maybe someday but not now.”

“But, I saw it.  I saw her. I felt her.  I am her.  I know how it all happened.”

“I am aware. You described the scene in detail.”

“It started with that selfie.”

“What do you mean?” the doc asked.

“I took a selfie at the last scene and saw this.”

“Yes,” he smiled, “I am sure you did.  But, I want you to take a few days off.”

“Was it accurate?”

“Pretty accurate on m any, many things. We are not sure yet.  You make sure you call out sick tomorrow.”

“Yes, doc.  I will.”

“X, did you know the victim?”

“No. I swear.  No.”

I knew it was the last time I would officially work with the doc. I know his position is political.  I saw how everyone on the scene was looking at me. While, at this time, I may not remember, I knew it was something which affected them all.  I know I am officially unemployed. 

The doc continued, “The medics are coming back to check you out.  I am sure it is only anxiety.”

“Me, too,” I replied.

“See you in a few days.”

“See you doc.”

I watched the doc enter his personal car and drive away.
I stepped out of the opened door of the police car and closed it behind me.  I took my vape from pocket and puffed.  I put my back to the present crime scene and took a selfie. Then, I saw it.  I saw what is happening tomorrow night at 2 am.  I know he fights back.  There’s skin under my nails.

I am so tired.  I have a headache and I know why.  I pull away from the scene and start my trek home.

What is the doc going to think when he sees me creeping around the scene tomorrow night?  Will he ask why I knew where to come? How am I going to sleep tonight?  So many questions I ask myself.  But, I am so tired.  I plop on the couch.  Hopefully, I can sleep."

9chomx,1,2018-09-02,Starting my first Internship,Daniel1836,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/9chomx/starting_my_first_internship/,"So I have about a year since starting learning web dev.

​

I currently attend an 8 month program web development technical program at school where they teach me a a whole variety of languages, I finish in October. I make honours grades.

​

I decided to start applying for jobs and internships early since I do nothing during the day and go to school at night.

​

On my second ever interview for a web dev position, I got past the HR portion and they sent me a technical test, full of OOP definitions and javascript type problems to solve. ( no technical interview). I passed the test and recently got word that I got the internship at a ""startup"" company. (I applied on a site where they post only startups).

​

The company wants me to code in REACT. Now I have never learned react before. But they say this is not a problem and will train me. My first two days on the job, they direct me to various materials, websites to study from including react, bootstrap react and typescript. (no actual training).

​

I start doing actual work and projects for the company on Tuesday and I am very nervous on how I will perform, and how I will contribute. I'm feeling some imposter's syndrome. React seems like a complicated language, and though I think understand the very basics of operations and syntax through my understanding of javascript and frameworks, I don't think I understand the underlying point to all the fancy react code, other than it is reusable. It just seems kind of hard at first.

​

I'm working their front end, on their web site which I have been assigned to work on.

​

What kind of things do you predict I will be tasked to do, how will I use react to accomplish their needs? I work with around 5 other web dev interns at any given time, but there are more part timers.

​

Also, it is a little disappointing that I am working full time without getting paid, but am extremely thankful that I can make my ""break"" in this industry and get some experience I can put on my resume.

​

How long should I stay with this company before looking elsewhere for paying jobs? They go public this month, where the HR lady tells me they may start paying interns, but I'm not holding my breathe.

9ci02j,2,2018-09-02,Should I start looking for a new job or stick it out?,rdluna,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9ci02j/should_i_start_looking_for_a_new_job_or_stick_it/,"I got a new job recently with a nice 40% wage increase, but in another city. HR was very convincing about the culture of the company being flexible and fit for innovation and development (I'm a data scientist). But now three months in I have the following situation:

1) my boss is really toxic, he works overtime everyday, keeps working at home and even during weekends. He's called me ""lazy"" for not doing the same and has even got mad I told him not to bother me during weekends.

2) he's ""never wrong"" about anything, and when I propose a different solution to a problem that's not his own (he's some sort of solutions architect) he gets mad and insists on his own and is extremely reluctant to my ideas

3) he often mentions the 6 month trial period as a sort of threat, coupled with the fact that he think he can do everything by himself if needed, things like ""you know I can decide what to do with you in 6 months, I have power over who stays in the team""

4) he gets really defensive when anyone threatens some of his power, he's had very heated arguments with one other manager who was put to steer our team and with another guy in the team that shares some of the decision power. One of this very heated arguments almost ended in a fistfight

5) I think he's a fraud, he claims he has experience as Innovation director for other companies and several parent's, yet he graduated in 2015 and there's no information on him related to any patents or professional experience.

6) he constantly bluffs (in my opinion) about having job offers that offer 3x the pay but says he stays because he likes learning new things in this company

7) upper management trusts everything he says, so it's hard to contradict anything he says because his boss doesn't have any experience in software/data/innovation and blindly trusts this guy.

8) he's very retaliatory, one other guy got in 2 weeks after me, but he was not recommended for hire by my boss, but by one of the guys he constantly has discussions with over power. He has already stated that the new guy is out when the 6 months end and that he's just an intern instead of a full time employee (he's the latter), and what's worse is that my boss already put his boss against this guy so his fate rests entirely on whatever my boss decides.

9) I'm not doing the job I was hired for, I'm a data scientist and was hired as such but right now I'm more a sort of project manager for application design, and my boss hired a duplicate role (a machine learning specialist) which he's giving all data analysis tasks that come up. Luckily I'm pretty versatile so that I can work with software development, otherwise I'd be without real tasks

10) The culture HR promised doesn't exist, it's an automotive industry and all departments put production first and then innovation, and I spend half of my time trying to convince people to give the team access to databases and other systems, but I'm always forced to fill interface contracts or lengthy requirement specifications which seem designed to request features twice a year. Flexibility is minimum and I spend too much time in pointless meetings.

11) There is very high attrition, HR even proposed to perform modeling on the data they have to determine the significant factors. I was supposed to do it but my boss blocked it because he doesn't think it's worthy of our time or of the ""expertise of the team"", he blocks every request from other teams he doesn't personally like even if they're simple.

12) my boss moves strings to sabotage or reduce responsibility for the guy he's already decided to fire in ~4 months, this is what worries me the most as it's borderline unethical, he's acting against him on purpose instead of coaching him so that he can learn.

Mind this is a leading company in the premium car segment, so I expected better culture and management. Albeit the plant is relatively new.

Do you think these are reasonable things to consider looking for another job right now instead of trying to stick it out?? "

I'm an uni student , and intern student at some company atm.

&amp;#x200B;

But it seems like the real business world is different than university exams. For example in the first day I came here, they wanted me to build a web service, because this is what they do atm. But I said them I never saw anything about this, I don't even know what does it mean. So I couldn't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

So my points, it seems like going university alone won't make me good enough to get a job. I also need to learn something different. But the question is, What should I learn?

&amp;#x200B;

There are so much things to learn in programming world. And I don't even know where to start. Seriously guys, what should I learn in next 2 years? (thats when I will graduate and find a job hopefully)

&amp;#x200B;

Btw in university I'm taking/took classes like Java, C, Ruby , DBMS, HTML, Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, logic circuits , and so on. But I feel like they won't be enough!"

I am not exactly sure if this is the right subreddit for this kind of question but I'm just gonna go for it. FYI, I am an American citizen in 12th grade studying in Dubai. I would like to major in Computer science. The schools I have chosen are as follows;-  


REACH  
1. Stanford  
2. UC berkeley  
3. CMU  


TARGET (hopefully)  
1. UIUC  
2. UT austin  
3. U of washington  


SAFETY  
1. Texas A&amp;M (?)  
2. Virginia Tech (?)  


I realize that most of the schools on my list are crapshoots. I am aware that I have an extremely low chance at all of the reach schools. The safeties that I selected can be much better IMO. If someone could recommend some good schools that I have a high chance of getting into based on my stats, I would really appreciate it. Something better than Virginia tech but a bit lower than UIUC for example.  


STATS  


1. GPA - I did my 9th and 10th grade in a local Indian high school and we used the CGPA system (out of 10). My CGPA for 9th and 10th grade was **9.4 / 10**. I switched over to an American curriculum for 11th and 12th. My 11th grade GPA was a disgusting **3.52 UW** but **3.81 W**. It was mainly due to a personal circumstance which I plan to elucidate in my apps.  


2. SAT - 1560, SAT Math2 - 800, SAT physics - 790  


SCHOOL RELATED  


APs  
11th - AP stats - 4, AP chem - 4  
12th - AP physics C: Mechanics, AP Calc AB, AP CS A (currently enrolled)  


Long distance running/ cross country - Been running for 10 years in individual championships (no team in my old school). Varsity gold medalist cross country in American school, Dubai.  


Indian classical music (Carnatic) - 2 time scholarship winner (span of 3 years each) from my old school. Have performed in music festivals as well as National Indian TV.  


Strong letters of rec (I'm pretty sure xP)  


OTHERS  


International Robotics Olympiad two time qualifier  


4 month internship at an artificial intelligence startup company in India. Have received certification as well as a letter of rec from the CEO.  


Been coding for a long time. Built a program for a school for special children using my coding knowledge. The school has implemented my software and use it on a daily basis.  


Taught math and english at a local corporation school in India. Students from low-income families.  


MUN and debate club  


Computer club  


ESSAYS - I plan to write about my internship but on a very personal level. (BTW if anyone is interested in critiquing my essay hmu in the Discussion)

9cmeh5,6,2018-09-03,Internship woes,peybag,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/9cmeh5/internship_woes/,"Hey everyone! I wish I had found this thread (or I guess joined reddit) earlier in my grad school experience. There are so many nuggets of wisdom!

I am in the 3rd year of my program during which I will complete my internship. I started at my site early to get a feel for things and I have been struggling! I am having a hard time deciphering if it’s the site, my own anxiety flaring up, or just normal stress related to finally doing the work I’ve been committing so much brainpower to the past 2 years of school. 

The site itself is pretty intense. It’s a growing agency with a lot of employees so things are chaotic and it shows in the attention they’ve given to all the new interns they hired (which isn’t a lot). I feel like I’ve been thrown to the wolves with lack a of preparation and training from my site. I’m currently doing in-home skills work and will be beginning school based therapy in the next few weeks. While I have weekly supervision, it is dual and I am always feeling pressed for time with my supervisors.

My own stuff that is coming up is related to imposter syndrome and general fears surrounding my ability to do the work. This seems pretty standard. I recognize my GAD has spiked, I plan to make regular therapy a priority and make ample time for self-care.

I guess what I’m wondering is: what is the right about of stress/anxiety to feel this internship year? How do I decipher between whether it’s the site that isn’t working or my own coping skills with stress that are lacking?

I apologize if this is a little all over the place. It has really been troubling me the past few months and it’s hard to articulate. Any advice/direction/anecdotes would be helpful! Thank you, all! "

(AUTHOR’S NOTE: It has been a while since Entry II was posted. The calendar tells me eight months, though in truth I find myself believing it may have been longer. There was a point at which I thought I would not – could not – go on researching the case of Charles Caldwell. The path is dark, my friends, and it was one that I considered shelving away for some future year, until I at last blew the dust from its rotten pages and gathered the courage to post its remains here, where anonymous rumors and half-truths can remain things of legend. Many requests have convinced me otherwise. It is for you that I open this diary again. But it is at this point I must warn you, the deaths recorded from here forth are not those of cats.)

*(From the memoir of Charles C. Caldwell, who took the lives of countless victims before he reached the age of thirteen. This book is dedicated to those who died. Abridged by Austin Thomas.)*

**ENTRY III - Rosemary**

Advanced Placement courses were a side of Greenwater Elementary I thought I might never see. Not that I didn’t deserve to be there – quite the contrary. But much like the earth-bound explorer who longs to venture the stars in search of new worlds, I thought I might never attain that which I so desperately deserved.

Mother wanted to send me to a private institution, that much was true, though Richard demanded I stay at home. Whether this was to save money or further exert his control over Mother and I was unclear. Probably both. The middle ground had been AP courses, and it had only taken my mother a black eye to get it.

“You’re going to make so many new friends,” said Mrs. Douglas as we approached a door at the end of the hall. Bold letters on a translucent window read “GIFTED” in all kinds of fancy rainbow colors. The colors weren’t really there, but I perceived them. “Your mother and me really do think it’s the best option, Charles.”

“I.”

“I’m sorry?”

“Your mother and I,” I corrected.

“I see.” Mrs. Douglas bent until she was eye level with me. “That reminds me of something I wanted to tell you, Charles. You’re… different. And different is good! But sometimes it can be a bit much for people, especially if they are meeting you for the first time. It’s not nice to correct people. Even if they’re wrong. It turns people off, you see?”

What I saw was that Mrs. Douglas had a booger that was threatening to loose from her right nostril and contaminate an otherwise immaculate floor. But I thought it would be a bad time to bring it up. I simply nodded.

Mrs. Douglas straightened my bowtie, smiled at me (the booger lowered even further), and gave me an encouraging push to the door. Not wanting to contract what outrageous diseases my fellow classmates had plagued the doorknob with, I removed a handkerchief from my pocket and opened the door.

A thousand faces stared back at me. In reality there were twenty-three, which admittedly exceeded my expectation of seventeen or eighteen based on our school’s population. Whoever would have guessed Greenwater possessed such smart cookies?

“You must be Charles!” said the woman at the head of the classroom, beaming an offensive smile in my direction. “We’re so happy to have you with us. Take a seat anywhere you’d like, we were just going over the anatomy of a plant cell. Can anyone tell Charles where photosynthesis is conducted in the—“

“Chloroplasts,” I said. “Chloroplasts are plastids known for containing high amounts of the pigment chlorophyll, which converts sunlight into useable energy.”

The room was in silence. There was a warmth in my cheeks that felt strangely alien. The other children were looking at me, their eyes round and intelligent.

“Absolutely correct,” said Mrs. Blackwood at last. I knew her name was Mrs. Blackwood because that’s what the name plate on her desk said. “Um, thank-you very much, Charles. Everyone give him a round of applause for that extraordinary answer.”

A flurry of lousy hand claps moved through the room. I looked around for an open seat but saw only one, next to a girl with black ponytails raising her hand high in the air and bobbing ridiculously in her seat. Mouthing “over here”. I pretended not to see her and probed the room for another availability but came up with nothing. Twenty-three preexisting students and twenty-four desks. Damnit. I blamed the school board and its lack of proper budget division.

I took the seat next to Ponytails with my head straight forward as if I’d never seen her. She existed in my peripheral vision – looking at me. I wanted to tell her to stop. To do so would cause me to get in trouble. Getting in trouble would elicit a trip to the principal’s office. A second trip to the principal’s office in less than one business week would mean a detention. Detention would mean Richard would have to punish me. Or Mother—

“Stop it,” I snapped.

“I wasn’t doing anything,” whispered Ponytails.

“You were staring at me,” I whispered back.

The girl went back to doodling on her notepaper, a horrendous depiction of flowers and sky and what must have been a quarter of the sun in one corner of the page, scrawled in bright, nauseating colors. The sound her markers made as they drew across the paper wreaked hell on my sensitive ears. I wanted to slap her. Then I thought of Richard, and my want stopped.

A man appeared in the doorway. “Excuse me, Mrs. Blackwood, your husband is on the phone in Principal Connery’s office.”

Mrs. Blackwood rolled her eyes. “I’m sorry class, you’ll have to excuse me one moment.” She strode out of the room, leaving behind a chalkboard full of plant cell organelles and their labels.

A garble of chit chat began to rise after a few moments of awkward silence. I hoped desperately Mrs. Blackwood would come back before—

“I’m afraid we got off on the wrong foot,” said the girl next to me. She extended a professional hand. “My name is Rosemary. Rosemary Dooley.”

I studied her. Black hair, parted down the middle and pulled into two identical ponytails that whipped as she moved her head. Skin so pale she might have been a vampire, if I believed in such superstitions. Her lips were thin and gray. She wore a black dress and black shoes and black wristbands. All her school things were black as well. The girl looked like a corpse that someone had unearthed and propped in a chair.

After letting it hang intentionally for a moment, I shook her hand. “Charles Caldwell.” Her hand was cold and clammy, as all girls were. I found myself longing for hand sanitizer, and reminded myself not to touch my face until I could find some.

“You must know a lot about plants,” said Rosemary.

“I know a lot about a lot of things,” I said, facing forward. “I know a lot of things that you don’t know, too.”

“Maybe you’re used to being a condescending doofus to the other kids at this school, Charles, but the kids in here aren’t so different from you.”

I looked her in the eyes. “Prove it.”

Rosemary studied the room. She pointed. “That kid over there. His name is Jackson, and he built a computer when he was just eight years old. And her – that’s Lillian, she’s written eight articles that were published by the Journal of Contemporary Math and Sciences. AJ has developed three aps that are just now taking off. And me – well, I don’t want to brag.” Rosemary was back to coloring her drawing with her fire alarm markers.

“What about you?” I asked quietly.

“If you must know, I’ve been an intern at many chemical research plants and could recite enough of the periodic table to melt that ego of yours into a puddle.”

I felt a pang in my chest. Perhaps a heart attack, or the radical idea that I suddenly felt threatened by a peer. “I can recite all of the periodic table,” I said. “Which of the elements is your favorite?”

Rosemary’s markers went back and forth. Eek-ook-eek-ook-eek-ook.

“Francium. Its atomic weight is my birthday.”

“Mine is Mercury. I find it to be the most underrated of the elements.”

Rosemary’s markers stopped. “You like Chemistry, do you?”

“How could one dislike it?”

That was when Mrs. Blackwood entered the room, apologized for the interruption, and continued an exciting lesson that I felt strangely distant from. My usually focused train of thought kept derailing into thoughts of personal delusion. Like the idea that I might have just made my first friend.

When class ended, Rosemary said, “I like you, Charles Caldwell. Perhaps you’ll fit right in.”

On the drive home, Mother dropped the most unfortunate bit of news.

“Your father and I have been going through a rough patch recently, as I’m sure you’ve noticed. We’re going out tonight, just the two of us. Jackie’s coming by at six to look after you.”

“No – Mother, I’m old enough to be on my own.”

“It’s just for the evening, Charles. Surely you can put up with her for just a few hours.”

Jackie Welch had been my babysitter since I was an infant. She was twenty-two years old and had recently graduated with a degree in being an apathetic bitch. She once brought her boyfriend to our house and they sucked on one another’s faces until my parents returned. Another time, she gave me a bag of potato chips for dinner.

At exactly 6:15pm, the doorbell rang and she stood on our front porch in all her unemployed glory. Brown hair parted beneath a ball cap. Cropped shirt barely reaching her stomach. One cheek full of bubblegum. Nose ring glinting in the porchlight. Wrapped in a letterman jacket. Hands curled around a phone to which they seemed permanently attached, the nails so long they were indistinguishable from claws. And yet, it was her scent that made me want to vomit – a combination of candy and cigarettes.

“Oh, great, you’re here,” said Mother.

“Yeah.” Jackie’s claws were tapping away at some text message that her eyes never left.

“Be good while we’re gone, Charles,” said Mother, her hands on my shoulders. “I mean it. Your father and I will be back later tonight, okay?”

I nodded. Richard didn’t say anything to me. He just put his arm around Mother and they were gone. I watched the door shut behind them.

Jackie sat on the couch – reclined, really – with her phone sandwiched between her hands, thumbs tapping, bubblegum blowing. I stood watching her. After about a minute her eyes flitted up to me with a highly exasperated look.

“What?”

I blinked. “Aren’t you going to make us dinner?”

Jackie rolled her eyes. A bright pink bubble inflated through her lips and burst with a pop. “Okay. What do you want?”

“A peanut butter and jelly would be nice.”

Jackie continued to tap away at her phone. Finally, she looked up again. “What? I’ll make it. Don’t you have like, homework or something?”

I trudged out of the room with full knowledge that I had completed all my homework before I left school that day. I didn’t bother telling Jackie. Instead of climbing the sixteen stairs to the bedroom, I instead went to the garage, where my not-so-elementary Elementary Chemistry Set was stored. The sight of it made me think of the cat, an incident I hadn’t forgotten but instead stored in the back of my mind, a constant background process that never seemed to close.

MURDER was a word that appeared blood red to the synesthetic part of my mind. Maybe I had committed MURDER, if the term legally applied to animals. And then to that extent: what defined an animal, really? A creature with sub-human intelligence? Surely it had nothing to do with size or shape or anatomy.

The question had been tormenting me for the past several days. Perhaps because if animals were animals to people, then it followed that some people could be animals to other people. I found the idea fascinating. Possessing an IQ score that was close to a hundred points below mine set Chris Sullivan on an animal-like plane of existence. To me he was an animal, just like most kids were animals, and most adults were animals as well.

If intelligence was what separated human from animal, then what did that make everyone below me?

Maybe I only entertained this notion to make myself feel better about another one, the idea of Chris’s body floating in its own tub of sulfuric acid. It was absurd. Sulfuric acid was no way to kill someone.

KILL. Not MURDER. Here, there was a fine distinction. On the left, cold blue ice. On the right, fiery red. People liked to use them synonymously, but they were not the same. Quite the contrary. A hunter did not MURDER a deer, he KILLED one.

The idea of KILLING Chris seemed a bit extreme, though irrationally so. I had KILLED a cat so what was the difference?

My chemistry set was composed of a bright red, shiny plastic. That made it easy to spot among all of Richard’s tools in the garage. I dug it out of a shelf low to the ground and unlatched it. Inside were all the things I had stolen from Mrs. Allen’s supply closet, some new, some old. And some were concoctions I’d created by turning her harmless ingredients into… malignant ones.

One such project – a recent one – was a small white bottle labeled KCN. The CN stood for cyanide. The K for potassium. A simple compound to create but oh so deadly. I cradled the bottle in my hands and weighed my options, though there was only one, really. If I was going to eliminate Chris, I needed to make sure a lethal dose of my – product – would actually 1) work and b) work well enough to be virtually untraceable in a post-mortem autopsy.

If what I had synthesized was too weak, too tame, there was a chance I could wind up with a deathly ill person on my hands, one who could rat me out as a prime suspect. The dose had to be perfect, it had to be lethal – and it had to be tested.

An obnoxious shout from inside the house destroyed my train of thought.

“Kid! Get your sandwich!”

Ah, yes. Perfect.

A guinea pig.

I've been developing basic apps for 2 years but I hopefully will release an app on the Play Store in 2 months.

I have a basic college education but no degree, however, I've taken many classes and absorbed all I can to get into Android development (even taken a bit of full stack) from the following sources

* YouTube - Sources like  [Let's Build That App](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA) and a few others.
* TeamTreehouse
* Top-rated courses from Udemy
* I even have a Nanodegree from Udacity and almost finished with a second one.

I'm also habitually attending local tech conferences like [Palm Beach Tech Talks](https://www.meetup.com/Palm-Beach-Tech-Talks/) and making it a habit to attend conferences like these whenever they spawn.

Even if I get an internship would be a great improvement. I'm just looking for help to get me in the right direction and some advice with someone lacking the funds (and personally losing faith) in a university degree.

How to fix?",TookAnArtDegree,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/9cowmh/i_got_a_degree_in_art_even_though_i_liked/,"When I started college way back in 2002, I had enrolled as an Architecture major, being interested in the design and construction of buildings. This was at a regular state school by the way, but their ""sister"" campus is considered in the top 20-25 for CS. Either way, the Architecture program wasn't as I expected it to be, and I, along with many other freshmen, dropped it in their first year.

For the following two semesters I was undecided with a major, and then transitioning to art. There was a waiting list in Art so I took general ed classes. However, even in art, where I majored in graphic design, I got sidetracked again and realized programming was the thing for me. I took a web design class where we learned to make some basic websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Notepad (yes, the stock Notepad program on Windows) and really liked it.

As a result I decided to enroll in some 100 level CS courses in my 4th year in college. I did more work using JavaScript, then Java. Some other students got teachers that taught C++ but I didn't have those classes. And with the dept's permission I was allowed to advance to intermediate CS courses because I met the pre-requisites.

The reason I chose not to follow though doing more classes to get a CS major, is that starting a complete major change (or double major) in my 5th year, I'd be going past 6 full years and 150 credits in college, and that would have greatly reduced my financial aid options. 

Up to that point, about 90% of my tuition was paid with Pell grants because my FAFSA has no family contributors. I wanted to cut my losses by graduating earlier with the art degree. ""earlier"" being relative. I graduated five and a half years later which is later than most.

But I did not think too much about how beneficial having that CS degree would mean to me in the long run. Also, I assumed that with an Art degree and with no internships I couldn't be hired as a programmer by Fortune 500 companies, but rather would have to take the ""long way"" around, by starting at smaller shops and working my way up to bigger and bigger.

But several years later, I am still stuck in a loop of under-paying small companies. And I don't really know what to do anymore. I have worked at four of them so far. And yet, my skill set is that of an average entry level dev, if I were to consider the feedback I get from job interviews. 

I could get interviews at medium sized and larger companies right now but I am always rejected by them. I am still not good enough.

Should I go back to school and complete my CS degree? And even if it's a good idea, how do I balance that with my time and my budget? I am only working 15 hours a week and also get paid like crap. Around $16k if you annualize it. I know some companies can pay for your tuition but that's not very useful to know if I am not good enough to get hired by them.

So to sum it up: My career is going in circles, not making a lot of money. I'm now in my 30's but I live like a broke college student. Any options I feel will just strain my finances and I cannot afford to live by myself and my family doesn't want me living with them anymore."

I am a senior right now who will be graduating in March. I've seen some posts here recently about how people in my position should start applying for jobs. However I'm at a pretty unfortunate disadvantage and would love any advice any of you have.

For starters, I didn't even start programming until the beginning of my junior year. I have been working very hard to learn and practice the various things I need to know based on things I've been reading in this subreddit and other various sources. I think I'm actually learning at a good pace, but don't think I'll be ready to start doing technical interviews at least for a couple months. I am currently learning and practicing algorithm and data structure type stuff, but don't feel confident in that area yet at all. 

The next big issue is that I don't have any relevant work experience. I never applied for an internship for this past summer because of my lack of confidence in my programming abilities. 

So I have a couple questions. 

1. Will I be screwed if I don't start applying for jobs now? I feel I could be ready around the end of the year. Will it be significantly more difficult to get an entry level job if I started applying then?

2. What can I do to make my resume more appealing given my lack of work experience. Anything else besides doing personal projects?

Thank you all for your guidance! "

I'm a freshman CS major who literally just started classes. I (somehow) qualified for and am now enrolled in one of my unversity's most difficult math courses.

I'm interested in computer science research, like AI. I recently did an internship at an AI research institute, and it seemed like many of the researchers there were mathematicians who knew how to code, rather than computer scientists. For this reason, I'm very interested in getting as advanced and sound a foundation in mathematics as possible.

On the other hand, I've never been exceptionally good at math. I got a 34 on ACT Math and an A in AP Calculus AB (with a lenient teacher, and not taking the AP test). I've been told that this course is usually recommended for those who scored 5's on AP Calc BC.

The course is:

&gt; designed for those interested in theoretical mathematics and perhaps theoretical (abstract) physics. It is a proof-based approach to learning calculus and requires the student to produce original, independent calculus proofs on a weekly basis.

&gt; an honors calculus sequence for talented students interested in mathematics.

On the first day of class, my instructor said that it will be ""Marine bootcamp for the brain,"" and that it's one of the hardest courses freshmen are allowed into.

I'm terrified of how difficult this course looks to be, but, if a serious foundation in math is going to be essential for complex CompSci research, then I feel I should suffer through it.

Am I overvaluing the role of complex math in subjects like **neural networks** and **cryptography**, or am I going to have to soldier through this course?

Thanks for your advice!"

Hi Reddit.

I am looking for some advice, career wise, on my next best move.

Here is my story briefly for context:

I spent many years isolating myself avoiding work and depressed after leaving school, about 5 years crippled with social anxiety and depression. Eventually I managed to work up the courage to take on University and further study, and go out into the world of work. In my 3 years at University, I managed to pass despite a lot of mental health issues. And I took on a few volunteering roles and part time jobs such as bar work and teaching TEFL English, after studying for the certificate.

I did some travelling across Europe teaching English after i graduated, but I found out my mental health took a nosedive. And i was laid off from work and flew back home, defeated and miserable. 

Since then I went back to University to pursue a postgraduate degree. Unfortunately, my financial situation got out of hand and struggles with my mental health reared its ugly head again. I isolated myself and thought i could succeed in my studies. I failed. I quit my course, laden with the debt regardless.

Now i am here. Currently I am very busy with a few projects. I am trying to teach myself to code with a lot of difficulty, through sites like freecodecamp.  And I am also writing daily, blogging and editing a book I have written. Most of all, I love to write. And I have been researching, networking a lot to figure out how to make it as a living as a writer. Registering on [upwork.com](http://upwork.com/) and things like that. Working on a portfolio and finessing my blog, which looks really good i am told. I can provide a link if anyone is interested in giving feedback on it. I am also volunteering for local charities. Writing press releases and helping them with content writing for their site. This is on and off though, and it keeps me busy, but little is going to come of it further work wise.

So, currently I am a little disheartened, exhausted and frustrated with my situation. I cannot find any writing clients. I am finding learning to code incredibly hard, but I am persevering. And my academic hopes have failed, and i am very disillusioned with education regardless. All my hopes are on writing or learning to code. But despite this, nothing is changing and my learning is slow and haphazard. What is more, the requirements asked even for entry level intern programmers is very high. Some ask for a good level in several coding languages, and i have barely mastered one so far.

My family all struggle with disabilities and problems of their own. And can offer no support financial or emotional or otherwise. Basically, I am in this alone.

I have a lot depending on my learning to code, or freelance writing. Because I do not work well with others. And despite being able to, I find it is overly exhausting for me to work 9-5 in a typical working environment.

Some advice would be fantastic, on my next best move. Anyone been in a similar situation? And overcome it? Do people suggest I focus on one or the other? Coding or writing?

So far I have little success in life. Financially, academically and mentally. But I am persevering. And I have rarely, if ever burdened others with my problems. They are busy with their own. 

If anyone has some input that would be fantastic. If anyone has been through this for example. If anyone has succeeded with similar circumstances etc. Give it to me straight. Can I get employed with huge C.V gaps? Is coding realistic for me? Writing? Am I wasting my time? Shall I go back into teaching?

Thanks"

This will probably be a bit long, but I need advice and I hope someone can give me the proper advice and the proper steps to follow. This is my main account, I thought about creating a throw away, but decided that it's not that much of an issue if people find out about who I am or, for those who know, to find out I plan to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm a Brazilian Engineering Student, born and raised here, but I have Italian citizenship. In two weeks I'm completing 24 and I've been studying Industrial Engineering for the past 5 and a half years, having abandoned school 3 times since I started due to developing anxiety and depression. If I stay here and am not dragged down by depression again I might graduate in 1 to 2 years from now, but today I got to the point where it is becoming too much for me to bear once again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't had an easy life, had to start working in my early teenage years due to my father losing his job, now things have been getting better for my family, but since I started studying engineering I've been going into a downward spire... I've worked as waiter, office assistant, tourist guide, cook, baker, bartender, website developer, marketing manager and as some other stuff. I've done volunteer work as scout leader for years and helped some other organizations when I was available. I love my city and my country, but the violence and some other issues take their toll on me... Last semester I failed in university again and I broke up my 3,5 years long relationship, what made me go on an impulse backpacking trip through Europe(Italy, France, Germany and Austria) for 3 weeks, in which I spent all my savings. During the trip I met amazing people who made me question the way I'm leading my life and made me think about moving and maybe starting over from scratch, but I decided to give me one more chance of trying to succeed in my school because I actually like engineering and I want to work with technology. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I was recovered, I arrived as motivated as I could be, but every day since I arrived back home I feel worse and worse and I fear failing once again. My country's political and economical future is looking grim, I have to correct more people every day on their ever more ignorant and intolerant beliefs, there was a shooting on the road while I was in a bus on my way home, my university has had 4 big incidents with (luckily) no fatal victims since the start of the year(and I wonder when  will be the next), I have to conciliate internships where I overwork and am underpaid with 32 weekly hours of classes, plus 3 hours a day of transportation and I still have assignments to do... I'm exhausted and burnout... 

&amp;#x200B;

I need to find an opportunity in a place where I can work and study without so many outside elements putting even more pressure on me. I'm selling all my games, collections, camping equipment and whatever I have of value to get enough to try this, I'm trying to focus on my studies and future and nothing more, I need to try something. I need help from people who know how to get a job abroad or maybe change to a free university in EU(I don't have any money), or preferably both. I have two weeks to buy a plane ticket(I have Huge a discount until I complete 24yo) or else I won't be able to afford even the trip, imagine the costs of moving. If anyone can suggest me where to go, how to search for opportunities, how to transfer from my school, if someone can give me an opportunity, a hint, anything, I'm accepting it, I'm reaching the point of desperation, if anyone can help with any advice, as little as it may seem, please don't refrain from doing so, thanks!!!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Once depressed engineering student in fear of reaching breaking point again due to my country/city's issues. Have European citizenship, English fluency, can code decently, have some random work experiences. Need help transferring or starting anew in a country where my life could be a little easier and where working would actually allow me to live, not just barely pay part of my expenses. Sorry for the mess, I wrote this in a rush."

Hey let me get my friends in my class to endorse that I'm good at fucking Excel! Now I can actually get a job! Who the fuck gives a shit? 

Also - the fucking UI is annoying as shit. It's admittedly not the worst website I've used but sometimes I feel like the software engineers of the world are all retarded. So many of the tools that we need to use in daily life now have these little annoying ticks to them. But I guess software engineers don't build things to be convenient to the user. They build things for money - that's the bottom line and that's all they care about. That's why so many people on this subreddit ejaculate at the thought of working at Facebook, sure it might be one of the most evil companies in the world but hey money amirite??? Yeah sure they may use their power to psychologically manipulate the masses, control political elections, and force-feed advertisements down everyone's throat but hey if I do an internship there I can buy a Boosted board and then all my friends will be jealous of me!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Edit: sorry if this upset some people. If it helps I've deleted my LinkedIn as I decided it wasnt useful to me even though some may find it useful. This rant mostly came from me having an issue with some of the functionality and not being able to find any support articles about it, so I got frustrated with why I was using LinkedIn in the first place and made this. Didn't expect to get so much attention.

I come from a CS/programming background and, even though some time ago I decided to follow the bioinformatics specialization offered at my uni, I'm pretty sure my education would allow me to get a job at an ordinary SE company. Recently, I seem to have climbed that fence once again and now am trying to decide which path to follow, BI or SE.

The reason I am becoming undecided once again is that I basically kinda don't like what I'm doing right now. Despite learning a bunch of useful (I think) research skills throughout my internship, the project I'm working on is what one would call ""computational biology"", i.e. applying some existing tools and some statistics methods to some data in order to find some cool patterns, whereas I guess I'd really love doing a more computational, a more algorithmic project (one of my previous smaller projects was to understand a simple existing algorithm from a paper and implement it as a part of particular tool, and even that was more enjoyable). As I was reading about the life in academia I got the impression that one's existence could be sad if work on something they don't like, so I'd like to ask these questions:

1. Is it possible/How hard is it to find a PhD student research position which would mainly focus on the computational/algorithmic kind of work. I don't mean it to discard the biological aspect (what's the point then), but I'd just dislike my research to consist solely of delving into slightly processed data trying to get meaningful results.
2. How would I search for such opportunities?
3. I've asked about a PhD and only a while ago I was confident I'd be pursuing a purely academical career, but maybe it's better to switch to the industry at some point?
4. Last but certainly not the least: for my own reasons I don't really want to move to the US, so I wonder what options regarding the questions I've asked above and also the particular institutions/companies I have in Europe. Most importantly, the question of funding is also significant (I wouldn't be able to pay for my education for sure; also, do the PhD programs in Europe pay any stipend as in the US?). I am not an EU citizen, I believe that matters.

First, I appreciate if you've read all of that. Second, I apologize if my questions were obscure or naive. I've just been quite confused and frustrated lately about what prospects I'd have with the path I'm on now. I am sometimes rather excited about doing research and science plus biology is a *very* cool subject, but at the same time I'm unsure whether all this is actually worth doing instead of choosing a ""safer"" career at a company that would be better in terms of payment and life quality.

What do you think about it?

Thank you!"

A few years ago, I started a business with a buddy of mine. The division of work was clear – I handle the technical stuff, he the sales.  Look, I am not especially tech-savvy, but I am decent at googling and reading forum posts on similar issues to my own. We just hired our fourth fulltime employee and take in two interns per semester. Business is doing great and I expect to hire two additional people in the upcoming months. 

In the beginning, it was just my partner and I, on a network shared drive from my computer. Those days were simple. We are now running a large 10Gb NAS backed up to several cloud solutions, which dutifully servers our files, and have done so for some time now. I am fairly certain that I have *that*side of the business pretty much under control. It could of course always be geolocally duplicated somewhere else, but there is a point where it does not make more sense for me to back it up more. 

Networking is alright. We run a full Unifi stack. While it does seem to be looked down upon many places, it has been very, very stable for us… so far.  

The windows side of the business, however, is starting to give me problems. In the beginning, spending a few hours to set up windows for new employee’s computers with email signatures, mapped networked drive and so on and so on was not a problem. I just spend half a day setting up the two new interns accounts, which is bothering me.

Surely there must be a way of automating this process, so that when I order a new license for my employee, and add them on portal.office.com, they can log into their account on a given machine on the network, and have it *just work*.

I currently have a local admin account on every machine, but as we grow this is quickly becoming a a burden. Is there a way to store userprofiles and their settings on the NAS?   


Apologies if this is not the right post. My title is not “SysAdmin”, but I handle all those tasks. "

I love programming and I hate that i figured it out so late in my college career. I realized business isnt for me and MIS isnt technical enough. I do little projects on the side.

&amp;#x200B;

If I spend an extra year as a student, I can take care of most of the CS fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, computer systems, discrete math) along with an upper-level software engineering course. Is the plan worth it to go into a software engineering career as a non-CS undergrad?

9cuv2y,30,2018-09-04,Has anyone ever heard of the Black Dove?,Wordsmith24601,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9cuv2y/has_anyone_ever_heard_of_the_black_dove/,"Ok, so I've never done anything like this before so you're going to have to bare with me, but I needed a place to write this down. To tell you the truth I just needed someone to believe me, or to at least have a chance to.  I’ll write as much as I can before the memories become too much, because this is a nerve I haven’t touched in two years.  To tell this story is to lay the darkest time of my life bare, and I need people to know, but it’ll have to be in my own time.

It's hard to tell where to start with this story, but I guess the day I got fired would be as good as any. 

I was working for a paper I won't name in a city I won't mention, trying to find a way into investigative reporting without selling my soul and whilst also avoiding writing stories I didn't give a shit about just to make my name. As you can imagine, that was a tough balance to find and my disinterest in what I was writing had led to one too many missed deadlines, and a career that was flirting with the edge of the thinnest of ice. Anyway, I had been writing this somewhat crappy story about how the next town over's recycling had actually been turfed into landfill (I know, not exactly the conspiracy of the year), and this intern Mikey comes over to me and stands over my desk. It's the last one on the row, kind of around the corner behind the other reporters and a stupidly large ficus, a fact that I try not to find offensive, but a fact that also means intern dude couldn't possibly be trying to get anyone else's attention. I'm trying to meet a deadline and this kid won't stop staring at me, mouth opening and closing. I looked up at him.

""Kid, spit it out, I'm working here."" I felt kind of bad because I knew I sounded like a dick, but the pressure was really getting to me. I was in a bad time in my life; recently divorced, lonely, pathetic, visitation schedule for my kid - I really needed work to be a source of success for me or I was afraid I'd have literally nothing to show for my thirty eight years on this earth except for a string of failed journalistic endeavours, failed relationships, and now failure to live up to the hero my son thought I was.  

""I got this note for you."" This was odd. We had a rule against this. The kid must've known that. Since a bigger and better paper had been the recipient of a serial killer note about 6 years ago, we weren't allowed to accept notes from off the newsroom floor like that. Definitely an overreaction, but the guy at the aforementioned superior rag had put his greasy fingers all over the evidence and the police has pulled their hair out over it. Plus it was creepy as all hell, so there's that to consider. I paused and glanced down the hall, but no one had heard. I stole a look at the note in question and was immediately intrigued. A black envelope. My imagination stole away with dreams of writing a serial killer piece for a second, then I remembered the rules and looked up at the kid again.

But I liked the kid. Mikey, I mean. He was one of those unfortunate types who looked as though maybe they'd been ignored by absentee parents, who had thrown money at the whole having a kid thing without actually being helpful. He had too long, poorly cut hair, very expensive but ill fitting clothes and a bit of an acne problem which lent him a slightly greasy appearance. Shame really, the kid wouldn't have been bad looking if someone had taken a moment to spruce him up, or at least shown him how to iron a shirt. Not that he needed to wear a shirt to the office - somehow it was the missing of that particular memo that made everyone view him as a child rather than a colleague. So I guess all of the above is why I did it, even though I knew better. Even though I should have loudly told him that he needed to take that shit right back where it came from. In a matter of seconds I'd looked down at my piece and thought, *I need a big break, I need a story*, then my eyes had landed on that note, with its black paper, and the chance of something greater subdued the voice of my better judgement. In spite of the fact that I had no real reason to think it was anything more than a bitchy note from my soon to be ex wife. She always had a flare for the dramatic, after all.

""Come with me."" He looked alarmed to tell you the truth, but he ran a sweaty palm through his hair and followed me anyway. We walked down the corridor and into the kitchen, and the second he noticed that no one else was in there he started to speak, his voice scratchy with the last dregs of adolescence.

""Mr. Dawson, I know I wasn't meant to but she named you personally and she looked normal like someone you might know, and then it was in my hand and I'd done it so I thought I'd better bring it to you cause maybe it's like a normal note y'know..."" he trailed off as I put a palm up, shaking my head.

""Adam. Adam is fine. Listen, we aren't meant to accept notes but just give it to me and I'll see if it's ok or not, alright?"" Mikey looked surprised at this, like he'd thought I was about to read him the riot act.

""Oh, ok. I mean if you have to tell someone that's fine, but I really need the experience here and if I get fired my Dad will kill me and it was just a note like it doesn't have to be anything bad, and why have these crazy specific rules anyway and..."" my hand went up again.

""Chill out. Give it to me, and go about your day - no one is getting fired and I'm almost certain it's just from my almost ex-wife. Give it over, and get back to work for Christ's sake."" The kid grinned at me, shoved the note into my hand and ran out of the kitchen without another word. I rolled my eyes heavily and sighed. I was a grown man after all, and here I'd managed to get myself all excited about the concept of a big story, when realistically all I had in my note was a fucking envelope and probably some of Mikey's palm sweat. But I just had this feeling. You ever get a feeling that's so deep in your gut that you have no choice, you've got to follow it?

This was like that.

With Mikey gone, my attention went back to the note in my hand. It was heavier than I had expected, no doubt what was inside was card instead of paper. I flipped it over to look at the front. There it was in white print - Adam Dawson. It was then that I knew that this wasn't from Helen. She had always written everything by hand, in a cursive I had once envied but now felt rage at the sight of. Typed print was firmly not her style. Something in my insides jumped, coiling up tight with anticipation. I shoved it firmly into my pocket and moved back down the hall to the post room - post was Mikey's responsibility, and I knew no one else would be in there as the post wouldn't be done until that afternoon. Once there, I pulled up an empty cardboard box and sat down, somehow feeling that the moment deserved a seat. I flipped open the edge of the envelope and pulled out a square piece of card, as black as the packaging I had pulled it from. 

I studied the image closely. White squares cascaded down from the top left corner, pooling into the bottom right of the card, leaving enough white for a black logo to be stamped onto it. A bird. I frowned at it, deeply confused, and then I flipped over the card.  There were numbers arranged in pairs around the border, the number 16 more frequently than any other.  I frowned, turning my attention to the printed text that dominated the middle of the card.

As I read my heart stopped.

*Mr. Dawson,*

*I would like to cordially invite you to rise to a challenge.* 

*To put together the pieces I'm giving you and tell the world the truth.*

*I know who is responsible, but to catch the Pied Piper you must follow the rats.*  

*The rats in uniform cannot help you.*

*Find the Black Dove, and you'll find the children.* 

*Fail, and they will all be lost souls, just like me.*

*Fail, and you'll never see Eric again.*

*Yours faithfully,*

*Raziel*

I stared.  The image blurred and I raised a shocked hand to my eyes, thinking momentarily that there must be some kind of substance on the card.  It was only when my fingertips became wet that I realised I was crying.  My heartbeat fluttered faster as I stared harder still at the card in front of me.  

After all, Eric was my son.

I stood, a fit of rage overcoming me and threw the box I’d been sitting on, desperation seeping into my nerves making my hands shake.  Have you ever felt so shocked that you don’t think you’ll ever fully exhale again?  That was what it felt like.  Even writing this I can feel that vice squeeze my chest, getting tighter with every word I put down.

I spent what felt like hours in that tiny room, trying to rationalise.  Reading it again.  Suddenly a seductive voice in the back of my head started to whisper to me, *what if it’s just a lie, what if it’s a hoax?*.  Then I flew from that room, racing back to my desk to get my phone.  It could all be fake right?  Eric is at school.  He’s 11 for christ’s sake.  How could he possibly have gone missing without anyone noticing?  I shoved people out of my way and finally got to the corner desk, throwing myself behind it and digging for the phone I left in the bottom of a bag, preferring to write without the constant buzzing that usually carried barbed texts from Helen.

Except there were no texts this time.  Just 10 missed calls, all in the last twenty minutes.  I hit return, sweat creeping across my back.

“Adam what the fuck, where the fuck have you been?! I’ve been calling and calling”  

She was crying so hard.  And I just knew.

“What’s happened” I could hear my voice as though it was at the bottom of a well.  My insides clenched as I thought about my boy.

“Eric is missing.  You have to come now”  she hung up.  I could hardly believe it.

I stood and promptly vomited on the ficus I hated so much.  As I sat back down and got a tissue I noted the pink slip on my desk, the formal letter.  I skim read, *twelve late pieces in a row….lacklustre writing….no commitment to the success of this paper*….*you will receive your next paycheck but we are sorry to have to let you go*.

Fuck it.  Fuck it all.  I felt the black envelope as though it was burning a hole in my pocket.  Nothing mattered anymore.

I would follow the rats.  And I would find my son.

Even if finding him meant losing it all."

I'm a non-CS student that made a serious decision to pursue software jobs in the summer between my sophmore and junior year and ended up trading academic performance for an internship opportunity. By the time I received the offer I was already finished the first semester of my 3rd year and knew that switching into CS would take more time than to just finish my non-CS degree + a post-bachelor program like e-OSU ([https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/undergraduate/computer-science/](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/undergraduate/computer-science/)).

&amp;#x200B;

In my head I didn't really expect to receive a full-time offer because I felt like I was punching above my weight-class, having only learned CS fundamentals online, but I did. But I also want to eventually have the opportunity to attend grad school, and would like to do it right this time without splitting my focus between school and work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I crazy for turning down a full-time offer to interview for internships (or take the existing offer, but as an internship instead) so that I can fulfill my pre-requisite courses with actually decent grades? I probably can't go back to my team since their org has been historically understaffed (and was while I was there), and taking the job in Seattle instead presents the same WLB risk. Academic performance means a lot to me since I haven't really performed since I've gotten to university and I'd like to redeem myself with CS."

I went into it because I had done competitive programming and robotics in high school and enjoyed it. I've found most of my programming classes a breeze and feel like I 'get it' more easily than most of my classmates. At the early stages of my internship, I really enjoyed what I was doing and felt challenged, but now I feel burnt out.

I think it's primarily depression brought on by social isolation. Most days I go to work, I clock in, get my things done, and clock out. If I'm lucky, I might have a five minute conversation. Otherwise, there's just a meeting once a week and a couple emails a day sent out to clients when punching out tickets between project-based work.

I've tried fixing it through pretty much every other way. I've been in therapy continuously for the past year and a half, I regularly exercise and meditate, I've been on medication, I make social time outside work, but I still can't deal with that level of isolation. I do like a lot of things about programming. I like being in a flow state and I like learning new stuff, but even when I'm challenged at work, I still feel like it's draining me.

It's to the point where I regularly fantasize about quitting my internship and just being a barista again (or literally anything else with more human contact) until I can figure out what to do next with my life.

I understand that company culture plays a huge role in how much socializing happens in a day, but given that programming works best when you have long, uninterrupted periods of time spent focusing, I'm worried I might just be in the wrong vocation? Are there roles that exist for people who need more face-to-face time?"

I have a lot of experiences on my resume attempting to start companies and I believe this is hurting my chances at getting interviews / passing them. I wanted to see if anyone had advice about my situation.


##**Background**

I'm a CS fresh grad from a decently ranked uni (graduated in May). I had an internship my freshman year at an options trading firm (as a trader, not SWE), but since then I haven't had another internship. I chose to pursue my personal projects those summers instead. I also took a year off from school to pursue these endeavors. 

My results aren't extraordinary but I've had some small success (and many failures). The main successes are:

- SaaS targeting small/medium businesses, generated low 5 figure yearly revenue (no longer operational).
- Mobile app targeting consumers, 5 figure downloads. 
- SaaS targeting larger businesses, generating low 6 figure yearly revenue.

I was one of two developers for each of these projects. 

I don't have anything to showcase outside of these projects since that's all I've been working on these past few years. None of these projects are open-source so my GitHub is empty outside of some homework assignments.

I'm worried that, since my resume is so entrepreneurship oriented, companies are deeming me as a ""flight risk"" and hurt my chances of being hired full time. 

## **Questions**

I have a few questions:

1. How should I present my projects on my resume? Should I change my resume so that all of my projects are ""no longer operational""?
2. How do I answer questions such as ""Why do you want to work fulltime instead of pursuing entrepreneurship"" / ""Why do you want to work here?
3. How do I ""present"" my story without straight out lying?

I know that part of the reason I'm not doing well at the interviews is due to lack of preparation for the technical portion of the interviews, but I'm not sure if the reason I don't pass interviews is 100% because of my technical interview performance, or also due to my behavioral interview performance.

I just started at WGU and will be taking the C# course. Prior to this I have done various online learning in front end dev through free code camp, udemy and YouTube for the last 4 months or so. I have made myself a portfolio site (which I will improve upon and add a backend to once I get there) and a two sites for people I know.

I plan to move to Raleigh once I finish to go after my first job. Were any of you able to get your first job without any internship experience? Any advice? "

The thing is....things haven't been going great. I've had several phone interviews but none have transitioned to an in-person one, sometimes I haven't even gotten a response at all.

The only time I ever got an in-person interview, it went horribly due to me not preparing as well as I probably should have(having an anxiety attack during it probably didn't help either).

And at this point....I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. I've been at the job hunt for almost 3 months now(he'll earlier than that because I was still applying for stuff while I was still in school) and I just haven't managed to get a good opportunity(Currently the only thing I have going is an opportunity for a Software Development Engineer job at Amazon, which I don't feel great about my chances on because I just don't feel like I'm good enough) In person interviews are my biggest issue because of my anxiety disorder.

So what advice is there? What should I do?

Should I:

* Keep trying despite the fact that Entry Level jobs are filling fast?

* Go for something besides a Software Engineering job? Like say Web Design or Technical Writing(though I'm not sure if there are Entry Level jobs in that)?

* Try for an internship despite already being out of school?

* Get a day job and work on sharpening my skills even further like learning new languages or something like mobile development in the hopes that there'll still be Entry Level opportunities down the road?

I just don't know what anymore"

I didn't realize until later in my education that I would prefer to pursue a career in software development instead of business. I recently completed a Software Engineering internship in August and I have two other prior internships for relevant work experience. I am relocating to work near home in the NJ/NYC area and am seeking new job opportunities and advice.

​

**Situation:** I have been applying for a month now with several interviews and two job offers. I don't have much work experience and I have only been contacted by staffing agencies (no direct placements) that offer similar ""Right to Hire"" positions where these intermediary companies would hire me full-time and contract me to their clients. Recently I have received an offer for NYC for 60K as an Associate Java Developer. I understand this is considered underpaid in the industry, but I would like to use this opportunity as a foot-in-the-door for future development positions. The team I would be working for (and interviewed with) seems confident that I would be hired full-time after the contract for ""fair market price"", since most of them were originally contractors. I have listed the details of the offer below:

​

**Position Details**:

* $30/hr as a W2 Employee
* No PTO with 5 sick days  (hourly employee)
* Health benefits (will not be using this since I will be under a family plan)
* 6 month contract (client can choose to extend full-time offer after this period)

I sent in a ‘checking in’ email last week to the recruiter but no response.

During the interviews, they told me that they needed someone by September 10th. That’s less than a week from now. Honestly, I’m not entirely devastated if I don’t get the internship but they asked me if I was willing to drop some of my classes and move 400+ miles away all on my own dime to make this internship work and I said DEFINITELY. Although, dropping my classes will probably delay my graduation another semester but I’m willing to do it. I just feel like its a little inconsiderate to go absolute radio silence.

They would smugly talk at length about how awesome they thought they were, and were quite dull to be around because they never listened to you and brought every conversation back to themself. I interned at the same big 4/big 5 company both times, so that might be why - naturally such companies attract ambitious narcissists.


Perhaps it’s a culture clash - I grew up in a slightly rural place, where being humble was kind of a social norm for both men and women. It was basically expected that when you got complimented, you meet that compliment with a self-deprecating remark and tried to avoid bragging at all costs, and focused on other people’s feelings first. You try to be interested in the other person and don’t constantly put the spotlight on yourself.


I hate, hate, hate thinking that if I want to get anywhere, I have to brag incessantly about myself and forgo the most basic of social skills. The people who got rewarded were the loud, brash, and inconsiderate people who had zero self awareness and seemed pathologically self-absorbed. Anyone have any advice/been through the same?

Wanted to give a bit of advice for lower years (going into last year) and generally say some positive stuff (hopefully I won't get deleted off?!) anonymously

also on co-op and too early to sleep so to use up some time right now...

to incoming students:
you will be ok! There's so much time to learn more about yourself, what you want to do and to meet new friends so don't feel like you need to rush. Everyone loves at their own speed - even that other frosh that has had 3 internships and won 4 contests and has a full scholarship has struggled at some point.

If you're struggling with friends: try to go outside your comfort zone - join those Rez meetings, join a club, sign up for a sport (intramural or lessons at CIF) - even if you're the worst one in the class you'll get out more and meet new people which is always good.

If you're struggling period: talk to someone. People care. A lot of students go through the same things, I've realized with my own peers but rarely does anyone vocalize. As shown before, there are people on this Reddit that care about mental health and well being - you're worth treating yourself properly. And if you need a break, take it. One semester off is nothing bin comparison to the rest of your life.

If you think school will be hard: prepare! Study! It isn't lame to be the one that stays in to prep for quizzes, helps in the long run. Use Quizlet, do practice exams, ask your TAs, use Piazza, create study groups. If all else fails, most profs tend to be quite understanding if you explain and show that you're willing and committed to put in effort and try. Don't cheat - it doesn't get you anywhere in academics or in relationships.

Misc: you will not need a full meal plan if you live in one of the CLV/MKV/UWP etc unless you eat out for every. single. meal. I'm still using my watched in forth year with meal plan $ from first year.
Exercise! Even a few minutes of stretching, outside jogs, cycling in CIF will do wonders for health and mind.
be safe! If you drink - have a backup buddy to call / hold back your hair/prevent you from drunk dialing people you should not etc. Also getting blackout drunk in random places may not be the best idea. (But be safe!! No judgement.)

For those that are wondering about co-op:
Get someone in your program or upper year to rip apart your resume. Yes, ceca will have a way of doing it. No, don't follow that. 
It's ok if your first job isn't what you dreamed of. It's your FIRST job. And likely it's going to suck. But that's okay - you learn through experience and struggles and hopefully you meet cool people. I found my first job outside of WW and it turned out to be the best co-op I've had so far despite being surrounded by strangers. And build upon it --&gt; keep trying, keep updating your resume, and keep learning. 
Also, feel free to jump around companies and areas (I jumped around for every co-op and I don't regret it - my path wasn't a predictable one but that's not a bad thing!)
Networking: you might not guarantee a job interview at all - but it's not a terrible thing. Practice socializing, soft skills, and become really good at asking questions and listening. If you could email after, that just might be your in to an interview. And you don't have to be perfect, just don't be rude.

Housing off campus:
No kw4rent. 
Please.
But If you must (I e. Desperate times desperate measures) - learn to do some basic home repairs (plunging toilet, lights etc or else some random crappy fee will come out of nowhere by management)
And avoid 201 Lester for cockroaches.

9d2lps,0,2018-09-04,"Thinking about starting to apply to other places, but nervous that I don't look good on paper.",Fun-ghoul,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9d2lps/thinking_about_starting_to_apply_to_other_places/,"So back in 2014 I got an internship at the company I currently work for. I was 2 years into my CS degree, and I was doing alright. Not great, but not too bad. Honestly though, I hated school. Everything we were learning was outdated and I was learning more on my own then I was in school. Then right after my internship I was offered a job as QA. It was a great position for me at the time and I was happy to take it. I was learning so much and was happy, but unfortunately I let my grades slip, with my GPA hovering between 2.0 and 2.5. But I was confident I'd be able to get them up, especially because I had more spare time working one full time job then two part time jobs. About 9 months into my position though, I got laid off and ended up having to get another job to help cover bills and stuff (I was moved out and paying for everything on my own). The job I got wasn't in my field, and was very rigid with my hours. Partly because of this, my grades slipped enough that my GPA dropped just below 2.0 for a whole semester, and they dropped me from the program. Good news did come pretty soon though, as some people from my old job (where I was QA at) reached out and asked if I was open to coming back. I had nothing to lose, and honestly missed the job so I happily took it. I was hired back about 9 months after I first got laid off and was offered a raise to come back. The only problem though was that QA isn't what I wanted to do as a career, I want to be a developer. I was happy for a while and had promises of eventually moving up, but it's been years now and I'm tired of getting dragged along. At my current job, my title is still QA Engineer, but I do WAY more then that. I of course do manual QA, write some of our automation, work on our code all across the stack (probably over half my time at this point is doing the work of a developer), lead larger QA projects... And when it comes to my developer work, this is stuff that they're coming to me and expecting me to do. I'm the one they come to when they need something done fast and done right on the QA side of things, I'm working well over 60 hours a week with frequent nights and weekends, and I'm being paid in probably the lowest 10th percentile of my area for QA, let alone developer. I've been kinda bottling up my feelings for a while because I really do love my job and the people I work with, but my responsibilities are sky rocketing and my pay is stagnating. I'm doing the job of at least 2 people and I think I'm ready to start looking around. But I technically only have a few years of ""QA Engineer"" experience and no degree because I flunked out of school, which are pretty big red flags in my mind. I'm confident in my abilities, and everyone I work with could vouch for me, but I can't exactly go and put my current manager as a reference. I realize that just on paper and by my resume, I don't look like an impressive candidate, but in person I am. Do I just suck it up and hope eventually things work out better at my current job? Do I start looking, and if so, any advice on how to ""pretty"" myself up as a candidate to get passed screening so I can really prove myself? Or is this stuff all in my head and should I not worry and just start trying for other places? Sorry if this question is a little scatter-brained, I'm wrapping up about a 15 hour shift and just finished a release to production and tried to lay out my thoughts real quick. Any advice is appreciated!"

The only jobs I've gotten called back for are pseudo-MLM schemes where you're basically just selling something like DirecTV or some BS product and that's not what I want to do.

I've had a couple of interviews, one didn't call me back, and couple I didn't call back because the jobs were not at all what was described in the job description. However, by and large, even jobs that I should hit all the criteria for, seem to look past me and never even get back to me even after months. I suspect this is due to my lack of experience in the industry on paper, but I'm struggling to think of how I ought to get experience if everybody looks me over for my lack of experience. As of now I have a few options I'm considering, I was hoping you could give me some more options or advice on which options I should pursue.

1) Go back to school for either a masters or another degree like computer science or statistics (to add in with marketing, not a change in career necessarily)

2) Go back to working wage jobs like sales associate etc. to get more work experience (even though it wouldn't be anything more than a lateral move based on my current experience)

3) Keep at it and hope. This is the one I'm doing now, but it seems like a stupid idea to keep doing what I'm doing being that it's not working out.

Side note I live in the metro NY area so most of the jobs I apply for are in NYC. Does this seem problematic re: the fact that the higher population density may put me at a lower end of the distribution of people than if I started looking in lower pop. cities? I visited my friend in Wisconsin a while back and got a few interviews very quickly, I suspect in part because of the fact that there's fewer people there, but they were also the jobs that weren't marketing jobs at all, so that may have had an impact on that experience.

Sorry for the long read, I'm looking forward to your advice, thanks!"

So I graduated in May with my Associates in CIS with an emphasis in Networking, and I have had no luck trying to find something in this field. Even before graduating I have been filling out applications, calling businesses, and trying to put myself out there, with no real luck.

I don't feel like I'm trying to shoot too high, as most of the jobs I've applied for have been help desk/entry level positions. Besides my Associates I have 2 Microsoft Certifications  (Installing and Configuring Windows 10, and Network Fundamentals) plus a load of TestOut certs, but I know most employers do not really look at those. I want to get my A+ and CCNA soon, but without a full time job it has been hard to get the materials I need to study and pay for the tests themselves.

I have filled out so many applications on Indeed, Monster, LinkedIn, Dice, and companies directly. Since May I have only had 3 interviews for positions. One company looked promising with a second interview, but then I never heard from them again. I've talked to my old professors, met with the college's Career Services advisor, and talked many times with the company and managers from my internship, but I have had no luck.

Any advice on where I can go from here would be greatly appreciated."

I'm mostly just here to vent, but if anyone is able to offer any words of wisdom in this situation it would be much appreciated :).

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my last co-op. I thought everything was going great, and for the first time out of all my co-ops, I really felt like I could see working here Full-Time. A couple weeks ago, I was confident I would ride off into the sunset and work here after graduation. A week ago, I got a call telling me I didn't receive a FT offer. I'm feeling a lot of emotions right now. Ashamed at myself for not being able to secure an offer, betrayed at my boss for making me think the entire internship that I was getting an offer only to not give me one, and very angry that my future that I've been envisioning for the past two months has been completely eradicated.

&amp;#x200B;

Further, I can't help but feel really guilty that I was given this opportunity, that hundreds of people can only dream of, and didn't seize it fully. It might be strange to say, but I can't help but think that I robbed this chance from a person who would have done this job right. Further, there are about half a dozen friends who I referred who I know would have their lives drastically improved if they were to receive an offer from this company, but now that my internship wasn't successful I'm sure that my referrals will be meaningless and I let all my friends down.

&amp;#x200B;

This company also pays virtually more than any company I've ever heard of in this industry, and I suspect that I will spend the next five or so next years of my career to climb to the point to where I would have been right out of school had I received the offer. I was told that I was an extremely borderline case with respect to getting an offer (although maybe they tell that to many of the people they reject), so it makes me left wondering if there was ever one little thing I could have done to change my fate.

&amp;#x200B;

Every day since I've been told of this result, I can't shake the feeling of shame and disappointment that washes over me. It's been the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about when I go to sleep. I keep waiting for the realization that this has all been a dream or that they will email or call me again to tell me that there was a mistake and they're actually giving me an offer.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the five years I've been here, this is the most disappointed I've ever been."

Asian-Indian Male, Competitive State, Lived in India for middle school, Very competitive, rigorous, private high-school (#2 in state, #70 in nation)

OBJECTIVE:

SAT - 1530. Retaking.

ACT - 34. Retaking.

SAT II - 800 Math 2, 780 Physics

GPA UW - 94/100 or 3.9/4GPA W - N/A

RANK - N/A (I only know of about 7 or maybe 8 or 9 people in a class of 74 that have a higher gpa than me, but I don't know for sure because my school does not rank and will not give colleges our ranks)

APs: Spanish Lang - 4, English Lang - 4, APCSA - 5

SENIOR YEAR COURSES - AP Chem, AP Micro, AP Gov, AP Calc AB, Lit, Art Electives

This is considered a rigorous course load for my school, not the most rigorous, but definitely second or third most or so. The only year I didn't take the most rigorous courses available to me was Junior year (took 2 APs instead of the limit of 3)

SUBJECTIVE: Extracurriculars (In order of appearance on CommonApp):

\- **President of large Social Justice club:** We put on productions like an annual MLK assembly, screen films, organize guest speakers (Had the professor of African Studies at Emory U speak for us this year), etc. As President I manage all of these productions, assign tasks, etc. In addition, as a result of my position, I've been called upon by my school's senior staff to sit in on board meetings and advise them on how to make a more culturally competent campus community and bring more diversity to our school (my school is very rich and is 85% white). I also interview prospective teachers to check for cultural competency. 9-12

\- **Leader (AKA President) of Admissions Student Ambassador Program:** Manage 100+ student ambassadors, responsible for info dispersion to them, getting them ready for events, training, delegating positions at school open house events, lead tour groups, etc. As President, I am the main link between prospective students and parents and the current student body. I am who any prospective families go to if they want answers from a current student. (Side question about this one: will colleges know what student ambassadors are without me having to explain it? Because I want to use my limited common app space to talk about my achievements in the activity instead of wasting time explaining what the program is.) 9-12

\- **Editor-In-Chief of Yearbook:** Enforce deadlines, delegate tasks, set artistic style and theme, hold everyone accountable for quality and deadlines, manage volunteer outreach, help lead a Middle School graphic design club to supplement the Yearbook production. 9-12

\- **Freelance Blogger for The Hindu:** The Hindu is the second most circulated English daily in India. Had an 1 month internship this past summer when I was in India, proposed, wrote, edited, and published multiple articles and blog posts on US Politics and Sports, I was asked to continue work for their online blog (which gets a lot of attention) throughout the school year on my own terms, which I accepted. 12

\- **Internship for US Congresswoman from my State**: Internship for very progressive Congresswoman, knocked on some 200+ doors and made some 500+ calls. Her progressive views align nicely with my background in social justice. The internship was originally unpaid, but I helped lead the charge to make it a paid opportunity, as many of my fellow interns were low income students from the local State university who were pursuing the internship at the expense of their financial wellbeing. Helped gather testimonies from my peers and craft a letter to the congresswoman which ended up procuring us pay for our work, though the story was picked up by the media and sadly used for slanderous purposes. 11-12

\- **President of Aeronautics club:** We design and engineer model planes. As president, I supply materials, decide on group projects and challenges, delegate tasks, educate new members on plane anatomy and physics, etc. We don't compete in any contests, we just have fun. 11-12

\- **Squash**: Player since age 7, currently nationally ranked, compete in gold tournaments across the nation, coach younger players. 9-12

\- **Piano**: Player since age 5, private lessons, solo performances in churches, school, and the like. 9-12

\- **City Youth Council**: Member my city's selective youth council, discuss topic such as food waste and homelessness and break into teams to create projects to address them like drives and fundraisers, and well as host an annual large diversity conference. 9-12

\- **Supervisor for Boys and Girls club:** The club I volunteer at helps primarily low-income, disadvantaged children. I have volunteered twice a week every week for the past 2 weeks. I am treated basically as if I have a leadership position, though I technically have no name for it. I have 100+ service hours at this one location, well over my school's graduation requirement. 11-12

9d5gqq,1,2018-09-05,Wanting to change industries from HR consulting to management consulting or corporate strategy after 6 months into first full-time job - any advice on handling this transition?,HWtosser,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9d5gqq/wanting_to_change_industries_from_hr_consulting/,"**Background:** I graduated early from college and have been working at a boutique HR consulting firm in NYC for the past 6 months. Previous to this, during school, I did an internship at a financial services firm and then an internship at another HR consulting firm. I don't think I ever really wanted to go into this industry, but I feel like I sort of fell into it.

For my academic credentials, I got a 3.5-3.7 GPA from a feeder school, but I didn't really do any extracurriculars or networking, which I think is the primary reason why I didn't get as many job offers in the industries I was hoping for. I'm hoping that having already started my career will sort of make those less relevant.

**Dilemma:** The firm is really nice with good people, but I just don't really find my work or the experience of working that interesting, and I fear that I am pigeon-holing myself into a very specific industry that I don't want to be in. Long-term, I would like to start my own business by being the bus. dev. cofounder/advisor or going into a high work, high reward industry like investment banking and then financing some start-ups. I think going into management consulting or corporate strategy would be both interesting and help me work toward my goals.

**My questions:**

* Should I start applying for jobs now or wait until I've worked at this job for a year?
   * Considering that my ideal jobs (which may be two jobs in the future considering that the transition may be difficult) are at a select group of highly-competitive companies (the Big 3 consulting firms, the top 6 or so investment banks, and the Big 4 accounting firms), would I be decreasing the likelihood of getting a job there in the future, when I am more qualified, if I apply now?
   * Would it hurt me long-term to leave my first full-time job so early into it?
* Should I be reaching back out to the recruiters that message me on LinkedIn about (mostly) HR and HR consulting roles?
   * Would it hurt to ask them about jobs outside of the industry they're inquiring about?
* Do you have any other advice on making this industry transition or applying for other jobs before the year mark?

Thank you for the help! I'm happy to answer any other questions, too."

9d65gz,7,2018-09-05,Should I accept this tech internship offer for next summer?,saxplaya,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9d65gz/should_i_accept_this_tech_internship_offer_for/,"I'm a junior studying Computer Science at a top university in the US. This past summer, I interned for a somewhat unconventional tech company in the US. It's been around for a long time, and unlike most tech companies, it has a more old-fashioned, corporate culture. I definitely had a good experience at the company, but there were a few things I didn't love and I don't want to return to the company next summer.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer, a tech startup in CA that I applied to last December reached out to take a coding challenge. I got through the whole interview process and yesterday they gave me an offer for next summer. Typically, the intern hiring process for tech companies starts around November and usually goes until late February/March, so it's pretty early to get an offer. The company seems great. They have great reviews on Glassdoor, every interviewer was very pleasant, and they have high-profile clients and investors, suggesting that despite being a young and small company, it's established and well-respected.

&amp;#x200B;

The pay they offered is pretty high for tech internships, albeit not as high as some of the big tech companies like Google or Facebook. I would be taking a pretty big pay raise compared to this past summer, too. I'm trying not to put too much emphasis on the pay, though, and more on making sure I get an internship that will teach me valuable skills and look good on a resume, both of which it seems I would get at this company.

&amp;#x200B;

They didn't really give me an offer deadline, but it sounds like they want me to get back to them very soon (my guess is they're trying to secure interns before all the other companies start hiring). 

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is: is it too early for me to accept this internship? My inclination is to take it because it sounds like a great place to work and it will be good experience for my resume. It would also save me the trouble of spending a ton of time applying and interviewing elsewhere. However, if I accept it, I won't have the opportunity to look around and apply to other companies. I'm currently leaning toward accepting it, but wanted to get others' thoughts. Thanks!"
9d66bl,2,2018-09-05,Will I kill my chances to work for a company in the future if I refuse a job offer now?,ElainePorter,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9d66bl/will_i_kill_my_chances_to_work_for_a_company_in/,"A couple of months ago, I applied for a very cool and a relatively prestigious internship. I received an informal offer some time later without a specific starting date. They finally got back to me now (almost five months later) and said they would like me to start this month. However, I still didn't get a written offer (I got the offer by phone), didn't get a starting date and all they said was that they would reach out to me next week to set up a meeting.   


I'd like to believe that I'm really starting soon but since the company was kind of flaky in the past and nothing is official yet, I'm a bit worried this will take a couple of months again. Therefore, I recently started looking for other jobs and found one position that is a bit less ""prestigious"" but sounds very interesting (also...it's a full time position /but still basically a traineeship/ and it's better paid). The application deadline is coming soon and I can't decide whether I should apply or not. I would really love to work for this company in the future (on a different position but in the same department as this one) but at this point, it would be more beneficial for me to accept the internship if I really get an official offer.   


I'm worried I might lose a great opportunity if I don't apply and don't get the internship either. However, I'm also worried that I might lose a chance to apply for other positions at the same company in the future in case I apply and then withdraw my application/refuse the job offer. It's not a huge company (with a small HR department) and one day, I'd ideally like to work at the same department as the one that's hiring now...so my future applications can basically be considered by the same people. Am I overthinking or do you think this is a serious concern I should take into account? What would you recommend to do if you were in a similar situation?   


Thank you so much for your insight! "

9d6ihc,15,2018-09-05,26 years old and completely burnt out of office work - interested in skills work,DouglasBubbletrouser,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9d6ihc/26_years_old_and_completely_burnt_out_of_office/,"NYC, 26 Male with 3 years of sales / customer success experience in the tech industry. 

I'm relatively successful, always ranking near or at the top performance on my team and finally found what I thought was a perfect fit in this type of role following a few tough inside sales gigs with a lot of cold calling. 

Now my job is to keep existing clients onboard and staying with us, it plays well to my organization, problem solving, and personal skills but even though I'm in just about the best situation I could be between salary, work from home flexibility, low stress culture, solid product and great people I realize that I will be miserable if I spend the rest of my life in traditional office work settings. 

There's just too much monotony and dealing with angry clients is so emotionally draining it feels like a part of me dies each day. 

Music is my passion and I originally studied and planned on doing live music / arena / venue management but decided against pursuing that after internships and realizing that working in those settings takes away the magic and with all the nights and weekends you lose the ability to go to these events. 

I have a creative side from music and am a good writer but not so great on visual/design creativity. 

I very much like having regular working hours, and since I'm in a band that pulls in some additional income playing nights and weekends it's important I have that availability though I'm nowhere close to even covering rent. This is my actual passion but it's not something I want to bank on completely given how hard it is to make a career out of it so I need a steady job that would allow me to continue that pursuit. 

I think I need to work with my hands or be a part of creating something. I used to manage a pool and the feeling of satisfaction I felt from keeping everything running smoothly from pumps to chemicals to grounds keeping to happy patrons is something I long for deeply and the reason I pursued a recreation management degree. I like ensuring that others are able to enjoy themselves. 

Once again I'm not sure if events are for me given the time constraints and more than anything I enjoyed completing all the tasks that kept the place running. 

I think a trade or skill would be a better fit, but not sure where to begin looking. With music such a passion I've considered instrument maintenance / building like becoming piano tuner or luthier. More traditional trades like electrician would be interesting as well to apply that knowledge to electronics in music as a hobby. 

I've considered programming / IT work because I have a keen interest in computers and have been building PCs since I was 16 and I've tried taking online coding classes and always get stuck as the problems get harder since I've got so many other things going on and it doesn't fully spark my interest as much as the hardware side of things. 

I love beer and have made several solid homebrew batches and loved it but that's hard to break into as well without more experience and I've had to stop since moving apartments recently. 

TL; DR : burnt out of office life and don't think I can find happiness there, still looking for regular hours though even its 50+ a week , love problem/puzzle solving and completing tasks, creating something whether experiences or projects, easy going and sociable, range of interests mostly stemming from music and computers. 

Would greatly appreciate any insight or advice, rant typed this up on the train so happy to provide more information that could be relevant."

I posted this to /offmychest too, I just would like more opinions on if my feelings towards my first job is normal to feel or if I should quit and look for something less stressful
(Mods feel free to delete if this is the wrong sub)


I am 21 and recently graduated with a business bachelors degree, &amp; started my first (real adult) job a month ago.
Previously to this job I had a business internship that I enjoyed the work in as an assistant, but in honesty that job was easygoing with it being 60% work &amp; 40% me reddit browsing, along with it only being 10 hours a week (while taking senior classes)
I started a new job working at a big national company who deals with many major clients, with my job being taking client requests and scheduling dozens of online orders &amp; tasks needed a day. (Trying not to get too specific in my job)


This job requires tons &amp; tons of multitasking multiple tasks &amp; conversations with major clients and requires me to be insanely detail oriented while remembering all of the client's specific needs. I also have to work very fast paced and meet deadlines, &amp; I also have to keep track of these deadlines myself, without much help. If I mess up any tiny details in my job, I can lose the client money. I have already done this on this past Sunday &amp; the client is very mad and I feel absolutely awful. (It's not tons &amp; tons of money but it's still a pretty bad situation) I have also been making other smaller mistakes at my job that are way less severe but still make the client unhappy, &amp; I am trying my best to not make mistakes but with fast deadlines &amp; lots of details I feel like I am drowning.


Also the job is 8:30-5:00 but there's already been multiple evenings where I had to work at home all the way until 6:00-7:00 which has been giving me more stress because I feel like I can never escape. I also work on a team, so if I am slow or make any mistake then it causes everyone else to have to do things like work after hours. I have talked to my boss today about how she can make my job less stressful, but I honestly don't think it's possible.
More than anything, I want to quit. I have had normal-to-moderate amounts of anxiety before in the past but nothing like this before. I have been having panic/anxiety attacks daily, I've been crying easily which I've done a few times before work because I didn't want to go (I have never done this before), I've had a lower appetite &amp; also have been throwing up during my panic attacks (directly job related). Just soo soo much pressure and stress.
All of my friends/family said they would support me if I quit, but I'm scared. My coworkers are very nice &amp; have been trying to help me the best they can. I just don't think I am qualified for this position though, it's so stressful and my mental health has never been so bad. I don't want to disappoint my boss too, she is very nice &amp; I don't want to make her work life harder, especially since I've made many mistakes at work lately thats been causing everyone stress.


I'm also mad at myself for giving up so easily. It's only been 1 month and I'd feel bad for bailing. I don't like to consider myself someone who bails at the first sign of trouble, but I just know I can't last much longer here, my gut has been telling me since day 1 that this job is going to stress me out
My biggest fear though: what if every job is like this??? I have an interview lined up for an office assistant job on thursday and an auto dealership, but what if I get that job and nothing changes? What if I just hate working 9-5? I hate not having free time, I hate giving 8 hours to something I don't enjoy, I just don't know if the problem is the job or if the problem is me.


I do think I need to get help for anxiety in general, I am talking to my parents about therapy &amp; maybe medication.
I just don't know what to do. I am just adjusting so poorly to life after college &amp; I want it to all stop. Part of me wants to quit my job this Friday, but I hate quitting without something lined up. I'm not in desperate need for money though, I have a saving account that can last me a couple months along with supportive parents (I don't want to rely on them though unless I have to). I do think I could find a job kind of fast, but only if I'm willing to accept jobs that aren't entirely in my field. The only sad thing about leaving this job is that they specialize the EXACT field I want to go in to, but my job itself isn't doing tasks related to that job. Also the pay is great here &amp; I doubt I can find something as good with my limited job experience, but like I said I'm not desperate for money.
I am sorry this is so ramble-ly &amp; is full of first world problems. I just really neede to get my thoughts out of my head &amp; maybe hear what others who actually have job experience may have to say. Should I stick it out? Is what I'm feeling normal for a first job? I'm just so so lost."

## Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

Hi, my name is Theo Lee and I’m the co-founder and CEO of [**KPOP Foods**](https://www.kpopfoods.com/).

Today, the brand and story behind a company is critical for success and sustainability as consumers are driven towards companies and products making an impact.

KPOP Foods is a Korean food company inviting people to discover and enjoy Korean flavors through its food products. Our approach is to become the Red Bull of Korean food by bringing together mainstream culture, art, music, and food.

My co-founder, Mike Kim, and I are both Korean Americans and launched KPOP Foods because we wanted to build a Korean food brand that people could resonate with and embrace.

Our mission was and continues to be about bringing people together and uplifting spirits through Korean food and flavors. When we looked at the Korean food companies in the market, we couldn’t find one that represented this spirit, so we decided to do it ourselves.

Our first product is KPOP Sauce, a Korean chili sauce based on my grandma’s 70-year old recipe using Korean chili paste (aka gochujang). We debuted KPOP Sauce through a successful [**Kickstarter campaign**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/603961883/k-pop-sauce-the-ultimate-korean-chili-sauce) last year in April that funded within the first eight hours of our campaign.

We received Kickstarter’s stamp of approval as ""A Project we Love"" and were featured as “A Project of the Day” and ended the Kickstarter campaign with nearly $40,000 from over 1,200 backers.

In April of this year, we launched our second product, KPOP Sea Snacks, a premium roasted and all-natural seaweed snack made here in the US.

While still fairly new, KPOP Sea Snacks is already an Amazon’s Choice product and was featured in FabFitFun (a women’s quarterly subscription box) and Pinterest’s limited-edition, specially co-branded box called the [**P100**](http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/pinterest-fabfitfun-box/313927/).

Most recently, we announced our new Head of Product and Product Development, celebrity chef, [**Chris Oh**](http://www.chefchrisoh.com/).

Chris is developing several new sauces that we intend to launch in November and is also opening his network for opportunities in marketing, content, and partnerships. We’re really excited to have Chris onboard and to be working with him!

Since September of last year, we’ve generated nearly $100,000 in revenue, primarily all online through our website and Amazon. Our products have earned the coveted Amazon’s Choice badge because they are unique and well -reviewed.

We’ve entered over 90 specialty stores throughout the west coast and are currently raising an investment round to expand our distribution into major retailers.

# What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

Growing up in Korean American families, we were fortunate to be surrounded by Korean food all the time. However, along with the food, an important principle that was instilled in us was the connection between Korean food and family, friends, and fun.

Mike and I met at business school at UCLA Anderson where we would take large groups of friends to Koreatown in Los Angeles to enjoy Korean food. Along with enjoying the food, our friends embraced the Korean culture and the energetic atmosphere.

This is what sparked the idea for KPOP Foods. We wanted to replicate the sensory and social experience our friends had at Korean BBQ and share it with the world!

I think a really important concept, especially for when just starting out, is being comfortable with launching things quickly.

The UCLA Anderson community played, and continues to play, a major role in KPOP Foods. We took the concept and business plan for KPOP Foods through UCLA Anderson’s entrepreneurial classes and startup program called Business Creation Option, a field study option required for graduation.

Prior to business school, Mike served in the U.S. Army and I came from a finance and banking background so neither of us had any real experience in food nor marketing.

Our classmates, professors, and other members of faculty were instrumental in advising and helping us during our Kickstarter campaign, which launched during our final quarter at business school, and connecting us to potential investors, advisors, and food industry professionals.

If you’d like to learn more, I’ve actually written a LinkedIn post about [**UCLA Anderson’s role in KPOP Foods**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/community-kickstarter-built-kpop-foods-theo-lee/).

The Kickstarter campaign was key in validating our idea and giving us the confidence to pursue KPOP Foods full-time.

But even before Kickstarter, we did hours of research, talking to CEOs and founders of other successful Kickstarter campaigns, running focus groups to test our brand story and variations of KPOP Sauce, and picking people’s brains on ideas for our Kickstarter video.

We also found a way to create samples by buying little bento box soy sauce containers shaped like pigs and filling them up with KPOP Sauce to send to our friends and people interested across the nation.

The samples were great as we were able to send them in the mail, keeping costs low as we paid for everything ourselves with our savings and credit cards. This was also helpful in getting the awareness of our Kickstarter campaign out to people.

As MBA students, we had significant student loans and were presented with opportunities to work at great companies, but thanks to our Kickstarter campaign, we were able to raise an initial investment round, allowing us to pay ourselves a minimum salary to cover rent, loan payments, and basic living expenses.

This was our chance to build something on our own and work for something that we truly loved so we dove right in.

# Describe the process of designing, prototyping, and manufacturing the product.

**Getting the ingredients right**

The reason we started with KPOP Sauce was because one of the key ingredients, gochujang (Korean chili paste), is a staple ingredient in Korean cuisine.

Additionally, my grandma used to send me bottles of her gochujang sauce and my friends absolutely loved it, putting it on their eggs, grilled chicken, burgers, hot dogs, noodles, rice, and more.

Given the versatility, we thought it was the right product to start with – a flavorful sauce that people could incorporate onto foods they already eat. Along with that, gochujang can be difficult to use given its thicker texture (think peanut butter), so the sauce made it much easier to use or cook with.

We used my grandma’s recipe as a base and began tweaking things based on feedback. The most controversial ingredient turned out to be sesame oil – some people really liked it, others didn’t. When we removed the sesame oil, people still liked the sauce, so we took it out.

**Packaging &amp; Design**

We also had to figure out the packaging, namely the bottle, cap, and label. Based on research and our focus groups, we wanted to be in a plastic bottle, so we went online and looked for as many different bottles as possible and asked people for their thoughts.

We also used these bottles during the focus groups to test usability and to see which one people naturally gravitated towards.

For label design, we found a designer, who I previously worked with at a previous startup, to help mock up some label designs. We gave him our story, ideas, and mock images to use as a style reference.

We eventually narrowed the label designs down to two options and received feedback from friends and people. We also posted the designs to social media and received a ton of engagement and comments through that as well.

Next, we had to find a manufacturer, or co-packer, to make our sauce at scale. I remember calling 15 to 20 different manufacturers and not getting anywhere, especially since we didn’t know how much we wanted to produce (time is literally money for manufacturers and since we hadn’t started our Kickstarter campaign, we didn’t know how much we needed to make in our first run).

Finally, a co-packer we ended up working with, was nice enough to explain the process and offered to help.

We learned that the first step was to find a food scientist to scale our recipe as things can quickly change when going from making small batches to hundreds of gallons.

The food scientist would also help us with testing for shelf stability, analyzing the sauce for nutritional information, and submitting our application for the license to manufacture in California, otherwise known as a S-Letter.

The person who explained the process to us sent over a list of potential food scientists - we were fortunate to find a food scientist through a friend of my uncle’s.

I had several calls with the food scientist and met with him to make sure it was a good fit and he turned out to be great, explaining to us certain issues and basic concepts.

**Finding suppliers**

While the food scientist focused on the product, we shifted our focus towards finding suppliers, namely for packaging (bottles and caps) and key ingredients. We were fortunate to find a packaging supplier that was also able to assist with warehousing as the minimum order quantities for the bottles and caps were well above our first production run.

Furthermore, we were able to negotiate a structure such that we only paid for the bottles and caps delivered to our manufacturer. This saved us a ton of money as the minimum order quantities for our caps was 25,000, yet we only needed 6,000 for our first run.

Alongside packaging, we also sourced a quality ingredient supplier that turned out to be in the same area as our manufacturer, keeping the transportation costs low.

After several months, we received our S-Letter and were ready to do our first production run for approximately 6,000 bottles. We’ve since completed 4 more production runs for KPOP Sauce, each time making small tweaks to the recipe as we’re always looking to improve.

Chris is now working on developing several new sauces and we’ve already begun the development process and excited to launch the new products later this year.

## Describe the process of launching the business.

Before launching our Kickstarter campaign, we made sure to have our website and social media accounts up and running.

We bought the domain for kpopfoods.com through **godaddy.com** for less than $20 a year and used **Shopify** to build our website.

In the beginning, we focused on building our social media accounts, mainly Instagram and Facebook. We used our website for credibility and a way to share our story while offering samples to promote our Kickstarter campaign.

After fulfilling all of our Kickstarter orders on-time in August, we were ready to begin selling nationally through our website in September. We picked up a number of re-orders from our Kickstarter campaign in the first couple of weeks and also began testing Facebook and Google ads.

In the beginning, we struggled to get conversions, leading to a higher customer acquisition cost than initially expected, however we learned a lot about our user flow and funnel. We’ve gone through countless iterations of our website to improve the UI/UX.

In October, we entered Amazon through ""Fulfillment By Amazon"" (FBA) and this was when things really began to take off.

We were fortunate to pick up a number of five-star reviews immediately from customers and Kickstarter backers, allowing us to become an “Amazon’s Choice” product within the first week. We soon became the #1 new selling chili sauce on Amazon for the next three consecutive months.

## Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

As we started to see high levels of conversions on Amazon, sometimes as high as 30%, we began changing our digital marketing strategy.

**Retargeting**

We were able to get clicks to our website at a very low cost per click, and thanks to some PR initiatives, SEO optimization, and content development (both video and blog articles), we were able to increase sessions to our website to 150 to 200 a day.

We would then retarget our website visitors with Facebook ads, driving them to Amazon and continued to see high conversions. As we began talking to other CEOs and CMOs of food startups selling online, they mentioned that they were using the same strategy.

The one downside to this strategy is that you can’t collect customers’ email addresses through Amazon - inhibiting your ability to retarget.

**Instagram**

While we’ve grown our Instagram account to over 10,000 followers, we’ve been using Instagram as a tool to partner with Korean restaurants and reach out to influencers we’d like to work with.

We haven’t seen a significant amount of conversions from campaigns with Instagram influencers, however these partnerships have been successful in growing our following, driving traffic to our website, and providing creative assets for our e-mails, website, and ads.

**YouTube**

We’ve had success partnering with YouTube influencers, but it’s taken a lot of time, effort, and luck. When we first started cold e-mailing influencers, we didn’t get many responses.

If you’ve ever had experience selling anything, you know it’s a numbers game and that was true here, but we really lucked out when Greg Mrvich, of [**Ballistic BBQ**](https://www.youtube.com/user/sd4547) (230K+ subscibers), got back to us.

He also resided in Southern California and was empathetic to our struggles as a newly minted startup. It also helped that Greg was a huge fan of Korean food. We sent him some samples of our sauce and the rest is history.

He creates these amazing, mouth-watering videos featuring culinary BBQ masterpieces and we can’t thank him enough for his help!

**Partnerships**

Along with YouTube influencers, we’ve been able to partner with other companies, such as subscription boxes leveraging our success on Kickstarter, online sales, earned media, and prior relationships.

We use past partnerships as credibility to fuel the next one giving other parties multiple reasons to collaborate with us. We are honest in our communications, prompt in our responses, and detailed in our work. We use every success as a stepping stone to reach up and find better opportunities.

We’ve partnered with subscription boxes such as **Bespoke Post** and **BBQ Box**, and each partnership has led to increased website traffic and new customers.

Our latest partnership for KPOP Sea Snacks was with women’s quarterly subscription box, **FabFitFun**, and Pinterest in their limited-edition, specially co-branded box called the **P100, a box reflecting Pinterest’s top trends for 2018**.

Partnerships like these can help in multiple ways from generating direct sales, increasing brand exposure, to acquiring a new group of potential customers. We see large influxes of website visitors at the onset of announcements and steady traffic for the duration of a partnership.

We are generally able to cater to these new audience by creating unique landing pages or offering special discounts only offered to them.

So how did we source these kickass deals? Apart from what I mentioned above about using accomplishments to get one deal, and then using that deal to source another, it comes down to goodwill and building relationships. Here’s an example:

Our Kickstarter success can be attributed to what we learned by reaching out to the founders of other successful campaigns. We paid that collaborative, sharing mentality forward by talking to anyone that reached out to us for Kickstarter advice or business advice in general.

Months after helping one such person, that individual connected us to one of her friends, working at an amazing brand that just so happened to be looking for amazing Korean-inspired products. And voila! Relationships matter and have led to some of our biggest achievements.

No matter how busy we are, I think we can all agree that we can spare 20 minutes out of a day to talk to someone or help someone out. Help other people out without expect anything in return

**Email**

Lastly, a new initiative that we’ve been focused on is email marketing. Through a platform called **Dojo Mojo**, we’ve been able to partner with companies to run giveaway campaigns and through just three campaigns, we’ve been able to grow our e-mail list by over 500%.

While email marketing has always been great way to keep in touch with our initial customer groups to drive repeat purchases, gathering new emails is essential to widening our top sales funnel and increasing revenues.

There are so many different objectives a company can hit with e-mail marketing (e.g., web traffic, referrals, conversions, education, etc.). The greatest part of e-mail marketing is that it is extremely cost efficient and targeted – we don’t spend on advertising and we get prime placement in the mailbox of our would-be and existing customers.

**Specialty Retail Stores**

A specialty sauce distributor reached out to us after the completion of our Kickstarter campaign and we’ve been working with them to get our products into their network of specialty stores nationwide.

These stores we’re placed in are generally independent grocers (think mom-and-pop shops), but our experience has taught us much about selling in retail as we look towards expanding distribution. It’s one thing to get into a retailer and another to ensure your products are selling in that retailer.

Sell-thru in a store can depend on, but are not limited to the following: customer demographics, store location, product price points, promotions/discounts, and sampling. Our success in these stores have served as validation that we must expand our distribution in order to scale and take our company to the next level.

## How are you doing today and what does the future look like?

Since September of last year, we’ve generated nearly $100,000 in revenue, primarily all online through our website and Amazon (about a 50/50 split in revenue by channel).

We are currently in the middle of fundraising to expand our distribution outlets, develop new products, and hire new talent. Since February of this year, we’ve entered over 90 specialty stores throughout the nation and are now receiving interest from distributors and larger retail chains.

We’re also partnering with restaurants and coffee shops, such as Everytable and The Hive in Los Angeles.

As mentioned previously, e-mail marketing has been showing promising signs. That’s the name of the game for startups. It’s a bunch of testing and finding out what’s working and what’s not.

We now have a list of over 10,000 subscribers. We’re constantly A/B testing variables such as day, time, content, subject line, and so on to improve our open and click rates.

In product development, Chris is focused on launching 3-4 new variations of KPOP Sauce in the 4th quarter of this year. We’re also looking into developing 2-3 new flavors of KPOP Sea Snacks to launch at the beginning of 2019. It’s been exciting getting sneak peaks at the recipes in development and we can’t wait to share them with everyone!

For e-commerce, we target a gross margin north of 33% - the higher the better. This is absolutely necessary if we plan on expanding distribution to physical stores. Online, we don’t get as many sales as we would if we were in multiple grocery stores, so an extra $0.75 per order, goes a long way.

Secondly, our margins include shipping expenses that we incur as we provide free shipping for all our products (shipping is quite costly especially if you have heavy or bulky product!). Our online price for our products minus shipping expenses will generally set the suggested retail price (SRP) for our physical retailers.

Traditionally, one could follow the 1/3 rule to expand distribution into physical retail stores. That is, 33% margin for you (the manufacturer), your distributor, and the end retailer.

Today’s retail landscape is rapidly changing, and many distributors and retailers are requiring higher margins as they’re facing competition at an unprecedented level.

While it’d be great to be able to do direct deals with retailers, until we have a suite of products or our own distribution network (hopefully one day), we must partner with distributors to scale.

With the increase in distribution and launch of new products, our revenues are projected to grow quickly in the coming months and we’re working on ensuring that we’re operationally prepared.

We also have a lot of plans for upcoming partnerships, content, and experiential marketing events. We’re not just talk. We’re out to prove we’re not your average food brand. We’re going to revolutionize the way people view and taste food in the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) space.

Our vision is to be the premier Korean food company for America – that KPOP products be in every pantry across the nation. To get there, KPOP Foods will need to be the Red Bull of Korean food by bringing together mainstream culture, art, music, and food.

## Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

**Cultivate a great team**

It’s tough to go about it alone. Find a partner and build a team. I think one thing that truly helps is finding a great co-founder to work with.

I’m incredibly lucky to have Mike as my co-founder and there is absolutely no way in possible I could imagine KPOP Foods being where it is today without him. While we are both very different in so many ways, the one thing that we share is a strong work ethic.

We push each other to continuing fighting and overcoming setbacks and obstacles and having someone there with you is a huge relief. There have been so many times where I was tied up and had to leave things off with Mike and knowing that he’ll take care of everything is paramount.

**Launch quickly**

Secondly, I think a really important concept, especially for when just starting out, is being comfortable with launching things quickly. Early on, it’s hard to get everything perfect and you have to become comfortable with things being launching that may not be 100% perfect or may not be what you had initially envisioned.

If you’re constantly waiting for your product or service to be perfect, odds are by the time you’re completely satisfied with it, you’ve exhausted your resources and missed out on the timing of your opportunity. Fail quick, learn quick.

**Reflect**

Lastly, I realize that at the early stages of building a company, this is very hard to do, but you should always try to find time to reflect on things to think of how you can improve or do something better.

It’s very hard to find time to do this, but I think it’s very important for a number of reasons – you may realize that worrying about something wasn’t worth your time at all or didn’t have an impact on the business or you may find that if you had something slightly differently, there could have been a lot of new added value.

This is also something good to do with your team as they’re also likely in the middle of many different things and receiving their feedback and points of view may help you down the road as well.

## What platform/tools do you use for your business?

After researching the various platforms businesses use for e-commerce, we found that Shopify was the best choice due to its convenience in website design, product setup/integration, and fulfillment.

We utilize the native shipping tools on Shopify that include discounted shipping labels. As a CPG company that deals with a lot of inventory, Shopify’s backend could adequately support. We’ve had no issues thus far.

Within Shopify, we use the app, **Shogun**, for frontend design. For example, we can use it to change the layout of our landing pages or products pages, and even affect how our pages look on mobile vs. desktop.

It took some time to master, but it’s pretty user-friendly and is much more affordable than hiring full-time web developers. I like their snippet function that allows us to save formatted designs that we can easily access and use at another time.

We use **Sumo**, another Shopify app, to generate our pop-ups for e-mail lead capture. I like the app because it’s intuitive to use and easily allows us to run A/B tests to see what kind of offers, content, or copy language performs the best.

We can run different pop-ups on specific pages, control when a visitor sees these forms, and what happens when a visitor submits his or her e-mail.

**Google Analytics** (GA) is a must for e-commerce store owners. It’s free to use and comprehensively tracks nearly everything we need to know about our website visitors and the actions they take on site. These visitors are all potential customers. By identifying and optimizing their pathways, we can increase sales and conversions.

For example, if our homepage has the highest bounce rate (percentage of visits in which a visitor leaves our website without browsing any other page) we know we can examine the source of the traffic or our homepage design/messaging to affect the bounce rate.

Lowering the bounce rate means that visitors are spending more time on our website, which increases the likelihood of conversion. This is just one example of the myriad of uses of GA. If you’re interested in learning more, Google provides a lot of free online classes on GA. It is truly a powerful tool worth investing in.

## What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

One book that I really enjoyed was **""Power to People**: The Inside Story of AES and the Globalization of Electricity"". This book focused on several topics, but the founders’ focus on culture and empowering employees to make decisions is something I hope to drive forward at KPOP Foods.

I want to say that most of you reading this right now have already read **""How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People""** by Dale Carnegie. But in the off chance, you haven’t, you should. It applies to every aspect of life, not just business.

I’m amazed at how, even 80+ years since it was first written, the principles still apply. If a person would try to adhere to any of the principles mentioned in this book, it would positively impact his or her relationships with friends, colleagues, and significant others.

Finally, we’d be remiss if we didn’t thank UCLA Anderson and the UCLA Anderson Venture Accelerator for all the support they’ve given us these past 18 months.

They provided us a beautiful, collaborative working space to build our company, access to industry professionals and investors, and a chance to work alongside some amazing companies like Alcatera, Habit Nest, and Textpert just to name a few. These relationships have been invaluable and have helped us move rapidly while avoiding costly mistakes.

## Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Entrepreneurship is not for the faint hearted. You’ll need grit and passion – and a whole lot of it. Creating a successful business requires massive amounts of action, perseverance, and conviction.

It’s not something you can build in one, two, or even three years. It’s a long-term battle filled with many sacrifices and tribulations.

Pursuing the path of entrepreneurship will most likely be the most difficult thing you’ve ever done in your life.

This isn’t to dissuade any of you. Because while starting your own business may be the most difficult feat you’ve ever attempted, stay true to your course, your dream, and it’ll also be your most rewarding accomplishment.

## Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

Yes, we’re looking for a VP of Marketing or Marketing Associate to join our team full-time. The person would oversee paid marketing (Facebook, Amazon, and Google Ads), email marketing, social media, brand partnerships, website, and public relations.

Additionally, this person would also have an opportunity to get involved in product design and content development

We are also always looking for interns interested in finance, accounting, data analytics, and marketing. If you’re interested in working in a startup or becoming an entrepreneur, it’s a great opportunity to get experience.

It’s a fast-paced and challenging environment where you’ll learn tremendously and see the results of your actions on a daily basis.

I graduated in May with a CE degree and would like to start building a career working with embedded systems. Sadly I don't have an internship under my belt and my knowledge of embedded systems is limited to a course I took working with PICs (16 and 32) but it was the most interesting course to me. While the course was a pretty good start, I'm still rough around the edges with interrupts and timers and things like that. 

Since I don't have internship experience I decided my best course of action was working on some personal projects to hone my skills and have something to show to recruiters. After a few suggestions I read online, I found the book ""Make: AVR Programming"" and it seems pretty helpful. I ordered the AVR suggested by the book (ATMega168) so I can work along with the exercises and understand the chip better then move on to a project of my own. I'm hoping this is a good course of action, though I'm open to suggestions.

My question is how relevant are AVRs in the industry? Are they regarded in the same way that Arduinos are (which I learned are a big no-no if I do plan to make a career out of embedded systems)? And how do they compare to PICs?  

I'm going to keep working with the book because it seems pretty useful but would you suggest I do something else on top of learning from the book? 

Thank you!"

Rate me from the scale of 1 - 10, 1 being the lowest possibility of me scoring an internship with a decent company and 10 being the highest possibility. 

Also, give me advice on what to improve on for scoring **good internships** my junior year. I know, I can't get an internship yet as I am a freshman and some VISA issues (will be resolved hopefully by sophomore year) so just wanted to know if I had a decent shot if I applied at the intern fair.

Thank you for your time!"

Here’s my background. I graduated college a semester early, in Dec. 2015 and completed 4 internships during college with major financial firms, all of which I still have on my resume, clearly stating I was an intern. I graduated college with multiple job offers, and immediately started a role in Jan 2016 doing insurance sales... which I hated. It was miserable, and I was literally dreading going to work on Monday after getting off of work on Friday. So I quit that job after 5 months and took a new recruiting job with a large firm. I actually enjoyed that role, but all of my bosses ended up getting fired 10 months after I started, so a lot of work was falling on me without any opportunity for a pay raise, so I ended up quitting that job.

I took a little retail job for a few months until I got another opportunity with another large financial firm (I don’t have the retail job on my resume), earned my Series 7 and 63 licenses, but worked 12 hours days and spent pretty much all 12 hours getting yelled at by customers because they couldn’t remember their login password. Not exactly how I wanted to use my Series licenses. So, 7 months later, I quit because I got another recruiting job. 

Now, here I am, 7 months in to my new recruiting job, and I’m not happy again. The environment is extremely unprofessional, and I honestly think I’ve moved backward in my career. 

So here’s my question. Will I be ruining my marketability if I jump ship again for another job? I’m at the point where I’m not going to leave unless I’m 100% sure it’s going to be what I want for the next few years, but I’m honestly afraid no ones going to hire me because I have “job hopper” written on my forehead. Any advice is appreciated!

9d9q12,8,2018-09-05,is an MBA right for me? engineering -&gt; hedge funds. Long introspective read - just a warning!,BigPapiT,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/9d9q12/is_an_mba_right_for_me_engineering_hedge_funds/,"Posting this from a throwaway because my main account would give up way too much of my identity.

I've been pondering this decision for a long time, and I'm at the age (27) and part of my career where I really need to decide if I'm going to do this (because if I'm not, then it'll never happen).

My background: I got an engineering degree from a top 10 engineering school (which also happens to have a top 5 undergrad business program and a top 10 MBA program). I did engineering internships at 2 different well-known global Fortune 500's during college. And won some business competitions, etc. About 1/2 of the way through college, I realized I did not want to go into engineering but rather go into ""business ""(vague, but I narrowed it down later to investing).

I also gained admission to the 1-year Master's in engineering program at the same university (they double-count some of the grad courses you take in undergrad, so you can get your Master's in half the time). I had this as a backup option for the sake of getting a Master's and it was half the time vs. if you came back to school later on to do it, but still planned on getting into finance/investing for a real job.

Anyways, I passed all this up when I got my first job out of college working for/reporting directly to a well-known billionaire. It was a crazy job to land at the age of 22 and a wild experience (and I'll always carry some emotional scars from them for the rest of my life...yikes lol). My goal back then (and naive looking back, given that this billionaire's personality which wasn't geared towards really helping anyone beyond himself) was to impress this guy enough over a couple years of working for him and convince him to give me funding to go out on my own. For various reasons, things didn't work out here for the long run.

After that, I kind of bounced around and ended up working as a freelance investment analyst for an out-of-state hedge fund. It was a great experience, but I never got paid on time, etc. In that desperation of not being able to find a normal job after my unique background/experiences (normal companies know that someone who lands a job out of college with a billionaire won't stick around for a normal 9-5 job for a long time, and it was tough for me to convince them otherwise), and patching together a few ideas I got from other people, I decided to reach out to wealthy people in my hometown to see if they might be willing to take a shot on a young, scrappy guy who wanted to run his own hedge fund.

About 75% ignored, about 25% of the letters, I got responses (including a couple Forbes billionaires who agreed to meet me, but said no anyways). Working for that billionaire out of college opened up doors as far as getting meetings, but didn't carry me much further than that as far as how I was evaluated. Eventually, I met a wealthy family (net worth \~$800 million) that agreed to give me a shot....I thought it was going to be a ""yes we will seed you"" or ""no sorry kid"" but they proposed having me work for them first before giving me capital to manage.

So after being an analyst on contract for almost 2 years, I was given roughly $8 million to manage last year and now am getting an additional $15 million for now. And based on my performance + how much other liquidity they raise, I could get another $15 million easily, which would be more than enough for me to launch and run an investment fund on my own, build a track record, and be a pretty prominent hedge fund launch.

My comp with this family started at $120K/year when I first met them when I was 24....got bumped up a year later to a $150K (although I cleared about $180K that year since I was a contractor and got a lot more paid work done than just my annualized hourly rate). Then I became a salaried employee for them at $150K/year, which is what I've been earning for the past 1.5+ years, which brings us to the present, age 27. My bonus going forward basically has no ceiling, since I get a %age cut of the profits I generate for them. By the way, this is all in a major city in Texas, so it's probably the equivalent of earning like 1.5x-2x as much as that in San Francisco or NYC. I should also add that I have insane flexibility in my role - they've given me an office w/ Bloomberg terminal, etc., but I usually work from home 3-4 days of the week if I'm feeling too lazy to go in. The only time I'm technically required to be in the office is if I'm meeting my bosses.

I think once I get more capital from them and hopefully prove my worth via performance, I can eventually get my salary bumped up to $250K base, which is somewhat standard for portfolio managers.

The plan here is they want me to get used to managing capital and if I do well, they will give me funding to go out on my own. And introduce me to their network of friends (who are all net worth $100 million to $1+ billion) who might also be interested in being potential investors of mine.

The background I should also add at this point is that my family is extremely educated. My father was an orthopedic surgeon, my mother an aerospace engineer (turned computer science later). My mom's mom was a surgeon (one of the very very small female surgeons in the 1950's through 1980's), and my mom's father was a chemical engineer working in the Middle East for several oil companies in the 1960's 70's and 80's. All my uncles/aunts/cousins all have graduated degrees and are either in medicine, law, engineering, or commercial banking. I'm the only one in my immediate family that doesn't have a Master's degree.

My family has sort of stopped talking about this topic because it always leads to arguments between them and I, but my grandpa + mom + stepdad all have been pressing me for years to do an MBA at some place like Harvard, Stanford, or even my undergrad alma mater. I just never thought it made sense for me, given my experiences and what I want to do (run my own investment fund). But sometimes I worry that if I fail at what I'm doing, they will get to say ""we told you should've gotten an MBA!!!"". It's hard to explain, but it's almost like they think my job is not legitimate and the money I'm earning isn't legit because I'm getting it without a graduate degree. I guess all of this adds to my apprehension in general when I see many of my friends/peers from undergrad all going to or graduating from Booth, Ross, Harvard, Tepper, etc. for their MBA's right now.

So my question here is, does it even make sense for me to do an MBA? Obviously, I wouldn't leave my current job opportunity to do a full-time MBA, but even an executive one on the weekends? I don't know. Seems like the best thing for me to do is just keep getting better as an investor. I've got someone with a lot of capital willing to back me if I perform on my end.

**Correct me if I am wrong, but I think people do MBA's to transition into a new industry, for compensation, and/or for the network.**

**Compensation:** I'm already making more than many MBA's as far as I know ($150K base in a Texas city) plus my bonus potential theoretically has no ceiling. If I can prove myself over time, I think I can get my salary bumped up to $250K base down the road within 1-2 years. Once again, my overall upside here (from the bonus) is only capped by my performance, which is great on paper but incredibly scary in person (lol) because the accountability is all on me and my value, for better or worse, can be distilled into an easily quantifiable number - the investment returns I generate.

**Industry:** I'm already in the industry I want to be in and in basically a ""dream job"" short of actually being independent on my own.

**Network:** With how plugged in I am with this wealthy family, if I do well for them, they are basically opening me up to their network of ultra-high net worth friends. And past that point, running an investment fund, the network is based on your performance and attracting other capital.

I think if I DID go to an MBA school, it would have to be in the top 10. I have no idea how I would do on the GMAT (but I got near perfect scores on my SAT/ACT and was a National Merit Finalist back in high school - not sure if this means anything as far as scoring high on the GMAT though). I think I've got some pretty unique work experiences and could notch some good recommendations, but does it even make sense for me to apply or try and go down the part-time MBA route?

I suppose if I really wanted it, I could convince my current employer (the wealthy family) to cover the cost of a $200K part-time/executive MBA at a top 10 school, but I'd need to make a really good argument for it lol. From their perspective, I think they would just see it as a distraction from me being a full-time investor. The only reason I can think of for getting an MBA at a top 10 school is to make me look better on paper for future prospective investors (good undergrad school - check, good MBA school - check?).

Anyways, sorry for incredibly long post - curious for your anyone's thoughts here."

9dbi66,2,2018-09-05,How to quit my nanny job of 2 years,Yellow_Sunshine,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9dbi66/how_to_quit_my_nanny_job_of_2_years/,"I'm sorry about the wall of rant- I'm really upset by this and my mind is bouncing all over..

A little backstory- I've been a full time nanny for a (now) 2 year old since she was three months old and love her immensely. But recently I've found myself disliking this job more and more. It's not anything that she's doing- I really love kids and I 110% that sometimes they have bad days. Especially when they're two, but she's still awesome. 

My issue(s) are with the parents, who I thought were my close friends. 

So because I know them, and when I got this job I didn't have another one, I didn't start off making a whole bunch of money ($250/week for like 30-35 hours). The Mom goes to school on a full ride scholarship so I'm paid by the stipend she gets from the school. At the time I was fine with it. Normally I don't work for them during the summer but the Mom got an internship so I agreed to work for them. I knew it would be for less money but when I worked it out in my head I thought I'd still be fine. Long story short- I ended up making $5 an hour for 9 hour days and I was not fine at all. In hindsight I realize that I should've told them I couldn't do it, or ask for more money- but one of my definining characteristics is that I am a good ass person. I'll do anything for anyone, even if it means I'll make more of a burden for myself. (it's part of the reason I'm here asking for help). Another thing about me- I hate confrontation and I hate disappointing other people. 

But that's not even the biggest issue for me anymore. 

I started out the school year yesterday, and a week ago when we sat down to talk about the upcoming semester, the Mom and Dad told me that they don't trust me. 

-They think I stole their weed (stealing is morally wrong to me and I would never ever do that to anyone, let alone someone I cared about). This was an issue during the summer and they got a camera for their garage (aka their smoking room) so they could monitor it/me. 

-This one is fucking STUPID and I don't even know what to say about it but it was a really big issue for them.  I uh... Pocketed a lighter one night when I was a little too high, and then brought it back then next day without saying anything. That's the extent of that. I don't even know. 

-Another reason they don't trust me is because they think I'm lying to them about when I get their daughter up? One day the Mom's friend took the daughter to the zoo and I was asked to get her up at 8, well Mom and Dad fought that morning and she woke up at 7:30. Well the Mom's friend picked her up at 10:30, and apparently told the parents that it was ""clear and obvious"" that I hadn't gotten her up in time, or even ready, and that I hadn't fed her breakfast....WHAT!? And then their roommate told the parents that I left her crying in the crib until 9AM? First of all; if they asked me to get her up at 8AM then I absolutely did. Secondly; I literally have a text to my friend saying ""they fought again this morning and of course she got up early"". I don't know what to say about the roommates input. 

And then finally, one single day this summer I called in sick with not quite enough notice- One. Day. I do feel a little guilty about that because I know it inconvenienced them but it was a single day and I really needed a personal day and I know for a fact that they take them way more often than that. 

So they told me that they don't trust me, for no reason. And verbatim ""if we catch you in a lie again, things won't be good for you."" But I lied about nothing in the first place. 
- 
So I need to quit my job. They really hurt me with their accusations, I'm a good person and I thought we were friends and I've done so much for them.. I'm starting to feel taken advantage of and I don't know how to get out of this position. 

I feel obligated to the family and specifically to the little girl, the school year just started and I made a commitment, I don't want to go back on it... But I don't feel comfortable staying here any longer and that feeling is only growing."

Everything I want in life no longer seems possible. In highschool I stopped doing well and became depressed. When I graduated high school I didn't have the grades so I went community college at 19 and stayed there for longer than I thought I would not knowing what to do but eventually I picked something and stuck with it transferring to a school that isn't so well known due to limited transfer options. Terrible anxiety about my future in those years. I suffered all alone because the few friends I had were doing other things and also no comfort from my family who were also hard on me. I have severe social anxiety so I have trouble forming relationships with others. As of right now, I am finishing up my last year of school but am afraid of not being able to pay back my loans and not being able to find a decent starting job. I have had internships which I did not do well at because I could never get motivated also making some really stupid mistakes. Meanwhile everyone I graduated high school with even those that hurt me are doing well in real jobs and going on tropical vacations with their beautiful girlfriends while I sit here in my parents house contemplating suicide.

In my entire life, there has never been anything I wanted more than love and to be able to feel and express it to the fullest with a woman I love. With my current situation being unemployed I am not too attractive to many women and my lack of effort and lack of care about everything certainly doesn't make me attractive either. My social anxiety is at its peak around attractive girls because they have treated badly in the past. Certainly not attractive to the girl of my dreams who has already graduated, is likely dating guys who are better off than me, and doesn't appear interested in me. Then again she doesn't know me all so well. I've never felt anything so intense as the passion I feel for this girl. Been that way for about 7 years. I could never get her out of my head and she is the most beautiful woman (inside and out) in the world to me. I've had nothing at all to hold on to these terrible years after high school so I suppose I held on to that amazing feeling I felt whenever I thought of her. That isn't going to happen now. That is perhaps the worst pain of all.

With nothing you want in life feeling remotely possible what on earth would you want to go on for? It isn't worth it in the least. There is just no joy in life at all anymore. Not since I was a child. I've suffered long and hard enough. I just want everything to stop completely now. I don't want to exist. I don't want to think or feel anymore. I haven't worked out a way to do it just yet. Its kind of difficult to hide the means from my parents."

Was a wealth management intern two summers ago and did a lot of public equity research and covered the autonomous vehicle sector of the market and made some stock pitches; not at a well known or prestigious firm

Was a private equity/investment banking intern last fall for a while; did some modeling and helped a little with due diligence on the emerging market/tech sectors; did at a smaller, boutique firm 

Was a research assistant in Honors Program at the Gabelli School of Business for over a year researching the affects of WWII on the book and publishing industry in the 1930s and 40s

**Goal of MBA:**

I would like to open my own hedge fund/investment fund at some point within the next 10-15 years

**Summary:**

I think my grades/test scores are a huge hindrance and my lack of experience isn't doing me any favors. I believe I'm a very interesting candidate that's done a lot of unique things; however, I don't know if it will be enough. I'd love to hear feedback, though!

Thanks so much!

The Emmy's are coming up. Office wants to have a party. Normally everyone write's their pick on the ballot, the awards winners are announced, then the ballots are counted and the person with the most correct guesses wins! But this takes way too long as there are too many of us. I'd like to automate it.

Already planning on using Microsoft Forms to get everyone to answer. ""Pick the nominee from a radio option that you think will win"" This will yield me a spreadsheet that I can then process hopefully in under 5 minutes. (Spreadsheet will have each response as a row with each column a different question)

So once the spreadsheet is downloaded, I expect to add a row with the correct results after the Emmy's are over. Then I need to compare each column and see which response is correct per each question. Then I need to see who got the most right. This is the part I'm not sure how to do easily.

And this needs to be easy enough that I can show the intern how to do it - so prefer to avoid macros or VB"

I am a bit burnt out. My parents paid for 2/4 years so I will still have some loans. I feel like I'm going from school -&gt; more school -&gt; work no break.

I'm also afraid of getting a job. The 9-5 shift will be the death of me. I have experienced about 10-4 in internships and 7-2 in high school. It makes me depressed. I cannot function that long let alone focus and be productive.

9ddu9j,0,2018-09-05,How Long Does it Take to Succeed?,FabulousAd5,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/9ddu9j/how_long_does_it_take_to_succeed/,"Source: Forbes 30 under 30 entrepreneur Chris Kelsey

Since a teenager, one of the biggest things I worried about was how long it’d take to financially succeed. I saw people who had a lot of money online and I always wondered how long it’d take **me** to get there. I originally told myself that I wanted to be a pharmacist because my cousin was earning 100k+/year right out of college. If it wasn’t that, I figured I could be a dentist and make $200k+/yr by my thirties.

In 2014, I talked to my cousin about what it was like to be a pharmacist. He said that it was the same thing everyday and overall he didn’t seem to recommend it. This scared me because my only other “option” was becoming a dentist, or so I thought.

During one of my dentist appointments, I asked my dentist if he could tell me about the business. He told me he went to school for 12 years and showed me some of the equipment they work with. I knew he made pretty good money, but the idea of being in university for 12 years (or 8 if you don’t specialize) was quite scary to me. He also said he worked as an employee for a number of years before he started his own firm. He described how he built up his client base which sounded the same as any normal business. I began asking myself why I would ever go to school for that long when I could start a normal business and make the same amount as him or even more. I also didn’t want to get in debt (which he said took years to pay off).

In my junior year of high school I joined a leadership program. One day they took us to a hospital and we got to learn from the doctors about their careers. One of the workers in residency said she went to Brown University and collected $200,000+ worth of student debt. She was a 28 year old that had pulled up in an old Toyota Corolla. I knew that was not the car I wanted to drive when I was 28 regardless of whether or not I was eventually going to make a supposed “fortune” from this industry. She told us that her only job during this “in the field” residency was doing paperwork for the hospital. It sounded like they looked at her as nothing more than an intern to take advantage of. I felt bad for her as I could tell from the tone of her voice that she wasn’t sure she had made the right choice.

After these events, I decided I wasn’t going to become a dentist, pharmacist, or even go to college. Beyond that, the seed of dropping out of high school was planted in my mind. My dream was to go big, and I wasn’t going to go home.

I did not become as financially successful as I hoped I would within the timeframe I’d expected. Yes, I did become a millionaire at 19 but I was trying to do that by the age of 18. In 2015, Appsitude only had 70k revenue and around 50k profit. At the end of the year I was disappointed in myself for not having made more money (although it didn’t take a lot of work).

I turned this disappointment into motivation to do better in 2016. Thankfully I ended up making 356k in revenue with around 200k in profit by the end of that year. I was happier but still upset that I hadn’t reached my goal.

I’ve found that success will not usually happen within the original timeframe you **hope for**, but it will definitely happen faster than you **think**. In 2017, my life began to change for the better over and over on different days (in the two previous years it did as well, but even more in 2017). All of a sudden I began to **feel** the light at the end of the tunnel.

In the pursuit of success, it’s good to stay motivated and continue pushing, but do not get mad at yourself if you don’t reach a certain point as quickly as you’d hoped for. Don’t compare yourself to me or anyone else because each of us had different circumstances. It doesn’t matter if you came from wealth or not, **true** success is completely independent of that. There are many broke people with a lot of money.

At the end of the day, you must remember that you cannot wait for future possible events to determine your success. You must create your success **today**. Today, my great friend was telling me that he wanted to wait on submitting a press release until he got a certain contract. I told him that he should do it **now** instead of later because the contract isn’t for certain, but that the journalists receiving and posting the press release is a guarantee (yes I know in certain cases you don’t know if the journalists will post your press release, but in this specific case it is certain). I also mentioned that posting the press release will put more pressure on his potential client because the article will make the client realize he may lose his chance to work with my friend due to the soon-to-come influx of other potential customers.

It’s always best to do something now than later. The only thing between us and success is **time**, and the only thing holding us back is our **fear of success**. I had many moments where I waited on posting something online because I knew it’d had massive results and I felt I wouldn’t be ready to handle what came next. The thing is, life always prepares you for the next steps even when it looks like it won’t to either you or those around you. When you have this in mind, you become unstoppable because you will realize that life is always taking you into the right direction.

It took me from December 2014 till May 2017 to become a millionaire. That’s around 2.5 years of working toward my goal. I did do things for money before then so you could say my journey originally began in May 2013, but I didn’t seriously get into business until the end of 2014. Yes, I did lose most of that money from my ex-business partner stealing it, but I didn’t care (besides the friendship lost) because I knew I can, and will earn far more than what I “lost.”

I feel that true success is the ability to realize that you could lose all of your material things today and not blink because you know you can just as easily earn it again. Once you’ve attained this **feeling** (it’s not just a belief), you’ll notice that everything you want to happen begins to happen. With that being said, I believe that I did not truly become successful until my fiance came into my life after the summer of 2017."

Yesterday, I took a county exam for a case manager position. I have graduate last year, but have not been able to find work. Most of my previous works ( internship and employment) are not really relevant to case managing, but I can take out events that match somewhat. Plus, I speak a second language as well, but this point has not benefit at all (As as I can tell by my rejections over and over)

But I feel unqualified and fearful since the participants I saw there appeared experienced and very well rounded in their expertise. Some even looked like internal employees with their lancer ID hung around their neck. 

In this case, should I even look forward to an interview? I had over three interviews with the county for different positions and I had land none of these positions. It appears there is always better candidates. 

I’m starting to wonder what is wrong with my qualifications. My last rejection was because they were looking for someone who was already familiar with their internal software. If so, why called me in for an interview when my resume clearly indicated I have no knowledge of that what so ever. Plus, I did ask what they were looking for in a candidate and that point was never mention. 

So if I don’t meet their qualifications or at least I’m doubting it, but if I am called, which I’m hoping, for an interview—what to do? "

9dihak,5,2018-09-06,Ausländerbehörde HELP! PLEASE!,AllThingsReset,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/9dihak/ausländerbehörde_help_please/,"Hi guys

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an international student from a non-EU/EEA country. I'm enrolled in a Hochschule in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. For the first one year of my study, my residence permit was issued by the local ABH in the city I'm studying. As part of my study program, the Hochshule pushes its students to do internship work between a semester to a year. I'm fortunate enough to get one in **Berlin** where I'm contracted to work for one full year.

&amp;#x200B;

My original residence permit expired on July. I've tried 3 months prior to the expiry date to renew my residence permit but they only allowed me to apply for a renewal on June, so I did. As many of you may know, that is not the end of the trouble; after applying, the next step is to get your fingerprints taken (again, even though I've done so when I applied for the first residence permit; this case may differ from one ABH to another. I'm not sure). Then sometime in August I received a physical mail telling me to be at the ABH on 6th of September at a specified time to get my fingerprints taken.  


Please note that at this point of the story I've already started working in Berlin since Monday 3rd of September where I also had registered my Berlin address in the  Bürgeramt. I don't know if the info in this part would help my case, but that's the fact.

&amp;#x200B;

So, on 6th of September I had to take a day off work. I went to the ABH where I should get my fingerprints taken; the ABH is located in a city 5 hours away by train from Berlin. I went to the ABH only to stand by the door of this lady's office, looking at her startled looking at me, then looking at her telling her colleague who was also in her office that **SHE FORGOT** that she had told me to come for my fingerprint appointment. No, she did not say that to my face, she did not apologize, I did not even have the chance to step in to the office. That level of unprofessionalism is unheard of, at least by me but that's a story for another day.

&amp;#x200B;

Then she asked where I live now. I said Berlin. Then she said I need to apply for my residence permit in Berlin. She said bye. She closed the door. No apology.

&amp;#x200B;

After a long story, here come my questions:

1. Do I need to apply for my residency in ABH Berlin from the start? What I mean by this is: I've given my documents to the original ABH, do I need to assume what I've done since July has gone to waste?
2. Would there be a problem with the fact that I'm enrolled to a school outside of Berlin but I'm applying for a residency in Berlin? Yes, I know I should have applied for a 2 year residency permit but I wasn't able to because of other things. Again, that's a story for another time.
3. There are contradicting statements in ABH Berlin's website. I found one statement that I should make an online appointment, then another stated I could just come and take a number (which I assume will make me camp from the night before, as I read online from people). Which one is true?

I really appreciate any answer, help, or tip. Thank you for reading."

I do know a little about relational databses and MySQL/PHP but my knowledge of backend web development is pretty scarce.

Recently, I got myself an internship in a pretty awesome company and I've been helping out with a lot of Wordpress stuff. Since all themes we use are pretty much coded from scratch, I'm learning a lot about project setup and management (Git, Gulp, etc), as well as PHP, but I've been working mostly on the frontend of things, making things beautiful and responsive, running browser tests, etc...

Recently, I've been asked if I had worked with Node.JS or Angular.JS and since I have not, I did not lie, I said I hadn't. Apparently that was perfect, because they wanted to put me on a Node.JS project to see how I'd handle things. If I succeed, I might have the opportunity to stay in the company after the internship so I'm pretty pumped, and scared, because I know very little about backend/fullstack solutions and how they work and...

So I need a guide, book, tutorial, tip, whatever you can give I'll take it. What should I learn first? Where? Any bases I need to have before diving in Node.JS and full-stack web development in general? Is it worth to go learn something like the MEAN stack or should I focus on Node for now? I'm starting on that project on Monday so I'm trying to have a head start.

Thanks in advance!"

Post here for recruitment advice, resume reviews, questions about offers/firms or general insecurity (15)",QiuYiDio,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/9doqed/recruiting_for_consulting_post_here_for/,"Post anything related to recruitment advice, company / group research, or general insecurity in here. 

**If asking for feedback, please provide...**

a) the type of consulting you are interested in (tech, management, HR, etc.)


b) the type of role (internship / full-time, undergrad / MBA / experienced hire, etc.)


c) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.


**Common topics**

a) How do I to break into consulting? 

 * If you are at a target school, join your consulting club and work with your career center.
 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  Experienced hires do happen, but often require a combination of in-demand experience and a meaningful referral.

b) How can I improve my candidacy / resume / cover letter?

 * [Read wiki on what firms look for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/lookfor)
 * [Read wiki on resumes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mcresume)
 * [Read wiki on cover letters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mccoverletters)

c) I have not heard back after the interview, what should I do?  

 * Wait or contact the recruiter directly.  Students may also wish to contact their career center.  Waiting times can range from same day to several days at target schools, to several weeks or more with non-target schools and experienced hires.  Asking in this thread will not help.

I am currently taking CS61A and doing okay so far, although I do feel that pace of the course is quite fast for me (I am just excruciatingly slow at learning anything in general). However, I believe that I am probably able to learn on my own most of the stuff taught in 61a and I am type of person that learns best by doing the concepts instead of trying to understand by just reading it. 

With that said, I would like to also take up to 61B so that I could possibly land an internship, but I'm not sure if I should enroll in the course or just audit it and do all the projects and homework on my own schedule while still trying my best to follow the pace of the course hopefully. The reason is that I am a pretty slow learner, so even if I do understand the material taught in 61a most of the time, it takes me a while for the concept to 'click'. I feel like if I just try to follow the pace of the course, I just end up doing the assignments to just pass the class instead of actually learning the knowledge and making it my own. 

So if I do not enroll in the course and just audit it (this is assuming that I would finish all the hw's, labs, projects while auditing, what could still be the downfall of auditing or if there would be anything significant I would be missing out? "

Next spring, I will be graduating from a state school with a B.A. in English (Professional &amp; Technical Writing Concentration) and minor in Marketing. I have a extremely strong GPA and references but do not plan on going to graduate school following graduation (if at all).

When asked what I want to do with my degree, I have always said I want to go into ""nonprofit communications and development."" But as I draw closer to graduation, I realize that this may not be the case.

My two major internship experiences have focused on social media management and content creation. I also have worked with external communications, editing, photography and video, blog writing, and data management. All of these skills are translatable to a hypothetical nonprofit communications and development job.

For my first internship, I essentially traveled all the time and documented the experiences of a fellowship cohort. It was amazing--active, fun, always seeing new places. However, for my second internship, I was in an office environment and only did community events two or three times over the span of eight months. While I enjoyed the work I did, I learned that I do not want to be in an office all goddamn day, five days a week. I could barely handle doing so for two and a half days a week.

As such, I am afraid that I might find myself in a job where I feel claustrophobic and bored.

I have a lot of interests and skills. I love to read, write poetry, play and discover new music, sing, and travel. I love beer and coffee (the only for-profit industries I'd really be interested in exploring). I'm highly organized and would prefer to do a variety of tasks, rather than focus in on a single task for an extended period of time. I consider myself a strong writer, in both a creative and technical sense. I have a good eye for design and am proficient in the basics of photography and video editing.

Beyond my academic work and internship experiences, I have an extensive background in customer service (retail!). I feel like my five-plus years in the service industry have shaped and expanded my people skills unlike anything else. I consider myself to be very sensitive, patient, empathetic, and able to connect with people on a one-on-one level. I am a good listener and feel like I am able to translate how people are feeling (eg: when they're venting but can't find the right word to describe their emotions or circumstances). I am shy in the sense that I hate selling to people, or interacting with them in a contrived environment (eg: networking events) but can otherwise adapt to working with nearly anyone. I would love to combine my creative, technical, and people skills and utilize them to help others.

Other personal qualities of mine include: a distaste for power/authority (would prefer to work in a minimally bureaucratic environment), an intense and innate sense of right/wrong, a passion for the arts and the environment, a youthful idealism and desire to ""change the world."" While I want stability and a fair wage, I do not have a desire to be rich. I just want to live comfortably with my boyfriend and maybe a pet or two.

I have considered careers in nonprofit communications and development, freelance grant or copywriting, teaching (either elementary school, English, or ESL), beer or coffee marketing (lol), higher education administration, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and counseling. I'm currently in the process of writing a thesis on poetry therapy, and have since been interested in learning more about arts therapy as a discipline and career. I feel like I can see myself being happy and fulfilled in any one of these fields, but I just am having trouble choosing one and sticking with it. I frequently have moments of ""epiphany,"" like I just found \*exactly\* what I want to do with my life, but they are fleeting and don't end up really sticking.

Sorry for the novella...I just have a lot of feelings, and I want to channel them into something good. If you made it to the end, can you help me find a path? :\~)"

I consider myself really frugal and I'm from a state school but most of the coworkers went to Ivy league schools and act like they don't know what poverty is. On the uber back from an intern event, someone was saying how they throw away coins that aren't quarters because they're useless. That just...makes me sick.

Not to mention the constant pressure to accept my offer. People told me to ""Just accept it, then you can go party :D"" 

I guess I'm asking if this culture is systemic to startups in the bay, or is this just a bad company. I made the realization this summer that at some of the ""best"" places you are trying to socialize with rich people all day."

The reason I ask is I'm still working out where I want my career to go, so I'm not sure if I should take some time off after graduation to scope out specific companies and wait for an opportunity I think would be closer to ideal, or take advantage of the career fair now to make a more rushed decision to find an alright company, after which I could apply to a more ""ideal"" one down the line?

Is it possible to retain legal rights over the work I've done?,throwaway11908,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9dxq90/i_got_caught_in_an_internship_scam_is_it_possible/,"Hey, I'm a college freshman who lives in the big city. For about 8 months now, I've been interning at a ""startup company"" that wants me to 'relaunch' their iOS app for Android. When I first signed up for the job, I was told I would be having regular meetings with the CEO/CTO about the progress/design aspects of the app, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The old codebase ended up being too crufty so I ended up having to rewrite the app from scratch. Progress has been stalling immensely recently because the CTO wouldn't get on fucking Slack and respond to my questions about the server/etc. The owners didn't seem to know anything about the technology stack behind the app, didn't give me many requirements or deadlines, etc. I was mostly working on the app at home, went in maybe once a week to their offices but that was about it. (I couldn't talk directly with the CTO because supposedly he lives in Louisiana, but now that I think about it he conspicuously just happened to be visiting NYC for another business meeting during the very first time I came by the offices.)

&amp;#x200B;

So recently, given the amount of time/effort I put into this, I decide to take the advice of a friend and ask for some money. Now I didn't request a fixed wage, because I would feel guilty if the app never launched and I was draining their bank, so instead I asked for an X% share of any profits made immediately following the launch of the app. Here's where I (finally) started to notice some red flags-- the CEO was really dodgy, suggesting that as part of the agreement I should ""stay around for a couple of months and provide tech support"" before receiving my share of the profits. I told her no, because the app would be making very little during the first few months anyway. She then got a bit flustered and said she ""generally agreed"" with what I was saying, since she couldn't find a way out. I asked her when she could draft an agreement by, and she also refused to commit-- I said fine and gave her a hard two weeks' deadline.

&amp;#x200B;

See, I should also explain that she works as a lawyer. She's the head of an ""XXX Law Office"" firm that's totally unrelated to this startup. Historically they haven't let slip any information to me about this law firm; they always closed the door on our offices when they were talking about ""sensitive cases,"" did not let me stay after-hours for risk of me looking through their files, etc. So I decided just now to go visit their website and check out some of the stuff there. Here's what I discovered:

&amp;#x200B;

\- The front page contains an quote from a book... that my boss herself wrote

\- The sidebar is entirely decorated with sketchy-sounding honorary titles for my boss

\- Under the ""Lawyers"" section... oh boy.

\- They've stolen the credentials of two other prominent lawyers from my city and one business magnate

\- Doing a Google Image Search for the third lawyer results in the Wikipedia page for ""Girl""

&amp;#x200B;

9dxxc8,3,2018-09-07,I got caught in an internship scam. Is it possible to retain rights over the work I've done?,throwaway11908,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9dxxc8/i_got_caught_in_an_internship_scam_is_it_possible/,"(originally posted at /r/jobs)

Hey, I'm a college freshman who lives in the big city. For about 8 months now, I've been interning at a ""startup company"" that wants me to 'relaunch' their iOS app for Android. When I first signed up for the job, I was told I would be having regular meetings with the CEO/CTO about the progress/design aspects of the app, etc.

The old codebase ended up being too crufty so I ended up having to rewrite the app from scratch. Progress has been stalling immensely recently because the CTO wouldn't get on fucking Slack and respond to my questions about the server/etc. The owners didn't seem to know anything about the technology stack behind the app, didn't give me many requirements or deadlines, etc. I was mostly working on the app at home, went in maybe once a week to their offices but that was about it. (I couldn't talk directly with the CTO because supposedly he lives in Louisiana, but now that I think about it he conspicuously just happened to be visiting NYC for another business meeting during the very first time I came by the offices.)

So recently, given the amount of time/effort I put into this, I decide to take the advice of a friend and ask for some money. Now I didn't request a fixed wage, because I would feel guilty if the app never launched and I was draining their bank, so instead I asked for an X% share of any profits made immediately following the launch of the app. Here's where I (finally) started to notice some red flags-- the CEO was really dodgy, suggesting that as part of the agreement I should ""stay around for a couple of months and provide tech support"" before receiving my share of the profits. I told her no, because the app would be making very little during the first few months anyway. She then got a bit flustered and said she ""generally agreed"" with what I was saying, since she couldn't find a way out. I asked her when she could draft an agreement by, and she also refused to commit-- I said fine and gave her a hard two weeks' deadline.

See, I should also explain that she works as a lawyer. She's the head of an ""XXX Law Office"" firm that's totally unrelated to this startup. Historically they haven't let slip any information to me about this law firm; they always closed the door on our offices when they were talking about ""sensitive cases,"" did not let me stay after-hours for risk of me looking through their files, etc. So I decided just now to go visit their website and check out some of the stuff there. Here's what I discovered:

\- The front page contains an quote from a book... that my boss herself wrote

\- The sidebar is entirely decorated with sketchy-sounding honorary titles for my boss

\- Under the ""Lawyers"" section... oh boy.

\- They've stolen the credentials of two other prominent lawyers from my city and one business magnate

\- Doing a Google Image Search for the third lawyer results in the Wikipedia page for ""Girl""

At this point it's done, it's over, I know to get the fuck out of this job. My only concern is that I want to retain ownership over all the code I've written for the app; no one else has touched it and I feel like it's MY pet project, I should be able to publish it to the App Store and reap 100% of profits from it if I want to.

Sorry for the vague heading, I did not know how else to title it. I am a first semester international Masters' student doing Computer Science at ASU. I'm a fresh pass-out  and hence don't have any experience other than the one internship that I did in an MNC back in my home country.  


My undergrad time was difficult. Had a lot of personal and family problems during those years and I was able to barely get through the courses.  I did make some projects in C++, Python and made an Android Application for my senior year project. After a lot of thought and getting through lots of obstacles, I decided to pursue masters and here I am in Arizona. I have been working on my basics by solving problems from leetcode and Cracking the Coding Interview. However, I feel dejected when I see the profiles of people around me with stuff like WebDevelopment using technologies like Node.js etc. , and I feel extremly inferior about my resume and my self as well. I am interested in AI and have taken courses for those as well. I need some advice on what skill-sets to acquire and how to sharpen them so that I can get a good job. At the risk of sounding cheesy, I add that I feel my determination can help me reach my goal, but I need proper guidance.  


  
TL;DR: Did not do well in my courses at undergrad, have no work experience, started with masters in computer science at ASU. Need some advice on how to be better academically as well as professionally. More specifically on the skillsets that I need to sharpen etc.  


Thank you."

But I've recently gotten an internship building a machine learning model in Python. So, I've been doing a lot of reading in stack overflow and I've seen a good deal of the posted solutions making what appears to be excessive use of try/exception blocks. Does python have some sort of mechanism that allows it to avoid having to build/tear-down those blocks with every call to the function scopes they exist in?

When I was working with Java I learned that using try/catch blocks worked for the odd edge cases when you have to implement some custom container or error class. But I also learned that try/catch blocks could become horribly resource/time intensive if your program needs to make frequent use of them.

Can someone help me bridge the gap in my understanding of how Python utilizes the try/except blocks? Or am I right in thinking that depending on them will lead to resource issues down the road?"

TLDR: flunked our of college in December 2017, 2018 worked in IT and interned as a software engineer, I keep learning on my own but chances of getting readmited are extremely low. Should I drop out 

Hey guys I’m was dismissed from my university back in late December of 2017 due to 2 horrible semesters in a row. My GPA is around a 1.7 and I’m thinking I might have to drop out.

A little background:
(Fall 2015-fall2017)
I was just a regular high school kid, graduated with a 3.0, 2280/2400 SAT, 32 ACT. Struggled with my AP classes but was able to maintain low Bs. I really didn’t have much going for me academically outside of my high standardized scores, I did lots of community service at my church and had IMO great essays. I got accepted to 4 of the top 20 engineering schools in the US. I began as an electrical engineering major I was awarded with 30k in scholarships. I did quite horrible my first semester (fall 2015) I reckon I had 69, 88, 79, 67 for my first set of math and engineering classes. My school just rounds down so I was put in probation the first semester since my grades translated to D,B,C,D. At any rate this kept going for the next 3 always averaging about a 2.0. Until spring 2017 I got my first F, which set it at like a 1.8 and then the following semester I did horrible yet again. 2 bad semesters they gave me a 1 year suspension from December 2017 to December 2018. 2017 was academically my worst year ever, 

(January 2018-August 2018)
I didn’t tell my parents yet, and if I’m being 110% honest, I really have no excuses I didn’t really have anything extraordinary happen to me that made me perform bad, I don’t do drugs, I don’t party every weekend, I hang out with successful and smart friends, I’m a man of faith etc. I really was just straight up lazy, and kept procrastinating for every test. At any rate, by this point I had been working at an IT firm so I came back for the spring semester since I still had a lease and just kept working  didn’t tell anyone about it. Let me add that even before getting suspended I really wasn’t enjoying most of my EE classes or calculus, physics and such. They were interesting for sure don’t get me wrong but not worth 7k a year. Anyways I liked working on software as a hobby and quite frankly had wanted to switch to the CS department but was not allowed due to a putrid GPA. Anyways so I kept learning on my own, working at the IT firm there was a task that I was able to automate, I fixed up my resume and used that as a project and by February of 2018 I had multiple interviews and an offer at a great company as a software engineer intern for the summer. Now they had no clue I wasn’t even enrolled in school officially anymore, they did a background check and everything and nothing ever came up. Fast forward may 2018 I start my internship which was amazing, and further reinforces my pursuit of a career as a software engineer. Fast forward August 2018 internship is over and they want me to come back next summer. So I sign a lease for an apartment in my college town and my parents drop me off there they still think I’m in college 😩.


Present ....
I’m two weeks into the semester and signed up for an online class at the local community college, while applying for dev jobs in town. 4 interviews scheduled 2 down this week 2 more next week. My plan is to get a job as a software dev and keep gaining experience to when I reapply by October the admissions committee Can see I’m serious about this. Part of my plan and “strategic” move on coming back to the college town was to be close to the advisors and staff of power, so far I’ve met with a high regarded professor in the CS department, my scholarship (which I lost) advisor and my EE advisor. The prognosis isn’t really good, they say there might be a chance to reinstate my scholarship (10k in loans) and maybe get back into school but it will be almost impossible to get into CS. Now my plan for that is to meet with every single person who has a say on my readmission application and do my best to appeal for my case within the next 2 months. Idk if this will work which brings us to my main question....

Future....
If I don’t get accepted should I just drop out? 

Best case scenario:
Self study, land a full time gig, save thousands on school 

Worst case scenario:
Can’t land a job as a software engineer and have to look for a different path

The reason is, i don’t know if EE would take me back, even if they did It would take and extra 2 years to graduate which would be the same for CS, but I just don’t enjoy EE program as much especially shelling out 14k a year. 


So what do you guys think? Anyone ever been on a similar situation

Bottom line is I’m ashamed, disappointed, and sacred. I flunked our for the most stupid reasons, spent lost of my money, and my parents money and lost out on 20k in scholarships. Got 10k in loans, and Lying to my parents everyday when they ask me how I’m doing in school. 

I accept that I screwed up and I dug myself into a deep deep whole, without any reason. I don’t come from a broken family, I have great friends, and people who believed in me. However I have learned a lot in this journey and I know I need to dig myself out, and complaining won’t change anything. Over the last 8 months I’ve been working hard to become more diligent, I still struggle but I’m improving.

Please I need some advice, don’t sugar coat it be as objective as you can.

Thanks and God bless

9e554b,217,2018-09-08,A company that offered me a job has been postponing my start date for almost a year. What the hell?,ElainePorter,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9e554b/a_company_that_offered_me_a_job_has_been/,"Almost exactly a year ago, I applied for a very interesting looking position offered by a company that is very respected in my field. The position was basically a traineeship/paid internship meant for graduate students in their last year. I was just starting the last year of my Master's so it sounded ideal. Two weeks after the job interview, one of the senior managers from the department I'd be working at (who was also one of the interviewers) called ma and congratulated me that I got the position. However, he didn't give me a specific start date or a written offer and simply stated that I'd be starting in around 4 weeks when the previous employee's contract expires. This is when things started to get weird.  


I waited for 4 weeks but nobody got back to me. After on more week, I decided to call the manager again. He told me not to worry and said that they're expecting me to start within a month due to some administrative delay. I wasn't very convinced but I had no other offer at the time so I waited. Again, no one contacted me. I was busy with my exams at university so I didn't get in touch straight away but called again right after Christmas (3+ months after I was supposed to start) and asked whether they still wanted me to work for them. The manager reassured me multiple times that they did and told me they would get in touch by the end of January. At this point, I stopped expecting anything and concentrated on my studies and other projects. And indeed, no one contacted me within the time frame. However, in the beginning of March, one of the other managers (who was also at my interview) reached out to me and said that they were busy working on some projects at the moment but that I should start in the first half of April.   


At this point it wasn't even a matter of getting the job for me, but more so a matter of curiosity. I checked the person who worked in this position ""before me"" on LinkedIn and found out the were already working somewhere else. I also didn't find any current employee doing this job (but of course...not everyone's on LinkedIn). I waited till the beginning of May and called them again. The manager thanked me for calling and said that I'd be starting in June. He told me to call again in the first week of June to discuss the details. I did exactly that but quickly found out both  managers I spoke to were on holiday till June 15. At this point, I started to feel like a character from Waiting for Godot but I love theatre of the absurd...so why not. I called again in the second half of June. The manager said they'd like me to start in September and told me to call after summer holidays. To wrap it up, I called two weeks ago and the manager told me that I'll be starting very soon and that they would get back to me.   


I'm not really expecting them to get in touch that soon...but my question is: What the hell am I supposed to take from this experience? Has anything similar ever happened to you? I understand that some companies string people along (but this much and for an internship?). The company is basically a government agency and really is quite respected...so I know for sure all the people are real and it's not a ghost company or anything similarly shady. The irony is that since I got the offer a year ago, I actually managed to finish my Master's degree, I'm graduating in 2 weeks and can look for a full-time job now. At this point, the only plus of this position is that it would look really good on my CV. I'm obviously not relying on it and looking for other jobs now...but what do you think...if by any chance they give me a specific starting date soon...should I take it (for the sake of my CV)? Thanks for your insight!   


&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Got a job (paid internship) offer a year ago without a specific start date. Every 2-3 months, the company gets in touch reassuring me I'll be starting soon. What is going on?"

Now it’s my senior year, and I was able to catch up on credits with summer classes to graduate on time with a BA in CS and a minor in neuroscience and possibly cognitive science.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently told my mom that I would be able to graduate on time, she was surprised and happy, but said that I don't need to rush, and that if I need to take a 5th year, I could.

&amp;#x200B;

Normally I would never consider making my parents dish out another year of tuition, especially when me failing out was a result of me being a spoiled lazy fuckhead. But as I am now I would probably graduate as the least impressive student in my computer science department with BA instead of a BS, a shit GPA and no internships or significant side projects. The only things going for me are that I go to a really good school and have better social skills than most CS students.

&amp;#x200B;

If I was to just make do with my current situation, I would do some smart contract development with the blockchain club I'm in for my side projects, and would just look for a job/internship for after I graduate. I do have a potential job offer from a buddy from my home town for a really cool and fast growing company, but it would be as a PHP developer which is not the skill set I desire, but would happily accept the job out of desperation and hometown convenience. From there I would attempt to get a job in a field I'm passionate about.

&amp;#x200B;

For more context, I'm obsessed with all the buzzword meme technologies: Distributed ledgers, IoT, AI/Machine learning, Brain-computer interfaces and VR/AR. I want to do whatever it takes to get into one or more of these fields, but preferably I'd like to get into crypto/blockchain/DLT first because has the lowest barriers to entry, has applications in both machine learning and IoT, and I think it will affect the world the most within the next 5 or so years.

&amp;#x200B;

If I was to do a 5th year in college, I would try to get an internship this summer and then switch my degree to a BS instead of a BA. Right now my mathematics background is incredibly weak, which is bad considering everything I'm interested in requires a solid math background. Getting a BS would require me to take Calc 3, algorithms and analysis, physics, linear algebra, intro to probability and another science class, all of which would be beneficial, but would create a very hard final year at college, which might impede on my job search for when I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post, would love any advice you guys can offer, don't be afraid to be blunt about the shitty situation I put myself in."

It started for me with a acute panic attack in 1998 from smoking to much canabis, no signs of depression ever .. prescriptions started, addiction to prescriptions, multiple attempts to stop, multiple relapses into massive depression, anxiety, 15 or more hospitalizations, multiple drug changes.. it’s all bloody bull shit.. have had periods being stable but never felt ‘normal’ &amp; able to function on meds.. 

Just spent 10 months in hospital.. they cold turkied me from original treatments I was on after 4 years on them .. I lost my mind.. they tried multiple drugs, none worked, all made me worse &amp; all gave me intolerable side effects.. so they cold turkied me again 3 months ago.. I’ve been a bloody mess ever since.. mental &amp; physical pain so intense I can’t live with it anymore..

Acute depression, acute anxiety with panic attacks, mood swings, aggression, even delusional, confusion, migraines, a sensation that the front of my brain has gone numb/stopped functioning, nausea, hearing problems, vision problems, cramps, detachment from reality, agonizing back pain, spit blood ever morning,. the list of physical &amp; mental symptoms goes on &amp; on.

I don’t know if I’m suffering withdrawal symptoms or brain damage or a perminant brain disfuction or illness.. demencia, altzimers, epilepsy or something else..

I’ve tried taking numerous supplements over last 3 months (this is when I was cold turkied beginning of June).. everything from Mind Lab Pro to omega3 high dose, multiple vitamins, minerals, even rTDCS.. multiple amino acids, multiple products bought off the net.. Indian plants, even an experimental antidepressant called NSI-189 but it made me manic, worsened my anxiety, so I stopped.. 

Since then have got much, much worse.. all symptoms have multiplied.. I feel like I’m dying literally every second of every day.. symptoms like a psychotic depression mixed with anxiety &amp; acute fear.. all I think about is suicide.. 

I’m not getting much help.. a nurse visits me once a week.. I’ve seen an intern shrink once every 2weeks.. I’m supposed to start a course if rTMS next week but at my lvl of symptoms I don’t think it will do much.. have no psychological help at all.. tried ringing local drs, therapists, shrinks.. no one takes me, everyone says they don’t have any places left..

Have even rang different hospitals to re-admit me.. the hospital I was in before refuse to take me &amp; the others are private &amp; full.. have been to er twice.. everywhere I turn for help I get nothing..
Even asked for ect, was turned down..

I’m at the end of my tether.. don’t know what supplements I should be taking or not.. posting this note here is my last attempt to get help.. someone to talk too.. maybe someone who knows what to do or take to ease my symptoms.. though I guess that’s hoping to much..

I’m in agony &amp; I need help.. it has to stop or at least ease up.. I put a knife against my wrist everyday but don’t have the guts to go through with it, scared of the pain of death.. scared of the blood.. some stupid survival instinct that blocks my intended actions..  

Is there anyone out there that can help... ?

1. In my case should I add relevant coursework? Since I've only taken two courses relevant to Computer Science.

2. Should I specify if my project is still in development? I am currently finishing the Database integration, so I should not be that far from finishing since all the functionality is essentially done.

3. Since I've only done a project using swift, should I be including the web technologies that I've used while completing udemy courses as well, even though I haven't used them in any projects of my own?

4. Should I calculate my gpa based on all the courses I've taken in uni, or only the CS courses relevant to my major (e.g. Intro to Programming, Calc I &amp; II, Linear Algebra, etc...)?

5. This is just a general advice question: I'm applying to internships with only being in CS for literally 2 months, I only have one side-project and pretty much no DS&amp;A knowledge other than the basics (simple data structures, stacks, queues, and a few sorting algorithms). How should I go about the next few months while applying to internships to get better? Should I focus solely on DS&amp;A, get more side projects, or a combination of both?

The company that I'm currently interviewing for is looking to start an IT department, and right now all they have is a CTO (who I'm skeptical of when it comes to knowing much about this field, seems to be just a guy in a suit). Apparently, I impressed them enough to make it to the second round of interviews where they're asking me to submit a proposal to implement IT infrastructure.

So to start with, I'm am a recent graduate with a B.S. in IT, and I only have 1 year of experience as a junior sysadmin from my internship. The issue they expect me to deal with is that they have very little existing IT infrastructure. They currently have 50 employees (30 of whom work onsite), and use G Suite for almost everything. There aren't any physical servers either, and they are using Google Drive for file storage. They also don't appear to have a ticketing system either.

My question, I guess, is how should I proceed with this? I feel like they're looking for a system architect, yet the position I applied for, 'IT Specialist', seemed more of a hybrid between a sysadmin and desktop support. If I'm being honest with myself, I feel a bit overwhelmed. Should I recommend a cloud-based infrastructure, something akin to AWS/Microsoft Azure/Google Cloud? Perhaps a hybrid approach utilizing both local servers and cloud computing? Maybe request a third party consulting firm to build their IT infrastructure from the ground up?

Not quite sure where to start, and I would be sincerely thankful for a step-by-step breakdown/approach to better grasp the situation. One last thing, they told me if I needed any training or certifications, they would be more than willing to provide it."

It seems like this problem is universal, but I haven't found much written on how to mitigate it. I'm thinking about something a bit more macro than just knowing/applying patterns -- more like:

* standardizing on which patterns to use when
* coming up with engineering guidelines strict enough to be useful but unobtrusive enough that they're generally followed
* writing documentation in a way that's efficient and (relatively) easy to change when necessary
* writing code that helps new engineers learn its structure and how to work with it

I'm on a team now that's scaling rapidly, and I'd like to do what I can to hold that entropy at bay. I have a few vague theories about how to do this, but I'm not sure I've ever really been at one job long enough to see if they hold up.

 I'm doing Calc III, CoSci 839 (second cosci class) and Physics 37 (first physics class, out of three I need to do). I've also been working as a STEP tutor since Spring.

 I'll be applying to UCLA in fall of 2019 (in one year!) and I haven't really done anything! Other people are getting internships, working on projects, learning a bunch of new languages, going to hackathons. I've done nothing! 

 I've applied to hackathons but never got accepted, I've tried getting internships/projects but I just can't find any in my area! (I don't have a car).

 and I'm too depressed to learn stuff on my own. I moved here last year in fall and so far I've made 0 ""real"" friends. I mean I talk to my classmates and I'm not shy at all, but they just seem not to care and nobody becomes close with anyone. They already have friends outside of college. What the heck do I do?

Here's a rough profile:

**Bachelors Degree:** Electrical Engineering (from Pakistan, 2013 - 2017)

**GPA:** 3.59 / 4.00

**GRE:** 155 V; 164 Q; 4.0 W

I'm currently an undergraduate student working towards a degree in computer science. Right now, I'm a junior (3rd year -- not sure if other countries call them differently). When I began my degree, I was confident and almost insistent that it was something that I would love, but after having more experience under my belt, I'm discovering that it may not be my cup of tea. I was exposed to it because of a high school, year-round internship that turned into a college-internship when I graduated high school. Now I'm dependent on the income from the internship (it pays pretty well) so I feel stuck. I've taken some elective classes to fill general education requirements and I'm far more drawn and engaged in them than I am in my comp sci classes.  I'm trying not to read between the lines too much, but if computer science ""is my passion"" why do the other classes seem so much more interesting? 

I'm just wondering if other people experience this same thing; I'm wondering if its kind of a ""honeymoon phase"" where I'm interested in the other classes more because it's new material/subjects, or if maybe I should seriously consider leaving my internship, finding a new major, and starting (mostly) all over again.

So for a little bit of background into how this situation unfolded, this all began when Me, my Brother, and my friend were trying to get a three person apartment in Temple Towers. After not being able to find an available room in Temple Towers, we ended up just placing ourselves into a room in Morgan North, we knew that a random roommate would be joining me in my bedroom but we figured that it wouldn't have been anything to worry about. I can now say, after just two weeks into the semester, that it absolutely was. The main root of the problems with him is the fact that he never leaves the room, He's always there at his desk on his PC. Now if he was simply there quietly playing video games this obviously wouldn't be a problem, but there are a few other massive things that are affecting how not only me, who has to share the bedroom with him, but how my brother and friend, who are in the other bedroom, are living. The first habit that is absolutely infuriating is the fact that he is extremely messy. Now thankfully this does not seem to apply to the bathroom's cleanliness (one thing I will say is that he at least cleans himself regularly and does his part to keep the bathroom clean as well) but does apply everywhere else. I've had to move a few things such as cardboard boxes and plastic bins that he just left in the center of the room to his side, and although it's only been about two weeks since move-in, his desk is already covered in fast food bags and crumbs, with the same going for the space around his desk. But by far the most infuriating thing about him is his yelling problem. He will often just scream and yell at his computer no matter what time of the day it is. This is only a minor annoyance during the day time but he also does this during the night when I'm trying to sleep. He'll scream, laugh, or yell swears at his computer and it has been waking me so much that I've only been getting about half as much sleep as I normally did. I tried to deal with the extreme brightness from his computer by wearing an eye mask to bed, but the main problem with that is that I seem to take it off in my sleep and then either the brightness or his screams will wake me up. There was actually one instance, while I was home for the weekend, where my friend **who slept in the other bedroom** was woken up when he was slamming his fists against his desk. I don't think I can truly even describe just how loud it is when he does it. I go home every weekend for an internship and one of things I am legitimately excited for is getting a full 8 hours of sleep instead of the \~5 Hours I get here at college. So it's only been two weeks and me and my other Roommates (that being my brother and good friend) have been getting sick of this. Is there anything that we can do to try and resolve this? We were thinking of waiting until October to approach our RA about this, but it seems that we need to do something now. If three of the four roommates in a given room go and complain about the fourth roommate, would that fourth roommate be kicked out of the room? Any advice would be appreciated because this is already getting on my last nerve. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank You all in advance.

Edit: Scheduled our roommate contract meeting for this Tuesday, will talk with him about my grievances then and how we can fix them. Thanks for all your advice."

9eaaf8,17,2018-09-09,Goldman Sachs Salt Lake City IBD (WSO),U_Accrete_Me,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/9eaaf8/goldman_sachs_salt_lake_city_ibd_wso/,"[In this thread](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/goldman-sachs-slc-ibd-overview), WSO user KD's Burner Account provides information regarding GS SLC IBD. He has been in the program for multiple years and most of the the information in the post comes from his own experience.

From the post:

Overview: The GS SLC IBD program is a collection of IBD analyst positions located in SLC.  The aim of the program is for an analyst to work for about a year and a half and then move to the NY or SF office as a full-time analyst there. This program is an amazing opportunity for someone who may not be able to go straight to a BB NY analyst role.

Recruiting for GS IBD SLC: A notable difference between recruiting for this program and standard NY banking programs is that you are much more likely to get a shot here if you do not have a prior BB banking internship.

Training and Staffing: From a staffing perspective, initially the teams are likely to be more client service focused and less technical given the limited prior banking experience of most analysts. Once the analyst has proven themselves (can be anywhere from one to four months), they are likely to be added to live deals with a second-year analyst to work with. Usually, around the six to nine-month mark, you will start to be the sole analyst on CS and live teams.

Working Remotely: The content of the work being done in SLC and the hours are the same as NY. The biggest obvious difference is that instead of sitting next to your associates and VPs, you'll be a few thousand miles away and forced to communicate through call/email/IM. In SLC you are surrounded only by analysts, whereas NY it is a mix of associates/VPs/MDs walking around. Given the nature of the junior population, it is exponentially more laid back and less formal in SLC and is a really positive and enjoyable working environment.

Conversion to NY: One other major thing to note, which is probably the overall biggest downside of this program, is that when you convert to NY you step back in tenure one year. So, if you convert to NY at 18 months, you will lose a year and be grouped for promotions and comp with the NY analyst class behind you that started 6 months ago.

SLC Life and Comp: Comp is less than NY, but expenses are also significantly less. All-in with a normal situation, you're likely to have about the same amount of money in your pocket after taxes and living expenses compared to NY.

Exit Opps: The general consensus of recruiting externally from this program is that you will be fine as long as you

1. tell a good story as to why you started in SLC,
2. make it clear that the work you did is the same as someone in NY, and
3. that you can intelligently talk about deals that you've contributed to.

What do you guys think about this program compared to BB IBD/other similar opportunities?"

So basically, from the moment I got there, this older woman from another department who was really, really close friends with my manager seemed to have it out for me. Here’s a list of the ridiculous shit she’s done:


- She told me my desk was too clean, and said not to “waste time” on it. This is ridiculous. I don’t spent more than 10 minutes a day cleaning

- I organize my stuff into small, labeled bins. She said it was a waste of time and it was better to be messy. 

- She’ll ask me to do something that’s not urgent. I’ll leave to go to the bathroom, and when I come back she mentions that “5 minutes have gone by. Do you not know what to do?” Then she’ll report to my manager I can’t do simple tasks when I’ve just been away for a small bathroom break

- I wear a mono-colored, long sleeved Hanes t-shirt and long pants to work every day. I wear flat shoes. None of my clothing is tight. My hair is always up in a ponytail, and I never wear makeup. She made a remark about how I dressed like a whore, and mentioned I was vain for wearing contacts.

- When I used a soldering iron, I asked her where the temperature setting was. She told me soldering irons don’t have temperature settings (blatantly untrue, she never went to school for electrical engineering, else she would know some of them do), and reported that I lied about knowing how to solder and that I refused to acknowlege when I needed help.

- Every time she talks to me, she stops by my bosses desk and gives him a scathing report. 

-She can see my status when I’m logged in to my computer. She never fails to message me the minute I get into work. If I don’t have a clear “daily plan”, she mentions to the boss I don’t know how to break down my work into small tasks

- One of my friends from school works at the same company, and is quite brilliant. She asked if I got my high GPA by getting him to do all my homework for me. I have never once in all my years of knowing him asked this friend for help with any of my homework, and turned down all his offers to help.


TLDR : horrible coworker has me under a microscope and is psychotically obsessed with finding tiny mistakes I make, and twisting them so I look bad. I have already decided to never return, but what if this happens again?"

I've been planning to move to Canada for years now and I'd finally be going to move there next year for study. I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science, but I'm going to study something else entirely. The problem is, I don't know what would be the best path to get PR there.

My current options are either taking Master degree in business and management (since that's the only Master degree that I can take other than Computer Science related things), or taking a graduate certificate program in Tourism/Hospitality (with internship). I don't really want to study business, but if I take the graduate certificate I'd only be able to obtain 1 year of Post Graduate Work Permit (I'd get 3 years if I do Master degree). Would one year PGWP gonna be enough to get a PR? Or should I think of other options?

Some other minor detail, I can speak basic French (I used to live in France). I'd really wish to move away from here permanently before they start criminalizing gays (It's been often implied that they might at some point).

9eblvs,40,2018-09-09,"started Linux SysAdmin internship 2 months ago, team leader always wants me to fail",WaspDog,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/9eblvs/started_linux_sysadmin_internship_2_months_ago/,"I have recently started as a System administrator intern at a company which is not very big.  The internship is permanent and it will converted to a full-time job after 8months.

So here is the story, I work in a team of 7 sys admins, 1 junior (me), and rest of them are seniors, one of whom is Sys Admin team leader. I got hired after I performed really well during the interview process. And they were really impressed with my linux skill and that I have RHCSA, CCNA, CCNP, CCNA Security and OSCP certifications.

**Problem:**

From the day one, my team leader who has over 15 yeas of experience always trying to compete with me, he expect me to not know things, and when I answer his questions on some of the most complex problems, he turns red and gets so cranky and rude. I get so scared every time this happens, and this happens almost everyday. It hurts my head really bad and put me under a lot of stress when he says, you don't know anything you are just a junior.

Because of this, I have to act dumb most of the time, even if I know answer to the questions he asks, I have to act like I have no clue, this makes me feels so guilty and bad. I don't know what to do?, he gets rude on very tiny things, If i find a bug or exposed password in one of the configurations, he will get rude to me and say rude stuff to make me feel down since he is the one who wrote those vulnerable configurations.

For instance, yesterday he asked me to follow perform certain tasks related to monitoring and I did them. He came to me and said, I bet you didn't do that when I said I have done it can I please show you. As soon as he heard that I have done it he got so cranky and loud since he was expecting that I wouldn't have done it.

He was once really really nice to me and said that I wanna give you career advice and tell you that you will suite in a bigger corporation where you will have room to grow and expand, but in this company there isn't much room for growth. That made me feel so down, since, on one side, he appreciate that I am smart and i know my shit, while on the other hand telling me to maybe look for a better job.

&amp;#x200B;

I love the work I do, its very complex and that is the kind of work I like. Being a SysAdmin had always been my passion and I have some massive linux based projects that I have worked on which helped me land this job in the first place, but I feel that my team leader wants me to fail all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't go to HR since there is no HR, there is just one person who is Admin as well as HR and she is also very rude.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't get mentally drained from my everyday work, but dealing with him everyday, makes my head hurt so much.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.  Can someone please guide me or had such an experience in the past. 

I really need help."

My education consists of an associates focused on computer stuffs and a few cisco/microsoft certs. Was top of my class during college math courses. I LOVE mathematics and problem solving through logic and critical thinking, which is the reason I believe I would make a great software engineer. Last month I started learning C++ and software engineering(algorithms, data structures, best practices, programming principles, computer mathematics, etc) closely following an actual university's curriculum.

Now, I am 100% sure that I can learn all those things, to a competent level, within 2 years of heavy grind. My question is:

Should I bite the bullet and just get an accelerated online bachelors which will probably not be completely focused on software engineering and will inevitably force me to enroll in some liberal arts/humanity classes thus splitting my focus? 
It will be much slower yet less intensive than self-learning the core material on my own. It will also cost me money but... I will have a degree at the end of the whole ordeal.

I am also willing to take an unpaid internship lasting up to several months, but how common are those? Would anyone even accept somebody without a degree related to programming and no github/demonstrable experience to speak of?"

I'm new to digital ocean and got a $50 credit through the GitHub student package.

I want to create a small Droplet (which I guess is just a VPS?) with Debian and Docker on it.

Some years back (I think around 2004/2005) I had a internship at a local ISP where I used Debian to create a webserver (from install to configuration) and created a small homepage with HTML and CSS. But I can't remember much of it.

I'm by no means a system admin or webdeveloper I got down the design route since then.

What I'm wondering when I create that Debian droplet with Docker (One-click app) is do I have to care about all the security measures you should normaly do on Linux webservers or can I just go ahead and use Docker to install the stuff I need and just confirue that?

My goal is to put a simple private homepage on it and to use [Nuage](https://github.com/mickael-kerjean/nuage) with it to share pictures with friends and family.

Sorry, I know this is atotally newbie question.

Then I was told by a professional IT that I should study for the Security+ again. 
 
I just started studying on August 31 so that I can at least know the majority of the material before taking a continuing education course next year. I remember taking my first practice test and I remember getting a 68, so why am I getting 50s and 40s even after studying? I dislike getting failing grades for any reason, whether it's practice testing or not. It makes me feel like I am wasting my time studying and my studying skills are trash. I also want to take the exam sometime May next year.

I bought the book ""CompTIA Security+ SY0-501 Exam Cram, 5th Edition"" by Diane Barrett &amp; Martin M. Weiss and attempted to read all 6 sections last week. I gave up reading one section per day because I was getting too overwhelmed by the material to read in one day. I remember reading chapter 1 two times, though.

So I took a practice test after reading chapter 1 twice and I end up getting another score in the 50s (a 52% on a 50-question test). I was expecting a 60% after reading the chapter, but I get a 52 instead. I just got so upset I threw the paper in the trash because my studying must be that bad if I am studying &amp; still failing.

The only part I think I am making progress with is reading the ports and the various acronyms mentioned throughout the book I bought.

My goal is to go to grad school after I finish undergrad.

What's the absolute ideal course of action I should take to have a successful college experience and have an easy time applying for jobs after graduating?

I keep hearing a lot of advice that seems contradicting to me. Some people say that the most important thing is landing great internships and that grades don't matter as much because your employer won't care. And then you have the people who say that having a perfect GPA is crucial for getting into grad school, while internships/general work experience come second. I've also heard people say that having personal projects is the most important thing in the list.I know what I should focus on more since grad school is my goal, but at the same time I don't want to have a really hard time finding a job afterwards.

Finally, how important are clubs in college? Does holding leadership positions in a few clubs hold any weight? Any word of advice about getting a research opportunity as a freshman (besides expressing interest to my department advisor)?

I'm aware it's impossible not to mess up from time to time in college, but it wouldn't hurt to know what I should be striving for.Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Big thanks to everyone who commented!

I see there's a lot of emphasis being put on internships. I understand I should be striving to do as many internships as I can, but if I manage to only get internships that last one summer each year for 3 years (if we imagine that I choose to spend one summer doing research), would that hurt me? Secondly, what's the most important thing when it comes to choosing an internship? The name of the company, what you'll be doing there (whether it's closely related to what you want to do after graduation), or duration?

9eglwn,1,2018-09-09,Coding courses classmate is exploiter,ropeman69,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9eglwn/coding_courses_classmate_is_exploiter/,"So some time ago I attented 6 months coding ""school"". It went pretty well, I have found a company where they will take me in as intern for 2 months. This is where things get pretty tangled up, my ""coursemate"" does not put much effort in learning and doing given tasks. He would constantly ask for homework code. And now that he contacted same company, they took him in aswell. We've been given 2 tasks. I have completed both of them. With the first one he was able to ""do"" as much as I send him (actual code), with the second one he did absolutely nothing. He has lagged behind massively, even with basic knowledge. So that is why he keeps on asking for me to send code all the time. I'm 22 myself, don't have any commitments, so I use most of my time for learning, even leaving little for friends. Hes on the other hand into early 30s with wife and small child. I don't have a driving license so I go with him to nearby city to attend classes. I add money to gas. It is still cheaper to go with him than with a bus, but at start he managed to ask for more than it would cost for gas, because of my lack of understanding in this. So this is what I have to deal with. I invest all my time in learning and coding, he does not and keeps on asking for code withnout appreciation for my time. I think of telling him about this, because it causes me stress that distracts me from time to time and by doing it I might lose cheaper travel cost. I guess paying 15 euros more for bus per month is better thing than stressing out and being used. What do you guys think?"

I'm in my last year of a computer programming major. I like computer programming, but I'm not super stuck on it as what I HAVE to do. I've just always wanted to work in technology, no specific part of it. During this last summer break, I did two internships, and they both went really well, because both have now offered me very different job offers. Both jobs pay the same exact amount, have health benefits, etc. But it's like this...

&amp;#x200B;

Job #1 is a place that I've worked at as a part-timer for about four years now. My internship was in their engineering department, and the job is for an audio/electrical engineer, handling a lot of the technology that goes into radio broadcasts. Hard work sometimes, but I really enjoy it, and I would learn a lot along networking and electrical engineering lines. It's a small department, so there's not much of a career ladder, and my pay increase would be slow and gradual. But I feel like I'm working with all of my best friends, and I could see myself potentially being happy there for decades, hopefully. Things are interesting enough to not get boring, but also routine enough that I'll have steady free time, and I can work on my artistic projects and hobbies on the side.

&amp;#x200B;

Job #2 is a place I've only been at for a couple of months. They're an IT company, and I would be working in their NOC to start off with.  There's a lot of potential for growth, though, room to move into their programming department later on, or to climb the ladder and become a manager, or all sorts of possibilities. I could potentially be someday making a lot more money that I make now, but I'm definitely going to be working my butt off to get there, lots of being on call and really pushing and go-getting, and ultimately, nothing is guaranteed. (If I don't successfully climb the ladder, NOC support is fine, if possibly a little dull after a while.) While I don't know the people there super well yet, they're all super nice, and everyone in this city says that they're a great company with great people in it. There is a weird turnover rate... People have either been in the company for twenty years, or for less than three, with not much middle ground, and there are a whole lot of things where it looks like there have been recent, massive changes in how they operate. But while this would normally be a red flag, I can't find anything wrong or anyone that seems unhappy, exactly, it just seems like people keep moving on. They really invest in training and making you a more skillful employee, so it could just be people jumping ship once they're trained to go elsewhere. So, slightly worried that maybe it's more unstable than it looks, but on the other hand, crazy training and promotion possibilities, even if I might have to sacrifice my personal life a bit to work hard enough to get them.

&amp;#x200B;

So, basically, a more laid-back, less-ambitious, but very stable job, or a very hard-working, constantly ladder-climbing, seemingly cool job that I'm a little uncertain about since it's new and I don't know about the turnover rate. I'm trying to weigh the two, and it's haaaaaaard. What would you pick, if it were you?"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is against a hidden rule or something but I could use some advice right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent the summer working on a few personal projects and a project for a company that wanted me to ""prove myself"" with a smaller project. They had me retake a node.js API assignment after they didn't like my first submission, then decided against giving me an interview. Probably my fault, I was just under the impression I was applying for a paid internship while they expected me to be a rockstar out of the gate. No hard feelings. I wasn't good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I did ""lose"" my summer over this. And class is starting soon. Right after being rejected, I impulsively sent an application to an IT focused company. No more dev for me I thought. I got instantly invited to an interview, but sadly I think with the way my classes are setting up, I'm not going to be able to take the offer. The schedule seem to be around 2x more hours than what I expected(in school) and they'd have me do at least 2 days/week minimum with extra stand by time. I don't think I want to take this, which effectively had me lie on an interview, since I said I'll MOST LIKELY be available for 2 days/week and then full time once classes are out and I'll write my Bachelors on my own time.

&amp;#x200B;

**Will I burn any bridges by rejecting the offer and having the position postponed**? I seem to be more than qualified and if by any chance the job was just too crazy to pass on I'd half ass school and re-take classes over the span of 2 years. But this seems like a regular IT job and I honestly didn't get the right vibe from my ""potential boss"" and the offices were basically an apartment with computers instead of bedrooms. And the interview felt super rushed, with barely any questions directed towards me or my goals.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the title. I haven't applied to many positions but scanning the market I don't really feel like there's as many options as the government had me believe(until I have 2+ years of experience at least). I got rejected from 2 tech jobs I've applied to over the course of this year, with both not even making it to the interview. One I explained and another seems to just be that the recruiter ignored my application after I said I got classes to take care of for about 3 months after the job postings. I think I got a decent resume(open source projects in 3-4 languages, knowledge of linux,git, CCNA type knowledge from school, general network knowledge etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I got money saved up, and glorious government pays for most of my expenses. Living with my parents I basically have barely any expenses(phone and gym only).

&amp;#x200B;

**Do any of you have experience being the choosy beggars?** Is it worth potentially risking school for a semi-decent part time job that could theoretically turn into a career? I don't think I could be able to take on the workload honestly, but I need experience on my resume. I'm finally looking forward to a semester, my classmates are becoming friends, my professors are passionate about their subjects and there's a bunch of stuff I get to do on my own time when in uni.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for being long but I wanted to contextualize this, since I know American schooling is entirely different and that is where most of you are from. If I was paying for UNI and my parents were in debt there'd be no questions asked. But a part time job's money would be spent on gym supplements and a new computer and probably a bunch of steam games."

I'm a senior year B. Tech. student in the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (India) majoring in Textile Technology with a minor in Economics. I have a CGPA of 8.05 (up till my 6th semester) and a GRE score of 335 (V:165, Q:170, AWA 5). I really want to get into a Masters program in Data Science, but I feel skeptical because of my low CGPA and irrelevant undergrad major. I don't have a research publication but I can get good recommendations from my professors.

I have a strong background in Stats and Econometrics and have done a few course projects related to them. I've also done a course on Data Structures and Algorithms and done 3-4 course projects related to it.

I have done two internships:

1. Ernst &amp;Young LLC - This was right after my first year and I was in the Indirect Taxes department doing basically Chartered Accountant work.
2. In an IT startup working on machine learing - This was after my third year and  I worked on an Optical Character Recognition System and designed a Multi Layer Perceptron from scratch.

Currently, I'm doing a course from Coursera on deep learning and following machine learning courses on Youtube, and making a Kaggle profile.

I aim to apply for Data Science Programs beginning in Fall 2019, and have shortlisted the following programs:

1. Data Science, New York University
2. Data Science, Duke University
3. Applied Statistics (specialization in Data Science), Cornell University
4. Master of Science in Analytics, Northwestern University
5. Data Science, University of Washington, Seattle
6. Master of Analytics, Georgia Institute of Technology
7. Data Science, University of Minnesota Twin Cities
8. Data Science, University of California San Diego
9. Data Science, University of British Columbia
10. Data Science, University of Toronto

I wouldn't apply to all of the above Universities, and haven't written them in a preference order. But, out of the above, which are the Universities, you think I have a chance in? Is NYU or Georgia Tech. within my reach? What about UBC and UToronto? Is there any other program you think I should apply for? Should I even be applying to Cornell with my CGPA and background?

Please help me decide."

I worked with a professor doing research for my first summer position, and this summer I interned at a small aerospace company. While the research was very hands on and interesting, pursuing a career in research seems difficult and not viable for most people(financially speaking). My internship in industry paid better, but the work there was absolutely brain dead. It was all excel work, which wasn't challenging or interesting.

I'm doing a computer science minor now to see if I enjoy the field more than that of aerospace engineering, as most of my friends that did a software internship had a positive experience. However, I've maintained strong grades so far so I still have the option for applying to med school, which still seems like a strong option.

I'm not sure if I can find interesting work in aerospace, if I should pursue software with a minor, switch majors to computer science, or apply to medicine. It seems that financially speaking, both comp sci and med pay much better than mechanical/aerospace engineering.

I wanted to get the input of redditors from these three fields about the pros and cons of each, or just any advice you might have for me!"

My boyfriend has some pretty severe ADHD (no medication for it yet, though he's likely to get an adderall prescription soon).  We've recently realized that this is the root cause of his intense struggle with getting a new job.

He's a retail worker, took a break and got a degree, came back to retail to pay the bills, and now he's looking for jobs in his field - but has recently been told that he's under-qualified because he has no internship in said field, and doesn't know a lot of the programming skills he would need to be hired.

So, now he's on a mission to learn these programming skills to snag his first job/paid internship/what have you. He still has to work full-time in retail to help pay the bills, but he hates his job. He complains/gets moody/depressed about it every day. I just don't know what to tell him! He needs to be working 30 hours/week outside of work to learn these skills and get out soon, but he just can't seem to do it. 

To elaborate, he has a major video game problem. He tends to start working, then take a break, which turns into a longer break. He then starts to feel guilty about taking said break, and get really depressed. At that point, he just plays video games the rest of the day to ""escape"" the guilt/anxiety. We've tried getting him to delete the video games, but he inevitably reinstalls them, and I imagine that's not addressing the root problem anyway. 

I just don't know how to help him. I know that the adderall will help, but it's gonna be awhile before we can get it due to waiting times between Dr. appointments, re-testing, some insurance BS, etc. I'm also of the opinion that the medicine is more of a bandaid than a long-term solution, but I've not contended with ADHD so what do I know?

I'm asking for anyone who's been in a similar experience and trained themselves into newer, more positive ways of thinking. Tips on limiting video game/screen time in any way possible are also welcome. Anything you can think of that may help is great though.

**TL;DR** 

**Boyfriend has severe ADHD, resents his job, yet can't push himself to work as much as he needs to on skills he needs to get a new job in his degree field. Gets distracted by video games, then loses entire days frequently, which demoralizes him further. How do I help him get a handle on the video games and/or train himself into more productive ways of thinking?**"

Having looked for posts similar to mine, I didn't find a satisfactory answer.

Up until now, I have relied on ""good enough"" laptops for my game dev needs, but now is the time to finally get myself a good PC, and am looking for advice on how to proceed. **I plan on using UE4 and focus mostly on 3D games**. I am not a beginner, being fresh out of a year-long internship as a gameplay programmer at a game company. Embarrassingly enough though I have never built a PC, and from what I hear now is not the right time to do so at all due to highly inflated prices.

My question is: **should I build or buy a PC?** I am ready to spend **up to $2000 CAD (\~$1500 USD)**. If I'm better off building, what parts should I prioritize? Otherwise, do you know of any pre-built PC that would fit my needs?

The last few days I had the opportunity to give lessons without supervision from another teacher. That was a great experience for me. 
However I have another, different class tomorrow, I already know the students and I'm not concerned with them not taking me seriously apart from two boys. 

I've already interacted with them in the schoolyard and talked with other teachers about them, they completely lack any respect for authorities. Whatever you do, be it shouting, sending them out of the classroom, or threatening them with other repercussions, they just refuse to do what you tell them to. Other teachers already have had these experiences.

That being said I'm not really looking forward to tomorrow. I'm interested how I will handle such a situation with difficult students as it unfolds, but I still got a bad feeling. I feel like I'm in the situation of a dog who barks, but can't bite since these kids just dont care about it.

What's your advice on this issue? I fear that because of these two students my lesson will end in complete chaos.

#Edit:

Lesson is over and it went ok. I did what many commenters here recommend and gave them the option to work or just to sit there and do whatever they want that doesnt annoy the others.

Guess which option they chose?

There was alot of talking and shouting involved in getting them to be quiet but it eventually worked out, they even wanted to do the exercises in the last 10mins.

Thx for everyones advice, I'm very grateful for that"

What I got from this experience is that I want to pursue a PhD in order to transition into a scientist position in industry.

One of the jobs recently asked for my references after a phone interview (before they offer me an on-site interview). I gave them. Today my boss emailed me about my candidacy for the position and whether I should pursue positions if I know that I would leave for graduate school.

My issues with this are

A. Admission to a PhD program is not a sure thing. I don’t want to put my life on hold for 8-12 months for nothing to pan out.

B. What if I like the position and find that there are opportunities to grow into a management position? I could potentially choose to stay at a position instead of going to graduate school.

C. I can’t afford to not work — I have student loans and I am saving up to buy a newer car. 

D. I also don’t want to feel as though I have wasted my internship and the skills I have learned to go back to working a low paying retail job.

I’m not really sure what to do and no company has asked if I’m planning on pursuing graduate school. While they have asked me about my career plans, I feel that I have been honest in saying I’m seeking growth in my career and would like to eventually become a “scientist”.

What should I do?"

It was an admin job at a big consulting company. I am 24, with little experience. I don't know anyone in my social circles who has been fired yet. After graduating a couple years ago, I struggled to get by, doing internships and contracted gigs. And only a month after I landed my first ""real"" job, I get fired on the spot.

And I completely deserved it. I was terrible at that admin job. I got multiple warnings for my performance and honestly, I saw this coming. I did my best to keep up, but I just did not have the skills for this role.

Prior to this job, I was in roles that involved research, analysis, and translation. I did good work, but it was all through unpaid internships or very lowly-paid contract work. The person I was working for on an informal contractual basis, let's call him Adam, was really happy with my contributions and said that he wished that I could have continued. But I didn't see any path to a full-time, 9-to-5 salaried job, so I left. 

I did have some outstanding research tasks for Adam, however, that I continued to work on over the weekends. So although I formerly left that role a month ago, I was still working on those tasks, and therefore do not technically have a gap in employment. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what now?

Should I leave off this admin job from my resume and note that I continued working for Adam during that month? Would it be dishonest of me to do so? Would it be a red flag for a recruiter if I omitted the admin job? If they found out about it, how would I explain it?

I submitted my last assignment for Adam yesterday. This morning, he asked me how my new job was going. A couple hours later, I got fired. Should I tell him I got fired only after a few weeks of working there, and ask him if he can find a way to get me hired at the organization he works at?

There was over 120 people applying for my position, so I must have done something right. In this post I want to explain what I did and how you can get a similar job.

[If you want watch a video of this instead you can click here.](https://youtu.be/OQbuUCxEeZE)

First, let me tell you about my background. I’m studying management science, not computer science. Basically, I’ve only done one course about programming. So all the computer science I know is from learning by myself. I haven’t even done that much programming by myself, roughly 200 hours. That’s like five weeks of programming full time, not much at all. That means you can get a really high paying job with all perks if you program for five weeks, pretty cool right?

**How did I stand out?**

When it came to the first questions, I researched the company a lot. I looked all over the website and at last I found an interesting frame for my answers. King has explicit culture values, and I thought it would look really good if I focused on them in my answers. Turns out I was right, apparently King grades applicants on how well they match the culture values.

Another thing I did was to make a personal website that stood out. I choose to make a parody of tinder. I show what I mean in the video. That website was quirky and funny, which fits well with the playful culture at King.

Playing their games and thinking about the product was really helpful for coming up with thoughtful answers in the interviews. I was always trying to relate to their company and understand them fully. My showing that type of dedication, I was able to get hired over more technical applicants.

Hope that made sense!"
9eqxu8,1,2018-09-10,Should I drop out of graduate school?,throwawayy123477,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9eqxu8/should_i_drop_out_of_graduate_school/,"After graduating from college with a degree in Media/Communication, I was unable to get a job in my field, primarily because I did not have an internship. So I decided to enroll in the Master of Journalism program at my school in hopes of securing an internship and launching a career in the media field.

After being accepted into the program, I began to have second thoughts. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to be a journalist and didn’t think the program was worth the money. I would also miss being away from my parents, to whom I’m very close. They are older, and I help out a lot around the house. However, my mom encouraged me to pursue graduate school, saying it was a good opportunity for me. She was so excited when I received my acceptance letter, and I didn’t want to let her down.

Well, I’m two weeks into the program, and I’m really depressed. I have social anxiety and don’t feel confident in my ability to go out into the field and conduct interviews. In addition, I applied to dozens of internships and did manage to obtain one, but it was my very last choice and I dread going in.

In the midst of all of this doubt, I applied to a library job back home and did fairly well in the interview. I think I have a good chance of getting it.

So needless to say, I am thinking about dropping out of graduate school, moving back home and working at the library. If I drop out by tonight, I can get a tuition refund. However, I am so afraid of disappointing my parents, particularly my mother. I know she will be so disappointed in me, and it kills me. I’m also afraid that I may end up regretting my decision later.

What should I do? Should I soldier on in graduate school? Should I drop out but continue on with my internship and look for other work? Or should I drop out and just move back home?

Thanks for your advice."

After working an internship in the aerospace industry, the impression that I got was that outside of research and small startups, the work in mechanical engineering has all been done already and there's not much interesting work being done. I decided to start a comp sci minor to see how I like the field of software since many of my friends loved their experiences in software internships.

My options to pursue a career in CS are the following: 1) Continue with mechanical engineering and do a CS minor along with self-learning 2) Switch to a CS major 3) Do a Masters degree in a CS related field

Which of these would be the best path to pursue a CS career?

Also, in terms of getting a first internship in CS, I've done a few hackathons and have done some amount of coding during my previous internships in MATLAB and VBA. Should I try to learn more about programming before I apply for internships, or do I stand a chance despite no in depth programming experience? Finally, is GPA an important factor when it comes to getting an internship?

So I have this dillemma what job to choose between two.

As first some history. This summer I decided tochange my career path and switch to IT. I was considering project management position. Not because I like communication, or taking responsibility for other people or being in the center of the attention. I would say on the contraty, I love calm working conditions, flexible deadlines, communication via messengers and e-mail but not face to face. However I have skills to work asa projectmanager that's why Ithought that this might be a good option. Studying to become a programmer takes too much time and now I can at least enter the industry and gain some basic experience and later I could learn programming and get a calm coding job. 

My first experience in project management in IT this summer was a bad one. That was kind of internship in a local company. Because of it I lost my main job, that was calm and quite OK. And that triggered a nervous breakdown. Feeling of responsibility, nesessity to act in considiotns when I do not know what to do, nesessity to draw a UX design (whichis usually not a PM's responsibilities and moreover I have no skills and knowledge in UX). I was completely down and thought that I would go out of my mind. I am still taking anti-depressants and visiting my therapist from time to time.

Later I found new job in a small local company. People here are awessome. The project I work on have very questionable future but the job that I currently do is calm and OK for me. I could say that I love everything here. Although other project managers complain that the company uses too simple approach to project management and you will not gain nesessary skills for the industry. The job is less stressfull but you pay for it with your absent skills of budgeting, deadline management etc. I have not signed any documents becauseit was a trial period and workedwith the company for several days.

But the life likes to bring surprises to us. And so one of the reputable local companies offered me a job of a project manager with higher pay. Initially I have agreed. But the guys where I work now say that they feel comfortable working with me and they believe that I will make the project live and offered me even more money. I know that this new firm uses industry spread approaches to project management and that PM job there is quite a stressful one. But they have good clients, formal, clear procedures, yearl review of the salary, some educational program etc.

So now I feel that my heart chooses the place where I am currently. But my mind chooses the new place because there I might have more perspectives. However there is a risk that I will get another breakdown and the job will be too stressfull for me and that I will quit very soon.

I need to choose today, whether to call the new place and tell them that I changed my mind (my first day there is tomorrow and they have already prepareda working placefor me). Or whether I should risk everything (including my health) and try it. Because if I do not try I might think my whole life what would be.

Hello everyone!

So I have this dillemma what job to choose between two.

As first some history. This summer I decided tochange my career path and switch to IT. I was considering project management position. Not because I like communication, or taking responsibility for other people or being in the center of the attention. I would say on the contraty, I love calm working conditions, flexible deadlines, communication via messengers and e-mail but not face to face. However I have skills to work asa projectmanager that's why Ithought that this might be a good option. Studying to become a programmer takes too much time and now I can at least enter the industry and gain some basic experience and later I could learn programming and get a calm coding job.

My first experience in project management in IT this summer was a bad one. That was kind of internship in a local company. Because of it I lost my main job, that was calm and quite OK. And that triggered a nervous breakdown. Feeling of responsibility, nesessity to act in considiotns when I do not know what to do, nesessity to draw a UX design (whichis usually not a PM's responsibilities and moreover I have no skills and knowledge in UX). I was completely down and thought that I would go out of my mind. I am still taking anti-depressants and visiting my therapist from time to time.

Later I found new job in a small local company. People here are awessome. The project I work on have very questionable future but the job that I currently do is calm and OK for me. I could say that I love everything here. Although other project managers complain that the company uses too simple approach to project management and you will not gain nesessary skills for the industry. The job is less stressfull but you pay for it with your absent skills of budgeting, deadline management etc. I have not signed any documents becauseit was a trial period and workedwith the company for several days.

But the life likes to bring surprises to us. And so one of the reputable local companies offered me a job of a project manager with higher pay. Initially I have agreed. But the guys where I work now say that they feel comfortable working with me and they believe that I will make the project live and offered me even more money.

But they have good clients, formal, clear procedures, yearl review of the salary, some educational program etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently starting an internship where I have to look into detecting base modifications in minION sequencing data. However, I'm struggling somewhat since the literature [PAPER](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4189.pdf?origin=ppub) talks about aligning the reads to a reference genome using a pair-HMM but I do not understand why.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone here know how to work with minION data from the R9 chemistry? It seems that they made some changes in the data files since the R7 chemistry that make it more difficult to extract meaningful data for training a model for example.

Furthermore, is there anyone who has worked with pair-HMM's for aligning reads to references before and willing to explain it a little or perhaps provide some literature?

I'm a third year compsci student in the UK and want to do third year project on something security-based in order to help me get a job in this industry. I have done a pentesting internship over summer and one of my colleagues suggested looking at side channel attacks. While I think this sounds interesting I thought it may be more electronics related that what I would want. Network security really interests me but I cant think of a project that would be sufficiently challenging with the current level of knowledge I have now. The project doesnt have to be a unique idea but I'd like to put my own spin on it whatever it is. It can be research-related or creating something (some software engineers I know will be creating apps).

I would be interested in seeing what you guys could suggest for a project in the netsec field and I really appreciate any responses you could give!"

I find it very hard to work with her on daily basis since she is tricking the company into making them think that she is actually adding value when she simply isn’t. Anytime I look at her, she is either on LinkedIn or Facebook “researching” a strategy. I do google analytics and businesses started finding us already because of the efforts. 

I also struggle working with people who simply do not deserve the job. Yesterday, she asked: what is the capital of France? She is from the U.K. and the office is based here.

On another note, how do you guys cope with ridiculously dishonest people to the point where they are asked what are they doing, they start rambling a bunch of s**t and never get to the point. This co worker non stop says things like “get out of my country” (as a joke) which simply isn’t a joke at this stage (I’m from abroad, but I couldn’t give a damn). 

I make jokes off my nationality and me being a permanent resident all the time because I find it funny, but her attitude is becoming plain disrespectful at this stage. She is trying also to set me up on meetings, asking me questions that are not connected to what I do to make me look bad (which i really don’t care), but I am looking for ways to cope up with this until a month after until I find another job.

It’s to the point that you can sense the tension in the room. "

(my pros and cons)",Soap-Taste-Ok,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9exug3/what_jobs_could_i_get_without_any_degree_if_im/,"I’m 20M, I’m unemployed and I wanna know if the things I’m good at, if I could use them to my advantage.

So things I’m good at (pros), I have very low self esteem so it might not be much.

1. I play a lot of pc games, since I were a child so I can type without looking at my keyboard. I type decently fast as well. So if I gonna write something from paper to my computer I can just look at the paper the entire time. Maybe I can use this as an advantage somewhere..?

2. People tell me i am a very calm and understanding person.

3. I’m decent (not very good but I been sitting at my pc for 5-10h “every day” for last 10 years.

Things I’m not so good at, (cons):

1. I’m scared of taking, uh what’s the word like taking steps on my own in workplaces.

2. When I’m on job interviews, ppl normally ask me what I enjoy. I normally tell them workout, play at my computer, photography. But then they ask me “what about ur social life”, and I kinda try avoid answering cause I have no friends irl, and I’m very lonely. This must be a very big turn off for a job interview.

3. I don’t think I’m good enough. For example last week I were at a job interview to be like a “jump in” on a place where u take care of ppl with autism, and give them medicine etc. she told me they can sometimes wanna jump in front of the road etc, if u outside. This made me doubt myself more then ever. Would I manage to stop them in time etc. Also cook food, I’m not very good at it.

Tomorrow it’s like a “informational appointment” where they gonna tell the ppl that searched the job how it works and how u give them medication etc. The job interviewer told me I would probably fit with 1 person with autism and they were gonna give me a like “come try 1h, and get the feel” (not sure when yet). But I just wanna don’t do this. I will also have to help them in the shower and on the toilet. But my parents will get mad if I don’t take that job, cause I been unemployed since I finished high school last June. (Struggled with anxiety and depression)

However 1 thing I kinda enjoy is what I’m educated as, which is a kindergarten teacher. But I doubt myself there as well, I also told myself if I gonna start at a kindergarten I gonna go learn CPR / how to save ppl that get food stuck in their throat first. Cause I missed that in our education due to I didn’t do well enough on our internship.

9eyrp9,10,2018-09-11,I keep messing up behavior at work but getting corrected after the fact. What's behavior best practice in what is a much older workplace?,frequentdoodler,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9eyrp9/i_keep_messing_up_behavior_at_work_but_getting/,"So I finally got a job after four months of unemployment after my last internship ended. I'm 23, a lady(relevant here in a sec), and in the art field, and I have found an amazing gig with the help of a creative staffing agency. It was very much a rare find because of the way the position worked out, so I'm estactic to be here. I'm currently employed through the staffing agency, but my boss has given me such rave reviews that she's pushed up the ""should I work here full-time"" talk from a month to two weeks (this friday, actually). This job would be absolutely insane for my career, and my husband and I would be over the moon because we have been struggling financially for a while. All in all, this job has been easily the best thing to happen to me. 

I am, however, worried about really messing it up- not because of my skills- but because of my behavior. So I guess its much of an older company corporate culture- I see folks in suits everyday, the women wear pant suits and stuff, but then the middle aged folks are also wearing stuff like nice cardigans and slacks and blouses. The wear is actually no jeans unless on fridays, and even then you need to look ""put together"". All of the how-to-dress guides are uh.. I guess ""millennial friendly""? Lots of jeans, t-shirts, tattoos, stuff like that. 

I don't have a lot of ""professional"" clothes to begin with, so I think I have to buy some pants (slacks? what are they, exactly?) and maybe some blazers? I'd post in r/femalefashionadvice but first I thought I should ask maybe some people who have more experience with more mature, corporate places. How should I dress? Am I looking at non-offensive blazer + Blouse + pants + pumps at work? My wardrobe is nothing but colored jeans, regular denim jeans, band shirts, floral or ""out there"" blazers, and plaid kimonos or tunics. 

I have five slightly frumpy calf length dresses in muted, plain colors, so maybe I should wear those + a blazer? I'm basically asking for guidance on what kind of ""corporate"" I'm looking for, because when I get comments on what I wear at work I'm really concerned I'm standing out too much. For instance, yesterday I wore a black and white striped tunic sweatshirt with corset style stitching on the side (literally just four inches on the side seams tied with laces), olive jeans and black leather ankle boots (like more old school doc martens). I also wore my hair in a high bun and neutral makeup. Is that too ""young"" a style to wear to work? 

Another thing- work behavior. This is the thing that REALLY confuses me. We had a deadline, right? and on friday, I stayed until 9 to finish it, and I had got in at 8AM that day. when I asked my boss a question via text (we have been texting the last few days), she called me and was horrified that I stayed so late working. I was really confused because what I was working on had to get done that day, right? My last job at an agency was exactly like that. Every day there'd still be people there at 8-9PM at night. She talked to me the next morning and asked that I never do that again, and said, ""if it doesn't get done, it doesn't get done"". So now I have a rule that the earliest I can come in is 7:30AM and the latest I can work is 6PM. I'm a bit of a workaholic and I routinely skip lunch if it means getting work done, but I'm starting to wonder if that is helping me or hurting me. I'm the youngest in the office AND the newest, so I don't want to seem lazy. That behavior got corrected, but after the incident today I feel like I'm already in jeopardy of losing this job. 

So early this morning, my pet began wheezing and wouldn't move from where he was, and I was concerned because he is elderly. (He's fine, now) In the past, at all three of my jobs, all I had to do is fire off an email asking what I should do, and then best practice to work from home. As long as work got done, all three of my last bosses didn't care. My boss is out of the office today, and I had completed a massive project monday, so all I had was lighter things to do. Between needing to monitor Cat, having to upload some major files, and otherwise having a light load today, it was the usual scenario that = working from home. 

Again, my boss called today and said, ""I totally understand that our industry and age and millennials has a lot of people working from home, and while I don't care and you're not in trouble, in the future it absolutely isn't best practice because [Company] is so old school. We have to come in, no matter what. Stop working for today and we'll reconvene tomorrow. Also send me pictures of [Cat] and I hope he feels better!!"" So while I don't feel like I'm ""in trouble"" per se, I'm still concerned that I'm royally fucking up. My boss is 25F and is just as bubbly and fun and casual, but then when stuff like this happens its 180 due to [Company] that we're under. When I asked for some kind of company handbook or material to ask about best practice for general work behavior, she paused and said thoughtfully that they didn't have anything like that because so many people here are ""old school"" and ""just know""

So these two incidents I've experienced make me think that all I have is the ""new school"" approach to work, and I know nothing about the ""old school"" corporate culture. What resources exist for me so that I can succeed in such a mature and tricky-to-me-environment? I'm not lazy by any means, and in fact have to be told to go home a lot because I'd happily stay late to work, but I'm worried my lack of ""old school"" professional behavior know how is going to shoot me in the foot. 

This is my first job in a corporate ""old school"" setting. Every job I've had prior to this was extremely casual and relaxed and still ""professional"", but i think that ""professional"" and my new job's ""professional"" are totally different. Any guidance? "

I'm kind of broke too so I decided why not.

Upon doing that, I received an interview for the position of Data Science for a consulting firm that a friend told me about giving valuable experience but does not pay a lot, they do train you.

I specialized in power/energy systems in my field of study in Electrical Engineering, but I am going for something that is more machine learning so it feels kind of weird. In fact, I took a course in University about Machine Learning and that was my highest mark to date.

I'm moving out on the 15th and since its just for a few more days I decided to put up with it as it would be a huge hassle to move now. 

**Problem:** Everything changed yesterday when he started harassing me even further and then physically blocked my way when I was trying to ignore him and leave the room as I wasn't feeling comfortable. He got annoyed that I wasn't verbally arguing with him and threatened to make some false claims and not return my security deposit for the room, adding that he could ""make my life very difficult"". I was shocked and didn't respond immediately but now it seems that this might be blackmail?

I told him today that I would consider my legal options if he listed false reasons for not returning my deposit and he said that it would be his word against mine and he'd deny he ever said that. I have no proof of this and I'm worried he's right. This is in California, a two party state so I can't record him either, right? If he refuses to return the money in 21 days, what sort of legal action can I take against him? I have before and after pictures of the clean and undamaged room but I don't know if this will be enough. If I go to small claims, can (should?) I accuse him of blackmail or is that not a good idea?

I like it a lot here; some of the teams here are supposedly very meh, but the team I work with has some really smart guys and we've been using React Native to work on a mobile app all summer. I wanted to go more in the direction of backend for my first job, but I like the work I do now (since I eventually wanted to go in the direction of full stack anyway).

However, I'm not guaranteed a job at this place due to reasons not necessarily related to my performance but related to the availability of positions. As such, I've been doing my best here, but also floating my resume around to different companies.

I'd like to stay in my relative geographical area (SF Valley/Greater Los Angeles). A lot of the jobs I see ask for experience in either Java or .NET; I know Java due to past experience, but have never built projects with it. I know much less C# but I also know it's easy to pick up.

Going to too many Hackathons throughout college and surrounding myself with too many Silicon Valley types (and this sub) gave me this impression that if a company:

1. Has a non-cool logo
2. Has a bunch of openings for older/Enterprise technologies
3. Has a shitty looking website
4. Is in defense
5. etc.

Then they're most likely a shitty company not worth working for. But I know that it isn't always the case, and I'm still a junior so I know I shouldn't be so picky.
But I'm afraid about going to a company full of bullshit engineers who don't care about good practices, C-suite that doesn't care about technology, and people who don't care to do a good job and always be learning. I don't know if that's a lot to ask from a job, but I've been there before (working for a bullshit 5 person startup with a ""CEO"" and ""COO"" who didn't come from a technical background).

Are these things really as bad as I think as they are? Do I have to learn Spring Framework or .NET Core now? (or even worse... .NET Enterprise)

The pay was pretty good ($25/hr, good for area), I loved the company culture, the people, the product, and my boss/coworkers. I also loved the work I was doing, touching a ton of different technologies front end to back end and and getting some really useful experience.

I got a return offer for the next summer. After talking to my cousins, who are software engineers at a big company, I should try to find a new company or different internship to get varied experience.

Are they right, should I look for other opportunities? I don't really see any other reason to not return to the same internship, especially considering I could get a great job with them immediately out of graduation.

I should also mention I'm not too confident in my ability to land another internship. "

Without further ado, here is my long-ass post about one of her more spectacular firework shows.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It's around the beginning of summer. I got a pretty good tech internship, the type that gives you free housing for however long you're there.

Around the same time, my grandparents/aunts/uncles on my mom's side came over for a family reunion and were vacationing in the same general area as my internship. Everyone's standing in the same room, being normal and stuff. At one point I mention my plans for the summer, and next thing you know my mom's inviting everyone over to ""come see boomvroomshroom's new place tomorrow!""

&amp;#x200B;

Wait.

What?

&amp;#x200B;

Hold on. Firstly, we didn't talk about this beforehand. Secondly, the apartment isn't ""mine""; I'm sharing it with a roommate I've never met before. Thirdly, my aunts and uncles? There's nine of them. And they all have their own spouses and children.

So of course I'm like, ""This isn't the best idea, there's too many of us and I haven't even met my new roommate yet - ""

Cue the artillery. She scolds me for disrespect, lightly in comparison to what I know she's capable of, but still enough to make everyone uncomfortable, to the point where one of my uncles cuts in and says ""it's really not necessary...really, it isn't! We have plans that involve sightseeing and whatnot, we really don't need to drop by the new apartment."" At which point she calms down. I think it's the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

NOT! Oh, sweet summer child, it was only just starting.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank goodness she didn't *completely* blow up in front of everyone watching (as she has before -- this was the epitome of her self-restraint, believe me). But as soon as we were out of earshot and out in the car, she's going ballistic. Some tirade about how I was being rude and disrespectful and lacking filial piety and making her lose face.

Where did this come from, you might ask? Turns out, it's ""selfish"" of me to not want to invite my family over to ""my"" new house, and by voicing that opinion, I was implying that I thought my aunts and uncles were beneath me, that I believed my aunts and uncles didn't know how to behave properly, and that I was ashamed of my culture and family.

(This is a common accusation, by the way. That I'm ashamed of my culture or something.)

&amp;#x200B;

I, using logic in an argument (yeah, yeah, I know, *I know*, I broke cardinal rule #1, but she'd been going on for close to an hour by this point and didn't seem like she was about to stop, and I could tell my poor dad was tired and needed to sleep because he was driving tomorrow), say the following things:

* I never said that my aunts and uncles didn't know how to behave properly. However, there's fucking nine of them. Even if they're being polite, it will very quickly get loud and crowded. We have neighbors. Many neighbors.
* ""Tomorrow"" (aka when she wants everyone to come over) is the move-in date for both my roommate and me. There will be boxes and stuff everywhere. You're planning to bring in nine FAMILIES -- not people, FAMILIES -- on top of that?
* This apartment isn't even mine. I'm sharing it with someone else. If it was a single apartment, I'd invite everyone over, whatever. As it is, I'm happy with having my parents, and maternal grandparents only. Not them, plus NINE aunts and uncles and their families. Like what the hell.
* Keep in mind, I've never met my roommate. Way to make a first impression --

Mom promptly forgets the first three reasons and focuses on the third. ""Oh, so you care more about some kid you've never met than your own family? You care more about appearances than what's really important!"" (Keep in mind, SHE was the one accusing me of making her ""lose face"" in front of my aunts and uncles...) ""When you get married, are you going to forbid your relatives from coming over because your wife said so?"" Her logic was that, because the apartment was shared, it was mine too, and therefore I should get to do whatever I want. (That's not how sharing works.)

* First of all, by the time I marry, it's likely that my wife will have already met my family, and gotten to know them in gradual increments. This roommate of mine has never met me and now you want my whole extended family to flood the apartment all at once?
* Can I remind you that ""tomorrow"" is the move-in date? As opposed to this hypothetical situation with a hypothetical wife, with whom I will be hosting this hypothetical housewarming party AFTER the moving is complete and everything is packed away?
* I point out that when I get married, my duty will be to my children and wife before them. As she has consistently reminded MY FATHER of that fact, every time there's a mother-in-law/daughter-in-law dispute.  Like, you can't tell my dad that he always needs to side with her when she's arguing with paternal grandma and then tell me I have to take her side when I'm married...

&amp;#x200B;

It takes her about another full hour of lecturing before I finally hit the proper analogy to get her to fucking understand that this isn't me ""disrespecting my family"" but me ""being considerate to other people"" and ""exhibiting common courtesy"", and that she should probably think about others outside of those directly related to you as well.

* Mom, how would you feel if X (my roommate from another thing, who my mom distrusts because she's a closet xenophobe) brought their whole goddamn family over on the day I was moving in?

""...that's different, your rooms there were all tiny and ugly, I wouldn't invite anyone over -- ""

* But you would be annoyed, right? In fact, you'd be downright furious if X pulled something like that. It's one thing to invite over a couple people who are directly involved in helping you move in, but the whole family over just to gawk? Why are you so obsessed with this particular apartment, when you've never cared about where I lived before?

""Those were just temporary rooms, though! This is your first real apartment."" (Not true. Last year I did a different summer internship, and I was in an apartment there, also with a roommate. Difference? Merely the property values of the respective neighborhoods. Hmmm. I think I'm on to something here.) ""What are you talking about? No! This isn't showing off! This is you sharing your good fortune with the rest of your family. Your family wants to come over because they are proud of you and they want to congratulate you for your success!""

Bull. Shit. You were the one who invited them over, mother. They were happy for me. They were fine with showing this happiness verbally. They were pleased to be invited over, but didn't care if they weren't, because they already had other plans! Jesus Christ.

I forget exactly what I said or maybe it was what my dad said, that she finally shut up, but I know she fizzled out around 1am after a few more weak attempts at a rebuttal. I know I did end up inviting the family over at some point, *after* I'd properly moved in and met my roommate, and in reasonable group sizes, not all at once.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, the argument was annoying and a total waste of time, but compared to some of the other stuff I've seen on here it wasn't that bad. Looking back, I find it rather comical. Probably because I know that at the end of the day, it's mostly bluster -- she gets super weird about shit that doesn't matter all the time, but she's not deliberately abusive."

========

Hey everyone! I have troubles into finding where I can fit. 

The context: I did my undergraduate in Electrical engineering and this year I pursue a Master in Operations Research. 

I did not have opportunities to make internship during my undergrad, so I am pretty inexperienced and I don't know what to do for my future career path. 

Until now, I wanted to work in finance, mostly because of high salary and prestige. But I have no experience whatsoever in finance, no knowledge at all. On top of that, I have to apply for internships very quickly this month or the coming ones, as financial institutions recruit very early. And I don't know to which specific financial position I should apply. 

I would go for quant position, but the career evolution seems very limited and I am not so good in programming (I know some Python, but no c++).

On the other hand, I could specialize in data science/data analytics in my current program, and I think there is no trouble finding job in that field. 

I think I am interested in these fields I mentioned before (finance/data science), but still as they are totally new subjects for me, I am not sure if I would like to work eventually in these industries.

So, I worried about what should I do right now. Could you please give me some advice ?"

Hi reddit.

I'm currently in my third year of undergraduate studies at my university, and lately I've been catching myself constantly thinking about what my future is going to look like after graduating. I'm going for a degree in Business Administration and my major right now is in International Business, but I am thinking about adding a 2nd major such as Transportation &amp; Logistics in order to beef up my transcript and give me more room to branch out. 

One thing I know for a fact is that I want to work overseas in Asia for at least a decent period of time, more specifically in either Japan or Korea. Unfortunately I have come across two glaring issues, I live on the east coast of the United States, and I still have made no commitments when it comes to going down specific career paths. Two job ideas that I have thrown around in my head are being a Business Analyst, and doing something along the lines of being in Import/Export Management. As for both of these jobs, there is definitely no shortage of openings for domestic positions of these jobs, as my city (Jacksonville) is a port on the east coast and deals with a lot of trade/commerce. 

I still have a great deal of things I wish to accomplish in these last 1-2 years of my time in college, including doing study abroad in Asia as many times as I can for experience/networking, as well as doing an overseas internship if I am lucky enough to grab one. Later on I also want to see if I can manage to do some research (preferably in analytics) with a professor in order to gain some professional experience that I can add to my transcript.

Am I thinking too far ahead when it comes to making these kinds of decisions? I have been told by advisors that I should just focus on my classes for now and take enough time needed to come up with these plans, but I can't stand having all these unknown variables in the back of my head. I'm not necessarily trying to rush anything along when it comes to this, I just want to have some sort of cohesive plan as to how I'm going to accomplish this (it would also be great motivator).

I welcome any kind of advice that you would have, including any suggestions as to what I could do NOW that would put me in a better position to get a foot in the door when it comes to these types of jobs. 

Cheers!

So basically, I just graduated back in may from my masters in computer engineering, and before that I was doing my bachelors. I studied machine learning and computer vision courses in graduate school, but ended up accepting a job in hardware design that paid well for when I graduate. I have been at this hardware job for about 2 months. Recently I have had regrets because my passion is in computer vision and machine learning and want to switch to a job in that field. So for the last month I have been applying to jobs in computer vision and machine learning and data science hoping my experience from grad school (courses, projects, a little bit of research) would be enough to get a full time job, but a lot of the entry level jobs say they want 5+ years experience. I just have been applying to everything I could find even some internships. I have applied to maybe 150 jobs so far, and I only recently got a job offer for an internship doing computer vision. the internship doesn't pay as much as my current job, my hourly salary would drop like 30%. I also have health benefits at my current job. I am young and have a lot of time to build my career, but I don't know what the best option at this point is. I am also about to interview for a full time ML job at a different company, but if I don't get that job I would like some guidance on what the smartest thing to do is. I am worried if I don't take this internship, I could just keep applying to ML jobs but what if I really need the experience first? I have no internships related to machine learning so far, and no industry software development experience, only hardware design. Please let me know what you think! Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Currently at full-time hardware engineering job with high pay, wanting to switch careers to Machine Learning/ considering leaving job for Computer Vision internship for 30% less pay to get job experience in machine learning for resume/future job opportunities, I want to know what you think, if doing this internship would be worth taking the pay cut in order to advance my goals towards doing machine learning full time."

In fact, I can't really even get an interview. I started searching in the early spring, wasted my time interviewing with a startup I met at the campus career fair, got an offer, negotiated a salary, had the offer rescinded when they sent me a contract with a salary about 30% lower than we had agreed and I questioned them about it. Since then I've applied to literally every entry level position I've seen on every job search site and job board that I know of. I've contacted two different placement agencies, one of which got me an interview, but I didn't get the job. I've went around to different company websites searching their job listings and applying if I feel I might meet even 10% of their qualifications. I've expanded my search out of the city and state and I still can't even get the time of day from employers. My resume goes off into the void without any indication of whether or not they've even seen it. 

My internship was somewhat tangential to the field and provided absolutely no relevant experience, but like a dumbass that needed to get his fix of not being broke, I took it. I look for entry level positions, which seem very few and far between, and most of the time I don't meet even the most basic of requirements for the job, i.e. I don't know front end frameworks, .net, Objective-C, etc. I'm in the process of trying to learn some of this stuff. I apply anyways. I tailor my resumes to the position I'm looking for. I've had my resume reviewed by several people, including the placement agencies, to get advice on how to improve it. I realize this is probably the most important thing when competing with dozens of other people for a single position. 

I feel like my CE degree and my coursework isn't enough to get me a hardware job because I had to take a bunch of CS classes and it isn't enough to get me a software job because I had to take a bunch of EE classes. I'm a jack of both trades, master of neither. I graduated with a 2.8 GPA, and whoever keeps saying companies won't ask about GPA is a damn liar. They do. Some even ask for transcripts. That doesn't stop me from applying though.

So my question is mainly to CE or CS graduates, but also anyone who's experienced this, which I presume is quite a lot of people. How did you find your job? Where did you look? What were you doing wrong in the first place? What did you end up doing right? Or else, where is the best street corner to live on? I'm getting desperate here, folks. "

Does my degree level matter ? what i mean is that i have a BA and yes i know places like google want a masters in x but thats besides the point, after several years of experiance in developmeant does it matter if i have a level 7 or 8 ? or what the degree is in ? if its engineering or CS since i know how to code and im reading books everyday like head first java, python(i dont know python yet ive done a net engineering degree),cracking the coding interview and clean code and coding to get better.

Another question i have is ,is there a point in me getting a level 8 in application developmeant ? im happy with learning on my own without a proffessor and once i get a job as a dev wouldnt it be better for me to stay there and move up and study myself rather then leaving after a year ? im very flustered with this because i want to do a masters in software developmeant later on but having to take a break from my studies for a year really bothers me and im not sure whats the best use of my time for this 1 year to help me achive my goals later.

I’ve done some research and keep getting conflicting answers on whether this could affect future career prospects. Would taking this role make it difficult to transition to a full developer role? I also worry that this role is either frowned upon or might be in danger in the future as companies push the developers to also do the testing on the software they write (both companies I’ve interned at have demonstrated this)


I don’t mind automated testing but I don’t know if this is the path for me. I’m also worried this could be the only employment opportunity brought to the table for once I graduate. 



What do you guys think? Am I over my head?"

I appreciate everyone's time, considerations and advice that they may provide to my question. 

I am a year out of school, graduated from a top 50 business school. Now, I live in NYC. I am working in a sales role for a large health insurer. I have been doing some research, and talking to people my age in those finance positions listed above, and want to make a change. I am all for long hours and every day work. 

**I am interested in what the best ways to start a transition and break into the industries are.** 

About me:

I haven't had any finance internships. I bar tended in a high volume club through school, fund raised $10,000 for planned parenthood through street canvassing one summer, started a company and pitched it for a $20k prize we received, led a large club at my university (event planning $1M budget) &amp; started and ran an innovation and entrepreneurship festival at my university too. 

The internships I did were for a well known non profit and health care company.. both on the operations side.

I studied Management Information Systems and Economics.

I appreciate your time reading again. Thank you. I look forward to the advice and conversation. "

And while much of it is true, I think it’s unnecessarily bleak and may discourage intl students who are pursuing or thinking of pursuing CS degrees in the US. Some guy literally said in his post that “No US companies are willing to sponsor international students”, which is an outright lie. I think it will be good to have some sort of balance of opinions. 

I’ll start us off - I’m a senior. I interned at a mid-sized company last year, am currently interning in a giant company and have received a return offer to come back next year for a FT role. I also have 3 interviews coming up for full-time roles. I am an international student - and from a mid middle class background in my home country,  which would translate to a lower middle class family here. I’m on an almost full-ride scholarship. Came in with zero experience in CS, but had a strong Math background. 

There are many stories like mine from people around me. Curious to hear if there are any in this subreddit too. "

It's way more advanced than I was expecting and I guess I should have been practicing over the Summer, but was busy was an internship.

Our first assignment is due a week from now, and we are ABSOLUTELY not allowed to work with any classmates, he could not stress that enough. We are currently learning classes and objects. I really need some refreshers on C# in general (complete beginner videos would help) and then in depth videos on objects and classes would help a lot as well.

We have been living in UK for 2.5 years now and she has been struggling *a lot* to find a job for her. I'm quite depressed as we sent over 100 applications this year but we only got 1 interview.

She holds an M.Sc. in law from an Italian university and her thesis has been focused in finance/business analysing a large set of data to show some connections between Quantitive Easing and bankruptcy filing in a specific region of Italy.(more details if needed)
She has been a professional singer and an event manager for approximately 15 years. She speaks good English which she has learned here in the UK.

She - unfortunately - does not have any professional experience here in England as she has been unable to even find an internship or any other work other than being an admin assistant at Marks and Spencer. 

She is of course looking for a junior position in - substantially - any field that allows some career development. 

Can any body give us some advice? At least at what to look at? These years have really taken a toll on her and I would be delighted to see her working at least in an entry level position.

I can of course post a CV.

Thank you all in advance."

Quick summary: My undergrad was in Computer Engineering with a specialization in VLSI, Electronics and Digital Logic. I prematurely applied for Master's in Electrical Engineering (this department has more focuses towards digital design) because I didn't find work right away and now I'm in my 2nd semester of grad school. Funny enough, at the end of the 1st semester (this spring), I started an internship locally with a fairly big company over the summer and am now working there part-time, basically waiting for me to graduate so they can get me on full-time.

After working there however, my interests have broadened even more and I'm unsure on what to look into. I'm still debating on doing a Thesis so I'm in a directed study class for the semester to research potential topics for a thesis (those who do the non-thesis route at this University are required to do a directed study anyways so this covers my base if I decide to stray away from a thesis). Obviously if I do go down the thesis route, this directed study class can be looked at as a preview/prelude to the topic.

My interests include FPGAs/VHDL/Verilog projects (or getting into UVM verification), ADC-DAC, audio/image signal processing, power systems, and digital communication (systems). I'm still brainstorming topics as my adviser hasn't really given me much to look into. Really, I find a lot of these topics interesting but I'm having a hard time narrowing down topics.

I'm going to informally meet with other professors within the department to help filter some ideas later this week as well.

Any suggestions to help narrow down my scattered brain would be grateful!"

I graduated in December, and then took a few months off where I did pretty much nothing.  I saw it as my own little summer vacation, but that time off is really hurting me now, and I completely regret it.  I've spent the last few months doing personal projects, and I'm even developing an app for free for a local business to try to get experience for an Android developer position.  Although I took all that time off, I've been working my hardest since then to prove that I'm passionate about programming.

I've had a few close calls with jobs, almost got one at Microsoft through a recruiting service and another for the Navy, but recently I have gotten no serious offers in Seattle which is where I want to work.

The only offers that I get now are from companies like RJT Compuquest and Revature.  Basically the deal is I go to some big city like Chicago and train for 6 weeks before they send me anywhere in America.  I would have little to no control over where I get sent, and for the most part these companies get poor reviews online.

Its incredibly rare for me to see a job posting in Seattle where they take on people with little experience.  I did an internship in college, and I've been doing all I can the last couple months to get experience, but even ""Entry Level"" positions in Seattle want at least a year of professional experience.

So am I stuck?  Do I have to bite the bullet and get sent to some random city thousands of miles from everyone I know?  My plan was to hold out and get a job in Seattle, but I'm really feeling the pressure of not having work."
9fb4yt,12,2018-09-12,Part 3 - So your AP thinks they know what is best and you should be a doctor? I bet they don't know shit.,GyopoSonDad,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/9fb4yt/part_3_so_your_ap_thinks_they_know_what_is_best/,"[Continued from Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/9fb0uu/part_2_so_your_ap_thinks_they_know_what_is_best/)

1. You may be replaced by a physician after all that
   1. In NYC last  year primary care salaries DROPPED by 2%.
   2. A lot of these jobs can be done by Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistance. Shorter school, shorter training, can handle 85% of the job, and work for a lot less.
   3. So if a doc wants to keep working? Lower salary. Market pressures. Why hire you when an NP can do most of the same job for less?
   4. So why subject yourself to longer residency and fellowship? I would HOPE due to interest, passion, desire,but the sad truth is that an increasing motivator is that the idealistic young person who decided to become a doctor, serve the community, be a family doctor is likely being motivated to add 3-5years of training for financial reasons. Student debt, later house, kids, spouse, alimony…it adds up. You might have been a lot better off in PA school. Somthing like over 50% of surgery graduates go on to do fellowships and huge numbers of Pediatric and Internists as well
   5. Take a look a this. [https://www.onemedical.com/nyc/physicians/](https://www.onemedical.com/nyc/physicians/) You can find all sorts of articles about them. Patients like them. See what percent are not MD's? When they first started, they had pretty much nothing but MD's. Is the percent of staff that are MD's going up or down? You get one guess.
2. In three years, you may be cold rice
   1. Unwanted, time to get something fresh.
   2. Remember your first contract will be 3 years max.
   3. Usually they have a ‘we can terminate you at will and without cause.’
   4. So at 3 years, you are up for an annual raise? But it’s cheaper to hire a fresh grad for less. You said, you know you should get paid more, and you want to get a house, maybe a boy/girlfriend, marry, have kids, need more money, you go try to ask for a bigger increase on your contract renewal and -Boom! Backfire. New grad works cheaper. Doesn't matter your experience, there is no gratitude for the work you did, your results. That's not how the modern business of medicine works. A warm body fills 99% of the requirements.
   5. See ya, wouldn’t want to be ya! You’re out looking for jobs with your student debt, family in tow. Has happened to many of my friends. Different market conditions in different parts of the country of course.
   6. You see, just having a warm body in that job is more important than your uber skills, 4.0  GPA, and all that. So what was it all for?
   7. Some private practice groups eat their young. They hired you intending to use you for cheap (relatively) labor and replace you for someone more naive, cheaper, younger, cheaper.
   8. Welcome to  your new job! And 3 year contract. With termination without cause clause. Hire a lawyer, get them to do lawyer things. Good luck - they aint' ever getting that clause taken out. Or the non-compete saying when you leave you can't work WITHIN 100 MILES of them.
   9. Your high paying, super specialized, very prestigious specialty may only have one job, far, far away from your parents and you may never live close to them again
   10. Great, so you became a pediatric surgeon, which can be as hard as starting out as a pilot and becoming an Astronaut. How many do you think every city needs? Not a lot, it turns out. But there’s a job in West Virginia. That’s not far from So Cal, right?
   11. Friend of mine married a woman training to be a pediatric nephrologist. She finished, and the only job she could get despite being in the top 1% all of her life is in Phoenix because that's the only place looking for a new doctor in her specialty at that time in a place she would even consider living in. Good bye New York! Green Acres, here we come!
   12. If you want to do primary care or a low competitive (relatively, considering what you had to do to get even that far) you have more choices. You're also in the lowest paying specialties, and lots of places are replacing you with NP's and PA's.
   13. Then your AP berates you for being ‘just’ an internist, why you not heart doctah like my friend's son, he drive Porsche, not 10 year old Honda I buy you still! You can’t win, can you. Can't compete against the electrophysiologist who was willing to train twice as long as you.
3. The financial aspects are not simple as ""make a good living and lots of money"".
   1. I think I covered a lot of it. The costs of interviewing. Student debt, of course. Here is from the U of Maryland website resident salaries. The money actually comes from the Governtment, so they are pretty uniform.
   2. Also, 200K goes a lot farther in the sticks than it does in Manhattan, LA, etc. Don’t think you get paid more to live in a high cost of living area. If anything, you may end up working a lot harder and longer hours to be able to afford to stay there.
   3. This is actually very complex and depends on your actual job situation, which I won’t get into.
4. Your parents may later actually envy their friends who have kids who pursued other (and often more lucrative) careers and have kids already.
   1. The money for training comes from Medicare, so the numbers are pretty much the same everywhere, give or take. Don’t’ expect to be reimbursed moving expenses or given a loan for a deposit on an apartment. What, they don’t have student housing? Nope. How’s your parents credit score, can they cosign your lease? Because you're almost 30, have a shitty credit score and no pay stubs to prove you can afford that studio apartment.
   2. From the University o Maryland, this is going to be pretty consistent across the country:
   3. Salary for 2018 – 2019 is listed below.  A reasonable cost of living increase can be expected for 2019-2020.
      1. Note: some years there won't be a COLA! 1-3% increase. It depends on inflation, stuff like that.
      2. PGY - post graduate year after medical school
      3. PGY1 - $54,321.00 (intern year), if in single in CA, your take home is $41K. You are working an 80 hour work week. **That’s $13/hour pre-tax, under $10/hour post-tax. You would be making more money with less stress working at pretty much any other job..**
      4. PGY2 - $56,978.00
      5. PGY3 - $59,603.00
      6. PGY4 - $62,053.00
      7. PGY5 - $64,473.00
      8. PGY6 - $66,620.00 (fellowship)
      9. PGY7 - $68,915.00
      10. PGY8 - $72,346.00
      11. Some training may take you beyond 8 years...you're stuck at 8.
      12. Research years may not count as PGY, so you may go into the lab after year 2 or 3, then come out as a 3 or 4.
      13. Vacation
      14. Interns: 4 weeks of paid leave/year (3 weeks between June 24 and June 23 of the following year PLUS an additional week of vacation June 24-30 for those interns remaining at UMMC)
      15. Residents: 4 weeks of paid leave/year.
      16. Be advised that you may not be able to defer loan repayments during residency.

Hi! Sorry if this is a read but I have to find some reassurance/guidance on my situation.

Long story short: Recently graduated from a respected university with a degree in New Media &amp; Technology (a lot of HCI) and a minor in CIS. Unfortunately, due to my parents not being the most wealthy people (no ill will I love my parents very much), I had to work full time throughout college which elongated my time spent their (graduated at 25) and had no time for internships.

Fast forward to now I graduated over the summer (YAYYYY!! finally) and got a job working on the IT Service Desk for a major retail company's HQ in the city I live in (jawdroppingly amazing campus, great benefits, etc).

My question is: Am I on the right path? Ultimate goal is to land a nice SysAdm job or find myself in a engineering/development team but when I look at my coworkers on the desk, some of them are still in college or aren't very technologically inclined. I have talked to many people in the IT department here (pretty big department) and a lot of them said they came from the service desk. I fully understand the grind and understand that I am entry-level due to not having any internships but I just want to make sure I am not wasting time in this position when I should try and get an upgrade or different set of responsibilities.

I know money doesn't buy happiness but my whole life I have had the anxiety of looming bills and my immediate goal is to become salaried and make at least 40k a year (If I get that I will literally call my mom crying). The pay is decent \~$18/hr with great benefits so it's not like I am not grateful for the job, it's more of I like what I do (IT, server maintenance, troubleshooting, writing/executing scripts, etc) but I don't love my specific role right now (taking calls, making tickets, etc). I would love to stay with this company and move over to their engineering and/or development team but I just don't want to wake up in 2-3 years and realize I was doing the wrong thing to get there.

Any and all advice or just comments would be eternally appreciated!!

I have a 3.3GPA and one internship in which I did really well for a decent sized company. I've posted my resume here a few times and had some friends look at it too. 
I just can't seem to even get an interview for anything. I've applied to maybe 40-50 places entry level or any job I fit their requirements. Yet I've only had ONE even call me, to which I never heard back from again.
Are jobs just not an option for December college grads, or am I being too hard on myself? I've exhausted all the companies I even care about and have moved on too anywhere that'll just hire me. I've even considered just taking another internship because of my struggle for a job.
I guess this was kind of just a big rant and sorry if I sound whiny, it just SUCKS. "

I am an SE student and every waking moment of my life is a hell of stress because I can't catch a break from schoolwork. My only real break is winter break because I have work during the fall and spring breaks and I have an internship during the summer.

I hear that ITSS is way easier and will let you get an IT job. However:

Since ITSS is very obviously less rigorous and less intense, it will certainly reduce the number of job opportunities I have.

Have any of you switched from CS/SE to ITSS? Can you share your experiences and why you did it? Would you recommend?

Almuni input who got jobs with their degrees is especially appreciated."
9fdbt5,2,2018-09-12,Need advice - student on an internship (Ontario),throwaway08927593253,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/9fdbt5/need_advice_student_on_an_internship_ontario/,"Hello everyone,

Random Canadian student who wants to remain anonymous here. I just wanted to field some advice for my current financial situation, as I'm looking to try and use/save my money in the best possible way for a student like me. To preface, I'm a University student in Ontario with credit card debt (which I'm looking to pay off) and a few years left in my program.

Right now, I'm slated to earn a little under $2200 a month (after taxes), for a total of \~$8750 by December (when my internship might end). Though it might not sound much, there's a few things in play here that will allow me to save up a considerable amount of money (I think).

Here are the list of expenses I've got so far (on a monthly basis):

* $250/month for commuting (e.g., local transit + 'regional' buses).
* $150/month for gas.
* $170/month for car insurance + phone bill.
* $200/month for personal expenses.
* Total = $770/month in total.

Now, aside from the car insurance &amp; phone bill, these numbers are rough estimates. They will likely be lower IRL (especially the gas $$$), but I'm estimating higher just in-case. **If you think I'm underestimating or overestimating my numbers, please let me know**. You've probably noticed that I haven't listed rent or food. This is because I'm living with family right now, and they've got me covered with housing and food.

These expenses aside, I'm looking to save for the following:

* A rent fund for when I go back to school (\~$600/month).
* Textbooks (\~$75/month).
* Paying back my credit card (\~$250 a month).
* Total = $925/month in total.

After all of this, **I'll have around \~$500/month left**, which I'm looking to put into a savings account. I've been told some conflicting things over where I should save this money, be it with my current financial institution or with a firm like WealthSimple. I remember reading something here about starting up a TFSA with WealthSimple, but I'm unsure as to which option would be best.

To add to this, I was curious over whether or not to put the other savings (for rent in the winter and textbooks) into the same account as the money above. I've been told that it could be a viable option, given that it should earn more interest compared to just the $500/month. However, I'm not the best with financials, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

Finally, there's some wildcards in play here in terms of sources of income. For one, gifts from relatives. This may sound like a joke, but based on past history, there's a reasonable chance I will receive up to $400 in cash from relatives. Second, is my vacation pay, which should be around \~$350. The reason I mention these is because of the fact that there are two ways I can use this money- one is to lump it with my savings, and the other is to use it to pay for a rust repair job on my car that I've been putting off for a while. The rust isn't too bad (my car has the rust undercoat), but given that it's literally the only spot (around the rear right wheel), I'd like to get it removed. I was considering adding this to the expense, but again, these other sources of income should be able to pay for it.

**Some final points before I do the TL;DR:**

* There is a likely chance that I will stop paying for gas in my car after October.
* In the past, I've paid a lot less than $600 for rent (all utilities and all that included), so there's a chance that I might be able to take some of the money and place it elsewhere.
* I technically have a job lined up for the winter, paying minimum wage (is $15 in January or is that not a thing anymore?).

**To sum up, here are my main questions:**

1. **Is my budget too conservative or do you think there's still some places I can save money?**
2. **Where should I put my ""main"" savings (the $500/month)? Would a TFSA (e.g., with WealthSimple) be a good idea? Should I leave it with my bank (Scotiabank)? Or, is there an alternative?**
3. **Where should I put my ""additional"" savings (the rent and textbook money)? Lump it with the ""main"" savings or their own account?**
4. **How should I use the money (\~$400 at the minimum) from my relatives and my vacation pay? Lump it with my ""main"" savings or use it to fix the rust on my car?**

Also, this is a miscellaneous question, but what's a good age to start contributing to RRSP? I'm just curious- I have no intention of contributing to it yet, given that it might be useful in the future for lowering my tax bracket."

I have applied to 4-5(can't remember exactly) new grad position, got 1 phone interview but the hiring manager lost interest as soon as I told him that I still have 3 months in school. got 2 rejections letter saying not a good fit.

I've taken a couple of classes and am not really sure how to structure a traditional resume in a field that seems to focussed in on experience and ability over traditional metrics of degrees and former positions (though those obviously help). 


As someone looking for a few paying gigs in web development, if not a paid summer internship (that would be the dream right now), how can I make myself presentable to employers outside of being my polite personable self with basic webdev knowledge who wants to expand their skillset? "

I'm a recent grad and want to prove to my team that I bring ambition to the table and want to increase my little value to my company.

So far on average it can take most of a day to setup one user and majority of it is repetitive tasks. Heres the process of setting up a new user.

1. Copy similar user on AD and begin creating the new user with information provided from the on boarding form.
2. Create mailbox on exchange
3. Image laptop using PXE Boot with WDS
4. Boring repetisse tasks (Turn off cortana, select key board, change time zone, update each driver manually (the worst), domain join, sign into user account, make a few more mundane changes (you get the idea)

My boss has given a lot of trust into me and I've brought up that I would like to some how automate some of these tasks. He's given me the green light and told me he will provide me with whatever I need.

I imagine im not the only one to think of this and someone has definitely applied and achieved this goal. Willing to learn and dive into whatever toolset that is required as long as its a step in the right direction."

The question I'm leading up to can be read at the bottom, but I thought some context might be needed.  

After being an engineer for two years, in a state where weed is legal (relevant), I realized I hated the engineering I was doing. After some serious consideration I determined that I wanted my career to be in the world of big data. I started learning R, python, sql, basic machine learning, going over old stats and linear algebra etc... and incorporate these things into the engineering position.  I managed to create some cool projects that definitely made my resume more appealing.

Eventually I quit the engineering gig and got a nice unpaid internship for a few months. I learned a lot and added some good stuff to the resume. I timed the internship's end with the end of my lease. This made my transition back home, to a large city where there were definitely opportunities, very smooth. Knowing that I might have to take a drug test for the upcoming job search, I stopped smoking a month prior to move. Well that wasn't enough time, I was still failing take home test at the 30 day mark. I thought ""oh well wont take much longer to pee good and plus, it's going to take a while to find a job"". Wrong. I moved home two weeks ago and since then I've made it to two final rounds and received offers from both jobs this week. 

Job 1 is at a large multi billion dollar company. Pay is eh. But the job will expose me to Hadoop and Airflow which will be a great feather in the cap. Plus Im surrounded by PHds and people I can network with. Definitely the more favorable position. It comes with a one year contract. Offer two is a startup. Pay is MUCH higher than job one. Environment is more fun. There is  more room for growth but the work is mostly SQL jockying. There is no contract. Offer one is definitely preferable but I'd be happy with offer two. Here's where my love of sticky green plant comes back to bite me

I had to take a piss test and background check for job1. I started peeing clean a 3 days prior to the test. peed clean right before and after the test. Obviously still not a sure thing. I did do my diligence,I found out the grade of test I'd be taking ( a cut off of 50ng/some volume) and got the same cut off level on the take home test. While I'm confident that I passed, it's not guaranteed. I will pass the background check and I SHOULD have the results early next week. Ive been told it may extend longer than that though, up to the end of next week. 

Job2 made me the offer tonight, I told them I was thrilled, love the company etc but it was a big desiccation. We set a call up for the middle of next week for me to accept or decline. There will be no background or drug test.

Best course of action is wait and see how everything plays out. But nah, Id like to get my plan ready now. 

What Im terrified of happening is, job1's test and check takes longer than expected, I decline job2, and then find out I failed the drug test for job one. leaving me with out a job. 

My questions is, how inappropriate would it be if I did the following: Accept the offer for job2, set the start date for the following week, and then rescind my acceptance later that week, prior to the start date, if everything clears with job1?"

9fe6yw,4,2018-09-12,Having trouble landing IT job,Brenglish,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9fe6yw/having_trouble_landing_it_job/,"Hello Reddit,

I sort of want to rant a little bit after another failed interview.. but also possibly get some pointers..

I am currently employed and have been at my current company for about 3 years. What I do right now is a little outside of traditional IT but does incorporate troubleshooting, and working out software and hardware issues, as well as working with NOC to help resolve network issues. I'm looking for a place where I can pick-up active directory skills, and networking knowledge. I have applied to entry level positions and been told I may be overqualified, but have applied towards a more mid-range position and been beaten by the competition so I'm not really sure where I stand.

I'm a big nerd at heart but also a very social person which I use to my advantage since many IT orientated people can be very socially awkward. I have been building computers since I was 10 years old. I generally do my own fixes, and troubleshooting for most of my electronics. At my current job, even though its not part of my responsibilities I go out of my way to be a sort of IT personal for the employees I have working under me. I personally enjoy the work, and it's something I have an interest in doing outside of my normal duties. I also did a complete systems upgrade on my own (15 stations). Because I am not the designated IT person I never really get to play around with servers, or active directory even though it looks simple enough. I've learn to unblock accounts, and set group permissions, but don't have advance knowledge of AD and what it's full potential is. Same with networking... I know how to troubleshoot basic problems, and where to begin, but more complex issues such as server migrations may be out of my scope.

The position was originally sold to me as an entry level Help Desk position, but ended up being more of a call center environment. I figured since I have no prior IT experience, I should at least use it as a resume builder before I started looking for a new job. 3 years have passed and I am currently a supervisor, with no hope of learning anything new or advancing my career arc. I have not received a single raise in my years of being here, except for my promotion which was a measly $1 more an hour for way more responsibility with no room to advance further. I have asked for a raise in the past, and was told ""this is what you agreed to"" but it wasn't like I had a chance to counter-offer. Since I currently am employed, I decided that I'll be a little more picky towards the places I'd like to apply to avoid the feeling of regret and wasting more years in a job where I am not working towards my future goals.

I been applying for jobs since the beginning of June putting in applications at places that attract me, I have been hearing back from a lot of places so I definitely feel like I'm doing something right. I've done a couple phone interviews, that have led to 2-3 hour long interviews in person. However, after I interview, I keep getting the generic ""we are still interviewing candidates so you should expect to hear back from us in 1 or 2 weeks if we decide to move forward""... with of course no one moving forward. I unfortunately don't have any certs, and currently pursuing a degree in CS. I feel like I maybe over-reaching or over-selling myself. My resume is not a lie, and I can account for everything I have put there, but for some reason my interviewers aren't impressed.

I am generally pretty honest in my interview, and state that what I do isn't 100% IT but I do many thing at work, and outside of work that closely match what they are looking for. I am also not afraid to admit that what I am looking for is more experience, and a place with room for growth where I can learn and improve areas where I am weak at. I feel I may be being too honest, and maybe should avoid talking about learning. I feel like this maybe a turn-off for employees and while everyone preaches to me learning opportunities, they seem to dislike hiring someone that doesn't already know everything they are looking for. I have interviewed for many well-known household names so its understandable to expect that the candidate pool may far outrank me but I'm reaching a point where I feel like maybe I should give up and try again after I have a couple certificates under my belt as well as my degree. My most recent (promising) interview was for an INTERNSHIP at a very well known clothing company, and I felt like I killed it (they even went as far as recommending I'd applied for the full position they had open; which I did) but no one reached back out to me and it's been a little over 3 weeks even though they said I should hear back in 2.

TL:DR: Been working 3 years in the tech field, have decent IT knowledge, have applied to internships, entry, and mid-range position, but never getting past the interview process. Wondering what I may be doing wrong.

I wanted to go to a competitive college then go to med school and then be a doctor for the rest of my life. Now, as an 11th grader, I realized that being a doctor just isn't for me. Instead what I'm really interested in is the same thing most kids these days are interested in. CS and ENGINEERING!!! I discovered a passion for those fields and I want to go to college for them. Yet the thing is I put myself at a huge disadvantage by bombarding my 9th-11th schedules with health science courses. Let me show you

  9th grade : Health 1
  10th grade: health science principles
  11th grade : Health science theory


Though that is only 3 classes, they all heavily dropped my weighted GPA a lot, and I could have taken courses I am interested in, such as AP computer science A and AP physics 1. 
I'm at a disadvantage this year because I'm not even in physics 1 so I won't be able to do physics 2 and C next year. I also won't be able to take Computer science 2 ( a class in my school ) next year, unless I self teach APCSA. And, largely, my GPA is suffering a major fall from my previous choices as I might not even be top 10% due to these 3 classes weighing my GPA down so much. Can I make up for this? Will I find a benefit? What do you plan I should do next year? I only get 7 classes a year. If I was to continue on the health track, it would be 2 full classes in my senior year next year of a medical internship, and I'm also doing marching band which takes up one class each year. "

9fer4k,4,2018-09-12,Should I quit my on-campus job or just reduce my hours?,tmrika,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9fer4k/should_i_quit_my_oncampus_job_or_just_reduce_my/,"(Pros/cons list + tl;dr at the bottom of post)

Warning: There's a chance I'm going to sound like a big overachiever here which might be braggy, but if it makes you feel better I'm definitely going to die alone so there's that.

So last February, I got an on-campus job. It's pretty chill, and my boss is nice and always wants to help you out, and I meet a lot of cool people through it. It's also a really collaborative role.

Two things, though.

This summer, I did a mix of a part-time internship downtown and continuing this job. I just found out today that my internship boss is interested in hiring me as a part-time employee during the school year. The internship has been a _lot_ more stressful and takes way more hard work and learning, but it's also an internship with a really really company where I get a surprising amount of autonomy. Plus it's relevant to my career, unlike my on-campus job, and there's always a chance the part-time might change to full-time when I graduate in June (not necessarily though, it kind of depends on a lot of factors, not just my performance). 

So here's the deal. I want to accept the PT gig with my internship employer - it just makes so much more sense career-wise. But between classes and clubs (I'm a President of 1 and an officer of 2 others ^save ^me), there's just no way in God's name I can handle two different part-time gigs on top (the on-campus job is supposed to be 12 hrs/wk while this new job is 15-20, I decide).

In theory, I can ask my on-campus boss just to reduce my hours to, say for example, 6 hrs/wk (there are evening shifts available, so it's logistically feasible). That plus this new job would be about 21 hrs/wk, which isn't necessarily impossible. Just a lot. I could also just quit, but not only would I be quitting a job I genuinely like, but I'd feel guilty for dropping out so close to the school year.

**If I reduce hours:**

**Pros**: I get to keep a job a like, where I go to cool events, meet cool people, and have relatively relaxed shifts.

**Cons**: 21+ hrs/wk on top of a courseload (I'd be taking the minimum amount of units possible) _and_ my various club duties is a bit much. Not too much more than what I've done in the past, but still a lot.

**If I quit:**

**Pros**: Free up my schedule a lot more.

**Cons**: Experience the guilt of making my boss scramble 1.5 weeks before the school year trying to re-coordinate everything, and also miss out on a lot of really cool experiences.

**tl;dr**: I'm taking on a part-time job with my summer internship employer, but my schedule can't fit the workload of 2 jobs (12+15=27 minimum) plus my other commitments. I really love my on-campus job and the stuff I've gotten to do and learn because of it, so I don't know whether to reduce my hours to something that's slightly less intensive or just quit altogether.

Thoughts? What would you do? And thank you so much!"

Any advice or things I should watch for?,C1TonDoe,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/9ff7gv/interning_for_a_railroad_company_this_upcoming/,"I'm currently a senior studying Industrial engineering. I am supposed to be graduating this upcoming Spring, but I pushed it back one year because I was offered an internship position at Norfolk Southern and accepted it immediately. Reason why I accepted it because I was not able to get any internship positions while in college, until now (Couldn't resist to pass up on this golden opportunity to gain some real world engineering experience. Also I'm always fascinated by trains and how it works ever since I was a kid lol, and thought this might be an interesting and perhaps fun learning experience).

My internship's department is Strategic planning. From my understanding, the main responsibility of this department is to optimize rail load and track efficiency.

However, since my previous experience is in retail and ecommerce (I owned an ecommerce store while in college and was pretty successful.), I have no experience or knowledge on how the railroad industry works. None of my parents, relative, or close friends work in the railroad industry.

So my questions are:

1. What should I expect working for a railroad company like Norfolk Southern?
2. What can/should I do that will make me successful in this industry?
3. What are the things that I should watch out for?
4. How can I prepare myself from now until the first day on work? (Like softwares/skills I need to learn right now)
5. Say you are assigned an assignment, and you have to use a software that you never used before (Say coding in C++ or Java for ex). What will they say? Do they just expect you have these skills before you even got this job or they have some type of training program for people that doesn't know how to do something?

Thanks so much"

IT major here who works 2 jobs. One is being a server at a hotel full time and the other is at my internship which is part time. I like both my jobs and it gives me a lot of financial freedom to where I don't really worry too much about money. I'm full time college and pay out of pocket for my classes. I have Object Oriented programming, Internet Applications programming, Computer Ethics, and Discrete Math. I find myself struggling with discrete math. I don't really understand anything, failed all the quizzes so far, and the test is tomorrow that I don't even feel remotely ready for. It's really unlike me to struggle this much with a class but no amount of studying is helping me much at all and it's bad enough I'm constrained on time. I'm averaging 50-60 hours of working and I'm typically a laid back person so all of this has been killing me. Plus it's a morning class. Shame on me for that... \*facepalm

I also have some recent events that are coming about. I found out recently I'm going to be a father (baby on the way) and despite how happy I am, it has added a tremendous amount of stress on me since  I'm entering a new stage of life pretty early. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing since I know I can financially support it. But I feel constantly stressed, sleep habits suck, narcolepsy, haven't been to the gym in 3 months, and I recently had a couple of anxiety attacks for the first time as a result of my overall well being. It's to the point where my mom is genuinely worried about me every time we talk since she notices how mentally drained I am, which is a first in all my years of school.

I have never withdrew from a class before and it's pretty early in the semester for me to do this. My girlfriend suggested I should focus on my health rather than trying to power through being miserable. It's like I constantly feel my head is compressed as if my brain is overloaded. I admit that the lack of sleep has me worried because I don't want to crash on the road from falling asleep since I commute A LOT (probably 12-14 hours a week). I feel like it'd be better if I pushed this class into next semester and spend more time on my other classes, work, and preparation for my upcoming newborn. 

Any advice anyone can give me? Please and thanks.

I did an 8 week Summer Internship at a telecommunications firm in the City. I was hired as a business analyst but my role was basically coding throughout the internship. This was basically me having a brief and then running my own autonomous project. The work was mainly around SQL and BI tools but I surpassed expectations throughout my time there, the main input I made was reducing their reporting process time from 1-2 days down to a matter of 15 minutes. I was paid a low intern rate of £15k pa for this work.

I am now back at university doing a masters but I have received an offer to do some work for the firm on a consultancy basis 3-4 times a month, which would be good to keep gaining experience and some money.

They are yet to offer me a day rate but they have asked how much I am expecting, obviously, I don't want to miss-price myself. I clearly don't want a day-rate based off my old salary as I thought it was very low considering how much work I did. A colleague at the firm said accept no less than £300pd and my stepfather who does contract work in the City said that this is a good starting figure.

Any of you lot do day-rate work think this is a good ball-park figure? Cheers!"

# Background

&amp;nbsp;

2 years ago I graduated from university. 

&amp;nbsp;

Back then I used to run an online letting agency for international students in between my lectures. Here is [picture](https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/N1geO27cYqUrDh0sXfJu0jcYyG52/@Vinrob|964127afc3/runtotheoffice.jpg) of myself and one of the students I helped relocate!

The business was simple: Cold calling landlords, taking photos of their properties, put them on a Wordpress website, advertise the properties to the students and hand over the keys  when they arrived in town.

After not being able to grow the business and with revenues declining, I decided to exit the business and took a year off to travel and explore Africa. I did an internship there and travelled a bit around nearby countries and eventually flew to Asia.

Not having a job at that time I decided to launch a small productized service offering unlimited design work for a fixed fee per month. 

I bootstrapped it to $40,000 in MRR and decided to write to write a long post to explain how everything came along so sit back, relax and take a cup of coffee, this is big brain dump of everything that happened from the start until today!

&amp;nbsp;

# Lesson #1 - Find a good value proposition
---

The top priority of a founder of any business is to create value and to capture it.

&amp;nbsp;

Entrepreneurship is really just about that: Understanding market inefficiencies and correcting them. You get paid to make markets more efficient.

Being a Indie Hacker / Solo founder is great because markets change all the time, and one industry can have many new problems. Incumbents are usually too slow at realising that and that's where you have an 
advantage at being small and fast.

In that regard here are a couple of lessons I have learned:

&amp;nbsp;

a. **Finding the right problem to work on &gt; Having the perfect solution** 


I think this should be **top** focus of entrepreneurs. Instead of spending months to think about a solution, instead spend your time being an expert at a problem and really understand it. 

Back when I was running my real estate company I would often hire design services: I would look online for designers, gave them 50% in advance, and would struggle to write what I needed to get done. A bad experience both for the designer and I.

I usually fix problems that really bother me and that I would be passionate to work on. It makes me motivated to work and I can see the value in fixing them.

Here is how I found my idea, by just looking at the problems and really understanding them, finding a solution was easy.

&amp;nbsp;

The basic problem: I was unhappy with hiring designers only. 

Why?:

- 1. Lack of trust: Put a lot of testimonials on the website and a 10 days, 100% money back guarantee.
- 2. Poor communication: Empower clients and designers to communicate better via standardised offers and standardised briefs.
- 3. Expensive: Source designers in Asia to offer more affordable prices.

&amp;nbsp;

And voila: After laying out the key problems finding a solution was rather simple: 


Let's just create an unlimited design service, with a 100% money back guarantee, and a platform where it is a great experience to submit a brief.

&amp;nbsp;
          
# Lesson #2 - Validate demand as soon as possible
---

&amp;nbsp;

The problem when starting a business is that you can have many biases. Use mental models and recognise which biases you may have as as entrepreneur so you do not fall into mental traps...

... But at the same time, it is great to keep a little bit of hope as it helps you push forward. The realist person in the room though, is the market. So you have to put your product in front of that person.

&amp;nbsp;

**A. Starting a MVP**

I purchased a $10 CSS/HTML template and launched a quick MVP which basically comprised the following items:

- The portfolio pieces of designers.
- The price and a payment button 
- A FAQ page
- A chat.

&amp;nbsp;

**B. Putting that MVP in front of potential customers**

Once the site was up I naturally tried to get people to visit it.


My thought process was the following:  ""Who would be the most likely to be interested by those services?"" ... ""And how do I advertise it without spamming?""


I remembered I was a member of various entrepreneur groups on Facebook and decided that it would not hurt to ask for feedback. [Here is what I posted](https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/N1geO27cYqUrDh0sXfJu0jcYyG52/@Vinrob|964127afc3/Screen%20Shot%202018-08-02%20at%2018.33.59.png)

It worked: A few people purchased and I repeated it on about 10 other groups. That's how we got our first customers.

&amp;nbsp;    

# Lesson #3 - Marketing is all about understanding what your customers want and delivering that to them.
---

&amp;nbsp;

**A) Understanding our target market**


A lot of our initial customers were solo founders or entrepreneurs, which is great as we help them as we are relatively low priced but they churn after they get their initial design work done. Selling to established businesses on the other hand require more time but is more valuable over the long term.
Sometimes the customers who are the easiest to sell to are not your best customers

&amp;nbsp;

**B) Using different tactics**

When launching a tactic I usually use a spreadsheet and analyse what is high impact, confidence, and effort required and create a score and usually try the ideas with the highest score.
&amp;nbsp;

Here are a few tactics we used to find customers:


**Creating valuable and entertaining content**


| Pro   | Con 
|:-----------|:------------|
| Helps with SEO and to connect with your audience    |          Takes a long time |        

&amp;nbsp;


What we did: We crafted behind the scenes blog posts that entrepreneurs loved. They used our learnings for their business and some purchased our services after.


**Launch offers**


| Pro   | Con 
|:-----------|:------------|
| Easy to set up   |          Short lived |    

&amp;nbsp;

What we did: Every time we would launch a new subscription/product, we would discount it and add a quantity and time limit on it. It created a fear of missing out! You can also use this strategy to kickstart your startup or even pre-sell your products / services.


Here is an [example of a launch offer](https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/N1geO27cYqUrDh0sXfJu0jcYyG52/@Vinrob|964127afc3/prelaunch.png)

          
**Building an email list** 

| Pro   | Con 
|:-----------|:------------|
| Very effective if people see value in your emails  |          Takes time to build and you have to maintain the quality |    

&amp;nbsp;

What we did: Having an email list is the real estate of the Internet. It is like having your own mini monopoly. It is something you can own and that can be extremely valuable. We use our email list to communicate with our customers (and future customers) about updates, behind the scenes, etc.
We are quite simple in our communication. We provide real value. That's all.


Here is an [example of email I would send to customers](https://storage.googleapis.com/indie-hackers.appspot.com/articles/N1geO27cYqUrDh0sXfJu0jcYyG52/@Vinrob|964127afc3/Screen%20Shot%202018-08-02%20at%2017.05.13.png)

&amp;nbsp;

# Lesson #4 - Building a great team to help you scale

&amp;nbsp;

During the first month I worked solely remotely with the whole team via Skype. After one month I booked a one way flight to Indonesia.


My goal of going to Indonesia was mostly to understand the motivation of our designers better: They found the idea of having recurring income great and they also loved the fact that they were being paid twice a week (some of them had to chase their clients for their payment). 


Understanding motivations is key in setting up a team, because if the right incentives are in place, you can go much faster.


**My lessons on managing a team:**

1. Always set expectations, simplify things, and make a process for it (the book of Michael E. Gerber is great for that!)
2. Train team, invest in it. For us what worked really well is train by doing (problem-based learning).
3. Work is done or it isn't, do not be compromising. 


# Conclusion

1. Providing value is the foundation of business.
2. Finding a good problem to work on is more important than finding a solution.
3. As a service business we focused a lot on empowering our team (via connecting them) and then only setting up SOPs. "

This is due to the fact that we got the summer internship through some sort of startup/intern pairing program. Weird, I know.)

I accepted the offer, but now I’m left wondering about how I’ll improve my skills without some form of a software development mentor.

Now he’s upgraded my title to Director of Software Development, which I told him I was hesitant to accept because I don’t feel knowledgeable enough or qualified and I haven’t even graduated college. But I ended up doing so. 

I don’t see myself staying with this company for more than a year (unless it gets some respectable traction, of course), so if I want to move and try to get a job at an established company, how am I supposed to do well at one if I have this hefty job title and zero idea of how best to work on enterprise projects?

Anyone have similar doubts? Am I overthinking this? Curious to hear what you guys think. "

&amp;#x200B;

This Summer I had a limited DevOps engineering internship where I spent quite a bit of time learning about methodologies, but didn't implement a whole lot. Now I'm going to be starting a DevOps role for a company as their only DevOps engineer and I'm not quite sure what direction to go.

The company overall is very Microsoft locked-in, using VSTS, and then CI/CD for Azure (Web) App Service. The app is ASP.NET.  While in Azure App Service I'm not completely sure how to improve upon the process of the app itself or what the next step would be. 

What are the limitations to look for within Azure App Service? At what point should this application be blocked out to containers and managed internally rather than pushing this off to MS?

My first thought was to spin up a dedicated server for running a more customizable CI/CD tool like Jenkins and start to integrate better testing along the way.

This being my first position out of college and first major one in industry I'm struggling pretty hard with where to even begin, especially considering they seem to already have a basic foundation setup.

After sending hundreds and hundreds of applications, going to networking events, and going on a few interviews, all I was able to get was a temporary contract job at a very early stage startup. The founders and all 'employees' (really they are all unpaid college interns) are college students. Things are very messy, and they may or may not be able to get the funding to offer me a full time job. They won't know for another month or so. If this fizzles out, I could be back on the job hunt for an untold number of months and I am already just about completely broke (I live with my parents, but still not great).

On the other hand, a former co-worker is hiring for an account management position at a more legitimate company. The salary is okay (I was quoted 55k-65k base, and this is in NYC), but not as much as I would make as a successful software developer (where salaries in NYC range from 70k for entry-level to over 100k with experience).

So my question is: As someone who has been out of the workforce for a long time, should I keep trucking along with the very challenging field of software development (which has a high reward for success, but a very very high possibility for failure to launch) or accept a solid job doing something else which is stable, but may result in lower overall pay?"

I got interested in programming by joining a robotics team my 6th and 7th grade. I learned very very basic C and didn't touch code again until my freshman year. My during my freshman, sophomore, and junior year I dumped crazy amounts of time and dedication to learn how to code, make apps, solve computer problems, and everything else. I am now the two year running programming captain for a different robotics team(FRC for people who know) and recently got an internship at Simma Software, a company that makes safety critical software for simis and other industry products. (They deal with the can bus and things along those lines) 

The problem: Now that I am a senior and will be leaving the robotics team, since it's only high school, I need to teach new people how to code and people able to work on their own without help. (I'm the only one of the team who can code) The past year and a half or so I've tried to teach people how to code and get them started. I always have at least a dozen students who want to but in a combination of me not doing the best teaching and them realizing it's harder to get into than it looks or seems, people leave and do something else on the team. I know programming is kinda hard to get into with no experience; let's face it, the initial learning curve is hard. But I know I can do a better job making the process easier and introducing the right topics at the right time. The problem isn't me not knowing the material or people not liking me, I simple don't know the best way to teach, explain, and help newcomers into programming. 

Question: Anyone who is a computer, electrical, programming, or similar teacher, how do you make the task of entering such an initially challenging and complicated field as easy as possible for newcomers. What things have you noticed work well and don't. What should you consider when introducing a new topic. Where do you start so you don't overwhelm people with something super complicated and scare them off but also not be so dull and boring they loose interest. What should you consider when pacing topics to not go to slow or fast? Basically I'm asking for general teaching advise and tips for engineering fields since I'm running out of time to figure out on my own. 

Sorry this was long, I really appreciate anything anyone has to offer, whether a teacher or not. I know not everyone is initially as driven as I was to learn programming and I want to help inspire and teach other people who don't think they have what it takes to learn."

This took place literally a few hours ago and is still on going.  I knew it was coming, it terrified me, we continued it together, and are stronger/going to stronger for it.

I'm a coward sometimes.  I think we all are, but this time was different.  I lied for about 6 months.  Back in March, I became severely depressed, disenchanted with my degree, disenchanted with the future of working in an office (but dad was getting screwed at work , my fiance was constantly miserable with her work),  my school work suffered and I was going broke.  I stopped attending, made enough to for my own expenses by delivering for an Uber Eats type of service, applied for internships as if I were to attend next semester, and starting planning my own business.  I didn't tell my family or my fiancee.  

My fiancee is very gung ho about her college experience and how it's basically a necessity that I graduate in order to marry her.  In my fucked up headspace, it was either tell her now that I'm a failed my classes as a broker, fucked up, loser and have my engagement ring given back to me and be told to leave our house...or I lie and delay telling the truth until I can demonstrate I'm worthy of her.

It was the most difficult decision I have ever made, and I chose poorly.  I let my dread and doubt get the better of me.  I told myself I won't be lying for long, I'll work my ass off at my internship and prepare for my own business.  I'll address it to her and our families and prove I wasn't a total fuck up to myself and her.  If I wasn't going to be honest, she deserved that much.

I should have been honest.

The internship was a scam.  No, really, it was an actual pyramid scheme.  They weren't paying us back for supplies and travel expenses, they were finding every way they could not to pay us at all. I talked to my fiancee about it and I searched for a new job - hell, I got one fairly easily.  I confronted my boss into one final paycheck, and left with no notice to start the new place.  Half the summer was gone, I really needed to get this shit settled and come clean.

The past few weeks I refined my business idea and plan in my free time.  I worked, made a fair bit of money each week, and provided enough to be capable of contributing to our livelihood as well as did some grocery shopping for her parents.  All of this under the guise that I was enrolled, which I wasn't.  My parents had asked about what tuition would be this semester.  The day of coming to terms with the truth was coming and I was almost ready.  I just needed another day or two.

I wanted to do it last week, but she had surprised me with tickets to the Eagles game for our anniversary (I took us to a Kesha concert as my present to her), and I felt like shit.  I honestly did not feel like I deserved to go and expected this all to be over by now.  She mentioned how much the tickets were and it was too late to get fair value reselling them.  Anyway, I was doing a home improvement project that day and the hardware store had Eagles bumper stickers...figured I'd get one to cheer up.

Today, I wake up and instead of going to a class I went to the Wawa store to get some breakfast.  I had just finished and relaxing for a few minutes before I was going to go to a Starbucks and do some work when she pulled up alongside me.  I thought she was going into the office today, but she woke up late, decided to work from home, went to Wawa for breakfast and saw my car...it was definitely mine (even though it's a common model and color for our neighborhood) because of the goddamn Eagles bumper sticker I had just put on there.

I wasn't ready to be confronted, I wasn't ready to do any confronting.  Doesn't matter.  I never should have thought about being ready, I just should have been honest to begin with.  We spent the entire morning talking about it, I came clean.

For the time being, we are still getting married in January.  I'm going to take time off from school and finish in due time.  I'm going to take as many work hours as I can...even a second job if need be.  But she doesn't trust me and honestly I don't deserve this.  She's too good for me and is giving me a second chance.

It's off my chest and I feel less afraid.  Of course, there are concessions.  She's in control of finances.  I have to tread carefully and understand that a second chance doesn't mean I'm trusted or forgiven.  I don't want to be forgiven, I just want her.   I'll jump through every hoop, work 80 hours a week if need be.  I want to earn her trust and make up for the hell I out us both in.

Tonight, I'm apologizing to my parents and making a plan to pay them back for last semester.  I'm going to apologize to her parents who have treated me like their own son or better.  I'm not lying again in my entire life.  This was the most terrifying experience I have ever been through and ever anticipating being through, but if I can get through it and be honest during this then I can do it about anything else.

TLDR:. Don't lie to your fiancée.  It's not worth the risk of losing her.  Also, my fiancée is better than your fiancée...basically she's better than me in every single way.  She's my love, my best friend, my rock, and my inspiration to be better."

Hey, everyone!

So I'm looking for feedback on how to get back into the field. I'm trying to be as honest as possible here (both with you and myself) to really get a good idea of what I should do.

The hurdle I'm trying to overcome is that I've been out of the industry for about 6 years now, and I'd like to re-enter in whatever way I can. I understand it may take some time or maybe even some retraining. I'm just trying to get an idea of what that actually looks like, so hiring managers PLEASE chime in.

​

About Me:

I graduated in 2009 with my BSME at a 3.6 GPA, full-ride scholarship, worked as an intern for my scholarship sponsor. I then graduated in 2011 with my MSME (coursework only) at a 3.97 GPA while working full-time for my BSME scholarship sponsor. I loved the work there (R&amp;D for US Govt, secret clearance level) but the company has a paradigm shift and we no longer matched. In August of 2012, I left the company in pursuit of greater income. After that, I worked for six months at another R&amp;D company only to realize (in hindsight) that I had burned myself out. Well, come to find out years later, I was actually suffering from severe mental illness. Now I'm on medication for it, and things are looking up! So I'm ready to get back into the game :)

​

1. How can I put this 6 year hiatus on my resume in a professional way that will do the least damage to my hirability?  
During this time I traveled, worked part-time jobs in unrelated fields (usually service or sales) and worked on my own personal projects, so my skills are not sharp but they're not completely gone either.
2. Do I need to go back to school?  
I'm thinking as soon as I can, I'd like to pivot into something with more of a software development aspect to it, perhaps in robotics fields. I'm not sure if I need to go get another BS for that or if I just need to find the right company?
3. If you were interviewing me, what would you ask me about the 6 year gap? Would I even be considered? How can I salvage my career?

Thanks so much!"
9fkwno,2,2018-09-13,I suck at networking.,Fine_Communication,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/9fkwno/i_suck_at_networking/,"I'm in college and although my grades are great, I'm really shy. I don't speak in most of my classes and don't really have any friends. And I feel like this is making me fall short in comparison to my colleagues.

I come from a lower middle class family and we live paycheck to paycheck. I don't have any connections in my field and I'm having a really hard time getting an internship because of it. Since we don't have money, I can't pay for courses outside of college, so my resume is very non-impressive. Where I live, we usually don't have these courses for free and I'm trying to save up some money to take a few classes, but it'll take a while.

So anyways, I really want to start networking and trying to make connections. I think a good start would be talking to my teachers, but even that is a huge challenge to me. I read somewhere that in the US you have hours outside of class to talk to your teachers, but where I'm from, we don't have that. It's either you talk to them during class breaks or you don't.

There's a group of very outgoing girls in my class and they almost always receive all the attention from teachers since they're very social. For example, today one of our teachers spent all of his free time during class talking to them about an article he wants to help them write so they can join a contest in our field with it. I'd like to be a part of that, but there wasn't a lot of space for me to join the conversation -- or so I felt. This bothered me so much because there are the types of opportunities I wish I would get. But people tend to forget about me since I don't talk so much.

When I try to start a conversation, I'm super awkward. I just nod and stand there not knowing what to say. Especially with teachers, since I'm always super afraid of sounding stupid.

So how can I stop being awkward? I tried asking questions and trying to talk about books, but I never know where to go after that. Someone please help me, this is trying to affect my self esteem real hard."

I have spent the past several months writing and improving batch scripts that the company currently uses to run various tests on their printers. I have also been tasked with developing methods to backup their Windows 7 installations. 

To be clear, these are workstations used to test receipt printers that the company repairs and sells. They are connected to Windows 7 based POS style workstations that are most similar to the POS systems used by customers in the field. 

My boss has told me that the ultimate goal would be to automate the installation and configuration of these printers. At the moment I agree with him that this seems to be the best approach to future proofing our printer test methods.  He even suggested I learn python to do it not knowing I was already acquainted with python. 

As best as I understand, here are the design parameters:

**1.** Silent install device drivers (printers, adapters, etc)

**2.** Will continue after reboot if driver requires reboot.

**3.** Configures advanced settings on hardware COM serial port (baud rate etc)

**4.**Configures advanced settings on COM virtual serial port created by third party driver

**5.** Is able to detect which printers are online and send “print test page” command by user. Is able to detect changes in COM port settings. 

However, since this script will be used in a strictly windows environment, everything I have read indicates that Powershell would be the preferred tool to accomplish these automation tasks vs Python. Although Python could be made to do all the same tasks as Powershell with the appropriate libraries, it would likely mean extra work and complexity. However, there are a few caveats to the design parameters that make me think Python might be the better choice. 

**6.** The script will be maintained by Engineers not IT Professionals. So the chances are greater that the next person working on the program after me will have familiarity with Python and not Powershell. 

**7.** Although Powershell is more capable out of the box to handle Windows automation, Python may still be easier for another Intern to learn when they pickup where I left off. 

Although **6** and **7** have made me inclined to think that Python may be the best longterm tool for the job, especially since I can run Powershell commands from Python, there is one more consideration that has me worried my efforts would be in vain. 

**8.** The script has to be capable of being run as some kind of .exe or similar that will install all necessary libraries / packages for the script to work regardless of what is already installed on the computer. It can’t require anyone to install python and use pip to load a ton of libraries. 

Strangely, Since Win7 SP1 comes with a much weaker version of Powershell, I don’t see it offering a huge advantage in this case. 


Please let me know if I am on the right path in regards to choosing to pursue this project in Python.

I have since the age of 10 been dedicated to moving to Europe for work and to live permanently. I recently have doubled down on my efforts and would like some ideas on achieving this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Little About Me:

I am 19, American, no dual citizenship or family abroad. I am fluent in english, speak basic spanish, and am learning german.  I would like to pursue medicine in Europe as it is where I would really like to practice. I thought about completing my undergraduate degree in biology in the states with a pre-medical path then going to europe. I am currently in my 2nd year of university in the united states, my first year i studied Computer Network &amp; Systems Administration, then did an internship over the summer as a Network Engineering Intern. It was fun however I could not see myself doing it for the rest of my life and fear disinterest and burnout after several years of it. I find it fun to do these things on the side however. Then I transferred to a cheaper, more local school for biology with a pre-medical path. This is where I picked up my german class and truly enjoy the language. I would like to go to Europe as it would be ideal since I would like to practice there, however money is somewhat of an issue. The UK and Ireland have large international fees that scare me away as it would be troublesome to scrape together 20K+ EU per year in just tuition and fees alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I am willing to learn any language as I find them interesting and am a very dedicated person. I was looking at say France for schooling, due to the low tuition cost, and have debated on independently learning French while seeing a tutor to help accelerate my progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am open to all suggestions, and would probably like to work on the side to make some money and help pay for the housing. I figured this could probably be in the form of IT work, as that is what I currently do to help pay for my housing.

In summary I am looking for  options or changes I can make in order to get an entry level position as a Java Developer. Based on my history it seems that the end road might be joining a place like Revature or posibly giving up. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I need to get this out of my chest whether I get help or not, atleast is out there. It has been about 9 months now since I started my job search, I was very excited about it the first months, I though I was in high demand. After the first 3 months I made some drastic changes and learned alot in the process. I further focused on what I wanted to do and continued to redefine my resume. Ever since, I been keeping my head high, doing personal projects and continuously applying to places I feel qualified for. I made the change from C++ into Java Web Development since is something I currently enjoy and is in good demand for my area (NJ, NY). Fast forward to  9 months in, and I send around 160 applications to jobs I actually felt confident in qualifying for. Only around 5 have giving me an opportunity at the interview process, didn't pass 2 because of hackerrank challenges the others I was just ghosted or no reason was giving. I am really trying my best and just looking for a small opportunity in which I can further grow. Almost everyday I been using indeed, glassdoor, linkedin to apply but day by day is getting more and more depressing. Finding less jobs that I am qualified for, not hearing back from other applications, and feeling unlucky and a failure. I can't focus on the positives, because I feel incomplete without having a position let alone a career.  Aside from moving forward and finishing my degree, I don't known what else I can do to secure a position. I know the degree won't be the solution, because many are unemployed even after graduating. I am already up in age, so not only am I behind others at a junior level but it sucks that I am constantly getting neglected. Only places wanting to move forward with me are those where they provide training and bind you to a contract. Really trying to avoid heading in that direction, but the situation is getting really bad.

Here is my [resume](https://i.imgur.com/w5wsDEu.png) . I am targeting internships or entry level roles around Java Web Development in the NJ/NY area."

There were many factors that contributed to the decision: chronic illness, mental health, burn out, fed up with school admin, finances, etc. I have 90 credits in two different fields of study (engineering and psychology) and a 2.06 GPA. I do eventually want to get a bachelor's degree but that will have to wait until I afford school again. I just want to start working on paying off my student debt and getting my life in order.

The strongest points on my resume are my internships, but since they're all in engineering, I don't see how that will help me with a non-tech job (especially since I don't have a degree). (Not to mention all the acronyms).

The other trouble is almost all my non-internship experience is at the school from which I withdrew, bringing attention the fact that I definitely attended a school but didn't earn a degree. 

I would really appreciate help/advice on those issues specifically, but any thoughts are appreciated.

I put redacted info in italics. Thank you!

How to present this on my resume?",TBoarder,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9fm55e/failed_previous_career_in_retail_and_didnt_do_an/,"I'm trying to redo my current resume, as I am not getting nearly enough hits on it for the number of jobs that I am applying for.

My situation is weird.  I worked in retail for 15 years and was a near-complete failure at it.  I managed to hold onto an assistant manager position from 2002 until 2006, but after that it went downhill with stores closing, inability to find jobs when unemployed, taking a year off due to a health and life-transition issue, and my last two jobs being just bad (fired from one, the other being only temporary Christmas help before going to school full time).

Anyway, I really, really, really wanted to graduate as soon as I possibly could so I could get into the real workforce ASAP, and thus made the stupid mistake of not doing an internship.

I'm trying to figure out a way to put onto my resume that I have work experience and I'm not a total clueless idiot when it comes to having a job.  I'm wondering if something like this would even work:

&gt;Work Experience:  Multiple years in various retail positions, with responsibilities entailing sales, customer service, cash handling, and management

I'm looking for a software developer job as a computer science graduate with an okay-ish GPA, fairly lame projects, and lacking in some important languages and frameworks.  I'm just looking for a way to stand out just a little bit more, without also revealing that I'm 47 years old.  I may have sucked at all of those work experience skills that I listed, but I performed them to the best of my ability, understanding that they had to be done."

I graduated college with a business degree in 2017, and am currently pursuing my MBA. I was hired on in the marketing dept at the company that I interned for right out of school. I started at $50k, then with a small raise in January I now sit at $51,500. I was hired on at the lowest possible salary grade at the company. The frustrating part is that I know that the person that had my job before me sat at the grade above me, and the two other interns that were hired on sit at two grades above me. This was “not a reflection of performance, but the nature of each of the roles”. I was hired on first and beat out one of them for my current role, but two higher level positions opened up later that each of them got. 

I like the company that I work at. I get to travel a bunch, stay in beautiful hotels, receive gifts for my performance constantly, it’s fantastic. I adore about 20% of the work I do, and the rest makes me miserable. I recently picked up some pretty bad habits (smoking, overeating) and am back in therapy because of it.

I am the “go-to” for pretty much everything support related on the team and am operating well above my salary grade, which I can quantify based on my objectives and measures.

We recently went through a re-org and laid off three people. My responsibilities increased drastically, more than they already had. We have plans to hire more heads in Q1. I’ve made it very clear that my intentions are to move up within the company at this time. I was told there’s a possibility that could happen.

I have an interview on Monday with a local company, and I really think I have a good chance of getting the role. We’ve already discussed salary, and it would be in the high 50’s. While I do not believe I’m being compensated fairly for the work I’m doing, I do like where I work. Could I leverage a job offer into a raise? What are the risks associated with this?

I recently started working in my new job, in Graphic design in a small Marketing company that revolves around creating marketing strategies, developing websites, social media maintenance and other stuff like that. 
I started as an Intern 6 months later, they liked me and well enough they asked me to work on the team. Now, don't get me wrong, I get along really well with everyone at the company, super nice, positive, and I have a lot of respect for every one of them. But the problem begins right as I started working with them. We have a meeting, all of us, as we usually do every Monday morning, and our boss tells us we are in a financial crisis and because of some in work problems that have been amounting through time, from not responding to client email, to having bad work ethics and all those sorts of things, and have had a similar crisis before, and the way he dealt with it was pulling money from his own account and trying to wait it out. But this time was different, he had no backup money and unfortunately, the salary would have to be delayed, he was very honest with his approach. I was paid the first working month, but the second one was when the problem hit the team, I'm finishing the second week with no payment, and it's been super rough, not just because of the pressure we are putting up, but because I feel frustrated that I'm overworking over something I did not cause, at all, and I'm not even being paid! 
Now of course I understand it's not because he doesn't care or anything, It's not that type of situation, but I can't help but feel frustrated having to keep this up with this, the team is very determined to resolve this situation, and that's really the only part that gets me going. But I'm starting to feel really tired all the time, getting really fed up with everything, beginning to feel overwhelmed and I'm starting to feel impatient all the time, due to the lack of rest. 

My thing is, I respect them a lot and I know it's not something that anyone proud of and everyone is trying their best, but I'm going through a lot and I don't know when too much is too much. How normal it is to work without getting paid in this situation, or if I should quit and save myself the for getting overworked soo soon, wasting away my week for something I did not cause."

* I recently graduated from college and have been working at an investment bank in SF or \~3 months in the tech industry. I like certain parts of my job, but I can't see myself doing this as a career. A little about me:
   * No tech related internship experience
   * Didn't do any tech clubs, hackathons, or side projects while in college (I tunnel visioned on finance)
   * I work 11-14 hours a day
   * Graduated from top 10 university with degree in Econ and CS
   * Relatively basic coding skills for a CS grad, haven't made anything practical (like an app or website), worked only on class assignments
* Here's why I want to switch: I don't want to spend the rest of my life working for a corporation. I want to gain the skills of a SWE / Data Scientist and then work at a / start a startup or small business.

&amp;#x200B;

* Ok, here are some options I thought of (in order from best to worst IMO):
   * I could no-life it (even more than I already am) and self study / work on side projects after work for 2-3 hours on weekdays and on more on weekends.
      * Problem: burn out, afraid I'll give up because it's too much / too hard (I'm also going to have to study for multiple licensing exams for my job which take up at least 10 hours a week, fml)
   * Quit my job cold and study / work on side projects full time
      * Problem: SF living costs are high, risky
   * Quit my job and join a boot camp
      * Problem: SF living costs and boot camp costs, I hear bootcamps aren't that great?
   * Do a masters in CS
      * Problem: tuition costs, probably won't get into a good program (why would they take me, finance guy with average grades and no CS experience), and I already have a CS degree.

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm just scared that I'm going to do all of this and the tech companies won't care/won't give me an interview or consider me.
* What's the best thing to do? Anyone been in similar situations or have done this transition before?
* Are there internships for post-grads like me?"

9fo3hh,3,2018-09-13,Filemaker Pro automated databases?,Dan298,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/9fo3hh/filemaker_pro_automated_databases/,"Long story so brace yourselves. I am a sophomore at university college and I recently started looking for internships. I dont have any coding experience outside C++ but I figured I would apply for a few internships anyways that require basic skills like C++, excel/word. So I get an email from someone saying they would like to interview with me, and she wants me to come in right away the next day. I find it a little strange seeing as how I have little to no experience, that an employer would be so interested. Anyways, I meet with the interviewer and her office is in an apartment complex. At the beginning of the interview she tells me that nobody in her company has any experience with coding. Then she tells me that they are maintaining a database on filemaker pro of 15,000 people by hand. Then she tells me that she wants me the automate the process by exporting formatted excel files into filemaker entries. While all of this sounds simple in theory, I have no clue what fileMaker even is and how similar it is to C++. When I ask her why she thinks I should know how to do all this, she responds ""you know how to code so it should be easy"". Then she proceeds to tell me how she had hired a professional developer to do all this work, but that the guy is too lazy and overbilling them. She says that he added features that should have taken minutes but it took him hours. (even though she said she has no coding experience). At this point there are so many red flags waving around I can't tell if I'm at The Running of the Bulls. However, this is the first time someone has offered me an internship, so if this sort of thing is possible for a complete novice then I would like to try it just to get experience. Although my common sense is telling me that at my beginner level, I wont be able to pull of 1/8 of what this professional programmer has done, even if he lets me use his old code.

Is this possible for someone at my level? Is it possible to learn in a short time frame?
Is there a large likelyhood this will blow up in my face if I accept the offer?"

I didn't have any internship experience in school (regretfully) and was worried about getting a job when I graduated. Turns out that I got an offer in my field for a startup company with good pay within two months of graduating and I took it because I thought it was the right fit for me. The job is a program which has me working a support position and then after a few months I will transfer to an engineering position that is \*somewhat\* related to what I want to get into. After a month of working here, I am really disliking what I'm currently doing. I have no desire to be working support as it gives me no experience in what I want to get into and it's been deathly boring. Every day is just a sheer struggle and I constantly think about quitting as I feel like I'm not doing what I truly want to do with my life. My mental health has been deteriorating drastically (I have severe depression/anxiety) and I've been on the verge of a mental breakdown since I started. I'm really not sure if I could last the couple of months it takes to get into the engineering position, so I've been applying for different jobs. I got a degree in Computer Science because I've always loved video games and wanted to get into game development, but I have little to none experience in it. My plan, if I quit, was to focus on projects for game development, maybe join a certificate program for game design, and improve my software engineering skills while I look for another job OR go back to school to get my masters. My parents support me fully with whatever I decide to do so it is up to me to make the decision.

9foed0,93,2018-09-13,New Grad Perspective: Making the CS POST at UofT is not the end all be all.,LastMathematician,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/9foed0/new_grad_perspective_making_the_cs_post_at_uoft/,"To give some background, I’m a recent grad from the CS Specialist and I had made the POST back when the cutoff was 75%. I’m currently looking for a job right now and it took me some time to realize that this degree isn’t my golden ticket to getting noticed by employers. 

When I graduated with the CS degree (and good PEY experience), I came out with this sense of entitlement. After all, I had worked very hard towards making the POST and coming out of it, so surely the employers will notice the work I put in to “make it"". I had assumed that offers would be delivered to me on a silver platter. 

Unfortunately, the saturation of the CS POST mirrors the current state of the job market for CS today. New grads are now competing with just as competent non-STEM related degree holders who went through bootcamps, or online courses. Today, the UofT CS degree (let alone the degree itself) is not enough (unless you’re just a rockstar programmer or from a top-tier school etc..). Just take a look at the front page of /r/cscareerquestions. Almost every week I encounter a booming thread about the difficulty of getting entry-level jobs as a new grad, many of whom hold CS degrees from pretty good schools. 

I’ve put my blood, sweat, and tears into making and graduating out of the POST. I naively thought it would be enough to at least land interviews. But I’ve now come to the stark realization that this and my internship experience isn’t enough to get noticed by employers. I thought I was worthy, but in reality I’m not compared to all the others who have the degree (or no degree) and on top of that, more personal projects and hackathon/work/internship experience than me. And this is fine. At first, I was bitter, because some of my friends who had graduated with non-STEM degrees are getting jobs as developers and I’m struggling. But I admire that despite their lack of CS degree, they are willing to try even harder to put themselves out there to get noticed. And they succeeded at just that. 

If you are worthy of getting a 86 in your CS courses, then you are worthy of landing great internships and making stellar personal projects. And these are what really matter at the end of the day to most employers today. 

I know I might have come off as entitled and I’m trying really hard not to across like that and I sincerely apologize if I failed at doing so. My intention is not to sound condescending but rather to give a different and hopefully uplifting perspective of the current situation at hand. 

EDIT: TL;DR: *""You are only as strong as you—not UofT—allow yourself to be.""*"

That was my first and last interview till this day and even though I was practicing mock-interview with a friend every week, it seemed not enough. My applications were rejected before companies even contacted me for interviews, so I thought maybe it was my resume or lack of experience was the problem, because if I couldn't land an interview, then focusing on practicing interview wouldn't help.

I have looked at some companies like Revature, SynergisticIT and on Glassdoor, it sounds okay but after researching on reddit, lots of people advice against them because of their practices and contracts that go with the training. That is why I need some suggestion here, maybe for a couple more months and I still cannot land an interview, I might have to look into these companies as my last options.

But for now I was wondering if anyone who has landed a SWE position or worked in the industry for awhile that can give me some advice on what source of technologies or skills your companies used that I should look at to work on to add to my resume, as my resume included mostly school projects, so I don't know if adding more projects would even help.

No job.,buildabotwkshp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9fohpv/1_yr_out_of_bootcamp_no_job/,"I didn't go to college and I don't have much professional experience before that, just one year at a non-profit. after graduating I spent time studying algorithms and data structures. I went through sedgwick's algorithms book. I've done a lot of leetcode and worked through most of cracking the coding interview and currently working through elements of programming interviews. I learned C++, learned about distributed computing, and **really** could use advice. 

I'm very confident in my ability to solve problems and come up with solutions to these whiteboard questions. The problem is I don't get any opportunity to actually demonstrate what I know. When I first started applying I sent out over a hundred applications and barely got one phone interview.  after that  I got discouraged and seeing so many of my classmates land great jobs kind of gave up. 

It's so frustrating because I know that if I were given an actual interview, I would do well. I also am actually passionate about what I'm learning and and while I was at boot camp I was told many times how quick I learn, how strong my intuition for finding bugs is, etc. 

Also my projects listed on my resume aren't that good. A lot of my focus since graduating has been on learning more and I haven't really done too much project building. I've learn C++, and it's what I'm using to solve the problems in elements of programming interviews. Honestly this language has been a lot of fun and incredibly challenging. Especially stuff like template metaprogramming and all the intricacies involved.. I'm having a lot of fun. 

but in that I also feel like I've spread myself too thin. And that my time would have been better spent if I just had focused on building more and more web apps in react and node. All the while the gap between when I finished bootcamp widens and widens. 1 year out of school and no job. My resume is getting worse everyday lol. 

I think I bought too much into the advice that bootcamp grads aren't real computer scientists and so I wanted to really counter that by learning a lot of computer science. and here I am now with a decent grasp of the fundamentals, and no job, while pretty much all of my classmates, even those who struggled a lot have great jobs.

I was really depressed and all but now I'm in a different mindset and I really just want to get this done. I'm open to contract positions, internships, whatever. it doesn't matter. I just want an opportunity to actually get paid to code.

Wat do. Kinda want to bug former classmates for referrals but if my resume is getting absolutely 0 traction I feel it would be wasted. Also I havent spoke to them in almost a year so.. 😣

I feel like I'm wasting my time here. All the CS courses I've taken so far hasn't taught me anything new, and the remaining courses that I will be taking isn't what my career needs (I want to do full stack). I absolutely hate how I feel like I am wasting my time and money at this University and gaining almost nothing but practice from it. 

I've done 4 internships (started in highschool) so far and I really enjoy industry life more so than academic life. I feel like I've learned so much more in those 2-3 months at the internships than all my classes combined. 

Any advice is appreciated!

TLDR; Feel like I'm wasting my time at school, I want to drop out. Any advice is appreciated."

I’m a junior SWE student at ASU. Pretty long story short, essentially I had a degree change, and the only programming I’ve ever done is the last few years of school. I’m incredibly proud of myself with how far I’ve come, and how much I’ve truly learned in a small amount of time. However I feel I’ve been completely naive and unaware of how behind I am. School alone has not prepared me or provided me with what I feel I need to know to get an internship. I also work almost full time, and I’m on the quarter system, which honestly makes learning this type of material (IMO) harder due to the fast pace. I haven’t had any time, and didn’t realize the importance, of having side projects, therefore I don’t have any to list on my resume. I have been exposed to C and C++, but I’m only truly proficient in Java. I have a 3.3 GPA, so I haven’t done too poorly. I’m also doing this degree online, and therefore don’t have access to recruiting fairs and whatnot. I have what I felt like a strong resume and cover letter, but after really looking at other people’s experience and personal projects I feel like I’m screwed. I’m in the Bay Area, and it’s really frustrating that I’m surrounded by SO much opportunity that on paper I’m unqualified for.

I also don’t really have any contacts to use to my advantage...I feel like I’m going through this entire processes blind. I wish school put emphasis on this to some extent, because I’m learning about it all too late. Also after reading through this sub, I feel like it’s impossible to get an interview just applying online, like you NEED a referral. That realization combined with my lack of experience, side projects, proficiencies, or connections, an internship just doesn’t seem to be in reach. I’m so incredibly hard working, and learn rather quickly, but I can’t sell myself on that without even getting an interview. I may just be panicking, but I feel like I’m also being realistic...I’m not even sure what I’m looking for out of this post...perhaps advice/ what other people think my chances are? Obviously applying is better than not, but I just don’t know..."

I've always been interested in computers and tech, but I was concerned about math as it's not one of my strengths.   
At my university, I need to finish 5 courses in CS/math to even be considered for the major (a BA in computer science). I will also need to take 2 years of a foreign language for the major, so basically I'm pretty far off. I'm already a sophomore and won't be able to start CS coursework until my second semester (though I am taking an intro course this semester).   
As a result, I may end up graduating a semester or two late. How bad would that be?  
Also, I know that internships are important but since I lack any knowledge I don't think I'd be able to do one until my junior year. Would that be a problem?  
I do already have some ideas for personal projects which I can work on in the mean time.  
Has anyone else switched majors and how did it work for you?    
Also any general advice / youtube channels / etc for someone new to CS would be super helpful.

9fu6jr,1,2018-09-14,[M25] Want to improve my appearance and social skills with women,MaB6,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/9fu6jr/m25_want_to_improve_my_appearance_and_social/,"\[VERY LONG POST - you can go directly down to the questions, if you don't wanna read it all\]

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 25y.o. man doing my Ph.D., i.e. working in research. I've been supporting myself for almost all the years in the university and I've been living on my own since 19. I've never been a Tom-Cruise-level-looking guy, but I've managed to get one girlfriend in the high school and kiss with several other girls back then.

It's important to add, that I've always wished to experience casual sex with many women, as I have a high sex-drive and I've been most of my life studying (mostly because of my very strict mother) or later, closed in the office with serious middle-aged men. Also, I love the feeling of being attractive to someone and just enjoying a moment.

In the university I've been extremely busy studying and working at the same time, which resulted on missing almost all parties and clubs and also into several pretty serious health problems, which are hopefully gone now.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a few other girlfriends in those years (really not many), my last one being very sexually open and willing to experiment with threesome, knowing about my wish.

In that time (cca 2 years ago) I was feeling pretty well, despite being incredibly stressed from finishing my Major and working full-time. 

When she arranged one of her friends for a threesome (who got multiple previous experience with it), the evening went horribly wrong. She was making out with my girlfriend, but when I came to the room, she rejected to interact with me at all (except kissing), with some silly excuse about her previous boyfriend. I've never felt humiliated like this, to be honest...

That was the first time I thought about being really unattractive.

After several months, a former schoolmate of my gf came to our city to visit her. They were together in my gf's old flat, where they were talking with another guy living there. I couldn't come that evening, as I had to finish something in work.

My gf's friend had sex with the guy and she's in contact with him despite having boyfriend. My gf talked with her about threesome and we arranged a date when we will meet her. She lives on the very other side of my country, so I booked a hotel and went there (my gf was already there for several days because of her job). When I've arrived, however, the girl was really cold towards me, telling me she doesn't have time that day and leaving me in the street, in front of my gf. Later I found out, that she commonly attends local group sex parties, so she obviously isn't a very censored person and have no problems sleeping with new guys.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I've gone through this even with my friend from uni, whom I helped some time ago finishing her degree (I've basically programmed all the software for her thesis). I talked about it with her and she told me, that she's too shy to do it etc. Shortly afterwards she found some much older, divorcing guy in his 40s, with whom she attended threesomes without any problems (and she wrote me her experience, of course). This was really depressing, as this guy is short, with poor facial aesthetics and terrible social skills (I know him marginally from the local climbing gym). He's also not the typical ""successful grown-up guy"", who is some high-ranked manager, making huge amounts of money and who can take his women to Florida 4 times a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting gradually more and more depressed by this, as nothing seems to work. I have zero confidence, as I can see, that I've lost my hair due to an excessive stress and I'm much skinnier, that what I was like 4 years back, when I was doing Judo and Kickboxing.

I'm repelling women on a daily basis, to the point, where I took my gf's friend to the climbing gym (she was talking about it several times), paid for her and took her there by car, but after training she was visibly annoyed and she insisted, that next time my gf will go with us (I've done nothing bad to her and we weren't talking about anything personal, which could offend her).

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping, that the situation will improve, when I'll move to another country, as I'm currently doing my 10months internship abroad. It didn't. To be honest, women are repelled by myself to the point, where secretaries, standing in front of the building, I've never spoken with, throw their cigarettes away and slam the door in front of my face, so they don't have to greet me and spend like 15seconds in my presence. I'm also experiencing this behaviour in the street, where women visibly look away, when I go around them or in the bus, when I'm going to the office in the morning.

So far, I've tried working out in the gym with the personal trainer with mixed success (put on some muscles, then lost it all due to an extreme stress and then injured my shoulder, which I'm still struggling with), shaving my hair completely, changing my beard shape and buying a new clothes. I've also asked for opinions on RateMe, AmIUgly etc., where I got mostly ""not very good"" ratings. You can look at my photos there on my profile, as I won't post links here.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, this thing is consuming my life as nothing has ever been. I need to do something about it, but I have no idea what. The worst thing is, nobody understands my position and I'm getting exactly 3 answers, whenever I try to bring it up:

1. Oh, so you've had some girls, you're just making this problem in your head.
2. You're very successful with your Ph.D. (in reality, I'm not successful at all, I'm simply trying to get it done somehow), so you should be grateful for that and women will come, as they love successful men!
3. You're SO shallow and womaniser! You don't deserve any women! 

Of course, none of them is helpful, as every one of them puts me more and more into depression.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my long-term goals are:

1. Improve my appearance as possible
2. Get some time and self-confidence for clubs, as I'd love to sometimes just go there and chill out
3. Become attractive to some women (don't know, if it's possible at all)

Do you have any suggestions how to start? I'll welcome ANY answers.

Thank you very much!

&amp;#x200B;

P.s.: I'm very sorry for this post, but I really needed to get it off my chest."

I started as an intern but was hired full time. My mother is a client of my company so that’s how I got my foot in the door. However, I was hired on full time because of my work ethic. 

From day one there was a lot of tension in this company. A woman who was “training” me was possibly the craziest person I have ever met. She was absolutely horrible at her job and soon became threatened by me. She started rumors about me within a month of me being there. She was eventually let go and things went quit for a couple months. The other girls in my office still hate me even though the rumors about me are not true. I’ve had personal property destroyed, my lunches thrown out, and constant complaints to my boss. It’s to the point where my boss is telling everyone that they are replaceable. 

So to get the point here, this company is extremely hard to work for. My boss shit talks everyone in the company openly. Most of the employees don’t do their job and sit around and gossip all day. And there is not accountability! 

But my issue is that I’m still a student and I get paid decently so I know it will be hard for me to find another job like this. I still have 2.5 years left of schooling. 

What can I do to make this company not effect me emotionally? Every day I go home feeling horrible and worthless. I feel drained. I struggle with generalized anxiety and depression so situations like this trigger me. I’ve been doing my best but I can feel my boss and coworkers negativity influencing me.

I'm interested in using AI to perform business automation and better the world by making life easier (such as renewable energy applications of AI). 

Currently, I've been looking at working as a civilian for the air force. It's appealing because through Palace Aquire I could get my masters paid for plus some good benefits. My wife likes it because it's a stable job. The caveat is I have read nothing positive about working for the government. Low pay, uninteresting work, laziness, politics, etc. I'm not really interested in working on old outdated system, but innovation and progression with the newest tools. I've also heard/read people don't want to hire you after working for the DoD/contractors.

The second option is to find work elsewhere, hopefully in the field I'm interested in. I have found most of those jobs are looking for people with 5+ years of experience or specific ai experience. I'm not interested in being a web developer and low level is not in my skill set. 

I'm wondering which direction is better. Get the masters through the Air Force and find my dream job after or go for the private industry and hope I get a higher paying job. The former would put the masters on hold until I'm in a better position or my employer pays for it. I'm open to other options/suggestions that I may not know/see currently.

Starting, I worked 8 hour days 5 days a week unpaid, dealing with customer service stuff.  After the first month, I asked my boss to pay me for expenses travel/food/etc. He wrote a contract hiring me for an internship position as customer support on a weekly wage (not hourly) with a 5% project bonus.

About a month later I am no longer doing customer support, but more web development in HTML/CSS which was great at first. I am the only person who knows HTML/CSS in the office because they developed websites with WordPress. Now I am constantly developing websites. He also took on a new project that he outsourced which is a online food ordering platform. This company is in India and their work hours do not match up with ours. At the end of my work day we have a meeting where I have to listen to what everyone has worked on for this project (testing/etc.) , put it together and write an email to this company of what needs to be done next. My boss even makes me contact these people at this company through Skype at 12:00 midnight on my days off including weekends sometimes. Also, to make things even worse, I am constantly working past my normal work hours for about 30min-1hr a day since I first started working there. I do not necessarily mind all this work, but I am only getting paid $10/hr which feels like i'm being slapped in the face considering minimum wage in NY is $12.50. I have only been working here 3 months which leads to my questions. Should I ask for a raise? Should I tell my boss I am not working on my off hours? Should I just walk out the door the second my work shift is over?"

I interviewed with company B roughly 10 days ago. Today they called and left me a voicemail saying they want to hire me.

However 3 days ago company A called me saying they have an opening and they want to interview me. I worked at company A during an internship and really enjoyed myself. 

Company A isn't going to interview me till Monday. But Monday is also the day Company B wants to hear from me.

So as of now the job with Company A is not guaranteed but the job with Company B is.

I'm concerned if Company A doesn't give me a definite decision at the interview I might have to go with Company B. 

From what I understand this is a good problem to have, but I'm just not sure how to go about this situation if I don't receive a definitive decision from Company A on Monday.
 
Any advice is appreciated "

If I don't make it can I go general admission?"".  Should I apply general admission or Early action/decision? I go to a private School in Maryland. Some stats about me:

***Extracurricular Activites:***  (I added some tidbits that are relevant but not sure if they reallyhave a place on college app.)

Quadcopter Camp (9) - Summer Camp I started. Second year it ran. Taught campers how to build and fly their own quadcopters.

Cross Country (9)

Building Drones (9-12) - Built at least 15 flying drones (quadcopter and hexacopter). I also built a RC plane with FPV feedback with a 15 mile+ communication range and 45 mile total flight range)

Drone Racing (10)

Rugby (11-12)

Robotics Team (11-12) - Team I started and competes in FTC local competitions. Our robot has won awards and made it to the Maryland State Championships (16th but good for 1st year team)

Computer Science Team (11-12) - Competed in local tournaments including UMD HSPC (High school programming competition). There, my 3 man team won $900 and the Gannon Award for the best 1st year team at the competition. Because most of the members are also on my robotics team, we decided to use that money for robot parts for the Robotics team.

Internship at Structural Design and Analysis (11-12) - Summer Internship. First year, I built a RC robot that would pull small personal planes around airports (think Cessna type planes). Second year was shorter, used Lidar sensor and SLAM algorithm to map layout of the office as I walked around with the Lidar sensor in hand.

McDonalds (12) - Worked at Mcdonalds full time over summer, weekends during school year. For 6 weeks, this job overlapped with my other internship and I worked 6 weeks of 7 days a week.

I got this job role by converting the internship opportunity given to a full time role. I was offered a package that I felt was good (It's more than twice the average salary of junior developers in India) and I accepted the same. 

It was once I interacted with other junior developers (there were no junior developers in my team when I was interning) in the same position as me that I came to know that I was being underpaid. The other developers were being paid upto 20% more than me I also didn't get any relocation bonus or joining bonus which by itself is a pretty sizeable amount (20% of my current salary per annum) .

&amp;#x200B;

I know that it was naivety that led to this but I just did try to negotiate some raise before accepting the offer letter but the HR was like this is the final offer accept or leave it.

I am already 3 months into the job and though I do love my job I feel a bit jealous as we all are doing very similar stuff but there is a large difference in pay. 

What should be my next steps? How should I proceed ? I am afraid to leave this company very early as I heard that other HR look at how long a person sticks to a company and leaving early will work against me.

&amp;#x200B;

My current thoughts and steps I thought I could take:

I don't have much interview experience in general and I am weak in Algo &amp; DS so I am slowly improving upon it. I am thinking of leaving this company after an year and trying out again as a junior developer in other top companies like Microsoft where the starting salary for even a junior developer is almost twice that of what I am making now.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this post seems too long but I really am in a fix and don't know where to turn for advice. I can't really ask the senior developers in my team as this is a matter regarding leaving the company and I don't know any other person to ask. Will be thankful for any insights or suggestions."

And here's an opportunity to take the first steps:  

One client doesn't have fixed workplaces and users tend to sit here and then there. Plus there's a lot staff turnover (mainly interns). As a result their workstations get swamped with profiles, so I thought to be clever and use GPO to remove profiles older than 30 days. But I just cannot get it to work and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong here.  

The setup is a W2008R2 DC (SP1) and I tested this with a W10 1803 workstation.  
I've added the new policy to 'Forest/Domains/client.local/Group Policy Object' and set this policy to delete user profiles older than 30 days. I also added a second policy to run a start-up script. Initially I did not change anything in 'scope'/'Details'/'Delegation'.  
As this did not work (reboot computer numerous times and the old profiles still there), I specifically added this workstation to scope/security filtering. And again nothing happened after multiple reboots.  

I ran GPResult on the workstation, but I'm not sure what I should see, so I don't really know if that specific policy is actually running or not.  

I've been googling about this, but cannot seem to find what I'm doing wrong. My gut feeling is I'm overlooking something simple...but what?  

Although I am asking for a specific pointer for the above and happily provide additional info, I would also be very much helped with a really good source on GPO's (which I seem unable to find...).  


Edit:  
Everyone providing genuine input: Thanks, it is highly appreciated.  
Some of you make me feel I have to defend myself for our actions. I'm too old for that. So, for those cursing at me for being an utter idiot, yes, you're right about that. I apologies for being stupid.

My name is Tim and I created this Reddit account to ask for input / advise / recommendations.

***Before I get started, here is the TL;DR:***

&gt;***I'm looking for recommendations for a ReactJS week long bootcamp in CA that won't break the bank.***

&amp;#x200B;

Now here is my story:

Before I graduated high school, I began an internship with a small non profit with my primary focus being video production. I was passionate about that choice, but knew that the end goal wasn't to be some all time famous video producer. My heart has been and always will be in technology. Luckily, upon me graduating I got a full time job with this company and have slowly been maneuvering my way into my current title, being the Director of Technology. I promise you though, that title seems far bigger then it really is. My current responsibilities include but are not limited to making sure the internet works, communicating with school district technology departments to make sure we support the technology they roll out, and managing one 'tech specialist'. I make an okay salary for my age (being 21), have plenty of respect within my small organization, and in general, don't hate my job.

I'm at a turning point though. My goal for the future is to move to a city that has the qualities and job opportunities that Seattle WA has.

Even though I don't have a bad job, I can't say that I'm happy because it's not where my heart is. I want to do full time Front end web development with ReactJS being my priority. For the past few years I've been taking multiple online classes and have dedicated quite some time into learning more javascript / react / html / css. I'm looking to accelerate my learning though. I'd like to take a bootcamp for ReactJS. Something that has some type of certificate attached that states I know something.

Now, what I'd really like to do is to approach my CEO and beg him to sponsor my learning in a bootcamp, so it can't be too expensive.

**So what I'm really asking for in this post is, how would you move forward in my position? Does anyone have any similar experience? Do I have anxiety over not having a BA in computer science for no reason? Any most importantly, do you have any recommendations for a ReactJS bootcamp located in California?**"
9g32y4,11,2018-09-15,"Graduated with an Art degree even though I liked Computer Science, and now I feel I'm paying the price. How to fix?",art_to_cs_throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9g32y4/graduated_with_an_art_degree_even_though_i_liked/,"When I started college back in the early 2000s, I had enrolled as an Architecture major, being interested in the design and construction of buildings. This was at a regular state school, but their ""sister"" school was known to be one of the best for CS. Either way, the Architecture program wasn't as I expected it to be, and I, along with many other freshmen, dropped it in their first year.

For the following two semesters I was undecided with a major, and then transitioning to art. There was a waiting list for the college so I took general ed classes. However, even when I was in art, where I majored in graphic design/new media, I got sidetracked again and realized programming was the thing for me. I took a web design class where we learned to make some basic websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript using Notepad (yes, the stock Notepad program on Windows) and really liked it.

As a result I decided to enroll in some 100 level CS courses in my 4th year in college to bolster my programming skills. I did more work using JavaScript, then Java. Some other students got teachers that taught C++ but I didn't have those classes. And with the department's permission I was allowed to advance to intermediate CS courses because I met the pre-requisites. I took three intermediate classes, two on OOP and one on discrete math and data structures (it covered both topics in one class). I got pretty favorable grades.

The reason I chose not to follow though doing more classes to get a CS major, is that by starting a complete major change (or double major) in my then-5th year, I'd be going past 6 full years and 150 credits in college, and that would have greatly reduced my financial aid options. Even a CS minor would have put me overboard by one semester.

Up to that point, about 90% of my tuition was paid with Pell grants because my FAFSA had no family contributors. I wanted to cut my losses by graduating earlier with the art degree. ""Earlier"" being relative. I graduated in almost six years which is later than most.

But I did not think too much about how beneficial having that CS degree would mean to me in the long run. Also, I assumed that with an Art degree and with no internships I couldn't be hired as a programmer by Fortune 500 companies, but rather would have to take the ""long way"" around, by starting at smaller web shops and working my way up to bigger and bigger companies.

But several years later, I am still stuck in a loop of under-paying small companies. And I don't really know what to do anymore. I have worked at four of them so far. And yet, my skill set is that of an average entry level dev, if I were to consider the feedback I get from job interviews.

I could get interviews at medium sized and larger companies right now but I am always rejected by them. I am still not good enough. I don't know how to introspect and am *terrible* at finding out behavioral problems at interviews.

Should I go back to school and complete my CS degree? And even if it's a good idea, how do I balance that with my time and my budget? I am only working 15 hours a week and also get paid like crap. Around $16k for annual pay. I know some companies can pay for your tuition but that's not very useful to know if I am not good enough to get hired by them.

So to sum it up: My career is going in circles, not making a lot of money. It's now 15 years later since I started college, but I live like a broke college student. Any options I'd like to take I feel will just strain my finances, but I want to recover my career so bad.

9g43h9,5,2018-09-15,Graduating in seven semesters on time or in eight semesters and one semester later,jbern5,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/9g43h9/graduating_in_seven_semesters_on_time_or_in_eight/,"I'm in my third year of school as a Computer Engineering major that is mostly focusing on software.  Due to family medical reasons I am going to have to withdraw from this semester.  After considering options I came up with two main ones: graduate in seven semesters and still graduate on time or use the full eight semesters but graduate in the winter rather than spring.

&amp;#x200B;

If I graduate in seven semesters, I will have to do a more heavy course load and take some classes outside of the normal semesters.  There is a slight chance that I can take two winter courses but the more likely option is that I take two summer courses due to the availability.  I can take these courses at night so that during the day I can still do some type of work.  That  work would probably be going back to a small startup that I have been working/interning with since it's flexible. However I would be giving up the chance to intern at a larger company and get that brand name recognition. This option is also cheaper overall, how much though depends if I do winter or summer courses. But is the experience from a small startup enough?

&amp;#x200B;

If I graduate in eight semesters and in the winter, I would not have to take any summer courses and it would be giving me another summer to try and get an internship, a possibility of getting two before I graduate.  The course load would be lighter and I would be able to get a minor in Economics as well.  This means I also have to pay for another semester of tuition and housing but with the possibility of two internships I would make some money to combat the cost hopefully. I'm not sure but I would assume it would be harder to get a job in December as a new graduate rather than in May when most people graduate, am I correct?

&amp;#x200B;

So after all of this, does anyone have any advice on what I should do?  Is the experience at a small startup enough to get me a decent job when I graduate or do I need a bigger, more well known internship? I appreciate any advice anyone has to give, thanks"

Currently at a **40hr/week part-time hourly job as a developer.** But living in high rent college town making **only $15/hr without benefits or holiday pay sucks.** Not being able to work and get paid on labor day, 4th, etc. hurts. And making the same as students at university who are working cafe and bookstore jobs kind of sucks too.

That **current job mentioned offering me FT**... but it came and went and **nothing happened.** I've been there now **5 months** as this ""PT intern."" Peers mentioned that they may just be using me as cheap labor, but regardless, I am wanting to look elsewhere for a real job. Not only because of this, but because I'm not learning from them. **They seem to be behind**, and **everything I've learned over 5 months has been me learning things because I wanted to.** There **isn't any challenges** and it is most definitely not a place that can push my career forward.

---

So, here is my first portfolio with my first round of individual projects. **I don't have much time to work on them, but I do after work and on weekends, and was able to throw this together over a week or so.** 

**I know it's not much, and I'm probably not ready for a FT job that I am looking for yet**, but its a start, and I'm looking for tips from anyone that has suggestions about anything."

Context: i'm currently going to school (Sophomore) and I work part time as an assistant for a company. I live paycheck to paycheck and it's tough. I hit a bump life and I can barely cover my tuition which spurred this  situation.

I applied to a few web-developer internships and they've offered for me to come on but they are unpaid. I've also applied to a few full-time jobs that are full-time but are tech support. I will (likely) get an offer in a few days.

The issue is, if I take this full time job, I won't have the ability to do the internships. 

My question is this: would it be better to do the internships and live poor till December when I can get paid internships or should I do the full-time job and give up on the internships?"
9g68z7,1,2018-09-15,"Just Determining My Future, No Biggie",RenardLouisianais,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9g68z7/just_determining_my_future_no_biggie/,"Hello all, thanks for clicking. I’ll try to keep this as short as possible.

When I was in high school, I was a good student: I was valedictorian, had excellent standardized test scores, was a good essay writer, played two varsity sports, student government, clubs, foreign language, et cetera. You all know the type. I was an eligible candidate for any university in the country (I live in the United States).

My parents didn’t like the idea of my going far and forbade me from venturing a certain distance from home. I live in the Deep South, and the majority of the nation’s best universities fall outside of that range. I ended up going to a \*good\* but not \*great\* university, but I’m on scholarship, so I count my blessings even though it’s not a school I would have chosen to attend. My parents also didn’t like the idea of my studying anything impractical, so I spent my undergrad double-majoring in Marketing and Management with a concentration in entrepreneurship; I also minored in French, which was okay because it’s a minor. My school experience has been fine but not fantastic; I have to agree a bit with those who say that B-school is not as strenuous as it could be.

Now I’m looking at grad school, and my parents have finally given me free rein on where to go (although not necessarily on what to study). The problem is that I’m not the exceptional student in college that I was in high school. I was pretty depressed for a while, and my grades are okay but nothing special (3.65 or so). I’ve had some internships, but again, nothing exceptional except for last summer, when I worked in Singapore. The company isn’t well-known, except in Japan. I haven’t had any major extracurriculars either. On the other hand, I did do a weeklong parliamentary simulation in Belgium, studied in Vienna for a semester and learned some German and a bit of Japanese to add to my French, so I do think I score well on the “international experience” front.

I’ve always loved reading and writing, and I’ve written every day since my freshman year of college; to date, I’ve finished (but not published) two novels and have another four or five manuscripts lying about. The idea of being a novelist is really attractive to me—particularly considering its flexibility and independence—but it’s an uncertain lifestyle for sure.

Basically, this is my dilemma: My parents think that I’m going to go to grad school for business. Firstly, most of the great schools won’t accept me for an MBA without years of work experience, so I’d probably have to go for an MiM or some other Masters. I would consider going to Europe if I got into an excellent school (like, say, the London Business School), but truthfully, I’m just not sure if it’s worth studying business as a grad student when I’ve done it for undergrad, particularly for a degree that’s not an MBA. Is the difference in material and subject matter so vast that it’s worth pursuing and paying for?

Lately, I’ve been considering programs in both the U.S. and Europe for international affairs or literature/creative writing, but I’m nervous to tell my parents that because they might dislike it and/or refuse to pay. Probably they wouldn’t mind if, say, I got into Harvard or Oxford or something, but I’m not that kind of student anymore and that seems beyond my capabilities. Also, I have no real qualifications for literature/CW (I did get perfect standardized test scores on both Reading and English back in the day, but that was in high school and the schools won’t even see that) or International Affairs (except languages and some time abroad), so I feel like I won't be accepted to most places. I just don’t feel the motivation to go to B-school anymore, but I’ve never been a true gambler, and the idea of swapping that for a less-certain career as a novelist or something is a bit nerve-wracking even though I think I would prefer to study literature. No matter what I do in life, I feel certain that I’m going to continue writing, if that makes a difference, and I’d like to try to be published someday.

Firstly, because I’ve already studied business as an undergrad, would it make a significant difference to study as a grad student (again, not in an MBA setting)? And secondly, is a Masters in Literature/Creative Writing/International Affairs somehow useless or not worth it? (IA would basically just complement my business education; I don’t really want to work in the field of IA myself.) I just don't know anybody in real life who has a good background to answer this, so I thought I'd ask here.

Sorry, this turned out longer than I meant it to be. Anyway, I’d sincerely appreciate any advice that you might have. (If I'm just being stupid, feel free to tell me, but please be nice—it's a worrying subject for me, haha.) Thank you for your time, and I wish you all a pleasant day :)"

I also have many other community colleges/small universities within an hour drive.

I am looking for an internship or research that would be science or pre-med related. I would love to do research at the T15 but just wonder if it’s too good. Their school of medicine is just mind blowing, and I participate in a study from the university. Should I try to network one of the grad students in the study? Or should I just stick to emails?

This is my number one choice.

I am in state, not local ( if that matters )

UC GPA:  4.115, upward trend ( Got All A's second semester junior year, which I haven't done before, and from what I know, they like improvement.)

Ap's taken 10-11th: AP World (10th grade), AP USH (11th grade), AP Lang (11th Grade), AP Physics (11th grade)

only exam I took was APush which I got a 3 on, which I believe means nothing.

Honors taken: Honors English 2. I also took an ""accelerated"" version of math at my school in 10th and 11th grade which my school weighted as an AP/honor, but it seems that colleges don't recognize it as anything special. Not that it would matter for weighted gpa, since I'm already past the cap, but I think it would help for rigor of schedule.

Dual Enrollment: Junior year, I took 2 courses of college computer classes (each one was one semester long) via dual enrollment. The first semester was coding, targeting Java. The second semester was computer information systems. I ended up getting a C (only C I ever got) in the first course because I was lazy( tanks my gpa unfortunately), however I did get an A in the second semester

SAT: 1200 (What I believe is the killing factor. I'm taking the October 6th one, and our school is offering one Oct 24. Hoping I get a 1300, perhaps 1350ish if I luck out. Always procrastinated studying for the SAT, and now its coming back on me, as I only have a month to study. ) I'm pretty sure even a 1350 is still below average, so I'm hoping my other areas can help out. 

ECs: 

Basketball 1 year (Freshman)

Tennis 3 Years (10-12th. good chance I'm co captain of varsity this year, which I would mention.)

I volunteered at my library one time, and got 3 hours of community service but that is so pitiful, I don't even think it's worth mentioning. 

80 hour internship with my Dentist. It'll probably seem very random because It has nothing to do with my major.

Should be getting a job this week, so I'll have that in time before I submit. 

I should be getting involved with my local community hospital soon. However, I doubt I'll have a considerable amount of hours done to influence admissions at all.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the personal insight questions, I have read over them, but my main focus is the SAT right now. I will start grinding those out late October through November. I do plan on submitting in my application late November, but at least a couple days before Nov. 30th.  I'd like to consider myself an above average writer, but I've lived a rather average life, so I won't have anything extraordinarily interesting to talk about. Lets just say my personal insight questions are a little bit above average of the typical UC Davis applicant I guess. 

Lastly, I will be under managerial economics. I do plan on getting an MBA after with an emphasis in healthcare, and I'm not sure if I should talk about that.

I've never done this before, so sorry for it being so messy, just wanted to try and give a sufficient overview about myself for the application.  Please give realistic responses, I'm fine if you think it's a no, I tend to be pessimistic anyways. Well I'll be suprised if anyone actually reads all of this, but if you do, thanks. Hopefully I'll be at UC Davis in a year.

I have been working for what we will call “company A” for the past 6 months as an intern. I’ve gotten a lot of great experience that makes me stand out as a job candidate now. 

A second company called “company B” reached out to me and said they found me on linked in and they really liked my experience on my resume. We had a phone interview and it went very well and they want me to come in for an in person job interview. I went to my boss at company A and told him that Company B reached out to me and seemed very interested in possibly hiring me. I basically just told him that I love company A and would like to know where they are at with hiring me on as a full time engineer because if they would like to hire me it will orient how i interact with company B. My boss is very relaxed and straight forward  and told me they definitely don’t want to lose me and that he would talk to the owners about hiring me tomorrow.

Let me explain about company A. I would really like to work for them. I have talked to a couple of the new grads that work there and they all were offered competitive job offers in terms of benefits and salary for a entry level engineer. I don’t know anything about company B honestly.  

My question is, if I receive a job offer from company A  is it worth it to go to company B for the in person interview? Does it look bad if my company A offers me a job and I ask them if I can think it over for a couple days because i want to hear from company B? Is there anything else I should be thinking about?

I have a solid background in Computer Science. During my time at the university, I did a couple of internships related to my software development field and some gigs here and there to make some money. When I graduated back in 2017, I tried looking for a full-time job but I couldn't find one. My CV was a short one pager quick read, as you can expect from someone who had very limited experience. During my last year, I got recruited into a well established multinational software development services provider as a SALES DEVELOPMENT REPRESENTATIVE (SDR). I was desperate for a job, and had to make a living, i decided to take a plunge since they were offering me good money. Fast forward a year; I now feel like I made a huge mistake back then and should've waited for job that was relevant to my field as a Software Engineer. 

As far as my SDR role is concerned, I have been outperforming my peers in terms of meeting my targets and have a pretty good reputation amongst my seniors. They believe I have a bright future ahead. 

I used to freelance building and helping companies with their codes and had perfect reviews but then I had to leave for my full-time studies. I now feel left behind and when I think about starting all over, what did I waste my year in the first place. So, I am confused. 

Is it too late to switch to a technical field? How would potential companies see an SDR applying to a Software Engineering position?

For context, I work part time at a library, doing IT work. Compared to a lot of IT jobs I'm underpaid but I can work evenings and weekends, and around my school schedule which is super important to me. I've been doing this for a few years now.

Last year, a co-worker and I wrote and received a relatively high profile and hefty grant. Without going into too many details, this grant increased my job responsibilities pretty significantly, and got the library national attention. It was at this time (November of 2017) I decided to ask for a raise.

I hadn't gotten a raise in 2017 at all, my last raise had been six months after I started in 2016. I spoke to the library director and the conversation, as I recall it, was that after the first of the year we could negotiate. Cool.

The first of the year rolls around and a week later I email the director and my boss asking when would be a good time for the three of us to sit down and negotiate. The director responds that it would be inappropriate to discuss a raise so early in the year and that I would have to wait. This isn't what I remembered the conversation being like, but I have nothing in writing so I say okay.

April rolls around, and as suggested by the director, I have a sit-down meeting with my boss about compensation. I lay out what I think I've done, he agrees with me, and says we may have to wait until 2019 for anything to happen. I mention that I'd like it to be sooner and ask him to keep me in the loop, he says okay.

I am not kept in the loop.

Late summer rolls around, I ask my boss again what the status of the raise is. He questions what more there is to talk about. ""Like, when it's going to happen"" I say. He doesn't know. I ask if I should talk to the director, he says no.

We've now gone half the year without any news on this raise, and two full years since my last real pay increase (I got a 1% raise in January of '18, which translated to about 14 cents so I don't count that). Around this time whispers start of us hiring a third person in the IT department. A high school kid. He's a good guy but I explain to the director I don't think we need a third person. I spend a lot of time with little to do, especially if you take away all the additional projects I've taken on. 

There are whispers that I may need to share my desk with the new intern, and since he is younger than I, I'll continue to work evenings while he gets the morning shift. I push back, find space for him in the office. He gets hired in at a pretty substantial hourly rate (though still less than me). 

This really fires me up, I've been asking for a raise for over a year now, and been getting the run-around, and now we find enough money to hire in a third person just because he asked for it? Even after my boss and myself (the only two in the department at the time) said it wasn't necessary? 

I go to the director, uh, directly. Ask what the status on my raise is. She says that the compensation committee is meeting soon and that I need to give my boss written justification as to why I deserve a raise. I go to work, I create a spreadsheet detailing all my past increases, and what I'd like my next raise to be. I ask for an extra $3/hr, a pretty substantial bump but one I intend to prove that I earned (and well within my pay scale). I create a two page bulleted list of all the responsibilities I've taken on, all the projects I've completed, every reason why I'm worth what I say.

I hand a print copy to my boss and give him some time to read it over. I ask if he needs anything else from me, no he says, this is fine. 

Another month goes by and I hear nothing. In this time, I'm being recruited by the director of another library, it's closer to home and possibly more responsibility, with a little more pay but not too much. He wants me to come work for him because we worked together in the past. I'm frustrated with my current job so I send him my resume. We negotiate a bit on the wage and I get him to come in at two dollars more than I'm making an hour right now. If my raise at the current place comes through, I'll still be ahead here, but I haven't applied to the other job yet, so I say I'll think about it and look it over when it gets posted for real.

Today, I come into work and find that the board meeting notes have been posted for tomorrow. We're a public organization so all of this information is public as well. I read through the fifty or so pages of notes look for any reference to my raise. There it is, at the bottom: an extra 2 dollars an hour.

On one hand, I'm happy that I finally got a raise, and looking at the rest of my co-workers, no one's pay raise this year comes close to mine (excluding full-time employees).

On the other hand, this is bullshit. I was given the run-around for over a year, and no one even bothered to talk to me. And then, when they finally decided to give me a raise, they came in below what I asked without even giving me a chance to counter. Hell, no one has told me to my face I'm even getting this raise and it will be approved by our board tomorrow. 

This whole saga has just had me feeling underappreciated and unhappy about how communication in this place works. I'm tempted to take the job at the other library, even though the pay is the same, just in the hopes that the compensation plan isn't as convoluted and messed up.

Am I being an arrogant kid who should be happy with what he got? Am I stupid for thinking of leaving my current job for a new, unknown one, with no additional pay (immediately?) Or was I crazy to have followed around and stayed for this long where I'm at.

At the end of the day, I just don't feel appreciated here, even after this increase. Too little, too late. Maybe I'm wrong. "

I'm wondering if recruiters care at all about this? Should I go out of my way to bring up this aspect (e.g. I could say something like ""shows ability to adapt to different teams and work cultures"")? Or is it not worth the extra space/bullet on my resume/coverletter, or extra time when talking to an interviewer?

9geovl,34,2018-09-16,"[19/F] I Hate College, But I'm Expected To Go...And Pay For It Myself.",sarabethg99,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9geovl/19f_i_hate_college_but_im_expected_to_goand_pay/,"I'm sorry for this being a long post, but I feel like there's a lot of context necessary to fully understand my situation.

Just like everyone else here, I'm feeling defeated, without a sense of direction, and I need some guidance/advice.  Let me give you a little bit of context: my mom died when I was seventeen and one of her ""dying wishes"" was for me, her youngest, to successfully get through college, probably because my older sister took about ten years to get through college and my older brother didn't go at all and can barely support himself.  Because of that, among other things, I feel an immense amount of pressure to stay in college.  Over the past year that I've been in college, between two schools, because I dropped out of one not knowing what to do and switched to another still not knowing, I've already accumulated about $10k in student loan debt, that I feel is a complete waste and that I'll have to pay back.  My family puts a ton of pressure on me to be in school, but also expects that I pay for it by myself without any help, which is extremely frustrating because the idea of taking on tens of thousands of dollars in debt as a young adult scares me, especially when I have no idea what I want to do.  Having a balance on my personal credit card scares me enough, the idea of huge loans scares me even more.

Fast-forward to today: I now live with my older sister instead of living on campus (see: me being afraid to take on too much debt) and it works out that I don't have to pay her rent since I'm still in school.  The deal has always been that as soon as I'm out of school, I need to pay rent.  That's reasonable enough for me.  When I tried to confide in her about this whole issue, she got upset with me for not wanting to be in college and discouraged me from even thinking about temporarily dropping out.

Here's the thing: I hate college.  I have hated college for the past year that I've been in it.  I hate most of the people, I've had a harder time making friends than any other time in my life, I haven't been able to experience college because I work so much on top of it that I can't enjoy it, because since my mom died other than not paying rent I'm on my own when it comes to any other expense in my life, and I hate the fact that I can't decide what I want to do.  I hate how expensive college is, and all I can ever think about is the amount of debt I'll be in when I leave, and fear that I won't be able to pay it back or that I'll never be able to get a job.  I'm basically on my own out here, trying to give everyone what they want from me and trying to keep myself sane at the same time, and if I decide to take a break from college, I'm not sure if I'll be able to sustain myself, and everyone in my life will be extremely upset and disappointed in me.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to move out on my own to prove them wrong, but I also don't want to live with someone that's not supportive of my choices if I do decide to take a break.

So yeah, I've been playing with the idea of taking a break from school to get my head out of such an anxious and depressed state and really think about what I want to do with my life.  I have two big interests: sales/marketing, and computer science.  At my first college, I went for computer science but was afraid that I wouldn't like it as a career path, and dropped out because they didn't have business.  At my new school, I'm studying advertising and marketing communications, but once again I'm afraid that it's not the right path for me, even though I know I enjoy the field, I just am way too afraid to commit to it.  The problem with my college is that there are very few ""gen-eds"", and the whole curriculum is so major-focused that there isn't enough space in a schedule of graduating on-time to be able to explore other fields.  So while I know I want to do some kind of path that involves software and sales/marketing, I have no idea which one I want to do, what my major should be, and if I should take a break to really think on it or not.

I enjoy real-world applications to things much more than I enjoy sitting in a classroom and being talked at.  While I love marketing, I dread going to my marketing courses every day because they just feel remedial and pointless.  I've learned more in real-world settings than I can ever learn in a textbook or from a professor, and everything you want to know is online for free nowadays anyway, which frustrates me even more about paying for college.  I work in a sales job right now part-time, and I really enjoy sales.  Because of the way my high school was structured, I have already completed a summer internship at a marketing firm, and I really enjoyed some of the work I did, but at the same time I was really bored and felt trapped and sick and anxious sitting at a desk 8 hours per day.  I used to do robotics in high school and really enjoy coding and learning new things about computers, but also fear that I'll end up in a job where I'm sitting at a desk all day and I dread that if I do software engineering or computer science.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, because this situation just has me frustrated and more depressed than usual.  I hate the looming pressure that's sitting over me and I have no idea how to solve this.

\[edit\] tl;dr: i feel like i'm wasting my money on college, have a lot of family pressure to go, and want to find a way to combine technology/software engineering with marketing and sales."

I've worked a few software internships the past couple of summers, and all of them I got via my university's career fair. I currently have an offer from the company I interned at this past summer, and I'm thinking of accepting. My only concern is this job is located in southern california. but I know eventually I'll want to move to the east coast in a couple years (Raleigh/Durham or DC) for personal reasons. For some context, I was born &amp; raised in the midwest and currently am finishing up school here.

Moving to SoCal will of course be a huge life change but I'd be excited to do it. The only thing holding me back from accepting this offer is hesitation about how possible working in cali will make it to move to an east coast job later on. This company, while large (&gt;$2 billion) isn't the most well known name, and the work doesn't sound very exciting on paper (IT Service management software). I'm honestly not sure how I'll be able to land a job on the east coast later on, especially since

1. I won't be living in the area (yet)
2. It seems much harder to land an out-of-state job without the help of a career fair/similar event (I don't hear back from 99% of jobs that I cold apply to online, vs a much higher number of those I talk to at career fairs)
3. I'll be working in a SoCal company whose name may be unknown to the east coast companies I want to apply to

Can anyone speak to the difficulty level of switching jobs between such different regions of the US without being eagerly recruited by companies as a ""new grad""? It's clear cold applying doesn't seem to work for me, so what other ways are there to land jobs? I know networking is one, but unfortunately I don't know lots of people on the EC, and going to california means I'll likely be building my network more within that region, which I'll be leaving in a few years. Any other ideas? Or even recommendations on whether to take the offer would be greatly *greatly* appreciated- the offer expires in 5 days and I'm seriously stressed trying to make this huge life/career decision :("

I recently got out of a LDR relationship that lasted for about a year(she met someone else). I then met another girl I really liked and she ended up being more interested in someone else towards a month in.

I’m a failure when it comes to relationships.. I either pass up great opportunities, get into toxic  relationships, or they end up losing interest in me. 

I’m still a virgin(have gotten to second base), mainly because of fucked relationship situations and a shattered self worth. And I’m starting to feel like it’s getting to late for me to experience the dating scene in my prime. No women generally wants to teach a grown man things about sex. Because of this I’m depressed. 

I recently got an offer to work at one of the most renowned companies in the world, for a six month internship. It’s been a dream to work here since I was child and I’m blessed with the opportunity..

But the only reason I want to take the job is because it’s 1500 miles away from home. And by taking the job I somehow think the new environment will fix my depression and make me happy.

I currently live with my mother because I’m also working full time in another professional internship so I’m not actually in school this semester(if I was I would have my own apartment).. I love my mother, but at 22 living here strengthens my feelings of being a failure. 

I have everything else going for me, but my experience with women is completely fucked.. not necessarily a lack of experience, but it always ends up toxic or me heart broken. I’ve never had a successful “true” relationship where I was genuinely happy last over 2 months. 

Sometimes I feel like running away and starting fresh somewhere else.. And I feel like this job can offer something similar to that. Alongside great experience and awesome pay. 

Will accepting this job and living in this new environment be beneficial to my overall mental health? Will the mere fact that I did travel across the country and live on my own for six months and work on at renowned / dream company make me happy? Or will it do nothing and I’m just gonna to be depressed in a different time zone?

I’m a failure when it comes to relationships and I’m starting to think it’s too late. I got a job offer across the country and I’m thinking of accepting it in hopes to fix my problems with my self worth. "

Thought this would be an appropriate place to post this. I wrote a simple API wrapper for the Rutgers bus API. The wrapper is written in Node.js and can be installed as a node package for any third party projects or applications

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first attempt at building something open source and as a recently graduated CS student from Rutgers, I know its pretty competitive and everyone is always looking for stuff to work on something that will boost their resume (contributing to open source looks good to a lot of employers) for internships or jobs after graduation. So not only does this serve as something  to work on but it actually will help in keeping access to the rutgers api up to date with the latest tech. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now the wrapper has a handful of functions for interacting with the buses and getting predictions and things like that. I'm hoping to add the other API services in further releases as well (or maybe people in the Rutgers CS community would like to take that on as a project....) but right now its just pulling information about the buses.

So I finished university 4 months ago with a degree in a area that I have no absolute no interest in. Honestly, the only reason I didn't drop out was I would have absolute nothing going for me in my life, so I kept lying to myself and telling myself it's gonna get better....... it didn't. By the end I had lost all interest and was barley going to class but still managed to pass with slightly above average grades. I hated the course and university the entire time I was there, no doubt they were the worst 3 years of my life I reconected with a girl from high school who transferred into my course who ended up basically using me to get over her ex, then ditched when she couldn't get over him for another guy who is very similar to her ex (not my proudest moment) and had almost 0 friends at university (We don't live at university in Australia, go there like you would go to school and go home). I didn't go to the graduation ceremony, despite my parents pleading me to go and take them because they felt I had achieved something important. Honestly, I didn't think it was a much of a achievement at all. I (who I would describe as average intelligence at most, who was usually surrounded by lazy kids throughout high school who made me look way smarter than I actually am) spent 3 years half assing it and still finished with above average grades... What does that say about the course and the type of people doing it?  

Anyways, fast forward to now. I have no clue what the hell I'm going to do with my life, I see all my friends and people around me moving forwards in their lives, weather it's getting new jobs in their fields, getting into new relationships, starting their own businesses or travelling the world or getting internships in amazing countries. While I am exactly where I was years ago, working at a part time retail job making half decent money while I continue to live at home with my parents like a total looser. 

I know they say you should be happy to see other people succeed, and most times I am, especially when I see my friends succeeding. But it doesn't mean it doesn't make me feel like absolute worthless piece of trash. I wouldn't say I'm depressed (I would know, I studied it!!) but very close to it. Some days are just sooo bad. I feel miserable all day and exhausted without having done anything, frustrated, angry and in shitty moods constantly and usually taking it out on my family members (with whom my relationships have slowly deteriorated). 

I have a small but good group of friends (which im cool with but find it diffcult to open up about this kinda stuff) and I'm constantly trying to expand my friendship groups, but it's super difficult when you're pissed off and exhausted 24/7 not to mention meeting new girls with this attitude usually sets me up for spectacular failures.

I've been reading and listening to self help books daily trying to improve myself as a person and love myself, but it's just soo hard and I can't understand why. Have no idea what the hell I'm meant to do with my life (only ideas I have usually tend to be unrealistic or childish) and feel like I have accomplished nothing in my life (or at least what a imagined I would've accomplished by now). Feel like a total failure compared to people around me and a major disappointment to my parents. My life is nothing like what I want it to be and I am nothing like what I know deep down I am capable of. Any advice on what the actual fuck I can do to turn my life around  and live a happier life and figure out what the hell I'm meant to do with my life??? Major thanks to anyone in advance who read my long ass post, much appreciated. U da real MVP!"
9gj7pg,10,2018-09-17,How do I explain a long gap since graduating and also having no CS job experience during school due to depression in an interview?,jdawggey,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/9gj7pg/how_do_i_explain_a_long_gap_since_graduating_and/,"I graduated with my CS degree about 9 months ago. It took me 5.5 years and I didn't have any summer internships (just food service jobs), so I have no career related job experience. I spent most of college very depressed and anxious, so I wasn't able to apply myself much or be proactive in any real way. 

Since graduating and moving home, I spent roughly the first six months in a deep depression, where I started a lot of projects, as well as a portfolio website and some applications, but didn't finish any of them or send any applications out. 

In the last three months, the help I've gotten has taken hold and I'm doing a lot better, which is awesome, but I don't know how to explain what I've been doing since I graduated. All of the personal projects I've ever started have gone nowhere and I really have very little to say other than that I slept a lot and watched a lot of YouTube videos. I played a lot of music, but that's not particularly relevant, it's just the most productive thing I've done in this time. 

How do I approach this? I would imagine there are plenty of people in CS with similar situations, so I figured this sub could give me a little boost since this is kind of the last thing really holding me back from hitting the application game really hard. 

Thanks to anyone who responds!"

Job hunt is demoralizing.,LoveThatShirt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9gjfff/finished_my_masters_degree_at_the_end_of_august/,"I finished my masters degree just a little over 2 weeks ago. I started applying for jobs as soon as I gave my thesis. No luck yet. My masters and bachelors are related to psychology and medicine. Graduated with very high results from both (First and Distinction). I am shooting for a career in research. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most jobs in research seem to want years and years of experience, which I don't have. I started applying for all kinds of jobs outside of my field. So far only done 4 interviews for 'marketing' jobs, which turned out to be scams (door to door sales, only paying commission). 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting to feel like an absolute failure. I regret not starting the search earlier, but my masters was so demanding (it was at a Russell Group university) that I could barely manage that, let alone interviews and applications. I'm hearing people who secured jobs starting right away after graduation, and am beating myself up for not starting the job hunt earlier. I got an apartment in London until the end of September, to allow me to look for jobs here. I feel like I would disappoint my family and cause financial burden if I don't find something right away, but aside from sending hundreds of applications I don't know what to do. I can't afford unpaid internships right now, as I have to finance my living completely by myself from now on, no more help from home. I don't know what to do..

&amp;#x200B;

Should I get an apartment for another month and keep looking? I also am starting a medical treatment here in about a month, so I can't really leave. What do?"

Less than 2 years out of college (computer engineering) and while it took me 5 months to get a job, I have a great job and great life now. The 5 months was including the fact I had a god awful GPA, and no internship or co-op and really only averaged 5-10 applications a week over that whole period. 

My first position was in Firmware engineering and I quite liked it and the company. Sadly that project got downsized and they had to migrate a lot of people to other projects. Luckily we had a great project manager who put in a lot of work to find us *all* position on other projects. So I got placed on a project as a junior SWE and Ive been loving it. I dont know much yet. But I enjoy the work, the people, and the company. Overall, I have a fantastic work-life balance, can afford my lifestyle, have a great wife, friends, and an awesome dog. 

So my point is. Yes, it sometimes does work out. Not every company is a shit hole. Not everyone is miserable. And you dont have to be top 1% to have a good life. I hope this makes some of you feel better. "

I transferred from community college back in 2016 to a 4 year school and I am in my final year at last. I've had to take breaks for various personal reasons.

Although I am still in school, my program is for working adults and I am two months unemployed. I've had two internships this year doing IT support as well as Systems Administration in both just getting done the last one in the middle of July. I've worked with documenting network infrastructure, supporting users, performing security remediation for various threats in accordance with annual penetration tests, Active Directory Management, Office 365 administration, and even managed permissions for SQL databases. I was feeling good when I was still working and feeling like I'm moving forward.

My performance was somewhat inadequate because I have social anxiety but do my best to fight it. I don't believe my bosses at my last internship would want to give me good reference because I have screwed up a lot there. I also have bad depression so I wasn't motivated the whole time but I still tried to do what I could. My biggest fear is basically not being able to find a permanent job because a lot of positions near me are contract positions some also require 5+ years. Thats gonna be a lot of internships. I guess I'd like to get into systems administration or I'd like to work in security because I really enjoyed doing that work. Right now my goal is just a job to support myself and I'm feeling a little scared and hopeless because I'm not getting calls back. I'd like advice on what to do.

I'm an international 2nd year university student currently pursuing a computer-science-related bachelor at some small university somewhere in North America. Due to granted credits, I will graduate at the end of my third year which means that next summer is my only opportunity to get an internship before graduation. Therefore, I spend most of my days applying to Software Engineering Internships for summer 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing that the computer science department at my university is pretty small, we have no career fairs, no assigned recruiters from any company and on top of that I have no ""friends"" that can refer me to any recruiter. To me, it is not a problem since it gave me the opportunity to be close to my CS teachers and the dean. I try to attend as many events as possible (even though there isn't a lot of them in my area) and try to work both on my network and my resume on my own. I started programming four years ago and taught myself web development and C++ progressively over the years. At university, I have been granted credits for some classes since I already had experience with computer science and became a Teacher Assistant this year. I really try to learn as much as possible and am very dedicated to computer science with my interest leaning towards software engineering. Aside from school, I have personal projects and I started uploading my new and will upload my future projects on GitHub. Right now, I feel like I am not as knowledgeable and experienced as I could be and definitely don't have the most impressive resume, but I'm working on it and I know that I need to keep putting the effort over time.

&amp;#x200B;

I already applied to many big companies in the US including Big Ns, major financial corporations, tech unicorns and big startups through LinkedIn job postings. However, I have the impression that I am just sending my resume into a ""black hole"" with a very low probability of hearing back from them. Moreover, since I'm an international student, I would require sponsorship to work in the U.S. Even though the U.S often grant visas to people from my original country, the need to be sponsored doesn't help. For this reason, I started applying in other countries too.

&amp;#x200B;

So, my questions are: what would you do in my situation? How can I increase my chances of getting an internship that would give me experience and add value to my resume? How can I improve my current resume?

When I was started out looking for internships freshman year, it was really difficult as recruiting was a very confusing, frustrating, and competitive process. It would have helped significantly if I had a mentor of sorts to guide me through the process. I had many questions – how to choose small/medium/big companies, what to look for in an internship, what areas to focus on – that often went unanswered.

Fast forward three years, and I can safely say that I have experienced CS internship recruiting to the fullest. I have been  through countless interviews, received job offers (and 2-3x as many rejections!), and interned at some cool companies over the summers.

I would like to share my experiences with everyone, especially junior CS majors that are starting out with the process. I'm wondering what the *best* way is to go about doing this. Would it be a QA forum, making videos, writing articles, etc? I am really invested in this, so any advice would be appreciated."
9glqgl,1,2018-09-17,My Co-Worker is Very Interested in Everything I do.,Guprodigy1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9glqgl/my_coworker_is_very_interested_in_everything_i_do/,"Hi! Long time advice requester here. I always get great input here so I thought maybe someone could help. I started working at this new Job and I really like the work, but I have a coworker who has exhibited some aggressive, unpleasant, and downright mean behavior...Which through me off because I'm usually the ""weird "" one in the office, not because of anything I do, just my interests and tricks I use to stay motivated / positive. He was recently promoted to another type of work within the company but it is still related to what I do.  Sorry for the long backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

But before his promotion when we had the same job, he would do things like threaten to drag me out of the office by my neck if I ever did anything like the guy who lost his cool at my last job (he over heard me telling the story to a coworker). Then when I made a joke about it (thinking he was joking) he insisted I stop laughing and take him seriously, ""If I know whats good for me"". This was on my third day in the office. Every day after that was followed by intense, loud, and public verbal reprimands in front of other teams, the interns, clients, anyone who was around when he was mad at me. This was particularly humiliating

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I don't drive and our office isn't really near anything enticing, so I just kind of surf the net or check Facebook or listen to music in my headphones or read an article on my lunch break. I cleared this with my boss and he was fine with it. But my boss didn't clear it with my co-worker... who just yelled at me about it every day for about 6 months despite me explaining it over and over. After a while he would come over at lunch time and pretend to make small talk...then try to subversively take a picture of my screen without me noticing, before heading to lunch himself. I found out from my boss that he was sending the pictures to him in order to complain about me. He constantly monitored my phone calls as well and would yell at me if he didn't like how they went **(he is not a supervisor or my boss in any way mind you)**

&amp;#x200B;

After a full year of the public humiliation and sneaky pics of my screen, and training the interns to ignore my instruction and lecturing me about only putting serious things on my white board. I explained all of this to management and they were livid with him and we had this long horrible meeting. He admitted that he was deliberately trying to shame me in front of everyone in some misguided attempt to get me to behave the way he thought I should. He also admitted to canceling my assignments to interns without telling anyone and he admitted to taking pictures of my computer screen and erasing my whiteboard. **\*\*\*But even after all of this the only actual acknowledged solution was that we BOTH need to communicate better and all of this stuff was just a simple misunderstanding between people who got off on the wrong foot.\*\*\*. A big gripe I had was In another meeting to help us with ""communication"" the manager I spoke to about the coworker insinuated that the physical threat from him was simply me misinterpreting his direct and blunt way of communicating...completely ignoring that he confirmed he was serious about the threat and admonished me for not considering it a threat initially.**

&amp;#x200B;

Now that he has been reprimanded he no longer stages public  situations so that he can embarrass me in front of everyone. But now, he just looks for ""mistakes"" and makes angry grunts or sighs or makes some unpleasant remark after I hang up on a call for example, I had to schedule something for either Monday or Wednesday and the person I was speaking with couldn't do anything for that whole week, but my coworker only heard me ask about Monday so he let out a big sigh and says, ""you forgot about Wednesday"". I ignored him... Another example is when I was walking by while he and a manager were talking about a training event and who would do it. The manager suggest I do it, as I was the only other one in the office at the time, and my co-worker responds, ""No, Gup can't stay on focus"". I've done like 50 perfect training sessions and he hasn't sat in on any of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't go to management and complain a second time...I don't want to be that guy. Is there anything else I can do? His new bad behavior bothers me way less than his old behavior... Should I just accept it as better than it used to be and go with it? Or should I just wait him out until he is tired of me and bothers someone else?

I'm hoping those who have had some experience in the software engineering industry give me some career advice on how I should approach my current situation. I was doing a software engineering internship during the summer with a well known fin-tech firm and I received a full time offer through the internship. My problem is that I prefer to be near family unless the salary is much more than what I would get near my hometown. My current location offer is for $67k and the salary for someone doing the same thing as me for where I'm from is $100k.

Should I take this offer or try to apply to other companies near my home? I'm a senior CS student and I'm grateful that I have a job offer, but I'm not really sure if that is a good salary for an entry position(average on glassdoor is higher) especially since others are getting a higher salary just because of their location doing the same thing as me. What I'm troubled with is that if this $67k salary is common then I don't want to run the risk of rejecting and either not get accepted into other companies or go through a tedious interview process only to receive the same salary offer in the end.

9gokuh,3,2018-09-17,[CA] Former friend/boss leaving negative &amp; untruthful job references due to personal falling out,badnotgoodreference,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9gokuh/ca_former_friendboss_leaving_negative_untruthful/,"A few years ago I worked at a small company as an intern. My friend &amp; roommate at the time worked there full-time and subsequently acted as my immediate boss. Later, we both moved away and for various reasons (nothing specific, different life paths, etc.), we ended the relationship on a sour note - not speaking since. Over the years, it's clear there was some resentment on their end, but for all I knew we had ""moved on.""  


Earlier this year, I was applying for another job in the field and listed someone else who worked at the previous job as a reference. Unfortunately, I found out they referred my potential employer to my ex-friend mentioned above. I found out they wrote a scathing reference attacking my character ('no integrity') with untruthful allegations ('never showed up to work'), among many other things.

The company ended up hiring me anyway because my other references were excellent, and I would have probably never even found out. 

Other than the personal effects (it absolutely sucks to know that someone in the world hates you that much), it's absolutely unfair that she is in a position to potentially ruin my professional reputation and future employment due to personal resentment.

I have the following to support my case:
- the written reference
- potentially other former coworkers (who were in higher positions) who would vouch for me
- personal messages from the end of our friendship of them threatening to expose and ruin me if our lives ever cross again

I'm not trying to provoke anything, personally or legally, nor do I have any immediate damages right now. I'm just trying to protect myself professionally and prevent her from attempting to defame me without consequence in any way in the future, since my previous experience there is directly related to my line of work. Honestly, I never thought they would go so low and based on what I know, am genuinely afraid of what they are further capable of.

Is this a good case for the classic cease-and-desist letter, or are there other options? Do I run any risk pursuing this matter?

Thanks in advance r/legaladvice

I have also been working as a software engineering intern at a medium-sized company for almost one year. For a variety of reasons, I'd like to explore other job options.

I have had good experiences with the company and my co-workers, my boss included. I have learned new things at this company. I have also built them software which is expected to save them a lot of money. About three weeks ago my employer told me he would be making me an offer, soon. While I'm not exactly unhappy at this company, I do feel a bit undervalued in my current position and that I do feel that am ready for some change. I'd at least like to have some offers for negotiation.

I have started several job applications, but I am waiting to submit them because I'm not sure what to put for the ""May we contact this employer?"" field. I know this is somewhat in my head, but if I say no then I feel it looks to an employer that I might have some kind of shady past. If I say yes then it looks to my current employer that I'm doing a ton of job hunting.

Should I be listing my boss as a reference for my current position in the experience sections of job apps even though I am aware he will be making me an offer?

I went to a very solid business school, and was a top graduate there. However, due to some bad luck, I never got that many big time internships. Despite these struggles, I got a really nice full-time job at a small firm. I want to keep this as vague as possible, but for a point of reference, let's say I work at a boutique place that does real estate investments. This is a really dynamic firm that does pretty oversized deals for its amount of employees, and there's a few local legends in the industry here. The only problem? I'm not doing the role I want. My goal is to be on the investment decision side of the business, but for now, I'm just doing 'portfolio support' work, ensuring clients are happy, filing paperwork, etc. 

The truth is, all of my bosses started out here. I believe they hired me, a new grad, with the hope of grooming me for an investment focused role later on. They actually told me that explicitly. If not, the experience and company name I'm getting is worth a lot in itself - due to the small size of the company I get a ton of exposure to different industry figures and diverse tasks in the company. So if a spot doesn't open up, I'm sure I can transition this into a somewhat exciting role elsewhere. 

I'm not even a full 6 months in, and I've already received a 10% raise (bringing my base salary to a very solid level). During some unusual circumstances, I basically covered two experienced employees and did a really good job. My boss (a director) has told me that he is really pleased. And yet, I'm getting a bit antsy to move into the type of role I want. If I knew for sure that I'd get it one day, I wouldn't be stressed. But I don't want to stay in this type of role forever; despite my age and inexperience, I can privately say that I have a better grasp of the industry big picture than 90% of the veterans in similar roles to me. Not to mention that I have a killer education. It's not even really about the money or prestige, what I hate is that I can't be included in the conversations about the stuff I'm most passionate about (the financial and business strategy side of it). 

And yet, I can see how bad it looks from the outside. My colleagues in the jobs I want all did similar stuff to me for at least 2 years. And I still have a **lot** to learn, despite having good raw talent. Does anybody have any tips? "
9gpbea,1,2018-09-17,"[CA] Landlord refuses to pay back a security deposit, will my case in small claims court be dismissed if I don't have a rental agreement/contract?",Dora_De_Destroya,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9gpbea/ca_landlord_refuses_to_pay_back_a_security/,"Hello Reddit sorry for the formatting. I am on mobile and yes I know how stupid I am for not having a copy of my rental agreement. 

TL;DR I want to go to small claims court for $390 for a security deposit but I do not have a rental agreement, or anything on paper. I do have text messages of my landlord agreeing to pay me back on September 15. I also have bank statements for 390, and the bank of America ""zelle"" transfer i used when paying the security deposit.


Last year I was in the last year of my Uni, and needed to take a 16 hr/week internship to graduate and get my degree. I couldn't afford to live on campus, and could not move back in with my parents  so I decided to rent a room in a person's home who only charged me $500 a month for rent, and $500 for the security deposit. Since I was despacito I decided to take his offer and moved in the following day. A year went by and everything was fine. We would talk and sometimes watch movies together and never had an issue. 

 I then graduated college, and am now working for the county in a decent paying job. I gave him a month notice, and asked him what it would take to get my full deposit back. He stated to ""mop the floors and clean the walls"" and I wouldn't have an issue. I moved out on July 31st and on August 16th I sent him this text.

*Hey, I was wondering if you can get me the security deposit by this weekend? I'm going out of town, so it would be great to have some money for it*

He never responded. On August 21st I sent him:

*Morning, I guess you didn't get my last message. But I was wondering when you might have my deposit ready?*

After I sent this message, I requested $350 as a transfer of money from the bank of America app.

On August 22nd he sent me the following text:

*Hey man sorry about that. I need a couple more weeks. I quit my job and all the bills are piling up. *

I replied with:

How much is a couple more weeks? I don't mind giving you time, but it's just alot of money for me to not care about.

He then said *Mid September. Did you ever find the contract* (the rental agreement)

I said : 

""September 15th work for you? And Nope, I just requested $350 so you can do two payments for me. Since we aren't sure of the actual security deposit amount,  let's just leave it a $400. I remember paying $500, but since we don't have the paperwork, I'll take $400 so there's no issue or involving court or anything. ""

He said: *sounds good thanks* 

And it ended there.

Fast forward to September 14, I send him a friendly reminder of the money and dint get a response.

On the 15th I send him a request for $400 through bank of America.  He never paid.

On the 16th, I place multiple phone calls and he doesn't answer any if the . I then tell him if he doesn't pay I'll have to file a claim with small claims court . 

He never responds.


When I first moved in, I payed about $890. I paid $500 for first months rent, and $390 in security deposit. (I have an email from bank of America where in the note I wrote ""390/500 partial security deposit"". Since payday was the following week, I then paid the additional $110 for the security deposit, although I think I paid in cash because I do not have a transfer email of that money. Since I only have ""proof"" on the $390, that's what I will file my claim for. 

My question to you Reddit is if emails and text messages will hold up in small claims court."

That being the case I've started applying to internships that could *potentially* evolve into a full time job that I would otherwise not be qualified for.

In this situation, I would still like to be pursuing the other career level opportunities while maintaining the internship.

Is there an eloquent way to bring this up with the potential employer without sounding like a flake?

I'm primarily concerned that I would need to have interviews (phone and in person) during business hours. Also if I were to receive an offer, would I be able to field the offer/start date without disappearing on the company that I interned with."

How do I learn all this stuff by my self now? I tried to learn Spring, but it was way harder than anything I've learned before and there is no good and structured resources to learn. Currently, I know Java and C++ (college classes covered OOP, algorithms, pointers, etc.) and I've dabbled a little bit with python and javascript. I learned VBA and SQL during my internship (I'm an engineering major, not CS).       
Also, I don't want to work with front end development. Ideally, I would like to work in back end dev, data science or game dev, but I have no idea how do I get the sufficient skills to find an entry level position in any of them in a short period of time (I'm finishing college this year).

* BS in Computer Science in 2 years with a heavy but not insane course load
   * Pros: College less expensive, more intensive academics, join the real world earlier
   * (Possible)Cons: Lack experience internship and project wise leading me to have trouble finding a job, join the real world earlier.
* Double major with something interesting(Phys/Math/Stat?) in 4 years .
   * Pros: More words on my degree, more fun math, wider breadth
   * (Possible)Cons: Second major, though fun and useful, might not outweigh the cost of an extra two years of college tuition
* Finish degree in three years with not super heavy course load and time for a minor

The two main questions I'm trying to figure out is

1. Would graduating early greatly affect someone's chances at landing a job since they lack internships/projects/experience (compared to someone who has had four years to build projects/get internships/experience)?
2. Are there any merits in completing a double degree that would outweighs an extra \~40K in tuition money?

&amp;#x200B;

My main areas of interest is in Machine Learning and AI so I realize that I might need a bit more than a bachelors to do that. I was thinking that maybe finishing my bachelors early would be beneficial since I could start a Masters earlier but right now I think I should worry about getting a job first and then maybe down the line going to graduate school."

I’m a student in ENV faculty and last term was my 2B term. I’m writing this because I feel like I have some problematic eating behaviors which have negatively impacted my everyday life. I personally don’t think it’s a case of anorexia. From what I know, this illness stems from a fear of becoming fat, which definitely doesn’t apply to me. I’ve never been overweight in my life, not even close. My highest record was about 45kg and the most recent physical examination I had was 2 years ago and I weighed 42kg (93lbs) at that time (my height is 1.63cm [5’3’’-5’4’’] btw). I’m also not the type of people who have an obsession with body shape. 
 
Looking back, there were some signals as early as first year. I lived in V1 and had light meal plan (the cheapest one, about $2,200 iirc) and after two terms I still had about $800 in my balance while I already felt like I had eaten a lot. I went back to my country in summer and some relatives of mine said they were shocked to see how thin I became. I didn’t think it was a big deal as I thought I was just being too lazy to eat or just forgot to eat, just like many other students did. 

My second year started and I was doing ok in fall term, but things went down in winter as my desire for eating plunged to a new low. I already only ate one meal per day before, but beginning at winter I sometimes ate even less. I started doing weird things I had never done before: I found myself feeling tired very often and was reluctant to get out of bed even though I was very hungry, but I still remained in bed and forced myself to fall asleep again so as to ignore the sense of hungriness. Sometimes when my stomach shrank too strongly I would just lie in my bed, searching for images of food using my phone instead of getting out of bed and getting myself some real food. I just looked at the pictures as if I had actually eaten the food being shown. This is bizarre since I never had the habit of searching for photos of food before. I could feel that I was hungry everyday but I just couldn't feed myself enough food. I also reduced the number of times going out, like I didn't have enough energy to walk out of my apartment. I still went out to do my lab assignments every week, but I started skipping some lectures. One night before a midterm when I was showering, again hungrily, I felt a sudden dizziness and could barely get myself out of the bathroom. When I finally reached my bed I fell asleep immediately. I missed the midterm but I thought I could try passing the course without this 20% so I ended up not explaining the situation to the prof (I didn't have proof anyway). Turned out I was a few percent away from passing this course, I really shouldn't have missed the midterm. I enrolled in three courses that term and failed two, the second one was due to not writing the final exam. It was, again, completely my fault as I should've just taken care of myself better. As I said before I reduced the number of times going out during winter. Sometimes even when I was running out of food I still was not willing to go out to get some groceries. I didn't know what was wrong with me, but I always felt like I was too tired to go outdoors even for just a while (where I lived was only a few minutes walk from plaza). During the storm days in mid to late April I only ate 2 breads for four days (those were the only food left in my room), plus a bar of chocolate bought from the vending machine in the lobby of my apartment. Normally I don't even like this kind of snacks, I bought it only because I could get it by just going downstairs to the lobby without having to leave the apartment. Anyway I was in a low state of health and I didn't write the exam, but I really didn't think it was a legitimate reason so I also didn't tell anyone about this. 

I went back to my country after the term and got myself a full-time internship. I wasn't in coop so this job wasn't necessary for me. I didn't tell my parents the major reason I suddenly wanted to live a fixed 9-5 schedule was that I felt like this could be a way to bring me back to the right track. I was originally planning to stay in the school to do another study term, but I guessed this could only exacerbate my situation: I would just continue starving and isolating myself in my room. But if I live with my family and have a job I would be 'forced' to eat and go out regularly. It did work to some extent but I still didn't eat like a normal person does. I had some really nice colleagues at work and they would invite me to have lunch at cafeteria together. However, I found myself intentionally avoiding eating with them cuz I threw away at least half of my lunch everyday and I didn't want them to know. Thanks to my family I couldn't skip any meal at home but it seemed like I couldn't enjoy what they cook anymore, and although I didn't skip meals I still ate less than usual per meal). Also, I often said no when my mom/friends asked me to eat out with them. All of these are so strange, considering how much I loved eating when I was younger. Now it seems like I had lost most of my appetite. I tried my best to behave normally when at home only because I felt an obligation to do so. I don't know what my current weight is, as I said the last time I stepped on a scale was 2 years ago. I know I have become even thinner by just looking into the mirror and hearing other people comment on my body shape. One friend of mine has always been underweight due to some kind of illness. She usually weighs around 38kg, sometimes it can go down to as low as 36kg. We had a meet-up this spring and she said she thought I was thinner than her. 

I made a wrong decision last term: in addition to working full-time (although it was just a two-month internship; could've been longer but I fell ill at the end of June for a whole week so I chose to stop), I enrolled in online courses and only passed one. I wasn't intended to take online courses in the first place but since I failed two courses in winter term I felt like I should get caught up ---- turns out I really shouldn't have. I should've waited til I'm in a better state of health. Anyway I'm on a non-degree term now and the email I received says that I can apply for readmission after withdrawing from the school for two terms. My advisor said I may try petitioning if there were extenuating circumstances, but I don't have any proof to support myself. I didn't tell anything to my parents; I only have surface level friendships with some of my classmates, some of them know that I eat like a bird but they're not really aware of the actual struggle I've been going through; and I have never used any relevant health services so no doctor's notes. In fact I'm fine with the school's decision, tbh I always feel that Waterloo shouldn't have accepted me in the first place. Petitioning or not, I do consider going to Health Services cuz some signs of my body are really not good. Now that I'm back in Canada and live by myself I begin to starve myself again unconsciously: if I don't force myself to consume more, my daily calories intake just won't exceed 500. My menstrual cycle has been a total mess and the change in the length of period has been worrying. Fortunately I don't have other problems like binge eating or purging.

Due to some errors occurred in my bank account, I had trouble paying tuition and had just become Fees Arranged yesterday, so I haven't received my SLF card's pdf for this term and I don't know when I will get that. I guess I can't go to Health Services without it, so I choose to write a post first to make me feel better. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone here has similar experiences or has any suggestions and is willing to share. Thank you very much :)"

When reviewing resumes there are always some comments saying “gpa low” if you have a 3.0 graduating gpa (3.0/4.0) or a little above is that actually THAT bad? 

Someone in my family works for a big aerospace and defense company in the USA, top 5 id say. He is an executive and often conducts interviews, when I asked him if he pays attention to GPA / what program his applicants come from he says he often just pays attention to experience, of course if the GPA is alarming then that is a different story. Is judging by GPA heavy just a finance/ big 4 / F500 “trend”? He also hires some younger guys, so I am assuming right out of college. 

Say I graduate from a top 3 cal state school with a degree in finance and a minor in Computer Science 3.0-3.2 GPA w/ 1 internship over my senior year. Will I have that much of an issue finding employment? 


I obviously don’t expect to be handed a high paying job out of the blue, and I understand good grades will show your competence in the field when you have a lack of industry experience. 

It’s scary thinking how saturated finance is sometimes.

Maybe at a smaller company.,ksnh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9grrpz/how_much_experience_do_companies_look_for_in/,"I'm learning only basic Python and JS this semester and Scala next semester through college courses, but I've been self-studying a bit of JS. However, it looks like most companies look for Python, Java and some sort of C language (C or C++). I was also looking at a really small amount of iOS development but put that on hold and I don't think it's relevant for most internships companies are offering. I've also been auditing my school's next level course for Java, but it's for people who already knew a bit of Java (they're changing the curriculum), but I'm having trouble keeping up and understanding some topics.

I'll continue to study JS but what should I try to focus on language-wise/how should I divide my focus to improve my chances? Is one language fine or multiple? What sort of projects can I do to bolster my resume/how much experience do they look for in the language?

Thanks!"

I was living with my boyfriend at the time and my dog, a medium goldendoodle. 


We lived two blocks from one of the main streets. I was extremely naive. I am from the north and am always cautious there, but I put way too much trust in the south. 


Every night at about 10:30-11:00 I would walk to Walgreens by myself to get snacks for me and my boyfriend for when we smoked later. It was a really short walk, and its extremely well lit and populated at night, that is, except for my street. My street was pitch black, and even creepier the neighbors on the one side of us literally had not cut their shrubs in years and the house looked like a shack. Just flat out creepy. The only part of my walk that used to scare me. 


I was getting ready to do my normal routine and walk to Walgreens when I realized my dog needed to go out. I noticed a woman had brought her dog in the night before so I thought whatever he can come it’ll be annoying but I’ll kill two birds with one stone. 


I go outside and didn’t realize it was pouring out. Our door went straight outside, so right when I walked out I noticed a man parked almost right in front of my apartment in the middle of the street with his car running, the driver door open, and he is looking in his trunk with a police sized flashlight. 


Red flags didn’t go up at this point, as again I put too much trust in the south. I walked my dog up the street and around the block and decided not to go to Walgreens because of how hard it was raining. So I headed back home. 


When I rounded the corner there is a building that is large so you can’t see anyone coming the opposite direction. I turned and almost ran right into this man. He was wearing black jeans, a white t-shirt, and a navy hoodie. We did the awkward shuffle and I looked up to smile to suggest it’s okay and he just gave me the most sinister smile (thats the best way I can describe it). At this point a million red flags were going up and I began to get nervous. 


I think my dog sensed my nerves because he gave the guy a firm growl, a sound I had never heard from him before.  I didn’t even wait to watch the guys reaction, I just turned around and started walking, not wanting to appear scared. It was then that I realized he had left his car. I then looked in the street and saw it parked in the same spot but with the driver door and trunk open, engine running, keys in ignition. 


Finally I looked back and the man was walking towards me, fast. I tried to book it but my dog went still as a rock and growled so deep I got nervous. The man slowed down, and I kept pulling my dog. 


The man decided to go for it, and I backed up but my dog pulled me forward. He bit the guy in the calf, but didn’t puncture because jeans are tough. It hurt the guy though and he fell down. 


I guess my dog was satisfied because he turned around and sprinted home with me. I ran inside and immediately locked and dead bolted the door and shut all the blinds. 


I told my boyfriend what happened and he fully believes the man was going to kidnap me. I was skeptical, I thought maybe just trying to rob me? I then went into my internship the next day which is in an ER, so I told the doctors and nurses about it. Immediately their faces went pale. 


The one doctor said, “Charleston is not safe, it is a huge place for human trafficking. One of the largest ports, which means easy to ship girls. I know for a fact you were going to be kidnapped and sold into human trafficking” I got chills. I was so thankful but also so pissed at myself for being so stupid. 


Now looking back on it, I realize if I didn’t have my pup I probably wouldn’t be typing this right now. "

I’ve searched for internships but these internships want an unreasonable amount of experience working in the IT field (2+ years) and will label it as entry level. I have a career advisor from my college who is supposed to be helping me but if you can’t put it together she’s really not too much help hence why I’m here writing this. 

I know I got the chops to do an job in this field but I also don’t want to get a job and they have a certain expectation I know I personally couldn’t uphold to in the time period they would probably want me to. I would love to find something to get me started in the IT field but I haven’t had any luck and I really don’t want this time I spent in school to go to waste. 

This now brings me to how much should I expect to be paid starting off with my first job once I get into the IT field. I was talking to a coworker (this job is unrelated to anything I want to do long term) and he was basically telling me I was crazy for wanting to get an IT job and start at $15+/hr. He basically said that it was low and I should be aiming higher like $19-20/hr. I live in the DMV area so the potential is here. I don’t know what to expect and I don’t want to be taken advantage of because I’m clueless of what I know I should be getting paid.  

I’m sorry if this post is a little over the place. 

Things that might help you help me:
I have a good resume (if my career advisor did one thing it was help me revise it)
About 2+ years of Customer service
Familiar with macOs, Windows Os, MS Office 
I learn quickly

Please let me know if there’s anything more I can add to help you guys. I’m mostly asking for information not handouts. Nothing I look for online is really helping and it’s all subjective to the actual company doing the hiring. "

I have a job as a barista in the morning and then a paid internship during the day, and finally a waitress at a Turkish restaurant at night. As you can see, I'm completely occupied. 

This one particular day I was just not feeling it at all but really had to go as I needed the money. I was almost done with the day and my final front was the restaurant. Luckily as soon as I arrived, the owner gave me some food and asked me to be in front of a house for the first hour. During peak hours this meant attending reservation calls and getting people a table, but that day it was pretty chilled, so it was an easy job. Just as things were starting to pick up, it suddenly started pouring like no other.  As someone who loves the rain, this made me feel a bit better. However, the business was affected and things slowed down. Noticing the lack of customers, my boss, surprisingly, told me to go home as there was nothing to do. 

It was raining and I got to enjoy it at home?! This day was slowly turning around. It was around 8 pm so I decided to quickly grab some hot noodles from a local store I knew. They made their noodles crispy and spicy with extra egg for me. I also grabbed some of their fortune cookies it was always fun reading what the universe has in store for me. It was just what I needed for today. 

I rushed home, which I share with 2 other people. It was a little villa surrounded by other independent villas. It was, overall, a petty safe area. As soon as I walked in I could hear laughter from my roommate's door. So I decided to leave a few cookies for them as well. We usually shared food and whatever other treats we bought. 

I then went to my little room and got dressed in some comfy pajamas.
My room is set up so the bed is parallel to the window. The window pretty much covers the entire wall so I can see everything outside. And for a day like today with rain and lightning, it was perfect. I turned off the lights and opened the curtains just enough to see the sky but not enough for that outside to see in.

As I needed some light while I eat, I lit up a few candles and sat on my bed and ate my noodles. The noodles and the rain really made up for the slow miserable day I was having.
Soon after dinner, I  went into a deep slumber. 

At around 2 am, I heard someone knocking on the main door. Now in our house, if we ever were gonna have guests, we would inform everyone at home. I got no such message so it was extremely weird to hear knocking, especially at 2 am.

I didn't go answer it as I figured someone else in the house might know about it and open the door. A few more knocks came.
 
As I kept ignoring it, suddenly I heard someone knocking on my window.
As the curtain was covering half my window I had no idea who it was. 
Finally, I decided to get out of bed and check who it was through the main door as it was next to my bedroom.  I was careful not to step on any of the candles on the floor as they were still burning on my way out.

I looked through the peephole and no one. Nothing was there. I figured whoever knocked had left. 

I rushed back to my room. Coming back to my room I saw something that scared the absolute shit out of me. All the candles, around 7, were blown off and the curtain on my window was fully opened. 

There was zero explanation to how this could happen. Panicking and scared I decided to wake my roommates. After knocking for ages, I realized she wasn't home. Weird, as she usually is home on Tuesdays.

I went to my other roommate's door and started knocking. No response. So I opened her door to check, and sure enough, no one was there. The lights were off. 

Confused I closed her door and walked away. That's when I heard some more knocks. Except these knocks were not coming from the front door. It was coming from my friend's door I just closed. 

Extremely panicked I got a knife from the kitchen.  I didn't know what was going on. What was knocking from inside my friend's room?

Scared to go out and scared to stay in I quickly called my friend and asked them to pick me up immediately. I didn't really explain much, just that I was in trouble and needed help.

The knock has started to increase and it's becoming louder and more violent. I got extremely scared to open the door. I asked if it was my friend but no reply. I checked to see under the door but there was nothing. Just darkness. What could be knocking?!

I quickly ran and stood near the main door so I can run out as soon as my friends came to pick me. 

I am so scared. I want to run out but I just heard some more knocks. I just can't believe this but it is coming from my room. It's also growing more and more violent. 

Guys, please help me. What do u think I should do. I am so scared.

9guull,293,2018-09-18,I am a private investigator and these are some of the weird cases I have done. Part 1,RickSong1,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9guull/i_am_a_private_investigator_and_these_are_some_of/,"  

Hello people of reddit, as the title said I am a private investigator. I have been in this career for over 10 years, at first, it was quite rocky but things became decent over time. I have dealt with numerous unusual or unsettling cases in this period, and the ones I share with you guys are the unsolved ones. Of course, some of you might be wondering if it is legal for me to share these stories, since I supposed to be private after all. Well, yes I should not be sharing them, hence why I will not be using any real name, but not sharing unusual thing is a crime of itself and it's not like the people in the stories are alive to sue me anyway. 

This case was about 3 years ago. One day a young woman, whose age I later asked was 27, came into my office late, a couple of minute prior to me leaving. She was clean looking, wearing office work attire and her body rich of perfume. She was nervous, a bit unstable but was not a junkie based on the looks.  

She told me that somebody had been stalking her and she needed protection. I told her I was a private investigator, not a bodyguard and that she should report whatever she had to the police. The woman, let's call her Elly, said that she already did call the police but they could not find anything. I was hesitant to take this case, since it seemed like a normal situation of rich people being overly paranoid and stressed. However, she offered me large sums of money, cash up front, double than what I am usually paid. ""You get half for protecting me and the remaining half after you solved whoever is behind this, deal?"", Her own words as I remember them. 

As you can tell, I took the case, the money was hard to deny after all. That evening I walked with her to her place, thing was quite and normal, yet Elly was shaking the entire way. She lived in a decent looking studio apartment, without any roommate. We sat down and discussed the details. 

Elly said that she have been noticing a woman following her when she walked home from work for several week. She had asked to police to escort her, but every time they did, the woman did not show up so she turned to me. I asked her what the woman looked like, she replied the woman appeared to be Asian, pale skin. She had different clothes each time but her faces had an uncanny smile that I would easily notice. 

I left her apartment later that evening and I rented a hotel opposite to her block. The plan the next couple of days were simple, I followed her discreetly when she travel to her work and looked out for anything suspicious. I found some cafe near the area during her work time and repeated the process when she traveled back. Turned out Elly was a high level manager at a media company, explained the level of money she got. 

3 days went by and nothing happened. I did not see anyone as Elly described. I began to do some investigate work on Elly background to find some suspected. Elly got a marketing degree, and managed to get a high position through years of unpaid internship and overtime working. The employee really liked her too, as her positions got high review on Linkedin. On the other hand, her private life displayed on Facebook page was bit of a mess. She had been through multiple relationships, but none was Asian thus the possibility of a stalking ex-lover could be eliminated. I managed to get my hand on her banking records. She had taken many trips to therapy and a frequent user of alcohol, though I did not find any sign of drug use yet. 

When talking directly in a cafe, Elly admitted that she had trouble separating her work life from her normal life. Ever since graduation she constantly worked day by day to ensure a successful position, but once she got it, she felt empty on what to do, hence the alcohol. Her works often took so much attention that she barely got time for her own and most parties she went through were company parties that required her to put on a fake smile or shake hands. Her coworkers were nice to her, but Elly was too paranoid and thought they wanted her position. 

I remembered her words were: ""I was never happy, I thought I would be by being someone successful, but I was wrong"". A weird sentence to say I'm sure. 

Anyway, with all the details I found, there were only two explanations I could give to Elly. One, this was a case of a secret admirer, someone completely unknown but might be related to her that stalk her with sexual intentions. Second, if her belief of people wanting her position was true, this could be a case of corporate espionage, someone wanted to find information to out her. Either way, catching the stalker red handed was needed. 

In the fourth day of the investigation, about 11PM, I received Elly phone call. She was frantic again and screamed in the phone telling me the woman was at her front door. I ran immediately to her apartment and used the spare keys she had given me to get in. I reached her floor, it was empty and quiet. I knocked on the door and called out her name. Elly opened the door, her face was pure white with fear. She told me she heard knocking on the door and when she look through the peep hole it was the woman. I told her that there was no one when I arrived, but to be safe, I stay with her that night. She slept in her room while I took the couch. 

Another 2 days went by, I did not find anyone or anything suspicious. Things get weird on the last day, which was a Saturday. I followed Elly back home as usual, and then returned to my hotel room. About over an hour later, she called me. She said that one of her coworkers admitted the stalking as a prank and she wanted to call off the case. I told her this seemed suspicious based on my assumption of a corporate espionage, but she was calm as well as determined to stop the case. However, she offered to pay me the rest of the money as well as asking me out, I reluctantly agreed. 

I walked to her apartment entrance at 8, Elly was wearing short wine dress. I took her to a luxury bar whose owner was an acquaintance. We were drinking and chatting about our personal lives. I remembered Elly telling me she used to want to be an artist drawing comic books, but realized it was too impractical for making money so she switched to a marketing degree. In return I explained my reason for choosing to be an investigator, which made Elly laugh. Elly was smiling and talking loud the entire evening, she seemed to be enjoying herself. 

I walked her home by midnight. She gave me the remaining payment prior to thanking me for the drinks. She walked back to her apartment and I returned to my hotel room.

The next day I moved back to my office, filed a report and did not received any news. However, the following morning, police arrived at my door. I was told they found Elly's body in her apartment, after her employee went to check since she did not answer any calls. The cause of death was suicide. She hanged herself, the time of death was estimate to after midnight. The police did not accused me since they got no evidence and I personally knew them, but they showed me her last words written on a piece of papers.

It was a short message.

""I was happy""."

I'll be graduating this December 2018, but I could also technically graduate in Spring 2018 by taking just 1 or 2 class that semester. I have 1 solid medium company internship, and decent/good gpa from a target school. 

So I have 2 routes.

1. Find full time now and start work in early 2019.
   1. Pros: make money early, save on tuition
   2. Cons: Low chance of landing Big-N offers. Still need few more months of interview practice.
2. Graduate Spring 2019. Work as an intern during Summer 2019, then full time in the fall.
   1. Pros: Trying out new companies, and allocating more time to practice Leetcode for Big-N offers.
   2. Cons: Internship after graduation looks odd? Making less money for the first year.

Also third option would be somehow to find a Spring 2019 internship and do a co-op, but I figure this is difficult and not many nice companies offer Spring 2019 internship.

9gwqmn,25,2018-09-18,I have no idea what I want.,Dzartovian94,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/9gwqmn/i_have_no_idea_what_i_want/,"So I've been applying for jobs for the past year, I've had around 20-40 interviews and zero luck.

Some have gone very well and others.... not so well. However I don't get any offers due to not fitting the company culture or whatever non-substance reply I get. 

My interviews have definitely improved over time, being an introvert I despise them but I really have no choice and have to deal with them. I completed my bachelor of business degree last August and well the job prospects are not working for me. Something about my personality doesn't appeal to any HR manager as I most likely don't fit the ""diversity"" culture of the modern workforce.

I also have two internships under my belt but no job offers.

So what other options does a two-time cancer survivor with a bad wrist (I can only type with one hand) have? 

Military? Probably not with my medical history.

Manual Labour? Not with my weak arm.

Data Entry/IT? I was working on learning Python but who is going to hire a business grad that can only type with one hand?

Sales? I'm introverted and i'm not very spontaneous at all. Prefer structured roles.

Minimum wage jobs? Too old for McDonald's and overqualified for anything else.

Admin? Can't compete with the other fully capable candidates despite my year and a half of part time work experience during university.

CPA? Got accepted into the course, can't finish without work experience, can't exactly get that and I need money in order to pay for said course.

Grad Program? Got 99% on a cognitive test for one that I was particular interested in, did above average at the final panel interview, ""don't fit the culture, sorry."" 

Back to university? My GPA is pretty rubbish (due to health/priorities) so I would have to do a grad diploma and frankly I don't want any more student debt (I don't have any at the moment, thank god).

Call Centre? Can't pass typing tests, I've gone for five of these. I also worked in one during university.

Another significant problem is that I don't really have a particular career or occupation that I want to do. Most seem pretty uninteresting and I don't have any ""passion"" for a dream job. I have interests sure but nothing profitable or marketable.
At the moment I'm just applying for anything I can actually do.

Going back to university seems useless due to this fact, which is really the only option I have at the moment. What is the point of studying more in a field I don't care about just to get a job that I cannot actually get? 

Well otherwise, seeming as I am the most unlikable person on planet earth, I'm in serious trouble.

I'll paint you a mental picture, imagine looking like a 14 year old, balding but I talk like a 40 year old. Got it? Now on top of that, my left wrist is damaged, I'm a harsh realist and very old school while being in my early to mid twenties.

I'm doomed aren't I?"
9gwv75,1,2018-09-18,I'm a lost exhausted mess as a college grad,clearfearwear,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/9gwv75/im_a_lost_exhausted_mess_as_a_college_grad/,"I feel the most lost and alone I've ever been in my life. I graduated college in May and since then I feel my walls crumbling. As of now I am still without a job in my desired field. I worked so hard in school and my peers higher up thought so highly of me, but with a lack of networking and not being able to land an internship in school I've just been tripping up constantly seeking a job. No one other than those around me at school see what I'm capable of, and that doesn't help me on paper. I have a part-time job, but I'm fucking miserable in it. This has been what's driving me crazy the most.

In college I felt like something. I was actively part of multiple groups and was looked up to. I formed an identity I was happy with and now I don't have that. I didn't even realize I was happy. I wasn't 100% satisfied with myself and I wanted more, taking what I built for granted and letting my worries get the best of me if that makes sense.

Outside of that, also being out of school means a smaller social circle. There were so many people around me who's advice and simple time to just hang out I took for granted.

On top of that shortly after graduating my gf (my first love) broke up with me via phone call. I found her when I was at my most confident and happy. Close to graduation though, I became a less confident individual as I was losing pieces of the identity I formed and identified myself with. I don't even know what to say about that. I'm confused in the sense that my gut knows she could have treated me better in terms of very basic relationship needs (even her parents thought that, which is a strong statement), but at the same time I can't deny her good qualities that so many guys would desire in a relationship. She has so much self-respect, but to the point she could be selfish at times - not totally high maintenance, but can often be cheap. It's complicated. I didn't feel she was as interested in my personal goals as I was with hers. I wanted more from her being that I invested so much of myself into the relationship, but instead (before the breakup) she wanted me to invest less in her and be more selfish myself. I can understand that from the perspective of being able to grow professionally, but it made me feel lost.

I feel like I took so many people in my life for granted in regards to how they've been there for me, and at the same time I think I need others more than ever. I don't feel I have much to offer people. It's just a large mess of thoughts in my head and I want to seek therapy soon. I want to be happy. I want to be confident. I know my worth, but I need guidance to get back in place."

I know I fucked up in life. Really bad. I know it's my own fault. I was in so much emotional pain after high school that I turned to shooting heroin on a daily basis. I didn't know how else to escape the misery of each moment.

Eventually I decided I wanted to turn my life around. I got into rehab, got clean, and got my Bachelor's in ""Mathematics/Computer Science.""

Now, at 30, I feel completely stuck. I really don't have much of a resumé aside from my degree. I lie and write that I worked as a legal assistant for my father's law office for the past 10 years just to fill in some space. I have no internships, no personal projects (I wouldn't even know where to start), no awards, no work experience... nothing aside from a degree. The best thing I can say about myself is that I narrowly escaped having a criminal record.

I don't even know where to look for jobs. I'm so lost. I went to the office of career development at my school but it wasn't very helpful. I've looked on Indeed and put out applications to the very few junior developer jobs I saw but the options were extremely limited and I haven't heard back from a single one. 

Is it going to be possible to get a degree in my field at all? I'm starting to worry that it's not. Should I just start looking for jobs not related to my degree? I feel like if I don't get an entry-level job in the field then I'll never gain any programming experience and I'll never be able to work my way up into better positions and then my degree will have been a waste. 

 I know it is my own responsibility to figure out what I'm supposed to do but I just don't even know where to begin. I hate to sound like I'm looking for my hand held or to be spoon-fed but if anyone could offer me some brief advice or assistance on what to do to find an entry level job I would be beyond grateful and appreciative. I see myself slipping back into depression and it takes so much energy to stay clean and I want nothing more than to just live a stable life where I'm not hurting anyone and I'd love to contribute to society or give back in some way but I just feel like there's no way anyone will ever be interested in hiring me for a degree-related field."

I'm taking a class in Machine Learning this fall for my Master's. A significant portion of the grade is a project that I propose that can be on any machine learning topic (even something not covered in class). This won't be my first ML class, but it will be my first opportunity to define my own ML project.

I don't really have a problem finding ideas for projects (I can easily find project ideas on Kaggle, Medium, and a list of past projects from the course and similar courses). The problem I am having is choosing what *kind* of project to do. There are so many different applications to ML/DL like:

* Computer Vision
* NLP
* Speech Processing
* Bioinformatics
* Medicine
* Finance and Commerce
* Playing Games
* Generating something (Music, Image, Video, Text)
* Recommendation Systems
* Sports
* Robotics/Self Driving Cars
* Literally anything that involves any sort of prediction, classification/regression, or decision making...
* Complete any of the above applications with some new or interesting ML algorithm or technique

I'm the type of person that could find pretty much any of the above applications/problems interesting, so I'm encountering some sort of choice paralysis.

Whatever I end up doing, I will probably put on my Github and/or Resume since I'm applying to internships for ML this summer and I need to get/show more experience. Plus I'll be working on this for 10-12 weeks, so I'd really like to pick something interesting, challenging, but not impossible for that time frame.

Does anyone have any guidance on how overcome choice paralysis for just picking a project?

**Note:** I'm not asking for project recommendations. Like I said, I can find ideas for projects, and it'd probably be very difficult to answer that without knowing a lot more info on my interests. I just need advice on how to narrow the long list of projects I have available to me."

My boss, hired me on my customer service jobs that I had before. I made it known that networking is what makes me tick and is my passion.

I graduate next August I need to get my hands on some switches and routers so I can understand more than whats given to me via Boson and PluralSight. 

Today, I sent an E-mail to him asking for something more, something that can teach me about routing in an enterprise environment. I'm lost and I'm starting to think that IT isn't what I want to do anymore, but one part of me still has the drive. I am losing it. I am so confused, anxious, depressed with the fact that I don't know what I should know from working in one of the biggest construction companies in my state.

Below is some of the stuff I e-mailed him for stuff I would like to do. 

* Design PowerShell programs, test, and implement
* Observe a network administrator setting up a new switch to be deployed
* Be able to confidently go on calls that require some network knowledge without having to text co-workers
* Document simple tasks for end users on our intranet in order to lessen the calls to the helpdesk. 
* Shadow administrators when something goes down, and have them explain to me the steps they take in order to fix the issue. 

Is there anything else I can do in order to show him that I want to do more networking than helpdesk?"

But ever since the redesign (where they took CareerBuzz off that awful weird login system), I'm finding it much harder to use the search function. The jobs it's recommending to me are often completely outside my major - like, basically just anything with ""engineering"" in the title gets recommended to me. Searching for jobs in Atlanta, or any other specific location, appears to show no results, even when I find jobs in Atlanta with the same search terms if I just turn the location filter off.

I had a lot of growing up to do in my 20s and kinda wasted a significant chunk of them (ages 26-30) at what I see called a ""unicorn job"" where my only task was to run scripts and maybe write a script in bash a few times a year. My manager wanted nothing to do with me and there were days where I'd come in 4 hours late and leave 2 hours early. This is close to the life I wanted, but I got arrogant and lazy, and inevitably they let me go after a reorg.

I have a CS deg, but my skills (and self-confidence) have deteriorated badly at this job. People who are even 5 years younger than me are on another level. I have a lower-paid job now that I got through connections, and I'm doing DB stuff with Perl and Python. I'm working on an online MS in cybersecurity, but I have 2 years left on that. I'm trying to direct my work tasks to be as resume-enhancing as possible.

What I really want is to be able to work remotely full time, but every job on remoteok.io wants some type of full stack experience. I keep failing at technical interviews because I'm bad at explaining things about http (which I guess you need to be an expert on now, even as a developer). I bought a WebDev uDemy course that I saw recommended on here, but I just wanted to hear any feedback if this is the right path to go down on? I don't really have a ""passion"" in any particular area, I just don't want to commute into an office lol.

Another factor is my age. I know employers are wondering what I was doing since 07 since I don't have a lot of ""knowledge"" to speak eloquently with. It seems like I'm supposed to have become very advanced by now. Like I'll know basic generalities, but every interview wants me to go into details that I don't know because I never had to use it. And if I did have to use the skills, it was at some internship 8 years ago and no longer in my working memory."

Although I am already enrolled in AI Master's degree which I am going to start very soon , I was thinking about dropping out and trying to apply (not in this order!) for a Data Science Master's at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), because it seems that there are not many research opportunities at my current university and the curriculum looks quite outdated for some of the classes.

The problem is that on their website they only say they require 'excellent academic records' \[1\] without giving any clue about what this means for their standards. My GPA during my bachelor's in CS was 8.37/10, which is not spectacular (but had 10/10 in Calculus, Algebra and Machine Learning; I assume it matters if you had better grades in subjects that are related to the degree you're applying for) and I had two internships abroad, one at Google Switzerland (as an SRE intern) and one at ARM UK (in the computer vision team). I've also been a teaching assistant for one semester at my university and  had good results in math competitions in high school. 

Although I have quite a good record, I am skeptical because I've heard stories of people not getting accepted even with higher grades. I was wondering if anyone has any idea about how their admission works and how important your GPA is and most importantly if you think there are chances of being accepted. All your responses will be appreciated :-)

Hoping to get some questions answered, opinions and feedback to those who have done this.",UbiquitousThoughts,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9gzuug/me_to_software_dev_opportunity_for_paid_java/,"Background: Mechanical Engineer transitioning to software dev.

An opportunity has come up  that pays for an immersive bootcamp then hires me as a consultant with a 2 year commitment, mostly working on projects for their clients which are banks. This will be in Charlotte, NC so BofA or Wells Fargo I presume. The details are as follows:

1. I will be paid $600/week to attend a 12 week bootcamp ($20k value which is  a bit higher than most but accurate)
2. Once completed I will be a consultant for the recruitment agency for two years working on projects with their clients. This will most likely be application projects.

\- $50k salary for the first year and then $60k salary for the second year. May be lower a bit lower than Cs grads but seems reasonable, I am okay with it. I realize they make money off me for these two years but also invested a lot.

3. They are committed to keeping me on as a consultant until I get a job, they hope with their client for the referral bonus. However it is not mandatory.

4. If I quit before 15 months (she said that but the two year thing doesnt make sense then) I must pay them back the $20k.

**QUESTIONS, etc:**

1. Does anything sound sketchy to you or is it really a situation where the demand is that much higher than the supply and this is a good money making opportunity for them that benefits me?
2. Those who work for banks, preferrably not interns, how do you like it. Pros/cons?
3. Will working with/for a bank give me good experience or does the bureaucracy resist that?
4. How does the industry view experience with a bank. Is it a postitive for eventually applying to a tech company later on?
5. Anyone go through a route similar to this that can provide feedback?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot for sharing.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:**  I did some due diligence and contacted a couple people that just completed the first course. The setup is just like Revature but here is what I gathered. The camp is $13k plus the $600/week equals the $20k they front. I spoke to two people who were completely satisfied with the bootcamp, although pricey it did get the ball rolling for them as far as coding goes and they had great things to say about attending a bootcamp. Out of the first group, some were not placed (possibly beacuse they are unwilling to relocate) and a few  got  decent jobs with  defense contractors etc. which took 3-4 months getting paid the $600/week. But I would consider them success stories. So it is possible. They are commited to placing you and it is in their best interest to do so. They are moving the program to places that have higher demand so perhaps it will pan out better in the mentioned cities.

**HOWEVER,** There were people attending the bootcamp along with the group hired by the recruiting agency and almost ALL OF THEM got placed upon leaving the bootcamp at around $65k (but minus the $20k investment) and had the ability to choose where they applied, obviously.  It is a risk of $0 income after but there were good hiring rates for this example.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros:** if you are not a self learner, don't have the $20k to front (camp plus living) and don't care where you get placed. Go for it. It is in their best interest to place you so they ARE trying to do so and will do so eventually. That is how they make money and $50k/$60k plus the $20k they fronted really isn't a bad deal.

**Cons:** They are only trying to place you with their clients. I think this is the problem with placing people. We know the demand is out there so these programs sort of restrict the job market for you. You don't get consultant pay until you land a project which could be a few months after the bootcamp. Lastly, they send you wherever they want. You have the ability to deny (I think because the people not wanting to relocate didn't) but in the end you are not involved in the placement process at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

 **I will not be attending but it is not a scam or a bad option for certain people. It is all situational. Bootcamps can be a great option, depending on the camp and city. If I attend one, it will most likely be out of my location to ensure a better placement chance.** "

Need advice,shengc5,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9h15el/lost_motivation_after_getting_a_return_offer_need/,"Hey guys.. long time lurker here. I'm currently in a bit of dilemma and could really use some advice from you guys to keep my head straight.

I currently have one semester left at a top 30 CS Master's program(will graduate this December). Got a summer internship as a full-stack developer intern at the digital practice of one of the most prestigious consulting firms(I know.. a bit unusual, considering 99% of my classmates go to tech companies). Summer went fine, travel was a bit heavy(4.5 days on the road every week), but the work was interesting, which was building full-JS platform for a big company not so involved on the web. I was offered to return after I graduate. The package is okay for a MCOL city, but is low for a place like Bay Area(which is most likely where I would relocate to if I do return). The deadline is Oct. 1, so I did not have much time to interview with other companies. I'm somewhat neutral toward accepting it, for a few reasons: 1. pay is average, with no stock, 2. constant travel takes a toll on you, 3. career outlook, in terms of technical abilities(this one is debatable, you are given more exposure to and get to work on the business/product side of things, which I like)

Now the problem is, I originally had plans to grind more Leetcode, prep for interviews, and try to get a better job once summer ended. But somehow I seem to have lost all of my motivation. Haven't touched Leetcode since February(which is when I finished internship hunting), don't feel like doing school work(have an OS class, which is super intense), and don't feel like applying for jobs. The worst part is, the peer pressure is driving me crazy... All of my peers are working and grinding hard toward a better Full-time placement, and yet here I am, doing absolutely nothing. Everyday I wake up, wanting to do something to make a change, but I just end up sitting in front of computer, doing nothing all day. And then this gives me trouble sleeping, cuz I feel like I let another day went by for nothing...

My questions are:
1. For those who have experience with software consulting, how does the career outlook/exit opportunity compare to regular SDE positions?
2. For software engineers, especially those with 5yrs+ of experience, is the process of becoming managers, being drawn to the business side inevitable? Do you/can you stay with coding for your entire career? I constantly have the feeling that I do not want the numerous lines of code to be the only thing I contribute to whatever organization I work for. And I personally do not see my self spending next 20 years of my career just sitting in front of a screen...
3. For those of you who just got return offers from summer internships, do you keep interviewing and looking for better opportunities? If so, how do you stay motivated...


I know this is a lot of ranting, and somewhat depressing, but I could really use some of you folks' help right now. Any feedback would be appreciated! Thanks"
9h1a5n,264,2018-09-18,Thought I'd share my experience with a recruiter today,Away_Pay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9h1a5n/thought_id_share_my_experience_with_a_recruiter/,"I found a junior software engineering position on LinkedIn and it was posted by a company that provides staffing services to big corporations. The position was very closely related to everything I learn't and did during my internship and they were looking to hire recent college grads who could start Jan 2019, which was perfect because I'm graduating in December!

&amp;#x200B;

I go through the initial phone call which was last week, and had a Skype interview today. The recruiter talks more about the position (its a contract to hire for a Big Bank) and then asks me some basic questions about myself and then moves on to ""technical"" questions. The first one she asks is to define what Object Oriented Programming is. I am a CS major but its been quite a while since I've covered this term (last covered it in a sophomore year Programming course) and so I give a basic definition and an example. Apparently that definition was not good enough and seemed like she wanted a textbook definition that matched her sheet, so I give her examples of how I used OOP at my internship (which was a .NET role so OOP was fundamental) but apparently that still wasn't enough because this lady was fixed on getting a textbook definition. Next she asked what polymorphism is and again I give her a pretty good example which was from actual production code I wrote and drew a little neat diagram on the whiteboard behind me. Same story; lady wanted a hardcore textbook definition word to word. During all this she even asked me what I meant by ""production code""...

&amp;#x200B;

She went on to say: ""So you want a software engineer role but you're struggling to define these terms?"" I pretty much lost interest in the role at that point but decided to finish this interview anyway. I responded that it's been a while since I covered these terms but I know what they are and my examples from my internship experience should prove that. She asked what my GPA was next and I responded and she questioned if I had struggled in college, implying it was low. I told her that I indeed struggle a bit during my first two semesters with courses like Calculus, electromagnetic physics, but my major GPA was much higher since I've gotten an A or B in every CS class besides Operating Systems and Discreet Math. She asked for the exact number of my major GPA and I said frankly I don't know the exact decimal digit but I'm assuming it's at least 3.5 and she asked me to get the exact number within the next few days.

&amp;#x200B;

This next part was what blew me away though. She stated that I'd be a good fit for their Quality assurance positions and asked whether I was interested in that to ""ease"" into a development role, I pointed out that I was fit for a development role and had internship experience which gave me some credibility, I have an informal return offer from the company I intern'd at, I'm just applying to other roles because I was looking to relocate outside my city and my company is local. I emailed her after the interview ended stating that I wasn't interested in the role anymore but thanks anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr- pretty meh experience for a Software eng role with a recruiter who seemed to not have any CS background.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else have any similar experiences ?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: oh wow I didn't expect this to get more than 10 upvotes, thank you all for your replies!  The most baffling thing about it all was that she cared zero about everything I had done during my internship. For context: I was the sole intern at a med sized company which had a team of 50ish software engineers. The company had 8 different ""main"" products all divided in to modules. My supervisor was the manager and senior architect of 1 of those 8 products and that product was divided in to 3 modules. 1 of those modules was pretty much complete and had been in production for 2 years now and the 2nd was being actively developed by a team of 5 engineers, under my supervisor. I spent a month working with the 5 engineers on that 2nd module and after that month my supervisor trusted me enough to let me start on the 3rd module and basically work on it from the ground-up. I got quite far into that and by the end of my internship I was  working on implementing all the business logic, I presented my work to the whole team of engineers, CTO, and CEO and they were pretty impressed. I explained all of this to the recruiter and all the little details but she just did not care, or maybe like some of you pointed out; she probably wanted me to state interest in a QA role. "

1. Take job and do projects on the side to bolster my resume.
2. Find possible internships instead.

9h2qbw,3,2018-09-19,Advice To Pursing This Friendship,thisfilmkid,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9h2qbw/advice_to_pursing_this_friendship/,"It is certainly true when they say ""you can meet a new person everyday."" I met a person and I'm slowly trying to build a relationship towards becoming friends... ""bros.""

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a large scale company with many employees. It is rare to find someone around your age that you simply can vibe with and enjoy the moment. While there are other people who are around my age, I don't have much interest in building friendships with them.

&amp;#x200B;

This employee and I work in different departments. He is 22 and I am 24. We live about 2-hours apart from each other. I reside in NYC and he reside in New Jersey. We both graduated college and started out at the company as interns. Now, we're both working with the company doing different assignments. We don't get to see each other every hour as each of us work differently. Most of the time, we see each other in passing or occasionally at lunch. I do all the work in this friendship. I message him to chat, he replies. In person, he's engaging and friendly. He is polite and respectful but he is also talkative when spoken to. As an introverted individual that connects with people by wave of their emotions, personal conversations, and life stories, my conscience tells me ""this person is a great individual to be friends with. Keep building this friendship. It will be slow but worth it."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, other times I get the evil talk.. ""You're wasting your time. This will not get anywhere. He doesn't have any interests and he doesn't even go out the way to actually message you or ask you to lunch."" Yet, when I do it, he is responsive and engaging in the conversations.

&amp;#x200B;

Our last lunch, which I must say was our second time grabbing lunch, I believe I climbed the scale on his friendship radar. However, there's still much needed effort to go. In person, this guy is friendly, approachable and interesting. He clearly welcomes me, he shows interest in wanting to build our friendship and he laughs at my corny jokes (LOL). But internally, such as going out the way to create conversations or plan lunch, he does not budge. There are days we go without talking. Yet, when we see each other, it is such a different experience! At work, he's normally the first to say hello to me if he sees me -- vice versa. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the cafeteria, for breakfast, we chat. If I message him, we chat until one of us have to go or randomly signs off after periods of waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my question....

Do I continue building this friendship? Do I continue to randomly invite to lunch, once or maybe twice a month? Do I continue to reach out? Any advice would be helpful. How do I connect to him and get him to talk about himself?

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I've been purposely providing space as I do not want to come off weird, uncomfortable, or annoying. "
9h3h5v,1,2018-09-19,To quit or stay in my job? What should i go for?,starscreamm03,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9h3h5v/to_quit_or_stay_in_my_job_what_should_i_go_for/,"  

A background to give you perspective because I myself cant pinpoint what went wrong and what to do next so maybe you can.

I have a diploma in business applications. I know, why do I only have a diploma and not a degree? That’s probably because I don’t know what to pursue and I got sick of studying. Anyway, my diploma is a combination of business and IT modules. Do I enjoy my time in school? No. Do I find any of the modules interesting? Yeah, to a certain extend. I did ok (in my opinion), but better than average students because I literally studied everyday back then as I feel like I cant afford to fail or get low marks (which I did in the previous school). 

So with this diploma, I obviously should be applying for business or IT roles right? An IT role was not what I wanted because most of the companies has high requirements like a degree with 5 years of experience in which I don’t have. Plus, I just think that coding for life would be a disaster for me because in school, I was stressing out about those codes, especially during my final year project. And the working hours wasn’t in my favour. 

During school, I was an intern for about 4 months at a main bank in my country. It was ok but I didn’t want to continue working there because it wasn’t my thing and didn’t really like my colleagues that talked behind and in front of each other. I figured it would be stressful for me. I was quiet (im an introvert), efficient but very careless. Multiple times, when my senior checked my work for me, she got fed up because of the repeated mistakes that I made. This should have been a warning sign for me.

So after school, I went for an admin role because I’m straight out of school right? I got accepted for a full time job as an admin assistant at this insurance broker. This company (company A) is related to another insurance agency, company B. the company has about 9 employees including me. When I first started working here, things got really stressful for me quite quickly for the first year. I don’t know ANYTHING about insurance. So everything was new for me. I learnt lots of things. When I start to do work on my own, I did LOTS of mistakes. And im saying A LOT of small little mistakes that even my boss knows about, but no one mentioned anything to me. But, I knew what I did wrong and I beat myself (physically, mentally and emotionally) because of the mistakes. And guess what? I kept REPEATING those mistakes. I know right? How stupid can this human being be?? There were even times when I went to the toilet to cry and hit my head because I can’t stand the embarrassment and anger. Everyone uses the same email. So whatever replies there are, EVERYONE could see it. I couldn’t believe myself whenever I made a mistake. The mistakes are: using the wrong email (wrong company, as I said theres two companies involved, company A &amp; B), sending to the wrong person (can either be an entirely different name or same name but from a different client company), attaching the wrong attachments, missing key words in a document I was supposed to edit, overlooking an email, unable to find the answer to my question when its SO OBVIOUS. All this pressure, \* 11 because theres basically 11 other people who has that same email address. I am efficient but as I said, many mistakes made. I also feel like all the little jobs are passed down to me. I see other people making mistakes but its not as much as i. 

I stayed in this job for 2 years now. I stayed this long thinking that I could learn from my mistakes, try to grow and prove everyone and myself wrong. I asked to quit two times but they refused and increased my salary probably because im the ONLY local in the company and they need me to sustain all the other foreign workers in the company legally. I do not know if they want me to stay because im the only local and to make use of me or they really appreciate me as an employee (which I doubt so). I stayed also because I needed the money and that im not sure if I’ll get another job. 

I don’t know if this field isn’t my thing or if im the one with the problem. What can I do to improve and stop making these mistakes? I tend to rush and when I don’t, I try to check my work but still the same results. If I were to change my field, how do I do so? How do I answer to the person interviewing me? Is this even normal even after working at a place for 2 years? What is wrong with me? Should I be taking pills?  Any advice or comments are appreciated."

I had both a flexible time schedule with regards to work and university and managed to spend around 30-35 hours per week at work and complete my classes as well - although it has been extremely stressful.
After working for 4 months at the big four firm I managed to get promoted to a full time employee and then in March 2018 I was promoted once again as well, while working on my thesis at university and this summer I have successfully graduated.

I resigned a month ago and I’m getting back to study a more practical thing - law. Since I live in an Eastern European country law is not a master’s but a bachelor and a master’s combined, i.e. 5 years. Which is a lot of time.

small sysadmin intern here and i hope ELI5 questions are allowed here!

So i made my first Win 7 Image yesterday (yeah we're still using win 7 here and even don't have any ZTI installation mediums here...) and realized after updating the vm and creating afterwards an iso with MDT and sysrep the file is getting bigger and bigger (right now its like 12 gigs of data) and this made me think.
private i am a linux user with a rolling release distro and every now and then i am downloading a new iso with the latest updates to reinstall my stuff and see: the iso is still at a size of 4 gigs of data. So for my understanding the same is with win10 it is (some kind of) a rolling release right? so when i would prepare a vm with win10 by myself and all its updates in it how does it come that my iso is in the end way bigger than a freshly downloaded one from MS?

In advance, sorry for my grammer and also if my lack of understanding totally nonsense right now.

So far, my my response rate is very very low like 2%, so this is my only shot. Otherwise, Ill have to prepare for a career fair that will take place in a month where I went to college.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to this company X, which is not very big, has a very few locations in the States, and they work for the goverment as a defense contract kinda company. I recieved a coding challenge, which took me a lot of hours(20+), doing research, and trying to come up with a really comprehensive design. I am sure the challenge wouldnt take other people that long, its just that I did some thorough research and the area was very unfamiliar to me. I passed the challenge, and got an interview online. The interviewers seemed really easy going and quite like their jobs. I passed the interview, however, I am given another challange that requires doing web stuff, which also requires SQL which I indicated I do not have knowledge of. And if I pass this one again, ill be sponsored for security clearence, for which I will have to wait for a few months to get before the final cilent side interview with their prime(this one should not be a problem I assume).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know this subs stance on working on coding challanges, but I like the company and it does seem to be a better approach to whiteboarding. I will obviously try to work on the challenge, even though it will again take me quite some hours(probably more hours because I have 0 knowledge of SQL), because this is not an area I am that comfortable with(I have done an web app thats capable of CRUD using firebase).

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: Assuming that I passed this 2nd coding question, I will have to sign a contingent non-binding agreement, am I garunteed the job then? What if my application for security clearance doesnt pass, tho I dont have any problems on my side. Is the security clearance a 100% to get? And while I am waiting for the clearance, is it smart to keep looking for other jobs, like going to the career fair. Not that I intend to break the agreement, what if I am offered another job that starts immediately while they are sponsoring me for clearance, can I just inform them my decision? And finally, what is the chance that they will somehow not accpet me after the clearance got through?

&amp;#x200B;

Any additional suggestions are  very welcome, thanks again fellow programmers.

The position provides insurance and benefits though.

I realize its only been a few months into my job search and I certainly haven't exhausted all the applications I can apply to just yet, but ought I accept this position for now until something better comes along?

9h5z8c,5,2018-09-19,"I was rejected from doing what I wanted. I jumped around a few times, but now I'm unsure. How do I know if I'm choosing the right thing?",eatpraylove-drink,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9h5z8c/i_was_rejected_from_doing_what_i_wanted_i_jumped/,"Sorry for the long read. There's a tl;dr at the end. 

  I don’t know which way is up anymore. Since I was 12 years old I wanted to be a clinical psychologist. People would always tell me how impressed they were that I knew what I wanted to do from such a young age. I’ve always been goal driven and ambitious. Once I knew what I wanted I would do whatever it took to get there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before I started studying I briefly considered studying law, just as a back-up. Ultimately, I decided to do a BA with the intention of becoming a clinical psychologist. Along with psychology, I also took subjects like sociology, anthropology, history and philosophy.

&amp;#x200B;

In my country (as I’m sure in other countries) it is very, very difficult to be accepted into clinical psychology. In order to apply to the clinical program, you have to have psychology at an undergraduate level, up to the third level. Then you have to do an honours in psychology, which is sort of a specialized degree that only focuses on psychology subjects at a more advanced level. 

&amp;#x200B;

Getting accepted to the honours program is also very difficult. Only about 30 students are accepted, and these are the best of the best academically. For the clinical program only 10 students are selected out of about 700 applicants. Again, they only choose the best of the best. Your academic record has to be excellent, you have to have done numerous hours of community service, be in a leadership position and take part in extra circulars.

&amp;#x200B;

I did very well in my undergraduate and honors, held numerous leadership positions, and I was heavily involved in community service. I didn’t just do this because of the prerequisites of the program, I would have done these things anyway, I just did a lot more. After applying numerous times to the clinical program, I never got a place. I was placed on waiting lists, but it never went any further than that. I was just never good enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime I decided to my masters in research psychology. I didn’t know what else to do and I thought it would increase my chances. I didn’t enjoy my masters because there was no coursework and you just had to do a thesis. It was very isolating and I thrive on working with other people. Again I did very well in my thesis, but I was never accepted. After being rejected for the umpteenth time, I realized that I would need to really make a decision about my future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Work is very scarce and because of the nature of my degrees, it’s even scarcer. I thought about doing other forms of psychology, but here you have to do the clinical degree and then you can specialize in being either a clinical, child, counselling, forensic, research or neuro- psychologist. It dawned on me that I would never achieve my dream and after my girlfriend’s suicide, I didn’t want anything to do with psychology. I had to move home because I couldn’t find a job and had no money. This was even more isolating because all of my friends live far away. I lost everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

During my Master’s degree I decided to take some courses in marketing, as a back-up, with the intention of completing the course after I finished my degree. I took the course online and balanced it with doing my masters. I hated the marketing course. I love learning and found the material interesting, I just knew it wasn’t for me. I thought maybe I could become an educational psychologist. With my qualifications I would just need to do a one year postgraduate teaching certificate. And then I could qualify for the educational psychology program. Again I did a few courses of the teaching degree but I absolutely hated it. In the back of my mind I knew there was the possibility that I would also not get selected for the educational psychology course. I didn’t want to be a teacher for the rest of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I now had a few courses of marketing, a few courses of teaching and a Masters in psychology. I decided that after my masters I wanted to do law. I liked the idea of knowing I will have a qualification where there will be a job for me. Again, I decided to do the law degree online since I’m financially very restricted and need to work. My mother was originally very against me doing the law degree because of the previous courses that I stopped. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of the content heavy structure of the law degree, I decided it would be best for me to work part time and while I focused on my studies. The part time work isn’t enough to pay my bills so I’m still stuck at home, very isolated. I’m almost done with my first year and while I enjoy it, I’m having my doubts (again). I only have a few law modules, which I love, but I also have other compulsory filler subjects, which I hate. I also don’t feel like I’m getting the full law school experience. I wish I could have studied it at my previous university (which has one of the best law schools in my country). I used to have my assignments done weeks before, and stuck to a dedicated study schedule. Now, I struggle to get motivated. I leave things to the last minute and when I try to work, I feel like I’m just zoning out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I’ve been looking at industrial (organizational) psychology. I’ve never really considered it before. I realize that I’m just not happy at the moment and I want to do what I can to change that. I’m someone I no longer recognize. I’m so confused. Some of the positives of this would be:

\- I miss psychology, which is truly my passion in life. Because industrial psychology would have a lot in common with psychology I did, perhaps it would give me an alternative. 

\- I’ve also seen that there are a lot of job opportunities in this field. 

\- I also thought that it would be easier for me to work full time with this degree and move out of my mom’s house. 

\- I could work in this field while I study, which is not the case with law (its heavily regulated).

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, the negatives are:

\- It’s another degree change, that I might get disillusioned with. 

\- It’s again another honors selection program and masters selection program, that I could maybe not get accepted to.

\- I would probably have to leave my law degree.

\- If I don’t get accepted into the masters degree, I would be stuck in HR for the rest of my life and I’m not sure if I would like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m 27 now, and will complete my law degree in 3 years. After completing the mandatory 2 year training, I would have spent 6 years on this degree. If I did industrial psychology, up to masters and the internship, it would also be 6 years. I wish there was a way that I could combine the two, but it’s just not possible. Degree programs are very structured over here. I’m not sure if it’s relevant, but I am an INFJ. Ultimately, I want a job that is meaningful, where I can help people. It’s also important to my mental health to be in a place where I can work with others. I grew up with a single mother and we struggled financially (we still do) so I want to have a decent paying job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don’t know what I should do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I’ve always wanted to be a clinical psychologist, spent 8 years dedicating my life to becoming one, only to not be accepted. I decided to move on, but couldn’t find a job with my qualifications. Jumped around from marketing, to education, and dropped out because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. I’m doing law now, but living at home, barely making money, very depressed. I’m thinking of doing industrial psychology, because I miss psychology. It might also be easier to work full time while I finish the degree online. Because of regulations in my country, I might also not be accepted to the industrial psychology masters (a prerequisite to be one), and would have to drop law degree. I’m so confused. "

I've been looking into going into industry but I've found that the areas I'm interested in are very technical or not ""R&amp;D enough"" and many require Masters or PhDs. 

As a result, I've been doing my own personal research into my areas of interest in my free time, but I'm finding myself wanting to take a day off work just to do more research and I'm thinking I would like to only be doing research, i.e. getting a PhD.

My major GPA in undergrad was 3.4 and cumulative was 3.1 (unfortunately), not super great for getting into the upper tiers of grad programs.

My core CS class grades are solid

* Computer Architecture - A
* Data Structures - A-
* Automata - A-
* Operating Systems - B+

I'm currently doing a Udacity Nanodegree and have covered topics such as: computer vision, deep learning, and sensor fusion. All relating to material I would find relevant to my future research interests, namely `Real-Time, Embedded and Cyber-Physical Systems`. I've gotten 1/3 of the way through a good text book on Real-Time Systems and understood it quite well. I also have a solid amount of experience reading research publications in the self-driving car space, but just no research done myself.

What schools should I reasonably be looking at? I don't want to waste money applying to programs I have little to no chance of getting into. I know I should be more worried about my advisor and I agree, but I don't even know what colleges to start looking at in order begun evaluating potential advisers at said universities. "

[What happened after that](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8xbe75/my_girlfriend_and_i_tried_the_maidens_gamble_game/) (Part 2)

Hey everyone, it's Alex again. To summarize my past two posts, I took part in a creepy internet ritual and made the fateful decision to permanently condemn my girlfriend Irene to the Other World. Some of my family members got into unfortunate accidents after I introduced them to my new girlfriend Irene2, and it was (at the time) a little unclear if she had instigated them. The last time I wrote in, I was about to confront her as a way of demanding the truth. 

I've spent a lot of time over the past couple of months reflecting on my actions. The stuff you guys said in your comments and DMs really hit close to home. I get that I'd been a terrible person and that I needed to man the fuck up, stop messing with the supernatural, and tell Irene2 to back off, among other things. There was a lot of hard truth in what you said, and after thinking it through I was determined to turn things around. It hasn't been an easy journey (more shit happened along the way, as you'd expect), but I'd like to think I've tried my best. You guys definitely deserve to know what went down, so here goes.

For starters, Irene2 hadn't taken my line of questioning very well.

""Alex... is that really what you think of me? That I'd hurt your family?"" She'd dropped the grocery bags on the floor and seized my hands. I was struck by the pain in her voice; the tears in her eyes. ""Look, we both know I don't exactly come from... wholesome stock. But you saved me from damnation, and I'll always be grateful for that. I'd throw myself back into that place before I'd let any harm come to the people you love.""

God, I almost let it go then. I mean I loved her, for fuck's sake. But I couldn't. I needed to know what I had released into this world. I pushed her hands away.

""Then help me,"" I snapped. ""Help them get better.""

""I can't."" Her eyes were full of pity. ""It's beyond my ability. Alex, *please*.""

I couldn't look at her. We were at a stalemate; there was no way I could force her into helping if she couldn't or didn't want to. I didn't know what to say to her. So being the immature person I was, I walked to my bedroom, closed the door behind me, and locked it. 

She was gone the next morning. Though the groceries from the night before had been neatly put away, all her usual things were missing - her clothes, her books, her makeup. This wonderful girl I loved above all else had been reduced to an echo in my mind, a faint trail of scented shampoo in the air. I could hardly believe it. I floated around my dorm like a ghost, touching the places she had touched, listening and breathing in my newfound loneliness, tasting each of our memories one by one. There was a note for me on the coffee table. 

*I only wanted the best for us. I think we should take a break. I'm sorry. - I*

I called her old dorm, but her RA said she hadn't been back in months. Her cell had been disconnected, and she had also deactivated all her social media accounts. For all intents and purposes, she had vanished off the face of the earth. It was difficult to accept that she had left me; after all, *I* was the one who had summoned *her*. She had left an imprint on my heart, stark and indelible as a burn.

I spent the next few weeks alone on my couch, alternately drinking, crying, beating off, and writing volume after volume of shitty poetry. Pathetic, I know. I was a textbook example of a huge fucking mess. 

After a time, it got easier to stop thinking of her. Fall soon arrived, and with it the start of my senior year. I figured we were well and truly broken up, so when a few girls asked me out at a back-to-school party, I ended up seriously hooking up with one of them. Sharon, her name was, and she fucked as though it were the end of the world and nothing mattered more. Our arrangement was explicit and upfront - we were friends with benefits; no more, no less. I didn't drive Sharon around, buy her flowers, nor take her to cheap bars on dates. There were no discussions about our feelings, and no creepy games. She came like clockwork to (and in) my dorm on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays. The things I knew about Sharon were few and far between: she was a sophomore; she was a sociology major; she had a long-term boyfriend who was a freshman at a different college; she had an IUD; her parents were Irish; she kept a pet parrot in her dorm. That was all.

Things were going fine - not great, exactly, but fine - and then Irene2 came back into my life with a bang. 

Friday, September 7. Sharon and I were messing around on my couch when I felt a familiar sensation cascading over me like ice. It was so incongruous, so out of place with what we were doing that I actually stopped, frowning, every hair on my scalp standing on end. For several harrowing moments, I struggled to comprehend it. Then the lights winked and flickered, and Sharon looked up and gave a tremendous scream.

Irene2 just stood there, staring down at us. Neither Sharon nor I had heard her come in. She was dressed in a tank top and sweatpants, and she looked for the world as though she'd never been away.

Shit, I know what you're thinking. How had I, Alex the scumbag, actually managed to sink even lower than I already had? All I can say is - you know that feeling of having fucked up? Well, turns out I feel it all the time.

Anyway, just to skip ahead, there was some yelling and a lot of fumbling, during which Irene2 stood calmly watching as Sharon got dressed and slammed her way out of my dorm, berating me the whole way - ""Oh, for fuck's sake, Alex"" - which I know I thoroughly deserved. Once she was gone an uncomfortable, buzzing silence descended over us, and I felt as though my throat had been glued shut. 

The thing was, I was *happy* to see Irene2. The moment I'd looked over Sharon's shoulder and into her eyes, my heart had skipped a beat, and I'd immediately thought of a thousand things I wanted to tell her. But it was, frankly, horrible timing - she'd practically walked in while I'd been inside someone else. 

She said, ""I've missed you, Alex. It's so good to see you.""

I gave a start. She was crying, and my first selfish thought was that it was because I'd cheated on her. Instinctively I reached for her, but she pulled away. ""I'm sorry,"" I said, stupidly. ""I didn't mean - I thought...""

She waved a hand in my direction and sank onto the couch, making a face as she did so. ""Alex, I'm not mad about Sharon. I know you guys have been sleeping together, and it wasn't fair of me to expect you to wait around when I'd left you with so little. Look... I'm really sorry for dropping in on you like this, but I've come back for a reason. There's something extremely important we need to discuss.""

""Of course.""

She was quiet for a moment, observing me with a different look, a predatory sort of tenderness. Though her eyes were smoky, her face was incandescent, brimming with a strange light. She was so beautiful, and I shuddered to look at her. 

""Alex, I'm pregnant.""

*Oh fuck*, I wanted to say, *oh fuck*. But the words wouldn't come. The world around me was spiraling, dwindling to a single, dizzying point. In the back of my throat, I tasted the first white-hot edges of panic. I was distinctly aware of a few small, stupid things: a low buzzing in my ears, a sudden dryness in my mouth, and the relentless echo of her voice, repeating those dreaded words over and over again in my head until they had been drained of meaning. 

Once again, I can probably guess what you're thinking. Stupid Alex, why didn't he just use protection? And to be perfectly honest, you'd be entirely justified. See, the thing is - and it's kind of embarrassing to say this on the internet, of all places - birth control was a foreign concept to me. In high school, I'd been with four different girls who'd all claimed to be on the pill, so I'd never once had to worry about condoms. I'd started going out with Irene after that, and as you know, unsafe sex between us had pretty much been a non-issue given the chaste nature of our relationship. But Irene2...

Yeah, you know what? Fuck me. I was officially out of excuses.

""What should we do?"" My voice was trembling, and I was absurdly afraid that Irene2 would be able to tell how freaked out I was. I wanted to put my arms around her, but she was shrinking away from me, her hands curled tightly around her stomach. 

""I... I found a doctor. The hospital is off-campus, so I'll need you to drive us there tomorrow morning. Look, Alex, I'm not going to pressure you into getting back together. Just... please come with me.""

There was no question about it. We went to the hospital the next morning. The waiting room was bursting at the seams with cheerful young families. Babies and toddlers shrieked and scuttled underfoot whilst bare-faced moms yelled at them to sit down and shut up. Nurses bustled about, checking blood pressure monitors and scribbling on clipboards. There was no one in there remotely close to my age. I found a seat for Irene2 and backed into a corner to wait. People looked at me curiously as they passed, and I closed my eyes and prayed that no one from school would recognize me here. 

At last it was Irene2's turn, and I accompanied her into a small, clean room. When the doctor pressed the ultrasound transducer against her belly, the machine flickered and died. It took several tries to get it working again. When we peered at the screen, I saw nothing but a small pale lump in a shivering pool of darkness, punctuated by infrequent bursts of static. 

""That's it,"" the doctor said, moving her cursor around the swell. ""It looks healthy. Given the information you provided, I'd say you're about eight weeks pregnant.""

Eight weeks ago, Irene2 and I had been in Taiwan. I could only blink at the doctor, my mind whirling, trying frantically to pinpoint the exact moment when it had happened. The cramped airplane bathroom, thirty thousand feet in the air? The cheap creaking bed in our Airbnb? The stairwell behind my grandparents' apartment? All those places, all those possibilities. I couldn't remember, and it frustrated me.

The doctor was peering at me, almost accusingly. ""How old are you, young man?""

""Twenty,"" I admitted.

The doctor pursed her lips. ""It's really not my place to say, but for people as young as yourselves, it's best you consider all the options. You'll both have to decide quickly, as the second trimester will be here in less than four weeks."" She handed Irene2 a stack of pamphlets and a prescription for prenatal vitamins. ""Read these and give us a call once you've discussed it with each other and your families. If you decide to continue with the pregnancy, start taking the meds twice a day.""

""What do you want to do?"" I asked Irene2 later that afternoon. We were sitting on a blanket in our campus park with water and sandwiches. She was stretched out on her back beside me, thumbing dispiritedly through a pamphlet. I felt a pang as I looked at her, the cloudiness in her eyes as she stared at the sky. I had ruined her life with my stupidity. Hers, and everyone else's. 

She rolled over to face me. ""I don't know."" Tears were spilling out of her eyes again, rolling down her cheeks. ""I'm so scared. I want to keep this baby, yet I don't know if we should. I can't face this alone, Alex. I need you with me.""

I took her hands. They were cold, and I felt a familiar surge stirring my senses. ""This is more your choice than mine,"" I said. ""But whatever you decide, I'll always be here for you.""

""Then we'll keep it. It's what I wanted from the beginning. You, and me, and this beautiful thing we created together."" She drew me close and kissed me. Overcome by emotion, I kissed her back, threading my fingers through her hair. It was the closest we had been in weeks, so when she hiked her dress to the waist, pulled down her underwear, and crawled onto my lap, I figured there was nothing more to be said. 

As it turned out, none of my friends were particularly impressed by our decision. ""Dude, you're a fucking idiot,"" said my friend Dae-min, over lunch in the cafeteria. ""Isn't this the twenty-first century? I thought only eighties people had no idea condoms existed.""

""Isn't her dad a pastor?"" asked Kayleigh, another friend. ""You're in some deep shit, bro.""

This was true. On Irene2's urging, I called my parents in San Jose to break the news and ask for their advice. Predictably, they were not pleased.

""How could you?"" my dad wanted to know. ""I thought you knew better than this. Really, Alex, we're very disappointed. We worked hard to send you to college, so you would find a good job and rise high in the world. And this is how you choose to repay us, by becoming a father at twenty? Why do you always not think things through before you do them? Even if you left school now, you'd have to find work. Living paycheck to paycheck, is this the life you want? Do you even know much it costs to raise a baby?""

""I'd suggest, and your father agrees, that you go see Irene's parents immediately,"" my mom said. ""And I don't mean just sending a text, Alex. Show up *in person*. Apologize for all the pain and embarrassment you brought down upon them, and beg their forgiveness. And since you and Irene don't want to abort the baby or give it up for adoption, then she should find a part-time job as well. It won't be easy supporting a family of three on your salary alone. With your major in comparative literature, it's very unlikely that you'll be pulling in the same pay as, say, an entry-level investment banker."" 

""You're right,"" I admitted. ""I'll go see her parents at once. And... I'm sorry for letting you both down.""

My mom's voice softened. ""We don't want you to drop out of college, Alex,"" she whispered. ""We'd be happy to help with a small portion of the expenses, but you and Irene will have to take responsibility for the rest of it. This is your mistake, and you both need to own it.""

It was late on Monday afternoon when I pulled up outside Irene's family home and cut the engine. Eighteen solid hours on the I-81 had made me tired and sticky, and I wanted nothing more than to crawl into the back seat and sleep myself into oblivion. I checked myself in the rearview mirror. My eyes were bloodshot, my dress shirt was wrinkled, and my hair was a mess.

I sprayed on some deodorant, smoothed my hair and clothes, and got out of the car on stiff legs. Irene's home was a modest-sized detached house along a dirt road just outside the city. There was a wooden crucifix on the door and a huge, beaten-down truck parked in the driveway. Several chickens pecked about the front yard, watched over by a doleful-looking basset hound. I began to walk up the steps. 

The day before, I had pleaded with Irene2 to accompany me. ""Alex, you know why I can't,"" she'd argued. ""They'll take one look at me and realize I'm not really their daughter. Can you imagine the awkward questions they're going to ask? My presence will only make things worse. I honestly think it'll be better if I stayed put.""

I'd balked, but then she'd taken my face in her hands. ""Please, Alex. One thing. Just do this one thing for me, and I'll find a way to make it up to you. That's a promise.""

And so there I was, alone in the Tennessee backwoods, about to come face-to-face with two people who disliked me beyond reason. I remember thinking that this was it, the culmination of all my fears. It was safe to assume that the meeting would do me no further favors. If by some miracle I escaped this encounter unscathed, there would be nothing else in the world to keep me and Irene2 apart. 

I raised my hand and knocked. 

Irene's father answered the door. I had met him exactly once before, when he and Irene's mother had driven up to Massachusetts the summer of our sophomore year. He had been icily polite to me when Irene had introduced me as her boyfriend. Now his cold eyes roamed over my face much in the same way as before. I could tell from the curl in his mouth that he recognized me. No further introductions were needed. 

""Why are you here?"" He stood blocking the doorway, refusing to let me see inside the house. ""Did something happen to her?""

Laugh all you want, but I was scared. He was a big guy, and I was fairly sure he could wrap both his hands around my neck and snap my head clean off.

""Irene's pregnant!"" I squeaked, before I could stop myself. ""I'm sorry! I'm so sorry.""

His eyes bulged. Fuck, I wanted to kick myself for blurting it out like that. I'd spent the drive down carefully rehearsing what I was going to say, and now I'd gone and blown it. 

""What did you say, boy?""

I flinched. ""She's pregnant. Look, I... I know it's my fault. I came here to apologize to you. I thought we could talk.""

He only stared at me in silence for a long time, his breath rushing hard and fast through his nostrils.

""Talk,"" he grunted at last. ""Talk. What good would it do? You've already ruined her. My pure, innocent daughter, violated by a faithless foreign bastard like you."" He took a heavy step forward, and I involuntarily shrunk back. ""She wanted to go to college in the big city. Always talked about how it would open doors, allow her to meet new people, see the world, that sort of thing. This town was just too small for her. When she got perfect scores on her SATs, my wife and I figured it was God's plan. So we packed her off and kissed her goodbye, just as she wanted. But as you see, it was a big mistake.""

I couldn't think of anything to say. 

""It started when she met you. I've never said this out loud in front of Irene, but God help me, I'll say it to your face right now. I knew there was something wrong with you from the moment I met you. And I don't just mean the fact that you're not really... well, that is, you don't really look like *us*."" He gestured savagely at my face. ""When I first saw you, I thought, *no way my clever, sensible daughter would ever choose a boy like him*. But you just refused to let her go, didn't you? And now you see fit to grovel for my forgiveness. Why on earth should I give it to you?

""You led her from the flock and into darkness. You forced yourself on her like a beast and expelled your disgusting seed into her womb. You robbed her of her virtue and her life. You turned her into a common whore!""

The shit that was streaming out of this guy's mouth was unbelievable. ""She's not a whore!"" I cried. ""And I didn't force her, it was consensual! The baby...""

""You will have no say in that at all, you hear me? She will drop out of that darned school and come home at once. She will have the baby here, and my wife and I will give it up for adoption. She will finish out the rest of her studies at the local community college. Starting from this moment, you are not to speak to her again or contact her in any way. When the time comes for God to judge you, I pray that He has mercy on your soul.""

It was now or never. I drew myself up, and with the last tattered vestiges of my courage I said, ""I love her, and we're getting married.""

His face twisted hideously, his flesh seeming to melt off his cheekbones. I perceived only dimly how his arm jerked backward, his fingers curling around the barrel of a sawed-off shotgun concealed behind the half-open door of his house. Before I could move, he was pointing it directly at my face and bawling, ""Get off my property! Now! NOW!""

I didn't need telling twice. I jumped off his porch and back into my car like a shot rabbit and stamped on the gas. The car leaped into motion and I was off, barreling back towards the interstate at 80 miles per hour. I was shaking, my blood coursing through my body as if I had been lit on fire. I definitely peed myself at least once.

It sounds like a terrible cliche, and I wish I could say I was kidding. But the fucking bastard had actually pointed a gun at me. Sure, I hadn't been expecting immediate forgiveness and a tender welcome into the fold of the family, but I confess I'd been hoping for something else. I don't know, like a serious discussion on what we should do, for a start. And perhaps with time, a little bit of understanding as well. 

Night had fallen, swift and heavy. Somewhere near Lexington, I pulled over on the side of the freeway and called Irene2 on her cell. She answered immediately. ""Is everything all right?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""I love you.""

""I love you too, Alex. Hey, are you sure everything's all right? You sound... kind of messed up.""

""Will you marry me?"" For the second time that day, words were coming out of my mouth before I'd thought them through. It wasn't right. I didn't have a ring; I hadn't prepared a long speech. I had nothing to offer but myself, and the immense weight of that single, tenuous promise. It lingered between us; wide as the sky, brittle as soap film. I closed my eyes, rested my head against the ticking metal of the car, and waited.

""Oh, Alex,"" she sobbed. ""Of course I'll marry you. It's all I ever wanted. Now come home to me, please.""

It's been a week since then, but it's still hard for me to describe my exact feelings in that moment; a strange mixture of elation and triumph and relief. As it turned out, my snap proposal to Irene2 would prove to be the turning point in these tumultuous few months, a sure sign that things were really going to be all right.

Two days after her father pointed a gun at me, Irene2 and I went back to the hospital and told the doctor that we'd be keeping the baby. Apparently, we'll be able to find out in a couple of weeks if it'll be a boy or a girl. Irene2 just asked me which I'd prefer, and I've told her it doesn't matter. I'm just pleased that she's happy, and that our baby will grow up healthy and loved.

More importantly, my dad called to say that they'd heard from my Aunt Flora in Taiwan. The strange mass in my grandma's lung had mysteriously disappeared overnight, and she was already awake and clamoring to be discharged from the hospital. The doctors were pretty stumped; it was nothing short of a medical miracle. My cousin Wei, who'd suffered a terrible motorcycle accident during my visit over the summer, was also well on the way to recovery. He'd finally opened his eyes, and the nurses had fed him water through a straw. I texted him to tell him that I was sorry and that I'd call him when he felt ready to speak to me again, but understandably he hasn't responded. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm really glad they're both okay.  

I tried calling Sharon to tell her that I wouldn't be seeing her anymore, but I ended up speaking to her brother instead. According to him, her usually docile parrot had attacked her face rather viciously in her sleep, and her injuries were so bad that she'd had to temporarily leave school to recover at home. I left her a message, but somehow I don't think she'll call me back. 

In other news, I've just landed a prestigious part-time internship at a major media company an hour's drive away from campus. Irene2 and I have gone over our finances, and my pay should be enough to sustain us while we finish out our last year in college, barring a few minor loans here and there. I've already set aside some money for our wedding. It'll be a small, intimate affair in November for a few of our closest friends. We'll be inviting my parents, but not hers.

I'm secretly saving up to buy Irene2 a ring, a simple band of gold set with a single dark opal at the top. Everything about the ring and its stone reminds me vividly of her: the exquisite craftsmanship, the enigmatic flashes of color beneath the oiled black surface, and the midnight sheen swimming in its depths, unknowable to all except those who behold it with affection and gentleness. I want to be the one to slide it onto her finger, to marvel at the sacred fit of metal against flesh. I want to be bound with her in a manner that transcends mortality; to rejoice and revel in the blessed coupling of our souls. For she is the only one who completes, uplifts, and sustains me. I don't care what anyone else says. I belong to her and her alone, through this world and the next. Through the planes of eternity, and the yawning voids beyond.

To everyone who has faithfully followed me in my journey thus far, I just wanted to say that this will be my last update. You guys have been amazing, and I'm sincerely grateful for your honest support and advice during this challenging time in my life.

Thank you all once again, for everything. "

I've been working at my internship, doing web dev stuff at NASA, since March '17. I've been looking into going into industry but I've found that the areas I'm interested in are very technical or not ""R&amp;D enough"" and many require Masters or PhDs. 

As a result, I've been doing my own personal research into my areas of interest in my free time, but I'm finding myself wanting to take a day off work just to do more research and I'm thinking I would like to only be doing research, i.e. getting a PhD.

My major GPA in undergrad was 3.4 and cumulative was 3.1 (unfortunately), not super great for getting into the upper tiers of grad programs.

My core CS class grades are solid

* Computer Architecture - A
* Data Structures - A-
* Automata - A-
* Operating Systems - B+

I'm currently doing a Udacity Nanodegree and have covered topics such as: computer vision, deep learning, and sensor fusion. All relating to material I would find relevant to my future research interests, namely `Real-Time, Embedded and Cyber-Physical Systems`. I've gotten 1/3 of the way through a good text book on Real-Time Systems and understood it quite well. I also have a solid amount of experience reading research publications in the self-driving car space, but just no research done myself.

What schools should I reasonably be looking at? I don't want to waste money applying to programs I have little to no chance of getting into. I know I should be more worried about my advisor and I agree, but I don't even know what colleges to start looking at in order begun evaluating potential advisers at said universities. "

I studied a Humanities field for undergrad, but I'm now pursuing a Master's degree in CS, with a focus in AI (the department's rank is in top 15, not trying to brag; wanted to be clear that this isn't me going to some for-profit online school, or anything like that). I also did a year at a CC where I took some undergrad CS courses, like C and C++ programming, and some really basic algorithms/data structures. For instance, I can easily implement several algorithms and could tell you some basic things about the big-O running time, but wouldn't be able to write a proof, for instance, of why building a heap is actually linear time, or why the expected run time of hash lookup is constant.

I can, however, implement some ML models. I've implemented Perceptrons, RNN, Word2Vec in Tensorflow and I'm pretty proficient with Python programming. Furthermore, the goal is obviously to know quite a big about AI after a year of taking graduate courses. But the main issue is that many companies expect us to start applying for internships around now, and so I haven't taken any actual graduate courses yet, nor have I had the opportunity to fill in my undergraduate algorithms deficits. Thus, I feel limited in my ability to pass a technical interview, coupled with having no idea of what to expect. So I feel like I'm caught in the middle somewhere between knowing a little and knowing a lot, but am also confident that I can contribute to something, somewhere, this coming summer.

Does anyone have any advice for my situation? I'd be open to doing something that isn't AI focused if it came to that, I really just want to get some kind of experience.

Thanks for reading my somewhat rambling post. I know this will probably come off as really ""poor me,"" so I'm throwing myself at the mercy of the internet here."
9h751f,1,2018-09-19,Feeling stuck in my career. Is it strange that I want to return to college to get the experience I missed out on the last time I was there?,TotalProgrammer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9h751f/feeling_stuck_in_my_career_is_it_strange_that_i/,"To make a long story short, I have experience in software engineering already, but I'm dissatisfied with a lot of things in my career. Mostly I am dissatisfied with pay, job stability, and recognition. I just feel like I'm spinning my wheels getting nowhere, not competent nor reputable enough to get a hire at any of the decently run companies. 

 My job history is filled with a trail of failing startups. I hate my life for how insecure it is financially and how I have not matured or been enlightened. My living conditions are as if I'm still working average part-time jobs.

And I missed out a lot of stuff when I was in college, but especially not majoring in CS. As a result I never took internships, and as a result of not doing *that* I never got a taste of working for a large company, trying different job cultures out and getting mentored. Or getting a recommendation from someone at one of those companies so that I can secure a job.

So I don't know if going back to college is the right thing to do, but is it weird that I think it is and also because I regret not living it better, in the academic and professional sense? I'm just going by the saying that you have one life to live, and you'll regret what you wish you could have done.

One thing I really wish I did besides get in a formal CS major is internships. And also meeting with professors, joining academic clubs, build connections and do well in classes so that I can intern at some really great companies. If you tried to get into one of those companies with my current self-taught background and no good connections, hah good luck, it's gonna be a shot in the dark.

You can't do that kind of ""taste-test"" of company internships after graduation. If you try to join and leave several companies in quick succession, it'll look real bad on you. So it's only possible to put feelers out for companies, ""demo"" them out when you are in college. And I look forward to getting to do that. 

And interviewing the companies isn't the same because you're not literally gonna be working alongside them- you're just there for a couple of hours, there's still a lot that you won't know about or experience. So can you see why I'd want to go back to college? Is it recommended I do so? And if you disagree, can you say why should I not seek academic and professional experiences that I never had, when they have been very helpful to many others?"
9h75bd,20,2018-09-19,In-Depth tutorial on how to implement data augmentation techniques for bounding boxes / object detection,ForgottenRhymes,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/9h75bd/indepth_tutorial_on_how_to_implement_data/,"For the past 9 months or so, I've worked an internship that has extensively required me to work with Object Detection. While data augmentation can be leveraged for great gains, I quickly realised that most of the data augmentation libraries or code bases out there don't exactly support what you will call *bounding box transforms.*

What I mean is let's consider the `torchvision` package from the PyTorch  which supports rotating an image randomly. When it does so, the bounding box containing the objects will also change, and `torchvision` doesn't support changing the annotation/label for the image we are rotating. The only library I have found that supports such augmentations is `imageaug` which only supports scaling and translation, and not advanced stuff like rotating, shearing and resizing.

Most of the open source implementations of object detectors I came across therefore implemented their own augmentations. Therefore, I decided to implement a tiny library on my own that currently supports bounding box augmentations for flipping, rotation, shearing, scaling, translation and resizing. I'm currently looking to add more augmentations, so would be greatly helpful if you could chip in with augmentations that work well for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the GitHub repo:

[https://github.com/Paperspace/DataAugmentationForObjectDetection](https://github.com/Paperspace/DataAugmentationForObjectDetection)

and the documentation can be found by opening the `docs/build/html/index.html` file.

If you want to know how I implemented it for pedagogical purposes, or you just feel like critiquing the design decisions, here's a tutorial series that covers the implementation from absolute scratch. This tutorial series cover the implementations in gory detail where I go over:

1. How to set up a uniform interface for defining an augmentation, so you could define your own.
2. What to do when a bounding box crosses the boundary of the image. Do we keep it, or do we drop it? Something in between?
3. How to combine multiple augmentations where each augmentation is applied in a stochastic manner.
4. How to incorporate these augmentations into your input pipelines. I cover this considering people use a lot of annotation tools and annotations come in different formats.

I have had one internship with a financial services firm and although I enjoyed it for the experience and growth, I would only really pursue it for the great income potential. 

I used to believe pursuing a career just for the money wasn’t a big deal, since it only a job and not your whole life. Im now realizing that if I’m going to be spending the bulk of my time working, it should probably be something I am motivated and happy to be doing. My real passions are things I pursue on the side. With that being said, my passions include fitness, building computers, technology and games. 

I have a nagging sense that maybe I should double major in computer science at this point as it actually correlates with things I love to work with. It would delay my graduation by a whole year, which is sort of frightening to have a whole extra year of debt, but it may be worth it as I believe I would love to go to work everyday developing new software or even video games.

Has anyone decided to pursue something else late in their college career? Would you say it was worth it?

Looking for a way to connect my computers to my dual monitor setup seamlessly in my home lab. I recently am going off my internship and back to school but scored a gig with the company I interned at to work from home whenever I can. They provided me with a USB-C dock for my laptop that I can use at home. I currently have a dual monitor setup on my gaming PC at home and have hooked the dock up to the other source inputs of the monitor. I am looking for a way to seamlessly switch my KB/M and my monitor inputs quickly when the laptop is docked and my gaming PC is on. 

My only thought would be to set up two KVMs one for each monitor. At the push of two buttons, I could have everything switch over. This seems like it would be making this process difficult, but I've seen no KVMs that support dual monitors. Any ideas?

9h9abm,8,2018-09-19,5 Months out of college and I seem to be one of the only ones of my peers to not have a real FT job yet. Advice?,Death_AllHisFriends,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9h9abm/5_months_out_of_college_and_i_seem_to_be_one_of/,"I just graduated this May after 3 years at Indiana University: BS in Informatics and Minor in CS. *[Informatics being more broad and about IT as a whole, and human side of computing, minor in CS being for the actual code/algorithms]*

**Portfolio**: https://jfarris587.github.io/web-portfolio/

**Resume**: https://imgur.com/a/yPndhwc

Because I was graduating early, internships turned me down, *""you need to be enrolled in school""* and FT turned me down because *""you have no internship experience and are too young""* so it sucked, but I did get this Part Time ""internship"" deal with a company as a ""HTML5 web developer."" Even though it is $15/hr and I'm making no more as I would working at the University Café, I take it (only option) and can't complain.

# 5 Months later...

... And they still haven't offered FT yet. It was mentioned by mentor that it was *""in the works""* but that was two months ago, and that topic has reappeared here and there since. But nothing. However, I'm not disappointed because it's actually not what I anticipated as a developer job....

- It's not challenging anymore after I've spent the past month outside of work really learning a ton and doing my own projects
- The company doesn't seem to have a high standard of dev work. Ex: I -**as a complete amateur in this field who is at the bottom of the totem poll**- think that some of what they develop is... bad? poor code/technique from other developers. The things they showcase for clients is 2006 era web development. 1) UI looks like a 2006 web site 2) they didn't have a dev/production environment until I showed up and made one. Not sure how they do what they specialize in and not have automated builds for their projects. It had to taken them so long to do it manually. Which leads me to believe they aren't the best, but fulfill their market in the local area.
- Repetitive work, reinventing the wheel for a worse product if you hadn't reinvented (reasons same as above), everyone is slow at their work for some reason, idk why but I seem to complete tasks quicker than expected? I have to drag tasks out longer rather than being productive.
- I assume it will be low pay if FT offered, and barely over $15/hr in salary.

Over the past month, outside of work, I've worked on my portfolio to learn things in web development since its such a huge field. I still feel like a rookie, and am lost since **I went to college because I was told that getting a solid job out of college would be significantly easier.** But I'm stuck in the mud it seems.

# Peers all got jobs...

**Peers who graduated alongside me but didn't have more skills on their resume have gotten 3 month summer internships that led into FT offers for a normal 50K+.** I'm also struggling because their positions are vague ""business analyst"" positions. They describe their day as ""doing some SQL queries, working with some data in excel"" and things that sound really basic tbh. It confuses me how that's getting them 50k salary offers? (unless they exaggerated? idk)

**To get there, they had to do something I'm missing out on.** So, I'm trying to figure out what else I need to be doing to get a real FT job. In my case, narrowing in on web dev as a development start, like I said, I've been spending hours the past month learning. I only have 2 full stack big apps in my portfolio (one is still in dev), and the rest are smaller scale projects as you can see, so maybe that's my issue. **Applying to jobs, maybe I just need to target populated urban cities more? My small college town just doesn't have a lot to offer, but maybe even my close cities are still over saturated with better prospects? idk...**

# I expected college to be different...

Like I said, I guess my view of college was different than reality? But with everyone else doing just fine without huge enormous resumes of skills and experience, I question that thought too. As a student instructor who taught undergrads my age and younger, I saw/graded over 200+ sample size of students in my degree. A solid 20% I questioned how they were going to graduate/get a job. 20% you could tell they were really smart and knew that they have a great resume without even seeing it. But then the 60% rest were just normal. **Yet, here I am still among the bottom 20% still looking for a real FT job. *I have got to be missing something that everyone else has under their belt***

He showed some expressions that made me think he did not see me fitting with the job. After I realized that, I did my best and insisted, showing him how that job opportunity fits with me, and he looked to be more interested. 

After that, the interview ended (I reached the time limit of half an hour). It was an ok conversation, but Im afraid that he did not like me.

1 hour after the interview, he looked at my linkedin (I received an notification). Does that mean something? 

I really want this job and Im thinking of texting him, showing how much I want this job and that I would do everything that is possible to learn what I need to know for this job. Do you guys think thats a good move? 

Obs: i still haven’t received any email/feedback of the process. I did the second interview two days ago.

9h9ylb,5,2018-09-19,is it worth going to a “harder” school?,abigfailure1,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9h9ylb/is_it_worth_going_to_a_harder_school/,"So, basically, I’m going to a UC known to be harder than the average school. I’m only a freshman right now, but I’m taking the first computer science class and it’s quite challenging. Now, don’t get me wrong— I’m really enjoying my time here. I’m not drowning or anything (yet), but I’m getting the sense that midterms and just content in general are much more difficult than many schools, thus I do think it’s going to be a bit more challenging for me to get what’s considered a “good” GPA. The school has the prestige, of course, but I can’t help but wonder if that’s worth getting a lower GPA. And not to mention, I’m an intended CS major, so it’s going to be even more difficult for me since it’s considerably one of the harder majors.

I don’t think I’m going to fail out or anything, but some of my friends are going to what are considered less intense, “easier” UCs/colleges. One of my friends, who has already started school, is finding that the courses are quite easy at her school. She seems to be headed in a very good direction GPA-wise and I wouldn’t be surprised if she pulled off close to a 4.0. But where I’m going, I’m already sure I won’t get a 4.0. My first CS class is pretty brutal to get an A in, so I’m aiming a lower than that. But it’s frustrating in some ways because my GPA is going to be deflated compared to others. 

So, is it worth going to a harder school because of prestige? Is getting a lower GPA here than others from different schools going to harm me, especially when applying for internships, jobs, etc.? Because it certainly feels that way. "

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago there was big hype around being a web dev, i'm just starting to get around it now after failing to find a job in mechanical engineering. So just wanted to get an update of how things are, specifically the markets in Canada and the US. My plan is to land something here in Canada and get to the US ASAP if Trump doesn't tear up that NAFTA agreement (TN visa). If you are a US resident, please answer the questions below as if I was also a US resident. To do this, my plan is to (over 6 months): 

1. become proficient with HTML, CSS, Javascript
2. become familiar with D3 and node.js, strengthening proficiency with JS by exploring how it is used in a full stack app.
3. Practice front end dev in greater depth, understand data structures i'm likely to encounter in interviews and on the job.
4. Finish 20-24 projects that will be displayed on Github as part of my portfolio.

My main concern is, **how competitive it is to secure an entry level position?** How long does the job searching process take? it is based more towards networking and nepotism, or project-based and merit? What will happen to the industry 5 years from now? 10 years from now? What if a person is unable to secure a job, can he freelance and sustain himself that way? how would a person go about getting internships? Networking?

9hakkj,12,2018-09-19,Possibly considering doing 2 years at a local community college or university and then transferring to a state-wide renown engineering school,TylerTheMLGPro,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/9hakkj/possibly_considering_doing_2_years_at_a_local/,"I am very split on which route I should take, and I need your help deciding. A note before reading, I currently have a 25 on the ACT and a 3.3 GPA

The main factor is the money situation. My family does fine financially but we definitely don't have the money to just go to college and have zero worries about it. My parents currently have about $30k saved up for me for college, with various family members donating to that as the years have gone by in the years past. The 4 year engineering school I am wanting to go to has about a $10,000 in state tuition and I can receive 35% off of that with my current ACT and GPA, then after you factor in all the other typical college expenses, that would reach about $20,000 per year, for four years. 

But, if I were to go to my local community college for the first 2 years, it would end up only costing about $15,000 for both of those years. On top of that, if I keep my GPA at said college to a 3.5, I will get about the same amount of scholarship money if I were to go straight to the 4 year engineering school.

Now, on to the arguably more/less important factor. The state in which I reside in has a bill in place to where if the institution holds a certain accreditation, a larger 4 year university must accept transferable classes from a smaller school like a community college. My only worry is that perhaps the classes at said community college will not be as high of difficulty as the 4 year engineering school, and I will be left unprepared and not on par with other students who have been there for the full time. Note: the community college has all of the main core engineering maths and sciences up to Calc 3 and the various Physics w/ Calc classes, and has several other associates degrees in other applied engineering focuses.

And another factor driving me away from going to the community college is the fact that I will probably miss out on a lot of the co-op and internship opportunities that this University is quite renown for, being located in an area where an astounding amount of companies and various engineering firms are located. Since nowadays the STEM field is becoming more and more popular, that will be a great thing to experience and be able to put on my resume when I graduate and go on looking for a job, helping me stand out from the crowd and even possibly get hired from the same company I interned with. 

If anyone would like further information as to what university and community college I am considering, let me know and I may edit this post, or I will just PM you so we can talk 1 on 1. 

Thank you all for reading, any advice will be greatly helpful. Also, don't forget to mention any possible factors or points that you all know of that I may not have thought about!! Have a good day all and thank you for reading."

However, they asked me if I want to come back in winter, or next year summer.

I said no for winter because I wanted to travel abroad, but I said yes for next year summer, since I wanted it as a safety in case I do not get offer from any other companies.

Right now, I actually do want to know how much they were going to pay me if I go back there as a full time. I should've asked this while I was working there as an intern, but I was kind of afraid to do so. 

Tomorrow, I will be having an interview with a bigger defense company than the company that I interned, but seems like their starting salary will be less for some reason (based on the Glassdoor base pay).

I know there's pitfalls to doing that, but I figure once I get one job that I should have a good foot in the door to continue off of.

I've got experience in primarily Java, and varying experience in python, ruby, PHP, ruby on rails, SQL, JavaScript, C++,C#, HTML/HAML/CSS, and git and Linux experience. I've had a 3+ month ruby in rails internship thats gotten me some work experience, but most of my knowledge was self taught either off pluralsight or codecademy (Years ago when it was good) or just messing around with languages. Even with my internship I don't feel like I got a great idea of what it'll be like to work in the industry itself, and since I don't know what it's really like to be working as a programmer that kinda looms over me.

I know a degree would help me infinitely in getting a job, but after taking a year long break from school I really enjoyed working 8 hours a day 5 days a week comparatively to school. I'm at the point in my degree where nearly all the classes I'm taking are repeat information, not to brag or anything but I just feel like I have most of the knowledge already that I would be gaining from the degree, and I have really been debating sending in my resumé to a bunch of companies just to see what I get back. Any insight into how feasible this might be is very appreciated, since this could be risky from how I see it. "

As of now I planned on applying to 4 reach schools. 

* Northwestern 

* Notre Dame

* GaTech

* Michigan

I absolutely love all 4 of the schools and although I haven't visited, I have done a ton of research on all of them and would absolutely love to go to any of the 4. All four have strong engineering programs as well.

Now the main issue and the reason for this post.

My stats are weak when compared to most applicants to these schools.

1510 SAT, 33 ACT. Math 2 and Physics being taken in October

Above average ECs (at least compared to my classmates): Student council, leadership roles in a few clubs, varsity athlete in two sports, volunteering, theater program, NHS tutoring, summer internship. But nothing that would impress this sub. 

My reccs will likely be pretty strong as I have a personal relationship with both teachers I asked.

My essay will be well written, but otherwise painstakingly average.

And now you're probably thinking, ""This application is pretty solid so far, not above average, but not completely unreasonable for those schools."" Welp let me prove you wrong! **3.4 UW GPA.**

I just need some brutally honest opinions. My dad is letting me apply to around 10 schools so I want to make every application count. But I don't want to waste any applications on places where I have absolutely no chance. **And I know the whole ""blind leading the blind"" thing, but I just want to hear what other people would do in my shoes.**

Other schools I plan to apply to are: Deleware, Penn State and Pitt(In-state), Maryland, VAtech, Purdue, and Lehigh. Feel free to comment on what you think my chances are there. I tried to avoid making this a straight up r/chanceme post, but what are you gonna do.

I don't have much professional experience in my chosen career field [video production] - how should I move forward?",GVOLTT,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9hcb6z/over_a_year_since_i_graduated_college_yet_i_have/,"So, approximately this time last year, I earned my degree from a four-year university, a B.S. in Communications, with my specialization being in video production. [I had previously been to a separate university, initially for computer science before switching to communications, but took a couple of years off to deal with personal issues, before enrolling in a university closer to home.] However, I assume due to my resume being a little, well, short, I have been unable to not only not find a job in my field, but also not able to even get a basic entry-level job [such as in retail or a restaurant] or an interview to one whenever I apply. The reason my resume is short is because I don't really have much, if any, relevant professional experience. The experience I list is basically the one internship required by my university to graduate, and a couple of municipal summer jobs while I was in high school. Aside from those, I have no job experience. I realize I probably should've taken on a second internship while in college, before my final semester, but alas, I didn't. It didn't help that my university [at least in my major, not sure about other majors] required that internships be unpaid, to allow us to focus more on getting experience than being paid for doing a job. [I do have an issue with this particular policy, having looked into laws on paid and unpaid internships, but that's beside the point, even if it had allowed me to apply for more potential internship opportunities, ones that were paid.]

So, basically, I have hardly any professional experience at all, especially when considering video production jobs, but I feel affects pretty much any job I apply for. I have made a basic website [a task given to me at my internship when they were otherwise short on work for the interns that day] that includes pretty much my entire portfolio of video work, which is just assignments I had for my various classes, including a demo reel. However, I am unable to really expand on it, because I don't have a decent-quality camera, a decent non-linear video editing program, or the money to even afford either. And like I have said, I have been unable to get even the most basic of jobs to just merely get income, so that doesn't help. As such, I don't feel I can gain even freelance experience. [This being said, I *do* have a crappy point-and-shoot camera, and can figure out basic video-editing programs, even if they have limited features.]

I am just completely unsure of how to proceed. Do I continue to look into the basic job route? Do I continue to look into what few video jobs I can find and apply for those? I know there's other technicalities I need to look into regarding my resume (mainly with how I order the different sections) and cover letter (which I generally just change the company name/info/job position depending on where I apply, but don't change much else beyond what I initially included - it's a bad habit, I know, but I feel I can fix it, especially if the company covers topics relevant to my personal interests), but I don't feel they're my primary problems. Do I just try to use my crappy point-and-shoot to film stuff? I don't have ideas for what to film, though. Basically, just... what do I do?"

I havent been doing internships because my grades were shit and i didnt have a major for like a year. and now im worried its too late. so lets say that i end up staying in college for another three years. can i still do interships during those three years? can they be during the school year or do they have to be during summer or winter breaks. if i can get my grades high again im most likely going to get my masters

I'll try to cut it as much as possible. I recently started taking a course on Game Developing (from which I'll go to Game Design and everything), but unfortunately in my country, gaming industry is close to non-existent.

&amp;#x200B;

What would be a suitable job for a student on Computer Science and Economics? The CS part is hardly ever challenged, but I've been learning on my own for a year now, although I've been jumping from C#, to Java, to SQL (I needed it for school), and now Unity3D, and soon Blender. I also know a little bit of Photoshop if helps with anything.

My plan would be to keep the whole Game Design/ Game Development as a hobby for the time being, and having a job in a related industry.

In this very moment, I have an opportunity as a QA specialist Internship or as an [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) specialist, but I'm unsure (because I also have to do a math class from last semester, and time might be pressuring me from everywhere). The Back-End part isn't really my best perk, nor gives me any kind of pleasure doing it. What would be more suitable for someone that wants to work with Unity3D and Blender in the spare-time?

9hfewq,47,2018-09-20,You guys have been the affirmation I’ve needed....,ThePopesicle,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9hfewq/you_guys_have_been_the_affirmation_ive_needed/,"I’m writing this at 6 in the morning before I’ve taken my meds, so my apologies if this seems a little choppy.

I’m 24 and was diagnosed last February (age 23), and let me tell ya, the last 7 months have been nothing short of incredible. Like many of you, I spent years being told by doctors I was only depressed and anxious. Since high school, I’ve definitely felt depressed, mostly because I couldn’t manage my life the same way others did, even though it seemed I was putting in way more effort. By the time a went off to college, doctors were throwing everything my way, from flouxitine to xanax, to try and get things right. I was able to make it through my first few years of college as a C student, but my upper-divisions killed me. At one point I was spending 20 hrs/wk studying for one class (PChem) and still failed....twice. Suicidal thoughts came routinely. I had to work during all my free time to keep up with finances, and ultimately I was missing out on many experiences just because I couldn’t stay organized enough.

I was finally able to get specialist (off campus) who diagnosed me. With some counseling, we were able to determine that growing up the symptoms were 100% there, it was just that my family had deemed those symptoms unacceptable and they were essentially conditioned out of me. My emotional response to any sort of disorganization became shame, which is why I could never really feel happy with myself. 

While I was coming to grips with my diagnosis, I was especially shameful because it felt as if I was pretending....that my subconscious-self was so beat down that I was willing to fake a condition to get a drug that would help me cheat and feel better. That’s when I came across this subreddit, and I knew I wasn’t faking. So many of the experiences shared on here have been identical to my own. I spent a whole day crying once just because I was so happy that I wasn’t lying; that my own experience was relatable and I wasn’t alone. 

Since February, I’ve gotten straight A’s, averaging a 2.3 GPA before, and a 3.9 since. I have so many great new friends, and have developed some of the strongest relationships I’ve ever had. I’ve worked 2 incredible, life changing internships and at the same time have gotten myself to the most secure financial position I’ve ever been in. I got out of a toxic relationship and can finally begin to identify what is really important to me in an SO. I’m also in the best shape of my life, and can finally get a full night’s sleep without the use of drugs and alcohol. 

There are still some speed bumps going forward. I still feel a lot of shame for the fact I’ll be in my 6th year of undergrad (I got diagnosed on the back half of my 5th). I will be taking PChem again this fall, and am hoping for the best. Not gonna lie, I feel a lot of bitterness towards the fact that it took this long to get things right, but this chip on my shoulder has also been a great motivator. Through one of my internships, I was able to get close to one of the department heads at John Hopkins, and if things keep going the way the are, there’s a good chance I’ll have a shot of getting into my dream grad-program. 

You guys have been a HUGE part of all this. All my life I have been completely consumed by shame, but hearing all of your stories has made this transition incredibly easier. You have given me the comfort I never knew I so desperately needed. I’m honestly still terrified that the rug is going to get pulled up from underneath me and I will go right back to how life was before medication and treatment. Regardless, I’ve never been this optimistic, and the future has never looked so good. Thank you, r/ADHD. You’re wholesomeness is life-changing and you deserve credit where it is due.

There’s more I could say, but I’m on the toilet and my leg is now asleep. I hope you all have a great day :)"

### Hello! Who are you and what are you working on?

I’m John James, I’m currently the CEO of [Engine, a new cloud hosted ecommerce platform](https://www.enginecommerce.com/).  

In this interview, however, I’m sharing the story of how I started my previous business, Acumen Brands.  

I’ll share how we started, how we acquired a nine million Facebook fans in 90 days for one of our brands, how we leveraged that success to raise $100 million in venture capital in middle-of-nowhere Arkansas, and how the business ultimately failed spectacularly after being acquired.

I’m excited to share the story about how an ex-physician (me) and an ex-lawyer built a automated robotic warehouse to support a few dozen online stores, and how one of the stores (Country Outfitter) exploded into a hundred million dollar retailer of cowboy boots in less than six months, despite the fact that neither of the founders owned a single a pair of cowboy boots.

### What's your backstory and how did you get into ecommerce?

Acumen Brands was founded on January 1, 2009, at the height of the financial crisis.

**From doctor to entrepreneur**

At that time, I already had well over decade of ecommerce experience.  I founded my first ecommerce business from my college dorm room in 1995, and the proceeds from selling quiz bowl questions and study aids on the early internet financed my medical school education.

In 2001, while working 100 hour weeks during the intern year of my Family Practice residency, I started my second business one night when I was on call in the hospital.  It was perhaps the only slow night of call in my three years of residency, and I took advantage of the quiet time to build [Grillstuff.com](https://www.grillstuff.com/).

My brother and I were partners in that business, and we hoped to hit $30,000 in revenue in 2002.  If memory serves, we beat our 2002 forecast by nearly 100x, and we even had a $30,000 DAY at the end of that year!

**Taking advantage of Google**

The arbitrage of the nascent Google Adwords keyword platform was pretty incredible in the early days. At that time, you could achieve first position in the search results for a few pennies or a nickel on super competitive keywords.  

We dominated search for grilling related keywords, allowing us to scale quite quickly.  The unbelievably cheap marketing allowed us to bootstrap that business to eight figures of revenue without taking investment capital.  Excluding the $49 “investment” we made into building a Yahoo Store, we were profitable from day one.

**The advent of Acumen Brands**

I sold that business in 2008, and almost immediately started Acumen Brands.

I started Acumen after reading an article in Harvard Business Review stating that in times of recession / depression / financial crisis, businesses that double down on their marketing spend gain a disproportionate amount of market share.  Paradoxically, starting my second business right after 9/11 and my third during the 2009 crisis was quite fortuitous.

With Acumen Brands, we set out to build several dozen online stores in several different verticals.  We built our own ecommerce software platform, and launched a couple dozen stores in different niches including medical scrubs, workwear, outdoor gear, dance wear, cowboy boots, and several others.

We didn’t know it at the time, but as I’ll explain, one of our stores, [Country Outfitter](https://www.countryoutfitter.com/), would grow an order of magnitude larger than the other stores and change our lives in the process.

### Describe the process of launching these online stores and running this while operation.

At the time, I described our business as “a marketing plan in search of products to sell.”

We had a cutting edge ecommerce platform that plugged into Google (and eventually Facebook and email marketing) quite well, and we had an SEO and SEM expertise that was light years ahead of many of our eventual competitors.

We were agnostic to industry, and find our target markets, we started with a data driven approach to keyword research.

We were looking for mid to high volume search terms with a good deal of purchase intent.  Once we found those keywords, we further narrowed our scope to industries that didn’t have an established online category killer brand - we didn’t want to sell books against Amazon, electronics against Best Buy, or even fishing supplies against Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s.

Additionally, we were looking for items that could be shipped easily, that had big gross margins, and weren’t sold online directly by their manufacturers.

We found a few dozen candidates, and we started building stores.

After building the first two, a medical scrubs brand and a workwear brand, we raised $3.75 million of venture capital -- the first round of VC in Arkansas in over a decade.

With that capital we installed a [Kiva robotic fulfilment system](https://www.supplychain247.com/company/kiva_systems), and launched a new store every couple weeks, growing to around 20 stores very quickly.

**Building our own software**

Before we could open our first store, we needed software.  We spent about 6 months building the first version of our custom ecommerce platform, and spent the next 6 years improving the product.

The learnings from managing a few dozen of our own stores on our own platform eventually led to Engine, the ecommerce platform we’re building today.  My old CTO (and great friend) Jim Kane was Engine’s co-founder, and we’ve hired several of the best engineers from our old team.

**Building a fulfillment center**

In addition to software, we also needed a world-class fulfillment center to pick, pack, and ship our orders. With the help of Kiva Systems and their robots, we designed and built one of the world’s most efficient split case fulfilment centers in a very short period of time - 96 days from start to finish, Kiva’s quickest install by nearly a year.

### How did you attract and retain customers?

We scaled from $3 million to $5 million to $9 million in revenue in our first three years, largely on the back of our “harvest demand” strategy driven by Google keyword marketing.  We would open a new store, adding new keywords to the mix, and revenue would follow albeit slower than we wanted.

Unlike the business I started in 2001 where clicks were super cheap, in 2009 Google Adwords was just beginning to get cost prohibitive for a startup. If we were going to scale quicker, we needed another nascent ad platform to arbitrage.

**Taking advantage of Facebook**

By arbitraging Facebook’s nascent ad platform, we were able to grow on of our stores, Country Outfitter, a retailer of cowboy boots, beyond our wildest expectations.

The opportunity was enormous. Whereas there were only 135,000 searches each month for cowboy boots on Google, we could reach 18.2 million potential cowboy boot wearers on Facebook by targeting people who liked country music, horses, and rodeo on Facebook.

The majority of those 18.2 million women owned a pair of cowboy boots, and we knew many of those would buy another pair in the near future.

We tried dozens of tactics, but the strategies we used on Google simply didn’t work on Facebook. Unlike Google where retailers could harvest pre-existing demand exposed by keyword searches, Facebook users weren’t in the buying mood.  Rather than “harvesting” demand, we had to “create” demand.

Harvesting demand is relatively easy and logical.  We’d first acquire a click from one of 135,000 searches a month for cowboy boots, then we’d land the shopper on a page containing all our cowboy boots, and sales followed linearly.

**A different strategy with Facebook**

The strategy we used to crack the Facebook code was counterintuitive.

Rather than sell boots directly on the first visit, we changed our goal to get multiple visits from the same visitor, and make the first sale over time.  

The goal of the first visit was simply to establish a relationship with the customer.  To ensure multiple visits without having to pay Facebook multiple times, we required the visitor to “join” the site by subscribing to our email list and becoming our fan on Facebook.

**Giveaways and a viral loop**

We enticed the visitor to subscribe to our email by entering them into a giveaway to win a $500 pair of cowboy boots.

After they entered their email address, we asked them to become our Facebook fan, and share the giveaway with their friends.  After completing that 1-2-3 step process, they unlocked a 20% discount.  

While more than half the people declined our invitation to “join,” the visitors who did would come back an inordinate amount of times.  They’d come back every week to enter our next weekly giveaway, and eventually they’d purchase a pair of boots.

Each weekly giveaway had over a million entrants, and Country Outfitter would routinely have 10 million site visits a month.

Due to the viral loops described above, Country Outfitter became ubiquitous on Facebook.  We held our first giveaway on Labor Day 2012, and by the end of that year

we had acquired 9 million fans and 11 million email subscribers.

Amazingly, 8% of those 11 million giveaway entrants eventually purchased a pair of cowboy boots from us, leading to a $100 million annual revenue run rate.  Through the process, Country Outfitter’s revenue grew from just $100,000 / month to a $14.5 million month just six months later.

Converting 8% of 11 million giveaway entrants into paying customers was an exhilarating challenge.

**Email marketing flows**

With 11 million email subscribers, we had to immediately shift away from a “batch and blast” email marketing strategy, quickly migrating to a much more efficient system of “event driven” marketing flows.  

Rather than flood our customer’s inboxes with unsolicited spam, we constructed dozens of automated marketing cascades that were tailored to the activity and interest of individual shoppers.  If USER X does EVENT Y then they receive MARKETING FLOW Z customized to their known interests.

These automated cascades increased our ecommerce email CPM by 1000%.  Updated learnings and processes gleaned from optimizing these flows are my favorite feature of Engine’s new ecommerce platform.

### What caused the company to fail?

To get to today, you have to run through several failures, and a couple great successes.

While we succeeded in generating a fantastic return for our Seed, Series A, and Series B investors and achieved a life-changing partial exit for the founding team, we fell far short of our goal of building a publicly traded company.  The cause of “failure” was multifactorial.

**Stepping down as CEO**

18 months after selling a majority of Acumen Brands, I stepped down as CEO.  The company had morphed from a retail marketing technology company to a retailer of cowboy boots that was attempting to become a manufacturer as well.  I was over my head, and out of my sweet spot, so I left.  After I left, the company lost their CTO and vital growth marketing talent as well.

**Competition**

The company failed spectacularly after losing that talent, but the writing was already on the wall when we left:  Amazon (and Zappos) started moving heavily into our space, the brands we sold started their own websites and started selling direct, our [biggest competitor went public](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/western-apparel-retailer-boot-barn-prices-ipo-at-16-the-high-end-of-the-range-cm408003), and most importantly Facebook’s organic reach algorithm changed dramatically and bid prices increased exponentially.

The fall from grace was nearly as swift as the ascension.

**Facebook Algorithm Changes**

With a series of algorithm changes, Facebook rendered our 9 million fans worthless. Whereas our organic reach initially hovered around 56%, it dropped quickly to well under 1%.  

Where over 5 million fans would see our posts for free in the beginning, after the algorithm changes, only 50,000 fans would see an average post.

**Switching from our custom built platform**

The death knell, however, was the new owner’s decision to switch off our powerful, custom-built ecommerce platform to Demandware.  The day of the platform switch, conversion rates dropped 38%, and never recovered.  

The business assets were eventually sold to our largest competitor for pennies on the dollar - a competitor we contemplated buying out just a couple years earlier.

**Changes in the ecommerce industry**

Through watching that decline, as well as watching the high profile implosions of similar high-flyers like [Gilt Groupe](https://www.gilt.com/) and [One Kings Lane](https://www.onekingslane.com/), I’ve realized that the future of ecommerce looks decidedly different than the beginnings.

As we found out on Country Outfitter, selling other manufacturers goods like a traditional retailer is largely a fool’s errand today -- Amazon’s already won that game, Wal-Mart is a clear second, and several great companies like Nordstrom are fighting for a distant third.

**Customer relationships and brand power**

The ecommerce companies that are winning today, and will win in the future, all have a direct relationship with their customer.  The majority of those will be high margin, vertically integrated direct-to-consumer companies.

While we did almost everything right, we found out the hard way that customer loyalty lies mainly with the brand they are purchasing, not the retailer.  In today’s post-Amazon world, retailers are largely “dumb pipes” - supply chains utilized by consumers to get the products from their chosen brands in the most efficient way possible.  

Customers are increasingly agnostic to where they buy their favorite brands, but remain highly brand loyal.

This brand loyalty, and the unprecedented ability to reach new customers online presents an exciting opportunity. Bonobos, Harry’s, Casper, Glossier, and others are the new breed.  These digitally native, vertically integrated brands sell directly to their customers, bypassing the costly wholesale distribution network of traditional retail.

Even mighty [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/) sees the writing on the walls, and is quickly moving away from a traditional wholesaler/retailer relationship by launching their own brands like [Birch Lane](https://www.birchlane.com/).

It starts with a beautiful content+commerce experience designed to be shoppable on today’s mobile devices, and it ends with the ability to directly communicate that content to customers in a highly relevant, customizable way that is not dependant on leveraging external platforms like Facebook and Google.

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

I learned humility, how to deal with failure, and most importantly how to place my faith and family first.

It was easy to get a big head when my picture was on the front page of local business publications every couple weeks, and speaking at [national conferences](https://pando.com/2014/06/10/how-john-james-plans-to-build-a-1b-e-commerce-company-in-arkansas/).  I became the face of startup success in Arkansas, and I must admit that the notoriety went to my head.  

Just a few months after selling the business, it started to unravel and we suffered through a round of layoffs.  I eventually [stepped down as CEO](https://www.enginecommerce.com/founder-to-step-aside-as-ceo-after-hollar-raises-35-million-at-200-million-valuation/) just 18 months after selling the majority of the business at a 9-figure valuation.  

These public failures knocked my ego down several pegs, and I hope that I’m a little easier to work with today than I was when I was younger.  I took success for granted, and this time around I’m savoring every small victory as a God-given blessing.

Most importantly, I learned how to be a better leader in my own family.  During my residency and up through building Acumen, I sacrificed both the health of my family and my own health to solely focus on building a great business.  

While I still think about business the vast majority of my waking hours, I’m 1000% more present with my family.  As an example, I have three children in athletics, and I haven’t missed a single game in the past three years - even the afternoon games that take place during office hours.  This was a conscious decision, and it’s the best decision I’ve ever made.

Along with that decision, I am diligent about taking care of my own health.  During the most stressful period of building Acumen, I contracted a rare stress-related illness known as Ramsay Hunt Syndrome.  I was incapacitated for an entire month, and nearly permanently lost my voice and ability to swallow.  

This brush with mortality served as a dramatic wake up call.  100 hour work weeks were the norm for me then, and now they are much less frequent though still occasionally necessary.

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

At Acumen, we built all our own software to run our stores.  The learnings from this process were the genesis of Engine.

Funny enough, in my role as an investor running [an ecommerce startup studio](http://hayseedventures.com/), I recommended Shopify to dozens of entrepreneurs and even used it in a couple of our portfolio companies.  

While I still believe Shopify has an incredible product for ecommerce brands that are just starting out, my tune changed dramatically after watching several of our Hayseed Ventures portfolio companies and entrepreneurs I mentored struggle with scaling on their technology.  

They all ran into a ceiling at about a million dollars of annual revenue, and universally had the same challenges that simply couldn’t be eradicated on Shopify’s platform.

Closest to home, we watched the technology struggles of our first investment, Menguin.  They struggled mightily with their technology, and we decided to build Engine to solve many of the problems they encountered.

They eventually figured out their technology and sold for $25 million to the founder of Men’s Warehouse, but the lack of flexibility in off-the-shelf ecommerce platforms nearly cost them their business.  The story is pretty incredible - [read about how they did it here](https://www.enginecommerce.com/the-menguin-story/).

We had previously solved those problems in Acumen’s homegrown software, and we contemplated purchasing the old software as a basis for Engine, but (wisely) started from scratch.  Shopify and Magento were started in 2006, and we wanted a fresh new stack leveraging today’s mobile-first technology.

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

Rework by Jason Fried is my all time favorite, it’s short, quick and impactful.  Measure What Matters by John Doerr is the best book I’ve read this year, we’ve adopted OKRs at Engine, and this book was quite influential in helping establish the process.

I love the [Masters of Scale](https://mastersofscale.com/) podcast by Reid Hoffman.

And I always start my day on [Google News](https://news.google.com/) then [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).  Then I breeze through [Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/) and [Venturebeat](https://venturebeat.com/), mainly to stay on top of the ecommerce industry.  I typically command click any story I want to read on those four site, and open a couple dozen tabs of stories that I want to read.

Despite the recommendations above I don’t read a ton of startup related content.  I read a book or so each week, but rarely are they the traditional fare of startup CEOs.  I only read non-fiction, and mainly consume a lot content from other fields.  Physics, blockchain, finance, genetics, astronomy, medical research, etc.

I’ve found through the years that learning the fundamentals of other disciplines is highly transferable to innovating in your chosen profession.  For instance, I first learned the concept of arbitrage from a finance book I picked up… I applied that external knowledge to the nascent ad platforms of Google and Facebook and did quite well arbitraging the pricing inefficiency.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

Just Go.  Seriously, just start.  Today.

Ready, Aim, Aim, Aim, Aim, Aim, Aim is not the best way to build a startup.  You have to abandon your fear, get outside your comfort zone, and not be afraid of failure.  I completely agree with [Reid Hoffman from over a decade ago](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-iterate-fast-and-release-often-philosophy-of-entrepreneurship-2009-11) - if you aren’t embarrassed by the beta version of your product, you didn’t launch it fast enough.

Run full steam ahead, create some chaos, then learn from the mistakes and iterate quickly.  

To be successful, you must have a few strokes of good luck.  Just staying in the game, and being in business long enough for that luck to take hold is a large part of outsized success. I will say, however, that luck seems to be distributed quite unevenly, and it seems to follow the most prepared individuals and companies more often than not.

I’ve made more mistakes than you can imagine, but as Mark Cuban said in 2005, in business, you only have to be right once.

### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

Yes!  We are closing our next round of funding, and have 18 engineering positions and 12 sales / marketing positions open at the current time.

We are specifically looking for Ruby on Rails and JS developers.  We have offices in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Denver, Colorado - two of the five best places to live in the entire country according to [CNBC and US News &amp; World Report](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/us-news-world-report-the-10-best-places-to-live-in-the-us-in-2018.html).

I'm a 21 year old male, currently in my third year of software engineering. I expect to graduate and receive my bachelor's in two years. My entire life I've spent here in Montreal (Canada), and although I love my home and City I feel extremely bored not being adventurous. I've had 2 internships so far at software companies, and I always meet these other amazing interns. They come from different countries like France, Africa, Iraq, Germany and I love hearing their stories about an interesting life. I feel like being here for my entire life has been so dull, I want to become an international student and live in different places. Currently I'm living at home with my family, and I feel like I have no privacy. It's a small apartment, and when I was dating my ex I could barely ever bring her over because I'd either be embarrassed or there'd be no where for us to just hang out.

How do you take the initiative to move somewhere and become independent. I want to go somewhere, meet new people and find someone I love. I want to live on my own in an apartment, continue my studies and find a job. I've always been scared of doing so, and is there even any point of leaving such an amazing country like Canada?

9hi2da,2,2018-09-20,Switch from double major of CIS &amp; BDA to just SCM. Thoughts?,butwipe123,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9hi2da/switch_from_double_major_of_cis_bda_to_just_scm/,"Hello everyone, I just started my junior year at Arizona State University. I am currently a computer information systems and business data analytics major. 

I’ve come to a dilemma. This semester is where my hard, major specific classes have started and I’m not exactly sure I like my courses. I am currently taking a java, database design class and my first data analytics class. Java really bores me, and I find it extremely difficult and frustrating, I am not good at it (I only did HTML and CSS in the past, but I really enjoy those even though they’re not all that similar as I have found out). We’ve been doing lots of ERD’s in my other classes and again, it bores me, and I find it hard. I think my GPA will drop if I continue in these majors from okay (3.19) to lower. If this is what I would be doing for my daily job, I think I would hate my life. 

This semester I am taking my first supply chain management class, and I am really enjoying it. This sounds awful, but it is the only one of my business pre-requisites (my others that I have completed/in progress are finance, management, accounting, marketing, and business law) that I have enjoyed at all and like going to class and studying for. 

My question is, if I switch, am I making a bad choice? Should I just stick it out and try and get internships in SCM? I have heard a number of times that CIS/SCM or CIS/BDA or even SCM/BDA are excellent degree combinations. FYI, I believe our CIS program is 18th in the nation, BDA is 10th, and SCM is 2nd.

In a way, I feel like I am taking an easy way out if I apply for SCM, as the work for my CIS classes is very hard and unenjoyable. If I transfer majors I am only losing a semester as the rest of my coursework covers my pre-reqs. I am also only one class away from getting the BDA certificate (which is why I applied for the BDA major as I liked the minor certificate) so I could always do SCM/BDA certificate.

Any thoughts or discussions would be very helpful, maybe I just need reassurance or something. Thanks!

9hi2oa,5,2018-09-20,"I got invited for a job interview for a Full-Stack Developer traineeship (The Netherlands), but I'm a mechanical engineer. Please help me decide",DavoMyan,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9hi2oa/i_got_invited_for_a_job_interview_for_a_fullstack/,"I'm currently studying Mechanical Engineering at the TU Delft, it's a premaster year where you can advance to Master Mechanical Engineering in a year if your prove yourself.

I already have a bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering. My final internship during my college was to develop an online multiplayer Virtual Reality program for engineering purposes. I had 0 knowledge about game dev/programming! I did have some affinity with Visual Basic Advanced and Arduino, but C# and Unity3D was new to me.

After blood, sweat and tears I learned C# and Unity, I managed to create a VR program for the engineering company (Ofcourse there were handy tools available like VRTK, I wouldn't reinvent the wheel) and I learned A TON about VR, C# and Unity3D ( Later I started developing my own game to release it on Steam, still WIP and super happy with how far I've come ). Since then my love for programming has started and I realised I really don't want to do mechanical engineering, but software development instead (or anything programming related, web dev, game dev, anything). I even purchased many humble bundle books to study different languages, this resulted in me learning Python and a couple other different languages (still newbie level right now though)

Anyways, so for fun I started posting my resume (Basically the CV shows my love for self study, motivation and ambition, my experience in jobs with 2 internships done, one was the VR internship and the other was fluid dynamics related. I am 22 years old). I applied to a Full Stack developer traineeship position, because the idea of learning for a couple months then getting a guaranteed job (2500-3100 euro's) was tempting. It would turn me from quick and dirty into clean coding in a professional environment.

They replied via linkedin saying they are interested and would like my phone number to call me.

Should I do this?, or, can I even do this with my non-degree knowledge of programming? Here is some more info:

The requirements are : No job experience, basic knowledge of C#, Python, Java, C++ OR another language and a bachelor degree in any field.

In one year I will be trained to earn these 3 certificates: Scrum Master PSM1, Microsoft Certified Professional and Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate. All of the learning will be in a class, they say I'll start out with the basics of coding, I'll learn clean coding in .NET C#, I will learn MVC and OOP software and how to work with Web API's. I will also achieve the Programming in C# microsoft certificate. I assume there will be many other programming languages available seeing that this is a full-stack traineeship.

Is it worth ditching my Mechanical Engineering master for this traineeship? I feel like gaining all this programming knowledge will allow me to apply to many more interesting job offers in the future with higher responsibilities, I can use the knowledge in my free time to develop stuff for my family, or my own game etc.

Please help, if you want to know more about me please ask.

Thank you very much in advance"

9hj0kn,1,2018-09-20,Looking for a personal opinion?,Superaussmo,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9hj0kn/looking_for_a_personal_opinion/,"So, I recently graduated from Penn State. I have a B.A in political science with a minor in history, in 2015 i graduated from Penn State Scranton with a degree in IT and cyber security. First why did i go back to college a 2nd time? To sum it up, I needed to grow as a person, I wanted to study a Field i enjoyed and had real interest in and i had come into enough money where I could go to school and live on my own without taking a loan. So since I'm in PA, and a political science major I wanted to get into the political sphere, i got an internship in Harrisburg, moved down here with my gf, and her sister. The internship was unpaid, so I would need a job to pay the bills. While at the internship I worked part time at a company callee game truck as a game Coach. I would end up leaving a month and a half in due to the owners Gordon Ramsey approach to training new employees. So while hunting for a new job I get contacted by Giant to work in their cooperate Harrisburg office. Over the course of about 3 weeks i go through afew phone interviews, then a physical one. The position would be a temp position which was initially 6 months and then became 3. But about 2 weeks into the Giant process i get contacted by another temp agency for a very similar job. I go down and talk with the lady and find out that  she has a 700 hour to hire role. The catch is that this role will be much more challenging and in-depth compared to the Giant one. Plus I'll get hired for 40k a year, which would be nice. I get both offers and now work at the 40k position. I've been here 3 weeks now and i have to say this place seem like a mess to me. Training is nearly non-existent, my tasks as nearly mindless and theres no resources to progress your skills Which has created an issue between the 3 people that know the system and everyone else that knows it well enough. My First week i was being trained by the out going supply chain manager(SCM), i was trained on how to update some things and do some stock plans. Which sounds good but the SCM was in a very unique situation as essentially a political exile stuck in America. So I've got a new and undefined role, training from someone that doesn't know what im going to be doing so he doesn't know what to train me on, and no one can give me a straight answer for what I'll be doing. As I learn more and more about this company im more and more convinced that the right arm has no idea what the left is doing and as the GM said today ""No one in this company has any idea what anyone else does"" which really made me feel like this is just the way things are. If this wasn't an international company, I'm sure this place would have failed by now. I really don't know what to make of this place, they've been open for 5 years there's 3 or 4 employees including the GM and only HR rep that have been here for 5 years. To quote a guard today, ""It hard learning people's names, they must have lost 50 people since I stated here"", more high quality news. It seems that this place expects Manager's to put in 10 plus hour days plus work from home and weekend work due to being behind on production because of understaffing
 Thankfully everyone's nice, but I feel this place was a mistake, the Best thing i can do is use this as a place to learn and hunt for a better position in the mean time. But im curious what other people think, I've mostly glossed over the issues, but this place seems like a real mess."

I feel like I wont find developer job after graduation. 

Should I keep searching for internship in my last semester? Should I just start looking for full time position?

I feel like this maybe confidence issue but people around me have 1-2 8-month internship in decent company with actual experience. Im afraid of ending up with no developer job after graduation.

I am a 3rd year Ph.D student working in Computer Science. I feel my research is useless when I compare to the work that has been reported in papers even in a hot area like machine learning these days.  My supervisor is not involved in my research, whenever I ask him something or try to discuss with him, 90% of the time the response I get is ""I do not know"". For this reason, I am not getting enough feedback. On top of it, I am working all alone, building the simulators, environments and everything myself so that I could send a paper to a conference to get it rejected.  In 2 years, I have only 2 workshop papers. I apply for internships, I get 0 fucking response. Most of the time, I think I am wasting my life and I am actually useless as my high school teachers thought.  I am getting sucked in depression day by day. Not even anti-depressants are working. With the increasing competition these days for publishing in good conferences, I don't think that I will every graduate."

Interested in working in Cyber Security or Digital Arts. A few questions about this stuff after speaking to a few upper-classmen. I've been told to go business professional, have nice resume paper and a leather folder, research interesting and specific company projects and that smiles and confidence go along way. For context, I guess my selling points would be that I did coding/research in a lab here at UF in high school, helped bring SHPE Jr. to my High School, I have Adobe Certifications, I have training in Cyber security/Ethical Hacking and I currently work as a video editor.

1. Should I bring a backpack? (Don't want to look ridiculous wearing a backpack on a suit, but rumor has it that free stuff may be available.)
2. I know it's possible for freshman to receive internships, but is it quite difficult?
3. What's a solid way to introduce yourself? I've heard talk of ""pitches.""
4. I have experience in two very different fields that I wouldn't mind landing an internship in, I feel it would be odd to be like ""I can do this digital art stuff, but like, if you don't do that then I can do this too."" Should I just propose interest in one depending on the company or just lay it all out on the table according to the flow of conversation.
5. Is it even worth talking to prestigious companies?
6. Specifically for CS, do they ask programming questions during interviews (assuming it's possible to even land one)
7. Do most representatives facilitate conversion or do I have to hit em' with the ol' ""So um... what internship opportunities do you have?"" or do they only want to bring that up if they think you're a good candidate?
8. Am I overthinking this because because I'm too eager to start early?

Thanks.

I was in a DevOps team doing some of their work, but I did not have any foundation or know the basics to even get started. Most of the time at work I was confused and did not know what to do and where to start. As a result, I did not accomplish anything during my internship and I felt somewhat useless and that I brought trouble for my boss and my team. Although I didn't accomplish anything, I did learn a good amount which got me started into studying more and improving myself so the same thing does not happen again.

I barely ever get call-backs. I am aiming for ANY type of Analyst position. I try to target things like ""Jr. Financial Analyst"" or Jr. Data Analyst or Jr. Project Manager. The apprenticeship is basically an internship, I guess they just gave it a fancy name. I only worked at the small distribution company for 3 months. I got laid off due to hurricanes impacting their cash flow. They felt really bad so they said I can say I worked here for a year instead of 3 months and they vouch for me. 

I have been reaching out to recruiters since August directly over linkedin and it has been giving me some results but nothing concrete.

I feel like my resume is thrown into an endless pit. I AM aware of keywords and I do change my keywords in my resume and Cover Letter for the type of job i'm applying to, most of the time. 

I don't understand why i'm not getting any interviews. At the very most i'll get a phone interview every now and then but that is almost never fruitful. 

What am I doing wrong? I am not socially retarded. I can hold my own. I don't stutter anymore. I rehearse my answers. The recruiters always have something nice to say about me by the end of the call. I try to follow-up but I hit dead-ends. 

I'm so paranoid that it's some BS reason like being fat or the recruiter can ""hear my fat over the phone."" I know that's just insecurity talking. I just don't know what to think anymore. I've tried so much. My parents are getting sick of me not making real money.. Currently i'm an uber driver which gets me by but this is not sustainable for a career and i'm getting more and more worried as each day goes by. Life is moving so fast.

I'm a college ""senior"" (because of transfer issues I've got 3 semesters left, including this one) wondering if programming is something I'd be happy with long-term. I know everyone's different, but I'm gonna try to go in to detail and hopefully you all can see where I'm coming from. Most of all, I just need to get this in to words 

I'm burnt out from classes, I'm insanely depressed by the competition, and I genuinely don't know what to do. I don't have any internships, networking contacts, projects, or even a decent GPA to show for all the anguish this has caused me. I don't even have a functioning LinkedIn page.

I know I'm capable of being a decent coder - decent enough to be able to get a job. It's the process of finishing my degree, keeping up with schoolwork, and all the grinding to get an internship that I'm struggling with. I wasn't able to get an internship this past summer, despite at the time having a decent GPA and applying to several companies that specifically target students at my University. The combination of getting turned down from literally anything I looked at, in addition to literally everyone I know getting offers... It really just destroyed any and all self confidence I had. To make matters worse, the only person I talk with regularly goes to UIUC, and the hyper-competitive dick-measuring culture over there is so bad that she unintentionally brags about her internship offers from big companies. The thing is, this is just the nature of this profession. It's insanely competitive, and most people seem to take any and every opportunity to show off. 

I used to at least feel confident in the fact that I could do well in my classes, but Spring 2018 was sort of the beginning of the end for that. The thing about the professors at my University (I go to Illinois State University, not UIUC) is that they seem to hire people that speak almost no English. There's professors who've taught here for over a decade that will still literally don't know how to explain something in English. I shouldn't have to say this, but it's not like a racist thing. It's the double language barrier of them trying to explain complex concepts in a language they barely speak, and 90% of lectures are a complete waste of time. I can't take notes, interpret what they're trying to say, and comprehend the information all at the same time. I end up teaching myself probably 70-80% of my courses because of how bad these lectures are for me. 

On top of all of this, I suffer from ADHD. I don't get any accommodations because I've never benefited from anything offered, and the process is so insane that it's genuinely not worth it. Maybe that's the real problem, but honestly it's only been a problem as of that Spring 2018 semester. For reference, the classes then were ""Computer Organization"" (the logic and components of CPUs, and some assembly), ""Systems Development"" (a diagramming course), and ""Practical Application Development"" (no joke, it covered Git, JavaFX, Android Development, design patterns, and C++ all in one course). This semester it's an advanced data structures and algorithms course, discrete mathematics, and a programming language concepts course. While in the Spring it was a little touch and go at times, this semester is something else. As an example, I had to code an LL(1) parser for this concepts class, which my professor said should only take us about 2 hours. I think I spent 20-30 hours total. I just couldn't understand any explanation of it. Eventually it clicked, but it took way too long. 

Sorry if this post isn't relevant. It's also long and rant-y. I just needed to put it in to some amount of words and hope for at least some amount of feedback. Thanks for taking the time to listen to my white people problems. Also feel free to be blunt in the responses. I need to know if I'm really in a bad spot here, or if I'm just overreacting to stress.

This happened a little while ago, but I'm literally just now getting his response on the whole thing. So I have an internship at a law firm, and he and my mom always ask me about it, like what I do and everything like that. I've just told them that i was reading up on local cases and stuff. Nothing really too important. Recently i started scanning files and other things like that but I hadn't told them yet because I just didn't feel like getting into it. Don't get me wrong, i love my parents, but sometimes i wanna come home and not be fucking bothered about what I did today. Like i like the gesture, and i like that they care about me, but holy fuck sometimes i get so tired of this shit. So out of just pure fatigue of the whole situation, i just start getting kind of pissy as he asks me what I did that day. I didn't start out pissy, but when i said ""oh you know, same old same old nothing really else"" in somewhat of a dismissive tone, he starts like asking me more and more about what I do. I can't really remember the whole situation (must've been tired or something) but somewhere along the line, I start to say some mean shit. Just being generally dismissive and kind of a prick, just not wanting to give the time of day to my dad. He says he's mad in what i assume is a joking way, and that's the end of the conversation. Nothing significant rises out of the next few days and everyone is okay. I come home tonight and start eating the shrimp he told me i could have after work. I had recently bought a playstation and had the idea of ""yaknow, i wonder what would happen if we got into an argument over it? like would i have any ground to tell them i bought it and it's mine?"" I share this idea with my dad, who i assume has forgotten about what happened a couple days ago, he doesn't really say anything. He's watching football on the tv so i come in and sit down and just start talking, then it goes down hill. He says ""one more thing about that playstation thing"" and i said ""ha, you're still thinking about that?"". He said something that rubbed me the wrong way and I just said ""why are you getting pissy with me man?"".

This is where things really fall apart

Usually when my dad's angry, you can tell because he screams. He gets loud and overpowers you with his voice. But this was quiet but serious. He was getting fucking pissed off. Not happy at all, he said something about ""you treat me like shit monday (or whatever day it was) and you have the fucking balls to say that in the kitchen? ill fucking break your playstation in half i dont fucking care. I've been giving you the silent treatment for the past couple of days but now i'm as mad as i can be."" At this point i'm like fuuuuuuuuuuuck dude. I didn't even realize he'd been doing that, if it really pissed him off that much, he could have told me, but that's besides the point. He basically ends with ""get the fuck out of here"". Now i have an AWFUL habit of smiling while getting yelled at. Like full blown someone just told me an inappropriate joke type smile. I was really fighting it back this time, luckily nothing happened. Right now, i'm down in my basement, working on some homework while trying to figure out what to do.

He just texted me now with:

""I just can't understand why you treated me like that Monday night. you made me feel worthless as a father, I couldn't believe you said those things to me, you even smiled while you insulted me like you were enjoying it. That hurt so much I cant even put it into words. There i was excited for you and showing enthusiasm about your accomplishments and you basically told me it wasn't worth your time to explain it to me. And then tonight; to ask that question about how much authority we actual have over you really says a lot about where your mind is right now. Then you took it a step further and challenged me when i s aid something about it. What in the world is going on with you? Don't you see what i do for you? How much i care for you? i would give everything i have for you, so why did you treat me like that.""

Shiiiiiit man i didn't mean to treat him like shit that kinda fucked everything up.

TL;DR I accidentally treated my dad like shit, and now he's yelling at me about it. Definitely fucked up my relationship with my dad

EDIT: We’ve made up and everything is square,  I told him I’m an asshole and that’s all he wanted to hear lol. Thanks everyone."

First time poster here and needed some advice from like minded people. Sorry In advance if this is too long and winded. 

Some background info on my position: I have been in IT for 4 years as a helpdesk engineer/head of purchasing all the technology in the company. This position was supposed to give me enough experience for a few years to learn and move up in the company. I’ve excelled in the position and my managers love me and always give me more tasks to take on because they know I will finish them correctly and In a timely manner compared to the other helpdesk person I work with(he just plays videos games all day and ignores the requests and calls).  

So about 6 months ago our IT director decides he wants to quit because he was offered a position making about 60k more a year(our whole department is severely underpaid). Everyone was scrambling and trying to learn his role while they hire a replacement but they never end up hiring another director and just make the IT manager the head guy. 3 months ago he proposed some major changes within the company that involved moving some people around into other parts of the department, so we as a whole can be more proactive and provide better help and programs for everyone. For example, I would get out of helpdesk(bring in an intern to take care of level 1 issues) and become my bosses shadow as a system network engineer/level 2 helpdesk. Our VP of the company has already made it clear to my manager that he doesn’t really think the IT dept is a crucial part of the company and thinks we’re over paid. So fast forward 8 weeks of negotiations and going back and forth with the VP and the president and the decision they make is basically screwing every single person in the dept on pay. 

My approved proposal that they gave my manager today was that I basically continue to do all levels of helpdesk on my own without a second pair of hands all while doing the role of a system admin and become my bosses back up when he’s out of the office while also taking care of purchasing for......a 4K a year pay bump ladies and gents! They want me to do 3 peoples jobs for about 15k less than what a normal system admin would make. I’m already on a job hunt because it’s clear that they don’t value anyone in this department. My dilemma at the moment is this:

A)take the pay bump and take on extra added responsibilities(which would almost guarantee I’d be working Atleast 60 hours a week) and learn what I can from my manager(if he doesn’t quit first) and then gtfo

B) tell them that I don’t want the pay bump or extra duties and just continue to do what I’m doing now until I find a new job


I’m so conflicted on what to do and just so frustrated with this company. I love the crew I work with but ever since they hired the new VP it has been nothing but bullshit after bullshit and I’m sick of being a kicking bag to someone who does absolutely nothing productive for the company and gets paid over well over 6 figures a year. Anyways, thanks for listening to my rambling and hope it all made sense! Any help or advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated! "

9hmtfs,3,2018-09-21,Thoughts about the offers to a new grad,salary_sharing_throw,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9hmtfs/thoughts_about_the_offers_to_a_new_grad/,"Hey everyone, I'm graduating in December, currently have two offers, and I'm curious what would you choose.

One is from post-series B startup in NYC that I interned with this Summer. I really enjoyed the work (like I was happy coming to the office) I did during the internship, and the culture is great: the company is very transparent, gives a lot of flexibility to employees, and I think it has all the chances for a great future. The offer is 120k base + 10k sign on + 0.06% options (the offer was improved from 110k base). It's hard to place the value on the options since the company is still pretty far away from going public. They also agreed to me working remotely for several months since I can't move to NYC right after graduation.

The second offer is from post-series D well-known startup in SF. The company has very good reputation and seems to be an enjoyable place to work with interesting problems to tackle and bright prospects. I expect that I'd enjoy the work less here than in the first company, but probably learn more professionally. The offer is 130k base + 20k sign on + 0.015% options. This company seems to be planning to go public in 2-3 years, and with their projected valuation, these options could be worth something like 50k per year.

So what would you choose? I really like the flexible culture of the first company, but the total compensation of the second will likely be significantly higher. Also, considering that I've already asked to improve the offer from the first company (which they did) and to allow me to work remotely for some time (which they also did), is it reasonable to ask for another raise? They know that I have other offers, but no the actual numbers."

I am a 32 year old in my final semester as a junior in college. I have been heavily considering leaving my retail job. I have been at this job for over 3 years while in college and as a STEM student, my job is relevant (fixing computers) to my degree, but I feel like as I am getting into my final semesters, that its becoming more of a hindrance than anything. 

I would love the free time to focus on school, and I live with my fiance who covers most of the bills. I have done the math and am able to take out additional school loans if needed. While not ideal as I'd of course have to pay them back, it would at most be for 2 semesters. 

Aside from just generally disliking the retail environment, having more free time would not only allow me to focus on classes and studying more, but I can also work on coding projects to teach myself cool stuff and even put projects on my resume. 

I have over a decade of work history, including a great and relevant internship opportunity, so I feel like being called out on lack experience is a non-issue. Just mostly looking for others thoughts before I do something potentially scary like becoming willingly unemployed.

Appreciate any advice! "
9hnpul,2,2018-09-21,Maybe it’s me?,some1-else,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/9hnpul/maybe_its_me/,"I’ll start by saying I’m not a writer. It’s my first ever post and to be honest, not sure what I’m looking for, but here goes...

My partner and I have been together for 12 years now and as we’ve gone on we’ve had our fair share of jobs. He’s had a few long term stints and I bounced around, luckily landing a nice job with a large company that is more goal and career oriented. My partner however is still plugging along in a store sales position he doesn’t want to be in and has been trying to get out of. 

Over the last year he’s said he doesn’t think he’d like working behind a desk, would rather work outside or manually. Totally fine, I encouraged him to look into automotive courses or shops in the area that offered on the job training. He did, and it was either too costly as he’s paying student debt for another ambition, or local shops don’t offer internships.

Fast forward a bit more and he wants to potentially start his own business or company. (Not related to outdoor/auto)
He’s always liked organizing and comics so the first instinct a comic shop. Fine. I asked questions, how much do you think you’d need for start up, where, what demographic, who would you need to begin making connections with in order to supply the shop? Maybe I came on a bit too strong? Needless to say, the idea fizzled out.

The latest thing has been video/editing, which is what he went to school for initially. It can be very lucrative and he’s tried to get in with local companies at the moment they aren’t hiring, so he thought doing this on his own could be the way to go. Bonus he knows someone who has done it professionally and has asked for advice, great! All for it! But every time there’s a step in the right direction there’s an excuse...’I need an office with my own space to work. I need a MacBook because that’s the only way to edit. I’m looking at this camera...’ 

It goes on. He’s currently borrowing a MacBook, which is awesome, and has worked on a project for a friend. He’s been excited, also great! The problem is he gets the carriage in front of the horse at times and gets overly excited without the motivation and business to back it up...he’s started looking at cameras, big, $$$$$, out of price range gear when he has a decent video camera he hasn’t used in years which is perfect for the time being.

And this attitude of having the best gear for the job has always been a bit of a sore spot for us. We don’t come from money and I don’t know where the gear attitude comes from but he’s always had it. Had to have Calaway clubs, Gibson guitar, etc...
In some instances, yes, it’s important to invest in nice things so they last/do the job you want, but if you’re not motivated to use the gear you have no amount of money spent will change that. (Which is true) And a friend mentioned that to him recently, he’s basically shut down since and claims I’m not supportive.

There’s some missing here, and I will say while I have always been supportive of his goals, but I’ve also been realistic and admit to being borderline mean at times when it comes to his big ideas because regardless how I respond to him the outcome doesn’t change. He either gives up or doesn’t even try/makes up excuses. I have never stopped him from doing something or said his ideas were bad. (Unless they were downright stupid or dangerous)

I’ve tried to ask what he wants, if I’m not being supportive, what his definition is of support is. He hasn’t given me an answer and he hasn’t said much in the last few days and to be frank I’m exhausted.

TL;DR:
My partner has grandiose ideas for new jobs/side hustles and thinks expensive gear and things will boost motivation to start his own business. Even though he owns decent equipment to start with, then claims I don’t support him when I don’t understand what he wants me to do. Ever been in that situation or know someone similar? What happened?

I might find myself soon deciding whether I want to keep a stable, well paying job that I don't like, or go do an equally paying internship for 4 months in the field that I want to work in. Web development.

I wanted to hear the opinion of developers already in the field or from recruiters. I think I already know what I'm doing, which is taking the internship if it's offered. But what I'm asking is, am I making a dumb mistake? Would the internship at this place help me get another job as soon as the internship is over?

For some context, the city this is all happening in is Montreal.
The company is a major e-commerce platform based in Canada.
And I'm a self-taught developer whose kinda comfortable with React and its ecosystem ( Router/redux/Context Api/styled components etc). Comfortable enough to build a few websites from the ground up ( not tutorials). But I'm still a junior though.

What would you guys/gals do? The alternative would be for me to sit tight and keep improving until I get a long-term front-end job. But I also feel like the internship would look pretty good on a resume. Especially with this company.

Any opinion is welcome! Thanks"

Just after my summer internship ended, I was hiking in a park and got a citation for being there 45 minutes too late after getting lost on my way out. It's silly, but given that I wasn't finger printed or physically arrested, I didn't find out it was actually a criminal offense until after I paid the fine which automatically deemed me ""guilty"" and I got a summons in the mail. The summons was promptly cancelled given that I prepaid the fine. But obviously now I wish I would have contested it.

Other than that, I have a clean record; and the charge listed on the case is neither a DUI nor drug-related offense.

I interviewed with this company internally before my internship ended, and at the time obviously I had no convictions to report.

I was just offered a position with this company and I don't know if I should voluntarily disclose this information before the background check or not? The company is VERY thorough and also requires disclosure of all prior arrests even if they didn't result in conviction.

Or should I try legal recourse (which I honestly can't even afford) to reopen the case and try to get the charge dropped given the circumstance? Moreover, if I were to contact someone, should I contact the corporate HR that extended the offer? Or the site-HR who I have been able to interact with personally over the summer? E.G. they know me as an individual and that I am honesty and trustworthy.

Last summer I was at a co-op that I enjoyed well enough, but I practically broke even after housing/groceries and I'm somewhat interested in pursuing a more impressive/cooler job. I've been offered a chance to return next summer, but I was told they'd interview more people at the fall career fair if I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, which would mean I wouldn't be guaranteed the job.

Also, I'm only a sophomore now, so I'm inclined to think that I should go ahead and take what I can get to be safe, as I feel like most of the more impressive jobs I've been looking at are looking for juniors/seniors. I know Google and Microsoft offer internships specifically for freshman and sophomores that I'll probably apply to, but I figure there's probably a lot more qualified applicants in CS.

Lastly, I'd hate to commit to the job and back out, because I liked my time there well enough and don't want to burn any bridges."

9hszq9,11,2018-09-21,Harmless Hallucinations,jmj928,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/9hszq9/harmless_hallucinations/,"Growing up I constantly had a tough time sleeping while in my childhood home. Every night I would have trouble falling asleep due to my mother forcing me to sleep with all the lights out and leaving my door open. My mother always felt my fear of the dark and waking up to see someone standing in the doorway was childish and irrational. I always felt more comfortable when my dad would watch me as he would allow me to fall asleep while watching cartoons which helped ease my mind a bit about what I would encounter during the night. 

Unfortunately, neither of my parents ever took the time to try to understand why I was so terrified of the darkness. They didn’t understand that as I would close my eyes and begin to get sleepy I would begin to hear deep guttural whispers all around me. I could never fully understand what they were saying as it didn’t seem as though they were saying actual words. When this would begin I would immediately sit up in my bed and scream for my mother. Night after night she would come into my room and ensure that nothing was there and that it was my own imagination. This would happen so often that she eventually just stopped coming to check on me and would yell from her room “Stop it! Just please stop!”. Feeling helpless, I would pull the covers up all the way over my head and cry myself to sleep.

Pulling the covers over my head as I tried to sleep accomplished two things. First, was to drown out the whispers. Second was so that I wouldn’t see any figures when I woke up. I would wake up multiple times throughout the night and as I would slowly start to open my eyes I would see a figure standing next to my bed bending over roughly a foot away from my face. Although the figures never had any facial features I could tell it was watching me sleep and it was angry. As I would start to gain focus and realize that something was physically in my room I would naturally begin to freak out and the figure would slowly disappear. Even minutes after each episode although I no longer saw the figure I could still feel the anger and tension in the room.

During the day time I never experienced anything nearly as frightening just the usual hearing of footsteps upstairs walking around when I was home alone. I would just chalk up these instances to living in an old house and my dog would only acknowledge the noises but never growled at it so I never thought much of it and would just play with my barbies. I would love playing with my barbies and my parents bought me a bunch of them and I would name them all and they would all have different jobs, roles and personalities (This was before The Sims came out).  I was very careful with these barbies and would put them away carefully on my dresser when I was done playing with them as I did not want to damage them. 

One day I noticed that one of my dolls was missing so I asked my parents if they moved it and they denied touching them and just assumed I lost it somewhere in the house. I was so distraught that I couldn’t find it anywhere in the house and since I was getting to the age where my parents felt I was too old to be playing with dolls they wouldn’t buy me any new ones.  I convinced myself that I must have left my barbie somewhere around the house and that my parents probably accidentally threw it away. I then decided to be more careful with my barbies and to always remember to put each one back on the dresser when I was done playing with them, yet they kept disappearing. I always felt that something else may have been taking them. I was never able to prove this or even find them when we moved out of that house.  

Before moving to our new house, we got to stay at my grandma’s house for a couple of weeks and I got to stay in the room with my parents. After moving to our new house, I didn’t experience anymore voices or figures while sleeping and I slowly started sleeping without the covers over my head.  However, in the new house my parents finally allowed me to start sleeping with my tv on and door shut which made me feel a little more secure and allowed me to sleep better. I never felt nervous or a negative presence in that house and soon forgot about all the things that would terrify me at night. I didn’t start seeing the visions again until I got to college.

During college, I got an internship and had to find temporary housing as the internship was out of state. I found this great apartment with this nice woman that loved to cook, the rent was cheap, and I was only a few miles from my job. Since I was in a different state I didn’t have many friends and I wasn’t old enough to go to happy hour with my coworkers so on the weekends I would just come back to the apartment play sims and take naps. During one of these naps I woke up to my phone ringing and as I slowly started to open my eyes I could see this woman with pig tails bent over staring at me. As my eyes began to adjust she started to slowly disappear. I then started to remember the things I used to see and hear during the night when I was younger and decided to do some research.

I came across these two conditions called hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations. Hypnagogic hallucinations occur when the person is falling asleep and it can cause visual and audio hallucinations. Hypnopompic hallucinations occur when the person is waking up and it can cause visual lingering images as this person wakes up. I thought back to my experiences in my childhood and everything now made sense! It made sense that I could hear things that didn’t really make sense or have a nightmare about insects and wake up and see the same insect crawling across my pillow but never be able to find it. After self-diagnosing myself I decided to tell my parents about my new revelation. 

I decided to go visit my parents as my internship was over and I had to go back to college soon. I started speaking to my mother about the old house and asked her if she remembered all the times I was afraid of the dark and how I’m pretty sure I now know why. As I was describing my experiences I could see my mother’s mood immediately change to a mixture of sadness and fear. She got up from the couch, got two glasses from the cabinet and poured us some prosecco. My mother never lets me drink with her, so I began to worry that something was truly wrong and what she told me caused all my childhood fear and dread to come rushing back.

My mother told me that she was also terrified of sleeping in that house due to all the things she experienced. She told me that she did remember immediately waking up in the middle of the night because she would hear me screaming so she wanted to come in and make sure I was okay. She never really thought much of this because she knew I was just probably having nightmares. What caused her to stop coming in my room every time she heard me scream is because occasionally she would wake up to hearing “me” scream, rush into my room and find that I was completely asleep. As she was in my room trying to figure out where the noise came from she would start to feel an uncontrollable rage towards me and knew that she needed to get away from me. The feelings of rage she would get during those instances caused her to question what type of mother she was and how far she may go if the rage continued. She felt the rage was uncontrollable and didn’t want to be in that situation anymore. After these occurrences, she couldn’t differentiate between my screams and whatever was imitating me, so she would just yell out for it to stop hoping that I wasn’t in any danger. 

Night after night this would happen and since my older sister just went off to college she decided it was time for us to move. My parents brought in workers and painters to get the house ready to sell while I was at middle school. One of the workers that was painting the closet in my room asked to show my mother something concerning. As she followed the worker into my room to see what he was so concerned about she began to get anxious. What the worker showed my mother caused her to burst into tears with anger. 

As my mother was telling me this story she began to tear up and I could see goosebumps starting to form on her arms. She apologized for not believing me about my barbies and for not protecting me from what was in the house. At that point I had forgotten all about my barbies and was confused as to why she was bringing it up and wanted to know what the worker showed her. After a couple deep breaths, she told me that the painter found something on the top shelf of my closet and wasn’t comfortable moving it. My mother found on the top shelf of my closet all my barbies that went missing each sitting side by side, naked with bite marks across their bodies, and heads removed.  She asked the worker to throw all the dolls away and we went to stay with my grandmother until my parents found another house.

After speaking with my mother, I was rightfully terrified but also relieved that I wasn’t alone and that there was a strong possibility that something sinister was happening in that house and thankful that nothing worse happened. I still believe that some of my experiences were due to the hallucinations and maybe it was genetic, and my mother had some hallucinations of her own. That must be true. I must tell myself that because I don’t know how many more nights I can take of my son screaming for me in the next room when I can clearly see him laying next to me.

9htcmk,777,2018-09-21,"You're another cog in the machine, but that's okay.",UnsolicitedCSAdvice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9htcmk/youre_another_cog_in_the_machine_but_thats_okay/,"I've been in this field for almost 20 years now, and as someone who has experienced all the highs (promotions, pay raises, bonuses, wonderful coworkers, challenging work, etc.) and lows (DOT com bust, layoffs, ungodly hours, toxic work environment/employees, legal woes, etc.) that this field has to offer, I feel it's time I passed on some wisdom to those who want a career in CS. For what it's worth I guess I would be considered successful and well paid as a software architect in a decent job climate geographically, but I've had positions from management to intern. I really hope you can take this advice to heart, and I truly hope to help some people.

Those who I know who have struggled the most, and have had difficulty adjusting most within this field in particular, are those that derive all or most of their purpose from their job. Why does it matter for us in CS more than any other field? Because if you haven't noticed, the world's expectations of technology and the Internet has changed us drastically. The pressure to be immersed in this world both on the job, and then when you get home, and to deliver to people's expectations (as the tech guru) INSTANTLY without flaw is stifling and depressing.

When this becomes all that you are, whether through choice or by coincidence, then a layoff, change of life circumstance or even retirement can be absolutely soul crushing. Studies are now being performed about the skyrocketing rates of depression in a seemingly ""more connected"" social media world. We aren't turning off, and then when you're in a job where you also don't turn off, it can cause serious mental setbacks. I'm speaking from my own experience, and the experience of others I know.

I've long been wary of tech companies that advertise their openings by touting the fact that working for them is like having a second family. They work hard and play hard... together... all the time. Do you really want to bond so closely with co-workers that leaving is like you've experienced a death, or communicating involves the same dynamic as talking to relatives? It doesn't really matter your age or generation. Question seriously whether or not this is a healthy dynamic. Not having a connected community outside of work means all of your purpose will be derived from your job. You will begin to make all of your decisions based solely on your employment status.

I've seen too many people go down this road. When it's all said and done their lives are a total wreck. They make stupid mistakes, sacrifice real family and relationships, get divorces, alienate kids... and for what? You have to find your purpose outside of work, and you will have to strive to find a balance. You need a sustainable environment that opens you up to positive experiences beyond your vocation.

I know this advice may fit with many fields, but I can only speak to the career I'm in, and which I think applies to this subreddit. There's something different to be said about what we as technology professionals bring to a now technology saturated world. Don't let this career path define you. You are so much more."

Some from current coworkers.",Anon71615141,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9htkdj/i_posted_a_bunch_of_creepy_texts_guys_have_sent/,"Someone suggested I cross post this here ..

I went to college for computer engineering, and got a job in the industry afterwards. In college, my internships, and my job, I've dealt with sexual harassment and I've had to get tough with people, telling them to stay the fuck away when I get the first whiff of sketchiness.

Every time I've gotten a creepy text or instant message from another student or co worker, I've screenshotted it and backed it up in google drive just in case it escalates. That's helped me a few times, when someone started to follow me around in college, and when someone took things so far at work that I decided to go to HR. I don't report most of the shit though, I don't want it to look bad like I'm always running to HR.

Last night, I got really drunk with my friend because I had a day off planned for today. I went home in a kinda bad mood because we'd been talking about how she was going through similar shit at work. I was in a ""fuck it all"" mood, and I uploaded my whole folder of screenshotted text messages to Facebook and Instagram, with the caption ""Phone &amp; Inbox of a female computer engineer."" And tagged all the men who had sent me messages, whose social media I could find.

Some of the highlights were...

A bunch of married men hitting on me, and me replying ""dude you're married"" or something along those lines.

Some guys asking me out and then taking rejection badly.

Some guys who would text me repeatedly even though I'd just replied ""Don't contact me, other than for work purposes""

Sexually explicit messages, or messages commenting on my appearance out of the blue.

Overall, just messages from people ignoring my wishes to be left alone.

This morning, I woke up to my phone blowing up. (I had planned to take a vacation day off work today). A lot of the guys I'd tagged in my social media posts had contacted me demanding or pleading that I remove the posts. Most everyone had untagged themselves.

The Facebook post had gotten some attention from my friends, but my two Instagram posts (I had to make 2 to fit all the photos) had blown up. I had a lot of new followers, a lot of strangers commenting on my post, mostly supportive.

I also had a email from HR at work asking me to meet with them first thing Monday morning. I replied to say that I would. I don't know what to expect there at all. I have not replied to any other messages about my posts.

I need some advice. Should I speak to the guys who texted me about the posts? Some are very angry with me because they are married and their wives found out. I'm thinking it's safest to not. Should I leave the posts up, or remove them? Or wait to see how things go with HR before I decide? Should I be worried for my safety? I feel a little nervous but I don't know if I'm overreacting.

TLDR - I posted an album on social media, a collection of creepy texts I have gotten from men in my field of study and work"

Because of the planned path for my CS degree, I don't take most of the essential courses (Algorithms &amp; Data Structures, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Object Oriented Design) until next semester. That being said, I'm in my Junior year now with now /real/ experience in the field yet. I went to a three-week bootcamp that focused on front-end web development, but other than that the only other experience I could count on are the two programming fundamentals courses I've taken so far.

The projects from my fundamentals courses are not that impressive. A Minesweeper clone, a human to zombie speech translator, a program that plays Boggle for you. All these were written in C and C++, really the only two languages I feel comfortable with but given the bootcamp I could work with JavaScript, HTML, CSS if need be.

Most of the internships for next summer I see as of now ask that you have some experience in those core classes I won't take for several months. And if the job description doesn't explicitly say those classes are preferred, I assume they'd still come up in an interview.

I feel stuck. With me in my Junior year now, I know I need to find an internship somewhere, but don't feel I'd be technically qualified until sometime next semester at least. Are my expectations set too high? Would companies prefer I take those courses first before applying for an internship, or is it possible some would work with me given my limited experience?"

I am a college junior and working on adding substance to my resume in addition to my minor high school jobs and clubs. I was just chosen to be secretary of the Turning Point USA chapter at my university. This is something that includes significant responsibility that I feel could depict a good skillset on my resume (mass communication skills, team leading, organization). However, if you don't know what TPUSA is, it's described as ""American conservative, nonprofit organization whose stated mission is ""to educate students about true free market values."" Some of its more well-known members include Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens. I know many people who absolutely despise those two. If you are somewhat into politics, hearing that description will elicit two very different responses I would think. I am not so hardcore conservative, but I do lean more right politically and I thought the club was a good opportunity, like I said, to resume pad. So, to bring this all together, would these be something I should leave off my resume due to the possible political reactions? I wouldn't have a problem if this was a non-political club, but due to the current nature of U.S. politics, and the fact that this club opportunity is one of the few things that works with my situation currently, I have a decision to make. Am I overthinking this, or is it a legitimate concern? Thanks for any advice.

I know many of you will be inclined to discuss strong opinions on this regarding conservatives and such, and I can't control what everyone says, but if we could keep this to a discussion from a job recruiter/interviewer standpoint, I'd appreciate it.

Note: I am a political science major (possible marketing minor), but I'm also trying to get into business if not politics. I'm using Polysci to sharpen my written and oral communication skills. I've had recent interviews with Kohl's for their management intern position, and am looking into sports marketing agencies for possible internships. So just as further information, those are the types of positions I have been applying to."

I would like to break it to you that this IS NOT AT ALL TRUE.  
Even people from top schools are struggling. There is a fuck ton of competition to get ANY entry level fulltime position. Hours and hours of leetcode grind and a factor of luck involved. Having a couple of years of experience helps but still is no guarantee.   
As an international student who graduated from a mediocre school, I can assure you that getting a job was RIDICULOUSLY FUCKING HARD. I worked extremely hard and got an internship at a big bank and converted that to a fulltime role. IF I was not able to do that, I would probably be back home by now.  
Even IF you get a job, you are at the whim of a bloody lottery where you have 1/3 chance of getting the work visa. Becoming a US permanent resident is another nightmare and you can kiss that dream goodbye if you are Indian.

On top of that, you can lose your job basically anytime in the US and cant DO SHIT ABOUT IT.  Being on the H1B gives you 60 days to find a new job to stay alive.  


The only jobs that are somewhat easy to get are those contracting gigs in which you get shit pay and 0 job security.   


The only people who have gotten fulltime offers where probably top 10% from top schools. The rest are just hanging in there trying to get something.   


I am not trying to discourage anyone but just know there are 0 jobs waiting for you.

I am a 32 year old in my final semester as a junior in college. I have been heavily considering leaving my retail job. I have been at this job for over 3 years while in college and as a STEM student, my job is relevant (fixing computers) to my degree, but I feel like as I am getting into my final semesters, that its becoming more of a hindrance than anything.

I would love the free time to focus on school, and I live with my fiance who covers most of the bills. I have done the math and am able to take out additional school loans if needed. While not ideal as I'd of course have to pay them back, it would at most be for 2 semesters.

Aside from just generally disliking the retail environment, having more free time would not only allow me to focus on classes and studying more, but I can also work on coding projects to teach myself cool stuff and even put projects on my resume.

I have over a decade of work history, including a great and relevant internship opportunity, so I feel like being called out on lack experience is a non-issue. Just mostly looking for others thoughts before I do something potentially scary like becoming willingly unemployed.

So, the details. I'm a CIS student who will be graduating this December. A federal contractor contacted me yesterday; I'll be paid a $52k/yr salary for an entry-level web dev role in the DMV area. However, [it's $15,990 below the median wage.](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151134.htm)

3. Web dev summer internship (3 months)

9hxioc,2,2018-09-22,Need help choosing corp housing or stipend for winter internship,canolaoial,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9hxioc/need_help_choosing_corp_housing_or_stipend_for/,"Hi guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Ill be in SF (near SoMa) this winter for 3-4 months and my housing situation is either corp housing or stipend (2k / month).

&amp;#x200B;

Corp housing: 1 bedroom apartment fairly close to work. Looks nice and is very convenient. However, another intern will be living there. So the living situation will be 2 twin beds in the bedroom. I assume that we can move the beds but that is a big negative to corp housing. The apartment is a Jr. 1 bed and I dont know what that means... is it like a 1 bedroom / studio?

&amp;#x200B;

Stipend: More hassle to find housing and stipend is taxed. But I get to find my own place and own roommates and hopefully own bedrooms. Is it possible to find a nice place with my own bed for 2k ish a month?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks"
9hxriy,1,2018-09-22,Cooperating in teams of 5-6 people for class projects,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9hxriy/cooperating_in_teams_of_56_people_for_class/,"I am trying to figure out whether I am overreacting or not. We have 4 core classes, all of which have projects of significant size, some of which are for a single person, some of which are for groups.

I asked the professor of the db class about past projects and he gave a few examples of the projects they tasked in previous years. All of those projects were gargantuan for the time students were given, the professor admitted it and he explained that few teams manage to pull it off. Last year they implemented a social network, the year before simulated a system for a company and all in all rather large projects.

Similarly in software engineering class, we have a lot to implement while working with an external entity and relative to the timeframe the professor has provided, we are on the verge.

I suggested that we'd decide what we'd like to implement and start with a small template or start reading about what we'd need to know, such that we are ahead of the schedule because when the time comes, we won't be able to afford to waste time.

One of the ideas for the software engineering project was to build a webapp, so I suggested to use python &amp; django as it's quite easy to build and me and another dude have experience in Python and I've had an internship during the summer that used django. The 4 other group members don't have experience w Python.

The other idea involves Android development of which I have experience through the previous summer and continued working for another couple of months after at the company.

It appears that at least two people agree with me however, the guy that's supposed to be the 'manager' had a kneejerk reaction, that I am overreacting. I get that we are a good group but I have the most experience in this regard in the group and in my opinion we really don't have a lot of time to waste.


TL:DR; Op suggests to build a small template and get our feet wet now that we have time to waste rather than later, receives some backlash because we are a good group and there is no reason to get everyone anxious."
9hxrvq,1,2018-09-22,Four months into my internship and I hate my lonely and stifling job environment,microsoftcheese,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9hxrvq/four_months_into_my_internship_and_i_hate_my/,"I'm a nineteen-year-old woman currently attending a technical college for factory maintenance work.  I have an internship at a plastics factory, which I started 4 months ago.

Last summer, I had just graduated high school and was enrolled at an expensive state college for a double major: physics and biology.  I was working part-time as a lifeguard.  I had completed all my generals and would have graduated in two years.  My mental health was also shit and I wanted to jump off a bridge, so I had a mini quarter-life crisis and quit everything I just mentioned, shattering the illusion of perfection.  

Telling my parents I wanted to attend a tech school instead of climbing to the very top of the STEM ladder was rough.  It was a massive fight for a while, but eventually, my mother came around.

The first year out of high school was the best year of my life.  I got a cashiering job and enjoyed it immensely, making amazing friends, spending my work days chatting with customers, and generally being the extroverted person I am.  School was even better.  I made friends with every single classmate, and I know we will all always remain friends.  I enjoyed the material, especially welding, and felt so much more empowered with a little practical knowledge under my belt.

I have had a dream of building myself a house for a long time.  I'd do it with very alternative methods - anyone heard of earthbags?  Strawbales? - by myself, on the cheap.  Hard work, but rewarding.  It was this dream that led me to my current internship, actually.  I chanced a few interviews for full-time maintenance jobs, hoping I could land one with a big enough salary to get a land loan.  Unfortunately, I only qualified for paid internships.  Oh, well, I said to myself, putting aside my dream with some disappointment.  Next year.

The internship was wonderful at first.  I made fast friends with my coworkers.  The day shift was full of chatty and interesting people, and I was usually tasked with something that felt meaningful or educational.  My boss is great, my coworkers are great.  Sometimes I had no tasks, and I would sit for hours, feeling like I was weighing down the system - but that was rare.

And then school started, and my hours changed.  I am working evenings and weekends now.  Gone are the bustling offices and chatty coworkers.  Gone is my boss, who was usually the one to assign me projects - he works day hours.  Gone were the day-shift maintenance men who didn't mind training the intern.  Now, my work has taken on a dark tint; I have begun dreading it.

Half my evening work days are spent with the N1 shift.  This shift's lead is a self-righteous, joyless man who seems to derive malicious pleasure from making people squirm.  The other two maintenance guys on the shift are nice but very, very quiet - and heartily disinterested in training an intern.  During these shifts, I may do one of three things: sit and do nothing, letting productivity paranoia set in; latch on to one of the maintenance guys and shadow them, feeling very much like a nuisance; or work on a separate project, sometimes actually a meaningful one.  Obviously, the third option sounds the best, but there are few things at my workplace that are trusted to an intern alone - and besides, to be assigned a project, I would have to speak to the shift lead.  The shift lead, who always manages to corner me into a mightily uncomfortable conversation about the impropriety of the personal choices of anyone other than himself, the idiocy of differing political ideas from his own, and general mean and unnecessary gossip about fellow coworkers.  He is a toxic man.  I think he likes me well enough, but he is exhausting.

The N2 shift is much better.  I actually connect with them.  But, aside from the shift lead, who is usually far busier than he wants to be, the guys on this shift haven't been with the company much longer than me.  So, while they at least try their best to give me some training, I still feel lost, and I still sit and do nothing an awful lot.

My Saturday shifts are okay - they're spent with one of the day shifts.  The offices are still bare and I still sit a lot, though.  Doing nothing.  But it isn't free time.

I feel so lost.  I'm stagnating and have no direction.  I'm living far away from my family and farther from my home friends.  I only see them maybe once a week, and I miss them so much.  I haven't seen my family in two weeks.  

I do best with near-constant social interaction, and right now, I always feel alone, especially at work.  I'm so lonely and homesick and I just want to go back to my old cashier job.  

I want to call my mom and tell her how rough this is, but I can't.  It would be an admission of difficulty, and I am too proud.  And I can't talk to her about so much.  She is so afraid for my mental health that I have to protect her from any transient low moods I may have - even if I'm generally just fine, one little blip can take her down the darkest path and I'll find myself spending hours showing her I'm not falling into depression again.  Besides, there are other things that would hang behind the curtain of my words - things she'd be afraid of, like the fact that I occasionally drink with friends, the fact that I've gone to clubs and bars, and my psychedelic experiences, as well as general life changes, such as the fact that I might want to convert a school bus and live in it for a while and the budding relationship I have with a girl she might disapprove of, plus so many other aspects of my diverging life that affect me but that I cannot share with her for various reasons.  So I would not really be communicating, just recounting a hollow story.  (Side note: when I'm a mother, I am going to be much more open to my children's activities and interests instead of expecting them to be good little babies and never expand past the little world of their upbringing.  Ugh.)  Actually, I haven't had good, honest communication with anyone for a while, honestly.  That's the loneliness.  

I miss my parents, the rock of my childhood.  My brother and cousin, who I am closer with than anyone - we have no secrets from one another.  My friends, with whom I may discuss anything from horses to house building to hippie stuff to hiking to music and whatever else is sitting on my mind or theirs.  The community of extended family that brings more meaning to my life than I ever realized.  My cats.  Everyone I love who's not living in my city.

What do I do?  I am going crazy at work.  I'm actually dreading it right now, sitting up in bed so as to delay the morning.  But if I quit now, I'd have to find another job - maybe just the same.  School is hard because I am lost.  I feel caged by pride and my own ego.  I miss everyone.  I miss my mom so much, but I can't reach her.

I've been exercising a lot.  I meditate regularly.  Those things are what is keeping my mood at the relatively  high level it is still at.  I go out with my school friends at least every week and my home friends maybe once a week.  I talk to my mom on the phone a lot.  But I'm not connecting, not most of the time.  And there's the ever-present dread of work.  Work is the epicenter of my misery right now.  

Other things I'm doing: I just landed a very low-hour babysitting gig that should bring some fulfillment into my life, and I'm thinking about volunteering at a humane society.  I occasionally hike, which feels more real to me than many things.  But those are tack-ons.  They improve my life, but they don't mitigate existing problems.

Please give me an answer, even if it's one I probably already know.  I honestly just need a human sounding board, because I'm stuck in my own brain and it's stuffy in here."

9i1b0h,33,2018-09-22,Imposter Syndrome for all the Wrong Reasons,cornellthrowaway0000,Cornell,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/9i1b0h/imposter_syndrome_for_all_the_wrong_reasons/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

EDIT: Please try to read past the 2nd paragraph. I'm not patting myself on the back for the entire post.

TL;DR I have social anxiety and I replace my lack of friends with try-harding in school. It sucks.

I'll start with the good things. Cornell to me has been an environment where I can thrive academically. In high school I was a terrible student and it was honestly a miracle that I was accepted to one of the programs that It's best known for (not going to be specific to mitigate doxxing myself). Not only am I grateful that I am here doing what I love, but I'm blessed to be good at it too. I've never really struggled academically while here; I've been able to do pretty well in my classes without putting in all that much effort. I've also been really lucky to get into a prestigious student organization (again, can't be specific).

When I was a freshman, I felt like I was the king of the world. I was destined to get the best internships and make a ton of money when I graduate. However, one year later, I realize that I was an ignorant ivy league brat. These things are not what's important in life. To me at least, I've determined that the things that really matter are true friends and love.

I've made a handful of friends that I used to see regularly my first year. They weren't very good friends, but they were better than no friends.  Now that I'm a sophomore, we've been seeing each other much less than we had last year. I can't blame them though, it's been hard because everyone's been busy for their own reasons. When I can't be with my friends as often as I was able to, realized that I have been relying on them without noticing it. 

From there, my mind has been spiraling out of control. Even though I haven't realized it at the time, high school was really the highlight of my life and will probably will stay like that forever. Even though I was a shit student and did irresponsible things, I had a core group of friends that really understood me and cared about me if I ever felt down. I lost that support structure now that I'm here with none of my high school friends.

I look at everybody here, and it looks like everyone is always with a friend of some sort. Everyone is fit while I'm fat. Everyone is having a good time while I'm grinding away at problem sets on Friday nights. I wish that I could be like everyone else here, but I'm afraid to risk letting go what I've worked so hard to accomplish so far by focusing on anything other than academics.

I do have interactions with some people here regularly though. For instance, I interact with the people on that student organization that I'm on regularly. However, I feel like these interactions are all superficial. There's no real friendship that exists between us. We don't hang out outside of meetings and org parties. We interact because we should, not because we necessarily want to.

My remaining support structure is thrilled that I'm doing well here. My parents always brag to everyone about how much I love it here and how well I'm doing. Don't get me wrong, my parents are mostly great parents, but they don't realize that this puts a pressure on me to keep achieving more than I have done so already. I really love my parents and I don't want to disappoint them by underachieving when I'm capable of so much more.

But I had this thought. When I'm on my death bed, I'm not going to care about my GPA. I'm going to care about what memories I've made throughout my life. I'm going to care about who have I have positively impacted during my limited time on planet Earth, even if I made their life just a little bit better. That's what I want to work toward, but I'm frightened that I will hold myself back.

I have a lot of social anxiety, especially when interacting with people I don't already know. This naturally makes me introverted, but I hate it so much. I wish I loved being social with new people. If I was, none of this would be an issue. I would have made a new set of friends of the same quality as the ones I had back home. It really sucks that I couldn't continue off to college with them, but that's life.

Because of this, I feel like I don't belong here. It seems like everyone is a good-looking social butterfly while I'm just a overweight problem-set slave. I honestly don't know what to do. Transferring is definitely not an option though. If anything, transferring would make it worse. This isn't Cornell's fault, it's mine.

Obviously I'm writing this for a reason. My goal isn't to make friends through the internet. Instead, I want to see if anyone feels like they're focusing on the wrong things like I am. If so, please share your thoughts. Thank you."

I recently graduated in May with a degree in Human Computer Interaction and a minor in Computer Information Science, unfortunately I wasn't able to do an internship as I had to work full time to pay  for college. I immediately got a job after graduation on a Service desk for the Home Office of a worldwide clothing company. I like the job, mainly actually working at a desk with a computer for once even if it is a lot of ticket making and admin work. 
I am just worried that I am working towards the wrong path. I know I didn't graduate with a CS degree, I am reminded by my handful of other friends who have and are working engineering jobs all the time. I just couldn't stay in the major with all the extra stuff we had to do (electrical engineering, CAD design, etc) I just wanted to program and what I graduated with is what my advisor and I thought was much better. 
I am 25 years old, at this point should I try and work my way to an engineering position in my current company or try and land a low level dev job somewhere near me? Or both? A handful of the engineers and dev teams at my current company moved up from the help desk so I have hope there. The only thing is the pay right meow is $17/hour (best I've ever had, I live in the midwest) but at this point and at this age should I be trying to immediately grab a development position or should I relax and keeping working my way up? I have to say my selfish jealousy of my friends with nice paying jobs adds fuel to my anxiety fire

9i3g95,10,2018-09-22,"[Support] Going into year 3 of my university course, how can I keep my confidence up when I make mistakes?",assassinsweed1,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/9i3g95/support_going_into_year_3_of_my_university_course/,"This is a very personal post. 

So the first 2 years of my university course were intense. My course has A LOT of assignments - at least 3-4 a week which count towards a small % of my degree. Second year was the worst as I had 10 exams in a 3 week exam period. So understandably, it makes sense why someone would struggle in this degree.


Now, my biggest issue which makes me not do well is my confidence. I think I'm stupid compared to my peers. This is something I am working on and I'm more aware of, I have seen a counsellor about it too. But when I started university, it was the first time I ever struggled intellectually. And as female, you do get some male students who do talk to you like you're an idiot too. I started to believe I actually was stupid.


I've noticed I'm too scared to mess up. Whenever it comes to assignments, I panic about wrong answers, constantly ask friends for help when I actually don't need it. And a lot of the time, it turns out I actually did know the answer but I didn't let myself say it or research into it because I thought I was wrong. 


for example, my Haskell module I worked so hard for. When it came to the exam, I panicked.  I have a problem that when I see a question I don't know the answer to straight away, I panic and convince myself I don't know the answer and how dumb I am. So I failed the exam after not being able to answer a single question. For my resit, I looked at the paper again and realised I could've solved at least 60% of the answers but I was too scared to even attempt to answer them. I guess I have a huge mental block which I can't get past. Starting is always the hardest for me because I'm scared to have fun with programming and mess around with code because I don't want to break anything.


I am getting better at this problem! I did a summer internship which boosted my confidence massively, thanks to my mentor. I am ready to smash this year and don't want to lose this extra confidence I have gained. 


Does anyone have any tips for how to not let yourself feel sad when you don't get a good grade? Or how to just have fun with the work? How do you maintain confidence when you make mistakes? Thank you. "

I'm thinking about trying to get a cs job/jobs for a couple years before I go back to school. I was hoping to get some advice about things I can do to stand out.

**Why Switch to CS?**

I recently graduated with a BSEE and am not liking the job market in my field. I would need to do a graduate degree to have a chance at getting a rfic design position, and finding a job that actually advances my career in the field is very unlikely (low gpa, no relevant internships).

**Where I'm at now**

I'm pretty comfortable in c++ and have completed a few programming classes from my undergraduate program. I'm currently working on a big project that will hopefully look pretty good on github when it's done (physical modelling software synthesizer, involves advanced math/dsp/3d graphics in real time). I'm confident I can do well in interviews with some additional studying. 

**What to prioritize?**

Should I look into hackathons? Bootcamps? Focus on getting my project finished? I feel like I need something to stand out since I don't have a cs/ce degree or relevant internships.

Thanks!"

I was wondering if I could get some feedback on something I've been thinking about for a while now. So I'm a final year Bachelor of Science (hons) in Computer Games Development. Even though the workload is high I do love my course. However in terms of career prospects when I graduate next year I'm looking more towards Web Dev / app dev. Even though my degree is very niche (which honestly sometimes I regret not doing software development) we did study a lot of modules which are thought across all Cs degrees in my college including Web development. I loved this module and managed to get a Web Dev internship at a startup this summer! I mainly used react and thought myself on the job. Basically I was wondering will my degree title hurt my chances of getting a general app development / Web development Job? It's something I've been worrying about for a while now as I feel it automatically puts me one step behind everyone else with general software development degrees. Any feedback would be much appreciated!

Since last summer, I've been very interested in cyber security (especially with regard to penetration testing, network security, and cryptography). I'm a sophomore in CS at a pretty decent state school, and the only languages I'd be comfortable working with at the moment are Python and Java, in that order (however, I will have a C/C++ course behind me after next semester).

With all of this in mind, what, in your opinion, would be the best move for me to make for this summer?

* Intern at some company (Big X or other) doing generic software engineering (No cybersec experience gained)
* Target a government/corporate cybersec internship (May not be qualified)
* Spend the summer doing a cybersec course and getting a certification (i.e. getting an OSCP cert) (Net negative on money, not actual experience)
* Something else entirely.

Do you guys think that I'd have any sort of shot at a cybersec-focused internship, given that my only technical experience is TAing and web development for the cybersec people at the school? What do you think is the best move?

Thanks, guys!"

I'm worried about transportation. I don't have a car, and even if I did I don't know if shipping it to a different place just for 4 months is practical. 

Do you just try and familiarize yourself with the public transportation of whatever city you'll be staying in as soon as possible? Do I bring my bike and try and make do with that? Is it practical to carry around materials like papers and a computer+peripherals while biking?

Is it normal to have to take a lot of cabs? Or is it not too hard to find a place to live that's relatively close to your workplace?

For example, I am trying to pick up Python, but it's been a struggle. I feel lost compared to my peers, who seem to internships and lab positions lined up to them.

9i5hi6,3,2018-09-22,I feel like I'm stuck. What should I do?,TheRaunchyFart,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9i5hi6/i_feel_like_im_stuck_what_should_i_do/,"Hello all,

I'm writing this post from my phone so please excuse the brevity.

I recently graduated college (may 2018) with a BS in Computer Engineering Technology. When I initially started the program I felt like I enjoyed it but as time went on I gradually grew to hate it. I stuck it out and graduated because I had made a promise to my parents I would graduate college. The reason I had stuck with the program after the first two years is that I had felt too far invested into it. I didn't feel like I could switch without having to spend another 3-4 years there. It was costing me about 25k a year. I had spent five years there so do the math for how much I owe.

Considering I owe so much my student loans are obviously astronomical. And that is where I need the career advice.

When I working towards graduation I was doing everything I could to get a job. I was applying to internships, apprenticeships, full time and part time jobs in my field. Each interview I had I would be turned away with them saying ""you don't have enough work experience"" or ""your GPA is too low"" (I had below a 3.0). As graduation got closer I was applying to more and more places. I believe at the point of graduation I had around 200 applications filled out on LinkedIn alone. (obviously I was going to job fairs and other hiring events). I was struggling to find a company that will willing to give me a chance. I actually had one company say they're going to hire me but when I called them up to ask when I need to come in for an orientation they said they went with somebody else with more experience.

On July 11, 2018 a company finally decided to give me a chance and bring me on with the title of System Engineer. They pay me below $16/hr. With my student loans it's a hardly liveable wage. When I accepted the job I took it so I could get experience in the tech field. They also were the only people who had offered me a job to that point.

When I graduated my goal was to get in the Semi-conductor business. Whether it be programming embedded chips to building and testing modules. At my current job I was required to sign a non-compete that is valid for 12-months. I have heard from some people that I know that in New York State non-competes are only enforced if you take intellectual property with you (knowledge, clients, etc). I may be wrong but I'm not sure. I feel that they use the title ""System Engineer"" as a blanket title there. I have done zero engineering and I think everybody in the office has the same title. I'm more of a Help Desk, I reset users passwords and do your basic MSP kind of stuff. 

I really want to find a new job. But I'm unsure how to go about it? Do I just stick it out for a year and get experience in a field with the label ""technology"" though it's not doing what I want? Do I leave the field all together and get a job that pays more right now (ie construction / carpentry). I feel trapped at work and I honestly hate it.

I hope I explained my situation well enough. If not I can elaborate in the replies.

Thank you.
 Note: I live and work in the Albany region of New York State. I can't move, because I can't afford it at this point. "

So I'm not in here bragging. HOWEVER it seems like most companies, if you jump through their hoops and they like you, will take their time deciding, and then suddenly give you an offer and basically YOU have to decide within like a week whether you're taking it or not.

Por ejemplo, let's say I'm applying to TinyStartup and Facebook. I do everything TinyStartup wants, and they say, ""Awesome! Looking great. Welcome aboard. You start on X date. Sign all these forms."" Obviously I want to wait and see what Facebook has to say, but because Facebook is HUGE, it's going to take them a lot longer to release their results.

I found this to be a major issue with internships last summer—the place I really wanted to work for would NOT answer the phone and basically waited until the last minute to let me know that I had gotten it, at which point I had already selected my second choice because I had run out of time to leave them waiting.

I never hear anyone talk about how to navigate this. And the CS department just sent out an email chastising students for reneging on job offers, and I get that that's rude, and I wouldn't do that. But then again, I do want to be able to make an informed decision, and I know that companies don't really care about that. What are the best strategies?"

Here's some general information that might come in handy for people looking to apply to 

university overseas. I have no personal experience yet with any of this: All of this information is based off of 

university websites, as well as information I've received from anonymous people online who have shared their 

experiences. If I think of something new or someone posts some useful information in the comments, I might come 

back to update this.

Please note: This post focuses on obtaining a *bachelors degree* abroad.

-------------------

**Why Look Overseas for University?**
-

There are a number of reasons that might compel Americans to attend university overseas:

- **Emigration**: If you want to leave America and emigrate to a foreign country, university can be a good path 

to achieving that goal. After studying at a university in your target country, you can try to get a job, and eventually 

gain citizenship.

- **Cheaper Tuition**: Certain countries and universities offer free or no tuition. For us, coming from America, it 

is possible that we can save money by getting a bachelors abroad. 

- **Foreign/Cultural Experience**: Studying in a foreign country allows you to experience a new culture, or to gain 

insights into the way of life of a different society. For many, this is worth going overseas for in and of itself. It's also 

possible that overseas experience might help with a future job depending on your plans (either as a ""resume 

booster"", or by being directly related to a job, such as becoming a diplomat).

- **Easy Travel During Breaks**: If you are studying overseas, then it will be much easier to visit nearby countries 

during your breaks. For example, if you're studying in Germany, you could potentially visit France, the 

Netherlands, Belgium, Czechia, Switzerland, or hike in the Alps during your time there.

- **Mastering a Language**: If you want to master a second language, studying in a country that speaks your 

target language will allow you to practice it everyday, and the immersion is an excellent way of improving your 

ability.

-------------------

**Things To Consider About Studying Overseas**
-

- **You need money**: You will probably need a sum of money in order to study. Even if tuition is free, you'll 

have to pay for flights, food, rent, etc. You could possibly obtain loans for studying overseas - I haven't looked 

into it. Depending on the country's laws, you may not be able to work for money while studying. For students 

coming out of high school, the easiest way to make this work would be if your family is willing to financially 

support your studies.

- **Not all universities will be cheaper**: Depending on the country, tuition may or may not be cheaper than 

tuition here in the US. Generally speaking, English-speaking countries where the bachelor degrees are taught in 

English (US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia) will have very expensive international tuition, equivalent to out-of-

state or private university tuition here in America. Countries that don't teach bachelors in English (Germany, 

France, etc.) are more likely to have cheap or free international tuition. When checking the cost of a university, 

make sure that you check the cost for *international* students, since that will be you, and international tuition can 

be different from regular tuition.

- **Some foreign universities work with FAFSA**: [Here's the current list (spreadsheet download warning)]

(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/international-schools-in-federal-loan-programs.xlsx) of foreign 

universities that accept FAFSA. In the future, you can find the most updated list [here]

(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/prepare-for-college/choosing-schools/types/international#participating-schools). 

Just click the link that says ""*[International Schools That Participate in the Federal Student Loan Programs]

(https://i.imgur.com/YXLOHQN.png)* "".

- **You will most likely need to learn a second language**: With the exception of the UK, Ireland, Canada, and 

Australia, all of which have expensive international tuition, most of the bachelor degrees you find will be taught in 

a different language. Some countries have preparatory programs which can assist in learning the language 

before studying. 

- **Distance from Family**: Depending on where you go, you'll be leaving your family, possibly going far away 

from them. Unlike college in the US, where it's possible you could visit family on weekends or holidays, it will be 

more difficult to do this when you need to book a flight to get to your family's home. If this is an issue to you, then 

keep it in mind as you consider foreign schools.

- **Different educational systems**: Depending on the country and university, the education system will be 

different in various ways from the US system. Universities may have no sports, no dorms, different teaching 

methods, different grading methods, a different atmosphere/philosophy, etc., you should research into the 

educational system of the places you are considering. In particular, one common difference is that, unlike 

American universities, most foreign universities allow a greatly reduced freedom of choosing what classes to put in 

your schedule. Programs are usually specialized and focused (and, in some places, only take 3 years), and may 

not allow you to get credits for classes that aren't part of your program.

- **Different admission timelines**: Universities in other countries often have different admission timelines than the 

US. Here, we usual have early admissions, and then regular admissions with deadlines in early December or 

January. Other countries may have deadlines much earlier or much later than the typical US deadlines. Make sure 

you check early and apply on time.

- **Your High School diploma may not be enough**: Many countries have different educational standards than 

we do here in the US, and you may find that your high school diploma is not enough for what a foreign university 

requires. Countries might require entrance exams to prove that you are knowledgeable enough, or might require 

specific SAT/ACT or AP scores or certain grades in classes (Two examples of countries like this are Germany and 

Switzerland).

- **It may be more difficult to get employed in the US with a foreign degree**: Consider the possibility that, if you 

study abroad, employers here in the US may not view the foreign degree as being as quality as a degree from a 

US or Canadian institution. I'm not sure how true this really is, or to what extent it applies, but this is something 

that is worth thinking about. A ""workaround"" for this might be to attend a bachelors abroad, then return for a 

masters/PhD here in America, which would allow you to list a US school on a resume. This potential concern is, of 

course, only relevant if you plan to return to America for a job after education.

- **If you want to work in the US, you will forgo on-campus recruiting and networking**: One big upside of 

studying in America (and maybe Canada) if you plan on working here is that companies may come to the campus 

to recruit for internships and jobs, and you will be able to network with your peers. Consider this if you want to 

come back to America to work after graduating.

- **Depending on your career/field, if you want to work in the US, you may need accreditation**: I'm not 100% 

sure about this part, so take it with a grain of salt and look into it yourself, but I believe for certain degrees, such 

as civil engineering, if you want to work in the US, you need to get a degree from an accredited US school. 

Foreign degrees might not work in these scenarios, unless maybe you come back for a masters. 

----------------------

**On searching for universities**

You'll likely have trouble finding resources for searching for universities. I'd recommend figuring out which 

countries you're interested in studying in (either by checking the usual international tuition for the country, the 

educational culture, or the cultural experience you'll find), then finding universities within that country. After you 

have universities that you are interested in, read their websites in-depth, noting languages of study, international 

tuition and fees, the educational system, student culture, etc. You could also try searching through online forums 

for information about universities - reddit has some good information on universities. If you search on google 

""reddit X university"" you may find some good information. You could also try asking a country subreddit about the 

university, asking people you know from the country for information, finding other relevant places to ask, etc. You 

can also, of course, email the university directly for questions you have, or maybe try to email the university 

students and ask them about their experiences.

**Languages**

If you want to learn in English without learning a new language, you'll unfortunately be paying more for tuition. 

Canada, Australia, UK, and Ireland all teach in English, but have expensive international tuition. However, the 

Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have some English programs. The ones in Belgium (KU Leuven) and 

Luxembourg (University of Luxembourg) are very cheap, but have limited English degree options. The universities 

in the Netherlands (TU Delft, University of Groningen, TU Eindhoven, and a few others) have more English degree 

options, but they are a bit more expensive (about ~10k Euros / year tuition from what I saw).

If you're willing to learn a new language for this, you should probably start learning as soon as possible. 

/r/languagelearning could give good advice to help you, as could specific language subreddits. Make sure you 

look into the language test/certificate requirements of the universities you're interested in. If possible, you may 

want to try to take a year before university to stay in the country and practice the language on a more intense 

level.

**Masters or Other Graduate Programs**

Although this post has been about bachelors degrees, note that the masters/gradschool scene is a bit different. 

There are a lot more English-taught masters across the world, and many of them are cheaper as well. If you're 

looking for a masters, you may find that you don't need to learn a new language at all before applying to a 

free/cheap program (although you would still probably want to learn it anyway, for communication and 

integration).

**Final Remarks**

I would like to offer a word of caution: I'm not sure what number of Americans actually go overseas for university 

with the intention to return back here. I've found only minimal information regarding this, and am unsure of how 

employers here would perceive foreign degrees. If you decide to study overseas, please be sure to come back to 

share your knowledge, experience, and advice with others online, to help guide people who are considering the 

same.

And finally: Remember that for many of the people you might meet while studying overseas, you may be one of 

the few Americans they meet, or potentially even the only American they meet, depending on where you go and 

what you do. Your actions and the way you are perceived will influence the way the people in the country perceive 

America as a whole. Like it or not, when you're in a foreign country, you are acting as an ambassador for your 

own country. Ensure that you leave a good impression."

I somewhat geared my undergraduate coursework towards academia, and I spent two of my undergraduate summers doing research, two doing internships. My most recent one, which was this past summer at Facebook (specifically Instagram), went horribly. I was a mess, and I put a lot of effort trying to keep up with the coding pace, but I just wasn't pushing code as fast as other interns. My 2 week starter tasks turned into 6 weeks. I did not get a return offer (though I should have been qualified for a full time position before I began!). And I have no idea why I did so poorly.

I have been doing coding projects on the side of my studies and I had gone through an Internship at Bloomberg in 2016 that was fine, though my manager did expect me to work faster and be more knowledgeable. I know a number of people who have less programming experience than me but have gotten return offers from top companies. I'm really not sure why my skills are lacking, but I'm worried that staying in academia, and possibly having to spend my summers doing research, will close the door on industry. Academia is too uncertain of a field, and I'm uncomfortable with the idea of not having programming as a backup.

Is anyone else trying to do this balancing act between academia and industry? Any advice on how to do it? Or are my expectations too high?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I think my biggest problem is understanding large code bases that I have to work with. Also, I'm actually very good at interviewing (the questions are often very algorithmic...), my biggest worry is my ability to actually do the job."

I really need help preparing for some entry level data analyst jobs. I'm bit overwhelmed by the different requirements and need help with figuring out in which to put more focus and effort into.

Background: I graduated this year with a BA in mathematics. I have no intership exp what so ever :( I currently have a job (got this before graduating) doing some low level IT stuff. Think racking and stacking, switches, access point. I'm pretty good with Linux and some now decent level of networking. I'm also familiar using some analytics software to the extend like AppDyanmics  and LogTrust. My job was more focused around setting up these for clients than using these, although I know little about using them too since I got sales and pre sales certifications. 

My other work exp including working as sales associate way back, in an eletronic store selling TVs, then in retail for something, then tutoring while in college ( highschool level math)

I'm not a pro with Python but I have built some small level programs and extension for other software. Same with Java. And I'm pretty good with LaTex as well. I'm also familiar with Excel (more than basics) but I'm improving on these by online tutorials. I also just started doing the R course thru datacamp. 

I keep looking at entry level positions and most of it require ppl knowing SQL, Tableau, R, Python, SAS and Excel. I'm really not sure what to focus on to make my chances for find a job go up. Doing everything at once is kinda overwhelming!

I'm kinda unhappy with my current job as it leading my into things I'm not really interested with. I'm more interested in data analytics and science.

I kinda feel burned out about not finding a job yet, plus no one has gotten back to me despite the tons of postings I've applied for, it's kinda demotivating. But I really don't wanna blame the world for it and that's why I started working on the required skillset. How could someone with my background be a strong candidate for the entry level jobs? I know I fucked up by not having any internship on my resume while in college. I was struggling with college and other personal issues, didn't think I could handle it back then.

Any help directing me to good resources, practices or how to make my self a strong candidate for these kinda jobs is appreciated.

The title of the position is ""Software Engineer"" but from reading the job description, it sounds like I will be doing more software integration and testing with some Python test automation. I got even more discouraged when I read all the negative outlooks this subreddit has on software testing in general. I also have an on-site interview with a Big 4 company in the next couple of weeks. The main problem I have right now is that I really want to work in aerospace because it's what I'm most passionate about and interested in (also is what I have the most experience in). If I get the job offer from the Big 4, that will look great on a resume, but I honestly will probably not be excited or interested in the work I'll be doing. I am, however, super interested in the aerospace company, but I'm scared that being a software integration and testing engineer will pigeon-hold me into a career path that I don't want.

I'm wondering if I should turn down the job offer and keep looking, or go ahead and take it because it's in an industry that I've always wanted to work for.

I'm in a bit of a hard situation and would appreciate advice from all.
I have completed one year of a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology. I didn't particularly enjoy it at all and don't think I would like the next two years very much either. On one hand, I could stick with this degree and see it through. On the other, I am thinking about transferring to a Bachelor of Arts program in International Relations and Economics. 

In terms of jobs, I don't want to really work in anything relating to any of those degrees at all. I would ideally like to work in recruitment, HR, marketing or PR. I understand that whichever degree I choose internships and building a good resume are crucial.

It gets difficult because I always hear the stereotype of how Psych majors all end up unemployed, yet if I continued with this degree I could see myself potentially getting a Masters and going into Industrial Organisational Psychology. Yet on the other hand, I feel like I would potentially like studying the IR/Econ degree a lot more, but worry about the job prospects since it is a Bachelor of ""Arts.""

Any advice, please? I am really torn and would appreciate any opinions.

Thank you!"
9i8qar,10,2018-09-23,Need Advice: The ethics of teaching super-rich private-school kids instead of the less fortunate ones,mrdude777,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/9i8qar/need_advice_the_ethics_of_teaching_superrich/,"I'm a new teacher at a really (and by that I mean *ridiculously*) expensive private school. Contrary to what some people have said in this subreddit about working at a private school, **I absolutely love just about every aspect of it**: workload, prep time, autonomy regarding curriculum and pedagogy, salary, benefits, work environment, little paperwork, no standardized tests except SAT/ACT (which I don't have to teach to anyway), and administration and colleagues. Parents are generally supportive and on the teacher's side; helicopters are a small minority. Kids are mostly (except for 10-15% who are on academic scholarships) from super-rich families, but few are arrogant or stuck-up about it, or at least not overtly so. All of that is great.

**BUT**

The one question that keeps gnawing at me is **whether I'm making the right choice, ethically, by devoting my time, energy, and relative expertise** (considering that there's a big nationwide shortage of teachers in my subject area, and many of those who teach it have either no academic background in the subject or in education or both) **on kids who already have so many privileges and opportunities in life that come from their families' wealth**. Now, mind you, I'm no radical leftist with a deep-seated hatred of the rich. But I'm very mindful about the class-based differences in opportunities, privileges, and struggles because I myself grew up in a struggling working-class family and did my teaching internship at a Title I school. So I think that I might be making a bigger difference and doing an ethically better thing by devoting my working hours to the kids who have *less*, broadly speaking. I certainly don't imagine myself as a knight in shining armor swooping down from the heavens to save these poor kids or anything like that, but still.

From thinking about this for a while and talking to others, I already have some pros and cons for each side of the argument. So I'm reaching out to you, especially to experienced teachers, for advice on what to do or at least how to think about it.

9i93wi,5,2018-09-23,Is switching from computer science to law a bad idea?,AMKReddit,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9i93wi/is_switching_from_computer_science_to_law_a_bad/,"**TL;DR:** I'm a sophomore CS/IT double major with some software experience looking at switching to CS/Accounting and getting into tax law. Is this a bad idea given the job market and work-life balance?

I'm currently a sophomore in college (CS/IT double major). I've always liked both software and law (at least what I know of them) but figured I'd go into software since I have experience there and am capable enough in it. I had a programming internship over the summer and found that what I really liked and was focused on was less the programming itself than the ""business"" part of the work. Basically, I like figuring things out, putting them together, and the general surrounding interactions more than I like day-to-day programming itself.

Right now, I figure I could be happy enough doing software, but I think I would enjoy law much more. My question is, given the current job market and working hours (9 or 9:30 - 7 most days in law from what I understand) in software vs. law is it foolish to consider switching careers?

Some background: I'm 19, located in South Florida and would like to stay here, although I would consider moving to New York. I have a 4.0 GPA and am optimistic about keeping that up over the next few years, I'm hoping that could get me a scholarship in law school. Although this isn't really a concrete indication of an aptitude, I've always done better with reading and writing than math.

I've been programming since I was 11 and have built a fairly successful app as well as done some work in the family business. I've always liked the work, but, as I mentioned above, I think I like the business aspect more than programming itself.

I'm seeing if it's possible to switch to computer science and accounting (from CS/IT) which would allow me to possibly get my CPA and/or switch to accounting if I can't go to law school in the end, but that would involve a heavy course load and my school might not allow it.

If law school works out, I'm looking at becoming a tax attorney, although I'm being told that IP/patent law is better and has less competition if you have a STEM background. That probably sounds like I'm just looking for the money, which I kind of am since I'm considering a switch from a fairly lucrative career path, but I think I would like the more business-related aspect of tax law and have somewhat more of a head for that than I might for, let's say, criminal defense. I'm also OK with the tedious aspects of many things that most people find boring.

My main concerns with law are the hours big law generally involves and the job market. I don't think the big law lifestyle is one I want, although I'm not sure if the hours just look worse on paper and are practically the same as a management position I might end up in with software otherwise. Ideally, I'd work big law for the ""required"" 4 or 5 years before either starting my own practice or switching to some other arrangement (in-house, small firm, etc.). I'm OK with the amount of work, but don't like the family life that comes with staying in the office until later at night. Working until 5:30 and then 7-9 from home is much better than working straight until 7, which is what I think a private practice might involve.

In software, I've done largely web related backend work (Node.js and Java) and would likely try to work my way up the ladder from there if I stuck with it. From what I understand, if you advance well in software you end up in management in about 10 - 15 years so a software career is really management longer-term. I've also considered cybersecurity, although I don't have experience there. TIA!"

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been applying as aggressively as some of you here, but I have had several interviews with several companies mainly for SE positions, the more interviews I have the less confident and more intimidated I feel, I know my problem is mainly mental, but I feel like I am at a point where I feel no self worth at all, with every interview I feel more like shit about myself, although I have had some pretty decent interviews but never received an offer, I know that this field is becoming extremely competitive and it is making me depressed about myself, this subreddit has offered me great advice but on the other hand it destroyed my self esteem, seeing the amount of effort some people put here just intimidates me and I feel like no matter what I do I am not doing enough.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway, I am aware of the fact that my programming skills aren't that great, again I will say that this is more mental to me but programming has always stressed me out severely. I decided maybe to start looking into positions where programming isn't very heavy, and I started looking into QA positions. I know the salary doesn't compare to SE positions, but the way I am thinking is that I wanna at least get my foot into the industry and then switch into SE. however upon reading many posts here I am guessing many people do not recommend getting into the QA field as a whole and that it is very looked down upon.

&amp;#x200B;

Which makes me even more depressed tbh, I am getting to the point where I feel like I would accept any shitty position, I was almost ready to accept a $13/h position at a small company just to get any experience, even though the position wasn't even that good in terms of experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that most people feel hopeless during the job hunting stage sometimes, but I feel like this is taking a huge toll on me right now. I am in the process of interviewing for a QA position that pays 25-27/h, they said they will train me for a month at their headquarters and provide free housing then put me on a project elsewhere, but part of me feels like I have already lost the battle. Idk maybe I will start feeling better once I start working. Sorry for the depressing rant, but I would love to hear your opnion about all this. Thank you.

I just need to talk for a second. My husband and I recently moved across the country for my MPH program, which has been everything I've wanted and more. I've gotten my dream internship, have begun creating a strong network in my field, am being challenged in classes, and have met many very interesting people.

However, for the past two years since college and before grad school, I have been working at a research center and really bonded with the cohort of Ph.D. students who started when I took the position-- more so than I ever have with another group of people. I feel bad since I barely miss my parents, but I miss those friends to the point of crying on a regular basis-- they were all fantastic people and we fit so well together. One of my friends recently got engaged, and I was so happy that she called to tell me over the phone, but I am SO sad that I can't be there to celebrate with her or help her plan.

The friends I've made in my cohort are all extroverts and into partying hard-- which are the people I usually attract, but I'm really missing the deep conversations and chill wine nights I used to have with my old friends. I've tried making new friends, but the cliques are already really well-established. People have often commented that I ""know everyone"" and am the ""most popular person in our cohort"", but since I haven't really connected with anyone, I just feel really lonely. 

Any advice?

3. World History - A
4. Princ. of Macroeconomics - A
5. Precalc2 - A

Took a summer class there too:

Calculus 1 - Withdrew

&amp;#x200B;

**Senior**:

Full-time doing dual enrollment at the University of Minnesota.

S1:

1. Honors Physics 1 - in prog
2. Intro to C++ for Scientists and Engineers  - in prog
3. Calculus 1 - in prog
4. Intro to Psychology - in prog

S2 planned:

1. Calc 2
2. Intro to algorithms, data structures, and program development
3. Elementary Computational Linear Algebra
4. Discrete Structures of Comp. Sci.

**Extracurriculars**:

\- Held a Software QA internship(turned into a part-time job after 3 months) for 13 months during my Junior year for 25-30/hrs a week. Strong problem/solving and leadership(project management) was required for this job. Can get a letter of req from here

\- Held 2 jobs during sophomore year.

\- Volunteered with local organizations about 35 hrs/year

\- NHS

\- DECA: Made it to state last year

\- Have received Private Pilot's License w/ Complex Airplane Endorsement (thus why my 2nd major is Aerospace)

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I'm a little different than most applications. Where a lot of students usually spent their time volunteering and being president of so and so club, I spent my time being independent taking college courses and working a high level job(for my age) at the same time. Now in senior year, I'm spending it getting my 1st and 2nd year computer science courses done. By the time I finish high school I could sign on with a company to be a junior developer. This was not a joke internship either, if I failed even once, I could be out the door. So assuming I do well during this senior year, what do you think my chances with UCLA, UCB, USC, U of Miami, or perhaps similar colleges?"
9icsp5,4,2018-09-23,Co-Op vs Internship,jarry108,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/9icsp5/coop_vs_internship/,"Hey everyone!

I am a current sophomore in mechE and had enough success at my career fair and initial interviews to get an onsite interview for an internship and a co-op program. The co-op is at an aerospace company next spring and was one that I am interested in, but my only concern there is that I would have to take a full semester off in which I take most of the core mechE classes (deforms, dynamics, electrical theory, etc). 

As for the internship, it is a much smaller company with about four real engineers at a small plant. It isn't as glamorous as the co-op, but it's in the summer which means I don't have to take a summer off.

I don't have any previous engineering related work experience and know that the rule of thumb is usually get what you can for the first intern/co-op, but I am constantly weighing the pros and cons for each one, or doing both, and can't come to a decision. My parents are also not so fond of the idea of me taking a semester off and delaying graduation by a year (my school requires senior design to be subsequent fall/spring). I was wondering what opinions you all may have about this situation and opinions on summer internships vs co-ops.

Thanks!"

So, backstory: I lived in Florida for 2017 doing a paid internship. My contract ended, I moved back home to CT. I got a job that is seasonal, meaning we have two temporary shutdowns during the year (one in 
Summer, one in Winter.) On June 29th, I worked my last shift before shutdown. July 3rd, HR mailed me my pink slip to claim unemployment. I filed immediately. I got an email notification from the CT DOL website informing me I would have hearing forms in the mail to fill out pertaining to my claim. I received those papers July 10th and mailed them out right away.

Cue 20 days later, no word back from the state and I have now been unemployed for a month. I had to go to the job center since CT does not have a customer service phone line anymore due to budget cuts (thanks, Malloy!) The unemployment rep informs me a claim was opened in my name in FL. He gives me the contact information, and thus begins my turmoil:

July 30th- I call and speak to an agent about my plight. They put me on hold. They return with a fax number to their payment issues unit which will close the claim, processing takes about 22 days. I fax the information the same day.

August 7th: I call and try to find out more information on the claim. Another customer service rep tells me the same as before. I get frustrated and call the fraud line, and I speak to an agent who informs me that it isn't fraud and that the state of CT opened the claim in my name, and that the state of CT also should've mailed me a form to decide which state I wanted to claim in. I also find out that the claim in FL was opened on July 11th and denied in CT July 12th. Hmm..suspicious?

August 10th: mail out another letter incase the first one didn't go through. Also speak to a CT DOL rep online, and they informed me they did NOT open the claim and until wages are restored I will be unable to collect. Once they are restored by FL I can apply for back pay.

I then wait two weeks, hoping after the 22 days I'll call and have the claim closed.

August 21st: customer service rep is confused when I ask if the claim is closed, she puts me on hold, informs me she sent an email over letting them know I need an answer so I can collect back pay. 

August 28th: rep sees that I've been calling since July 30th for an answer. She asks for my phone number, informs me she will call me if she gets an email from the payment issues unit. No response.

September 4th: Another clueless rep, she puts me on hold, tells me she sent an email asking about the status. No update.

September 13th: I speak to a rep who asks me if this is fraud. I tell her everything that has happened up to this point. I get put on hold. She tells me another email has been sent (where are they going???)

September 20th: I speak to a rep who realizes I have no employment information in the system and no driver's license. I explain to her my problem. She places me on hold, she tells me to fax a letter to the payment issues unit. I explain to her I have done that twice. She tells me the state of CT filed the claim to prove I wasn't already collecting. She also told me to check my status on the FL DOL website (yet..I don't have an account and can't access that information..because I DIDN'T. OPEN. THIS. FUCKING. CLAIM. The system does not recognize my SS number or DOB or ""pin."") 

So..now I'm at my breaking point. CT is denying involvement in this and FL is saying they are the ones responsible. Luckily, I returned to work on 9/10 but, what worries me is we have our second shutdown late Dec- early Feb and if this claim ISN'T closed I will not be able to collect then, either.

So, smart people of Reddit, please help me. Should I get a politician involved? The news? A lawyer? Should I buy a plane ticket and bust  the doors to the FL DOL? Family has suggested I claim off of Florida, but it's too late now since I am back to work, but their thought was it would be immediately closed because the employer will fight it and be like *DENIED.*

I know this is a long shot since no one knows how to handle this situation or help me. Any guidance on what to do from here would be great. I appreciate you.

TL;DR: somehow a claim got opened in my name in a different state that I didn't open myself. No one knows what is going on, birth states have conflicting information."

Can't change it. Sorry.**

  
Hi all,

I am a 26 year old who is returning to get my Bachelor's this Spring. I received my Associate's back in May. I will be attending a university with roughly 15,000 undergrads.

I am embarrassed to admit I have been to quite a few schools over the last 8 years, but I finally got things back on track about a year ago and at least got my AAS. Now I'm ready to go back for my Bachelor's.

Currently, I work full-time in a help desk IT gig. I have worked here since July. The pay: meh, but its right around normal help desk pay. It could be worse but it's livable. And I also have to commute an hour to/from work every day. Which I have noticed is adding up more than I thought even with decent MPG. Anyway, because of it being a full time position, I don't have that much free time.

I tried to bite the bullet, and suck it up and had planned to try juggling work and school. But, to my dismay I showed up for late Fall 2018 (a month or so ago) orientation to find out this college does not offer as many online classes/late sections as I thought. So I couldn't fit into the Fall. They get filled up **incredibly** fast. *However*...the college itself is great, has the exact program I'm looking for (Computer Science), is offering me a decent little scholarship. I would only be taking out about 1,000ish a semester in loans.

Now that I have gave you some background information, my question is: **would you leave the job and go back to school?**

I have to do *something* to pull income while I'm going to school. **I am trying to come up with some ideas that will generate me some income while going to school.** The area itself where the college is located is not very large at all and offers very poor job choice. The area is only known because of the state school that occupies it.

If I return to school, I will need to live off-campus so I'll have to get by with the little income I have by living with roommates or something.

**My final gripe in question**: if I did this, that I'd be leaving this job after about 6 months. I know it could be worse, but I am afraid in the future to look like a job hopper. I have a pretty decent work history at major companies like Apple, Best Buy, AT&amp;T, etc. and I'd like to think I interview very well. So I don't think I'd have a problem finding some kind of internship.

So, if you were me...would you take the leap? Would you leave the job at 6 months and go back to finish your Bachelor's?"

I live in the Silicon Valley, so I understand that there are lots of IT positions, but again I'm not sure where I fit in as an employee looking for a part time job.

I'm a mechanical engineer by trade, but around 5 years ago my firm at the time asked me to create something.  And it took a while, but I did.  It's basically a bunch of VBA code that reacts to a bunch of information that an intern or someone would put into a spreadsheet and it spits out a bunch of javascript that gets injected into PDF's so they become interactive.  Anyway, they wanted to patent it, so I jumped through all the hoops they asked me to and filled out all the paperwork they requested.  It was filed as a patent pending up until I quit that firm over a year and a half ago.  Fast forward to last week and I get a call from my old boss.  Looks like they're trying to finalize the patent and he said he needs me to sign some paperwork.  One of those documents is a declaration, looks to be a standard form, and appears to be fairly innocuous as I'm just verifying that I am indeed the inventor.  But the other (an Assignment) has me asking A LOT of questions.  I've copied the text below followed by a few questions. I've anonymized the text and am using throwaway for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

So, that's what they want me to sign.  Apparently, they are asking me to sign this now because they have a patent application with a notice of allowance and they realized they did not have the assignment.  But they've known this since early July and I'm just now being asked to sign this.  Apparently, they have to have this done by Oct. 2nd.  I'm kind of pissed because now I'm in the position of needing legal advice because my former firm wants me to sign on for some terms a full year and a half after I quit working there.  Not only that, but the conditions in the last paragraph seem laughable...""and generally do everything possible...""  wft?  Also, I don't particularly care if they succeed in obtaining the patent.  So here are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Am I obligated to sign this?

2) What happens if I don't?

3) What keeps me from saying they should change the $1.00 to $10,000?

4) Should I be asking them for indemnification?

5) What do I possibly have to gain by signing this document?

6) If I do sign the document, can they scrub my name from the patent as the inventor?

7) I did all this on company time and company software.  I've always thought it as something owned by my former firm.  Why are they asking me to relinquish something I don't have?  And shouldn't they be paying me a lot of money to agree to the other stuff (especially the last paragraph)?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, guys.  I know it's a lot of text, but I really don't want to spend a bunch of money on attorney fees all because I was nice enough to develop code and apply for the patent for my ex-firm.  Also, although I don't harbor ill will towards them, I have no reason to try to help them in their endeavors.  Thanks in advance for the read and the advice.

I’m a 24 year old recent grad (graduated April 2017) in mechanical engineering. I was lucky enough to have done 1 internship (12 months) and 1 co-op (4 months) during my time in school. Both placements were with 2 different automotive companies in different engineering roles. 

I was also lucky enough to land a job within the first 3 weeks of graduating... within in the automotive industry but not with my previous employers (I was offered contract positions by previous internships and coops but I didn’t want to work under contract). My first job was good however I was low balled on the salary and being a recent grad I decided to accept the pay cut for experience hoping to see a raise/promotion in a year. Fast forward 1 year into 2018 and I asked for my promotion my manager even tried pushing it but upper management rejected it, even though I was taking on full responsibilities as an intermediate.

This was upsetting so I decided to seek out another opportunity and was able to get a offer from another automotive company that was meeting my salary expectations and presented a 2 year financial growth plan. I was happy with this and decided to jump ship, my employer tried matching what the new employer offered but I already signed my new employers offer. 

It’s been 4 months into my new job and this is the 4th automotive company I’ve been with since I started uni... and honestly I’m really not digging this new position. Pay is okay but everyday I’m dragging myself out of bed and my stress level has increased (just seem less happy), it’s gotten to a point where my family has started to notice as well.

After some serious reflection I realized the reason I’m not really feeling my jobs is because I might not be 100% sure about a career in the automotive industry. I currently want to switch out and pursue another engineering industry however my history of 4 automotive companies and not staying with a company for more then 13 months is a red flag for any other industry. I’ve actively started searching for a new job however the only responses I get are from other automotive companies. 

I was wondering if I can get anyone’s opinion on what I should do? I have friends in the consulting field, energy and software that are ready to help me get a foot in the door with their industries but I’m not sure how my jumping ship will affect my job hunt and if I’ll like the new industry.

9iifc0,1,2018-09-24,"Questions on Address Matching, Clustering, and Correction",pseudorandomforest,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9iifc0/questions_on_address_matching_clustering_and/,"I had a good call with the hiring manager of the logistics company where I am interviewing for a Data Science Intern position. He instructed me to work on the following problem and interview with him on Thursday.

So, the problem is about last mile delivery. Logistics companies such as DHL, UPS etc. can spend up to 35 % on last-mile deliveries. A key problem is the call center has to call the person to get the exact delivery location. This increases costs.

Instead, we can feed the address into a geocoder and get the coordinates. (Geocoder: A software which takes {address or points of interest} text as input and spits out latitude, longitude). This is still expensive as Google charges per API call. Obviously, we cannot make a new Geocoder (Google et al has already done a lot of research; Why reinvent the wheel?).

But, we can structure our software in such a way that can reduce the number of API calls to Google to reduce geocoding costs. We can save money by integrating our historical database (address-geocode records) with the geocoder.

The hiring manager suggested on looking at solutions to:

1. Check if two addresses are similar (Eg. they may belong to the same building but have different apartment numbers). We can use historical geocode records in this case.

2. Since, we have millions of address-geocode records, how do we structure or cluster them in a  manner so that the search space therefore search time is reduced?

3. If Google’s geocoder fails to find a match; how can we modify the address such that we are able to get a match in the second try?

9iifda,1,2018-09-24,Should I take the leap of faith?,carluoi,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/9iifda/should_i_take_the_leap_of_faith/,"Hi all,

I am a  26 year old who is returning to get my Bachelor's this Spring. I received my Associate's in Information Security back in May. I will be attending a university  with roughly 15,000 undergrads.

I am embarrassed to admit I have been to quite a few schools over the last 8  years, but I finally got things back on track about a year ago and at  least got my AAS. Now I'm ready to go back for my Bachelor's.

Currently,  I work full-time in a help desk IT gig. I have worked here since July.  The pay: meh, but its right around normal help desk pay. It could be worse but it's livable. And I also have to commute an hour to/from work every day. Which I have noticed is adding up more than I thought even with decent MPG. Anyway, because of it being a full time position, I  don't have that much free time. And I spend all my free time at work doing IT related projects and studying for certs.

I tried to bite the bullet, and suck it up and had planned to try juggling work and school. But, to my dismay I showed up for late Fall 2018 (a month or  so ago) orientation to find out this college does not offer as many  online classes/late sections as I thought. So I couldn't fit into the  Fall. They get filled up **incredibly** fast. *However*...the  college itself is great, has the exact program I'm looking for  (Computer Science, cyber security track), is offering me a decent little scholarship. I would  only be taking out about 1,000ish a semester in loans.

Now that I have gave you some background information, my question is: **would you leave the job and go back to school?**

I have to do *something* to pull income while I'm going to school. The area itself where the college is located is not very large at all and offers very poor job choice. The area is only known because of the state school that occupies it.

**My final gripe in question**:  if I did this, that I'd be leaving this job after about 6 months. I  know it could be worse, but I am afraid in the future to look like a job  hopper. I have a pretty decent work history at major companies like  Apple, Best Buy, AT&amp;T, etc. and I'd like to think I interview very well. So I don't think I'd have a problem finding some kind of  internship.

So, if you were me...would you take the leap? Would you leave the job at 6 months and go back to finish your Bachelor's?"

SAT - 1460 (760 Math, 700 W+R) 9 Essay

Extracurriculars: Helping to manage a club founded by a classmate (this year), founded my own video game development club (this year), kickboxing(from grade 10), business summer school at Upenn, participating in a few game jams, learning Japanese. 

Might do these by the time I reach my senior year: Create a game for disabled children (using the Microsoft/Xbox technology for disabled people), summer internships if I find any locally or in nearby countries, start the key club if a sponsor can be found in my country

Essays will probably be good. Might need an editor or something though since my grammar isn't the best.

Since getting into CS is really competitive, I am not sure if my stuff is good enough for top 20, especially my ECs. I feel like my essays can carry me hard (since I can make the worst shit sound amazing) but I don't feel like I have any big achievements to make it into top 20 for CS."

I am currently a computer science and math major with a minor in electrical engineering. I recently was offered the opportunity to apply for a paid, with housing, meals, and travel fully paid for biomedical eng. research internship, which I’m half positive that I can still apply for even though my major doesn’t exactly line up. However, I’m starting to wonder why I never did biomedical engineering other than my school doesn’t offer it (though I had the opportunity to pick from many other schools). I’m wondering if I should change my minor to biology in order to hopefully work on my graduate degree in Biomedical Informatics, or if it doesn’t matter that much. I’m already in my 3/5 years and I’m pretty sure if I wanted to get my bio minor it would either set me back or make life harder. I’m not really sure where I’m going after I graduate but I’m very interested in biology and data science, and I also figure biomedical informatics would be personally fulfilling because I’d be helping people. Anyways if anyone has any experience or advice I’d appreciate it."

I graduated last June with a 3.85 GPA from a no-name school with a MS in CS (my BS was in Accounting).  I did one six-month internship in web dev at a local company through my school's co-op program.  Other than that, I haven't done any special projects or anything.

Now for the intangibles.  I am not passionate at all about CS.  I know that it can help for job searching to build your portfolio with different projects, but I really don't have the motivation to do anything outside of basic projects that practice the fundamentals of things like Node, React, etc.  Also, please don't tell me to choose a different career just because I'm not passionate about this stuff.  It's too late for that, and I'm not passionate about any other careers anyways (I already ditched accounting).  I chose this path and I have to go through with it.

I started out applying to a bunch of smaller local companies since I figured they would be less competitive (I'm in Oregon).  However, after applying to about 40 or so jobs with only 2 callbacks, I noticed that most of these small companies are looking for seasoned developers with at least 3 years experience, not a fresh grad like me with only one internship under his belt.  When I researched more and more companies, it seems that they just do not want to train and want someone who can do the job on day one.

Thus, I feel like I need to apply to the bigger companies that have the capacity and resources to take on freshers.  However, I'm doubtful that my single internship experience is enough to even get interviews at these companies.  I've applied to some larger companies without any results right now, but not enough to make any conclusions.  Should I stick to spending most of my time applying to local opportunities?  Is it going to be a huge grind/crap shoot no matter where I apply?"

Other people spoke to recruiters longer than I have on average too, and I understand that most undergrads aren't looking for full-time positions, so maybe the career fair was more internship-focused but I'm not feeling too well after the career fair.

This isn't my first career fair. In fact, it might be knocking on the door of my 10th, and most of them end poorly, but I'd expect that since I'm applying for full-time positions, I'd at least get more opportunities. I also had internships my past two summers, so I do have some work experience, and most of other decent qualifications (good GPA, some involvement, some projects). But I don't know if the bar is higher for full-time hiring. Is it a bad thing if companies just tell me to apply online for the most part?"

9ilpqm,39,2018-09-24,A message from the Dean about the REAL course format,pointlessBRZ,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/9ilpqm/a_message_from_the_dean_about_the_real_course/,"Just got this message in canvas and figured I would post it here for anyone who may not have received it 

“Dear College of Business Students:

This past week we heard from a number of you regarding concerns with the Active Learning/Reduced Seat Time (RA) course format—what we call the REAL (Relevant Engaged Active Learning) courses here in the college. We’re big on engagement at the college, so I wanted to thank you for the feedback we have received and take a moment to address some of the concerns we have heard and share what we’ve learned and what we plan to do.

For those of you who are new to the college, it’s worth taking a moment to discuss what we had before the REAL courses. Since 2000, all of our core courses were taught in a Video Streaming/Reduced Seat Time (RV) format, what was known as lecture capture. Yes, lecture capture’s official name has the same “reduced seat time” label attached to it as the REAL courses. The lecture capture format charged the same distance learning fee as the new REAL courses and class sizes ranged from 800 to 2,000. Lecture capture produced the lowest average grades on campus of any format used by the university. Very few students came to class (way fewer than the 280 seats available) or watched the lecture videos. So we started the move away from lecture capture last fall, because research from a number of universities, including UCF, shows blended learning formats outperform all others in encouraging learning. Lectures alone, whether you watch them in person or on TV, are simply not as effective in preparing students for the business world.

The REAL courses are a blended learning model that uses a combination of online, adaptive and face-to-face learning. It actually costs us more to deliver than lecture capture, but we’ve done it without any additional cost to students. We were willing to absorb these extra costs because UCF’s 20 years of experience with blending learning shows this format will better prepare you for future classes and your career. We started rolling them out last fall, and now most of the college’s core classes are delivered in this format. Results over the first three semesters have been encouraging. Two-thirds of students surveyed rate the courses as excellent or very good. Student Perceptions of Instruction return to historical averages in the second semester the course is taught in the REAL format. It is a bit too early to completely assess the impact on learning, because research shows these gains usually take three or four semesters to fully manifest as both students and faculty adjust to the approach. So far, scores in these courses have been on a par with historical averages.

While we have been encouraged by the results of the first three semesters in this format, we know it is a significant change for both students and faculty. To help those of you who may be struggling, we are working with the Center for Distributed Learning at UCF to develop a workshop with tips on how to navigate the blended learning format, access available resources and develop strategies for success. We will be providing more information on the workshop in the coming week.

The REAL courses require students to adopt a bit of a different mindset than the standard lecture format. This is by design. The material demands more of you, so you need to be more proactive. It shouldn’t be just you, your computer and your textbook. The college has created hundreds of ways for you to be proactive and to learn and engage. You don’t need to have a class scheduled in the building to further your learning.  You can come almost any day and...

meet with representatives from the companies you have told us you want to work for
find a mentor (Meet Your Mentor)
form study groups with other students
work with career coaches and our employer relations team
find internships (The Invitational)
network with alumni (CareerFest)
hear from experts in The EXCHANGE
meet department chairs and faculty (Majors Week)
join an RSO (Welcome to the Majors)
connect with recruiters and apply for jobs (Knightline)
learn how to study abroad and much more.
I cannot emphasize enough the importance of reaching out to your instructor or TA if you are struggling. They are in the best position to help you understand their course. The REAL course instructors meet regularly to discuss what’s going well and how they can best address student concerns within the goals of their course. They are already considering adding study guides and/or debrief materials for group exercises to some courses. Your success is our primary goal.

Every day we seek to create a culture of engagement at the college that helps connect you with classmates, faculty, alumni, employers and business and community leaders. There are more students on campus now interacting with faculty and classmates than they ever did with lecture capture, and that is a good thing. This spirit of engagement is what differentiates our college from other business schools, and it is part of the reason employers tell us they want to hire our graduates.

So we hope you will continue to talk with your instructors, TAs and department chairs, provide feedback and let us know where you’re struggling with the REAL format and how we can help.

9im73t,1,2018-09-24,I want to create a small program to automate reports at my job (Land Surveying) - Where should I begin?,lorty,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9im73t/i_want_to_create_a_small_program_to_automate/,"First of all, I have a very basic knowledge of programming. My knowledge consists of dozens of Matlab programs over the course of my college degree, as well as one class of Python programming. So yeah, very basic stuff.

Also, English isn't my first language, so sorry about that!

**Career context** :

Alright, so I'm a Land Surveyor and I've been working in a small firm in a small town for the past 2 years. Beforehand, I did a bunch of internships in between college sessions.  We currently have 4 full-time employees, so it's a really small office.

Right now, our method to write documents/certificates is to dictate the content through a cassette recorder. Yes, you heard it. A cassette recorder. My boss has been doing it for 20 years+, and never bothered to change his formula. Fine, he's now really good at it... but I'm not. It's frustrating to use, awkward, and whenever I have to write difficult and complex sentences, I type it on Word anyway.

His pattern is simple : He takes an older document similar to the one we're currently doing (So he will take a survey that has been done close to the job we're doing, or a survey with many similarities), then reads/speaks the content and changes the words/sentences so that it represents the current information. Documents are about 10 pages long, and we change about 50% of the content.

Afterwards, he gives the cassette to the part-time secretary, and she opens the .docx document that has been used as an example, and changes the words/sentences by listening to the cassette through a pair of headphones.

She then prints the document, and either I or my boss will correct everything. After that, she proceeds with the corrections, then she prints the final version.


-------------------------------------

**Objective**

In the past months, I've been thinking about how I could innovate and use a program to help me write automatic, or semi-automatic reports/documents. My boss isn't ready for this ""technology jump"", and will never pay me to do this (because there is literally no available time left in the office to do this), but in the next 2~ years I will slowly become independent within my office and lead my own things. So even if I do this on the side, it will help me later on for my career. 

I've looked it up on the internet and found multiple Microsoft Word addons and programs that let you automatize text such as HotDocs, but that's not enough. My automation would be a bit more complex, and involve stuff such as coordinates and values from AutoCAD-exported ascii files, mathematical functions, etc.


So basically, I want to create a small program that consists of a basic interface that lets me automatize paragraphs with the help of buttons, boxes, lists, etc. These paragraphs once completed would be inserted into a pre-written Microsoft Word template. In other words, only 25-50% of the document would be automatized. 

**My question(s) are :**

- How hard would that be, considering I have a very basic knowledge of programming?

- Which language would be optimal?

- Is it realistic?


Thank you! "

I know that I:

\- Dislike front-end / app development, but I probably have the most experience here

\- Like optimization problems (the kind of problems on Leetcode); I've done well in programming competitions

\- Like distributed systems (and have internship in this area, but mostly working with cloud computing services rather than algorithms. I heard that most of what DS engineers do is work with Cloud / Azure  / AWS etc and no actual algorithms)

\- Like general programming / writing plain code or scripts, server-side. I have no idea what to call this skill

\- Am interested in AI but no experience. Also this field seems too over-saturated atm, and besides that, I'm not sure if I want to go to grad school.

What do I market myself as? What kind of jobs should I be applying for? When a company asks me how I can be useful, what can I say?

Once I have finished my rotations, I am granted the opportunity to interview for a position. I am not sure what your experience with similar training programs are, but we are essentially treated as interns during our time in the program. I am fine with paying my dues as a new engineer but I really would prefer to be given a well defined role as well as some time to become competent in it.

The company's primary focus is in subsea oil and gas which appears to be trending downward. Layoffs are common and company morale is low. At this point, I am not entirely certain what I want to do. I intend to apply to the major operators, aerospace companies, and even software development because that is something I really enjoy. I do not intend to leave my current job unless I can find something significantly better - either financially or in terms of quality of life/company culture.

I gave them my resume and they asked me a few CS related questions and some questions about my previous internship at Shopify. 

Today, I got an email from Bloomberg telling me I’ve been selected to do an on-campus technical interview. But I’m not sure if I should do it or not.

I’ve applied to Google(with referral) and to Microsoft(with recruiter referral)  as those are the companies I truly want to intern for next summer, (Microsoft said they’ll be scheduling an interview with me in the near future). But should I still do the Bloomberg interview even if I don’t want to work for them ?

(3.14/4.00 cGPA).

I'm currently taking 2 CS courses for fall (Software Design in Java and Intro to Database in SQL). I plan to take 1 other course in the winter (Either Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing). So in total, I would have completed 4 CS courses by the time I graduate. Lastly, I have completed 1 CS and 6 math courses:

* Fundamentals of Computer Programming (C+)
* Calculus I (A-)
* Calculus II (C)
* Linear Algebra (A-)
* Engineering Mathematics I (A+)
* Engineering Mathematics II (A+)
* Probability Theory (A+)

The first 4 courses were completed in first year of school.

**Work Experience :** I have 20 months of internship under my belt with 3 Fortune 100 companies but not a single one of them relates to CS.

**Self Education :** Here is a list of MOOCs I have taken:

* MITx 6.00.1x - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python without certificate
* MITx 15.071x - Analytics Edge without certifcate
* Udemy - Python for Data Science with certificate
* Coursea - Andrew Ng's Machine Learning without certificate

I would like to get a reality check as to what my chances are into the program.

Thank you!"

I'm not sure if this is the right place to be asking this, so pardon me if I misplaced this. 

Anyway, I recently graduated with a diploma in Business IT Management from a polytechnic institute/college this past June with a 69% avg, zero ""good"" connections, zero co-ops/internships (my school didn't provide co-op opportunities or even a normal timeline to fit an internship like most colleges/universities since I finished in late may), and zero job opportunities in my field at the one job fair they had for business students. 

I'm currently 21 years old and i'm trying to decide if I should complete my bachelors degree (BBA) in 2 years at this polytechnic institute/college (can confirm there is no co-ops for the BBA program and the job fair would be the same) or ""restart"" at the best computer science school in Canada and be done in 4 to 5 years depending on co-ops? 

I'm interested in the computer/technology side of business and would like to have the best opportunity to have a great job, not an average job or a job for the sake of having money ASAP (within a reasonable timeline of course, nothing too long).

Note 1: My credits from this polytechnic institute/college do not ""easily"" transfer anywhere (I would need align my past school's syllabuses with the other school's syllabuses, if the school provides me that opportunity) since my school is very keen on keeping their students. Also, my grades are not the best for my first year (first year is mainly business courses).

Note 2: I'm planning on taking my CAPM exam sometime before April 2019.

If you could suggest what route would be the best and why, that would be very much appreciated.

9irczu,3,2018-09-25,[Ontario] Need help - New tenant is withholding my mail,donnaw7131,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9irczu/ontario_need_help_new_tenant_is_withholding_my/,"I did a lease transfer of my apartment to a new tenant since April 20th of this year. I paid the new tenant, let's call her Jane, $300 to take over my lease because I had an internship in another city and I had to find a new place to live in for 4 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Jane moved in the following week. I had two ongoing paid subscription services with that were sent to my original address. Those services are automatically billed once a month and then the packages are sent the week after. After my first package arrived I texted her immediately asking her if it was okay for her to to hold onto the packages until I can come and pick them up. I indicated that packages would come every month. She replied with ""OK"". I sent her follow up texts in the following months but I received no response. Turns out, she blocked me, but I had no idea at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my boyfriend to contact her because she wasn't replying to me. He sent her a message asking her about the boxes and she replied by saying she left them at the front desk of the apartment. She then blocked him (that's when I realized I was also blocked).

&amp;#x200B;

After I came back from the 4 month internship, I went to the front desk and asked about the packages. They told me that no packages were left at all and they don't even offer that kind of service. By that point, I was *livid.* I paid someone $300 and she lied to me, and blocked me to get away with it?

&amp;#x200B;

6 more packages ended up being sent during the 4 months.  I checked the tracking number of each ... 4 of the packages were marked as ""delivered"", which means she probably has them in her possession. The other 3 have all had ""attempted delivery"" but then were returned to sender and are somewhere lost in transit. One said ""addressee moved -- item returned to sender"" meaning that she came in contact with the courier but told them I didn't live here. Another one said ""item being held, addressee being notified"". The last one was ""returned to sender because of no pickup after 10 days on hold"" and again.. I was never notified.

&amp;#x200B;

I've got all of the tracking information printed out and solid text evidence of her being aware that those packages are for me. I am debating what to do next, since I've read that withholding/opening/tampering with mail that does not belong to you is punishable by law. I spent money on those. I could either contact management of my apartment and request to speak to her, or I could go straight to the police. Has anyone dealt with this and what is the best thing to do at this point?

&amp;#x200B;

9is7pr,1,2018-09-25,Should I just give up on promotions?,GeneralizedPanic,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/9is7pr/should_i_just_give_up_on_promotions/,"This is long but I will TL;DR it at the bottom. 

I graduated from college with a niche degree about a year after the housing market crash kicked off the recession. The town I lived in was massively effected by the downturn and, for a lot of family-related obligations, I couldn't move away at that time. So I made do with the jobs I could find which were entirely admin/bookkeeping positions.

It's 10+ years later now and I can't break out of admin work. I am an admin at my current job in an industry related to my degree. I get glowing reviews, have branched out into helping with other roles with great success, and have made my desire to move into a non-admin role clear to my supervisor and other upper management types with their vocal support. 

A month ago, I was asked if I wanted to move to a different department in a non-admin role with a great career trajectory. I gave an enthusiastic yes. There was logistical planning and email chains where I was explicitly told that Other Department Manager would be my new supervisor and that she would be filling me in on specifics during an upcoming one on one. At the one on one, it suddenly became clear to me that I was at an informational meeting about what that department does rather than a meeting to discuss my future in that department. Other Department Manager told me all about how hard it is to hire in her department and how she is interviewing candidates now. She mentioned that I could ""maybe help out again"" on upcoming projects as I have before. I kept up a good face, asked good questions, and generally tried to appreciate the time Other Department Manager took out of her overly busy schedule to talk with me but I left the meeting feeling like an idiot. 

I spoke to my supervisor about it and she acted like I was being unreasonable to expect a promotion ""so soon"" (I've been here a year and a half). She told me she understood why I felt misled but that no one should have given me the idea that I was actually being promoted. I asked her about all those emails where we were literally planning for me to move to a different department and got an excuse about ""business needs changing blah blah blah look at Coworker, he was here five years before he got to (position three levels above me currently, two above where I'm trying to go).""

I can understand that needs change and maybe that position wasn't available to me anymore for any number of reasons but I'm feeling so burnt now that they are acting like no one said the things they said to me in the weeks leading to the disastrous meeting. I agreed in the heat of my embarrassment over my apparent massive misunderstanding to take on a multitude of additional jobs to prove myself and my abilities but I've been here before. I've always been the admin who does upper level work for admin pay while external hires and interns get the positions I'm vying for. 

The TL;DR question is this - I may have a shot at moving up in my current company but I'm afraid my admin title and experience will forever hold me back. Should I stay and hope for the best, should I accept that the interns will always be hired into the positions I want over me no matter how well I demonstrate my abilities and just make my peace with being an admin forever, or should I jump ship and hope for something better even though my experience will pretty much limit me to admin/bookkeeping jobs everywhere else, too?"

9itvaz,0,2018-09-25,Taking an extra year: Okay to do?,Throwbod,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9itvaz/taking_an_extra_year_okay_to_do/,"Hey all. I am looking for advice if potentially taking another year on my CS degree will look terrible or not. I believe that the context of me doing so is a little outside the norm, so Ill go ahead and share it. 

I spent my entire life up through High School doing Classical Music and Opera, while dabbling in C++ and doing front end web development/website building as a hobby. I knew going into college I would want to double major in Computer Science while also getting a B.M. in Vocal Performance. This was necessary for any sort of Opera career. I was dead set on an opera career after studying abroad during High School in Italy. My entire worldview was shaped by going to a High School that heavily pushed music and I was heavily encouraged by my Vocal teacher to go school at the school she taught at, where I would basically guaranteed get roles. I wont give the name of the school, but it was a minor school within the UW (University of Wisconsin) college system. Despite being accepted into the likes of Carnegie Mellon and Texas A&amp;M, my Dad's alma mater and my #1 CS school pick(And now my greatest regret) , I chose to go to said no name school as my entire worldview was shaped by music. 

What a fucking mistake. In my Music program, I was taking 18+ credits of Music classes for my Freshman year, and while I was doing well, I was only able to self study for Computer Science. By my second semester, I was becoming worried that I would not be able to juggle both CS and music at this school, and made my concerns known to my advisor who also happened to be one of my music professors (Huge conflict of interest, but small school made your professors sometimes overlap as your advisors). After speaking with my Vocal teacher who kept on pushing me in opera, which I was successful in, but was beginning to find just how much money I would have to spend on grad school and also terrified from sunk cost fallacy of how much money I had already sunk (Young Artist Programs and Vocal Lessons are very expensive) I began to see that the people in my music life were not out for my personal best interest. Couple this depression arising in second semester from being the only music major who also was self-studying CS and had a huge interest in it, while constantly being encouraged to stop (sometimes to an abusive degree by said vocal teacher) caused me to look into transferring. For the sake of my mental health and future financial wellbeing, I knew I had to transfer schools. This vocal teacher, who I turned down other schools for, turned almost abusive when I came to her in my Depression asking for help because I felt like an outcast from the other music students who shunned me for ""not fully pursuing music"". Despite this, I aced my juries and had a pretty good GPA. 

My twin sister had established in-state for my family at a state school that had a promising CS program. My Dad, thrilled I wished to fully pursue CS and now having just divorced my Mom ( Who was the primary force in getting me to choose the worse school for music) said he would help me financially pay for school as long as I had in-state. This eliminated Carnegie Mellon, A&amp;M, and the other dream schools that I had the pick of in HS, But this state school was still an INFINITE improvement over the music school. Luckily, I had not nuked my GPA from first semester, although it was starting to slip by second. In my Depression, I quickly submitted a transfer application second semester and direct admitted into the CS program. I finished out my freshman year at the previous school, and began taking CS classes as a full on CS major in the fall. Still trying to pursue Music, I took some music classes the first semester while taking my 100 and 200-level CS courses (I had already knocked out most geneds) . I quickly realized I no longer wanted Music as a career in my life, and switched fully over to CS. 

It has been a year, and I am happier than ever. Leaving the abusive music environment was the best choice I ever made and I am now on the prowl for internships as I am putting myself through Honors Data Structures and Algorithms. I love CS with all my heart. 
As a result of this chaotic freshman year, though, I feel somewhat quite behind in terms of CS credits. I need a certain amount of hours in 300 and 400 level classes, and am pursuing a Cybersecurity focus which requires me to take even more advanced math (Further than just Calc II which I have already taken and passed). Unless I take 17 credit+ semesters and classes over the Summer, I simply do not feel like I can finish within my 4 years. While I have taken some summer school, all the courses I need to take require a large commitment and I worry they would detract from my ability to pursue an internship with full commitment. 

I already feel a little behind for internships as I spent last summer self-teaching myself Data Structures and Algorithms before going into the official class this year, but its hard. I feel more like a sophomore in CS than I do a junior. I took a lot of APs in High School so my credits dont necessarily reflect that, but it is how I feel. I am working as hard as I can to catch up without burning out. 

Basically, knowing this information, would taking an extra year to finish my CS degree hurt me in the job market at all once I get out? Would it be conspicuous enough to hurt my postgrad and internship search? 


Thanks for the long read yall and I appreciate ANY and all advice.

It also created JIRA tickets and moved these JIRA tickets across the current active sprint as the pull request went through the code review process. I wanted to know if I could upload this code on my personal GitHub account to showcase the source code if I took out all private information from the company? It seems like a generic bot that could be applied to any workspace, so as long as there’s nothing tying it to the company would this be fine?"

I am also minoring in math and studio art, which I am aware is a quite bizarre combination. I don't have a real portfolio yet, and I have yet to try and find an internship. I like programming, and I really like helping people learn how to program. I am a teaching assistant for 3 classes, and I also tutor for cs.

&amp;#x200B;

As I get closer to finishing my degree, I realize I have no idea what cs career path I want to take. I am taking a databases intro class that I like, but I don't if it is what I want to do in the long run. I guess maybe what I'm looking for is some validation that not everyone has it figured out yet, and maybe some advice as to how I should focus on a path/profession. I am a good student, I feel as though I write good code, but even then I still feel so behind.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I am just caught up in the idea that I need to be an expert to get any sort of job, which I don't know if that is true or not. As a teaching assistant I grade a lot of code and I know that I am definitely good at what I do relative to my peers. I don't want to work at a huge company, but I do want to find something that pays the bills and gives me some financial security.

This is my call into the void to maybe hear what you have done to land your first job, how you found your passion in the cs world, and how I can stop worrying so much about needing to be an ""expert"" to get an internship or job."

9ivx9d,6,2018-09-25,Questions about Career Fairs,HangaHammock,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/9ivx9d/questions_about_career_fairs/,So I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student and my university has a career fair next week. My goal is to have an internship next summer. My biggest question is how do I go from talking about my interests and skills to making enough of an impact on a person that they'd want to hire me specifically? Anyone can talk to a person about themselves and express the fact that they are interested in working for that company and have various relevant skills but what specifically should I say and how should I steer the conversation to make the person want me specifically? 
9iwrsf,78,2018-09-25,PSA: Fall Career Fairs &amp; Internship/Job Recruitment,estellaria,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/9iwrsf/psa_fall_career_fairs_internshipjob_recruitment/,"I figured that it would be a good time to post about the career fairs since classes are starting soon and there are so many posts asking about internships and job recruitment. There are three major career fairs being held in early fall quarter which are held through the Career Center (and student orgs in the case of Meet the Firms).

**Career Fairs**

[Science &amp; Technology Career Fair](http://career.ucsd.edu/triton-fairs/sci-tech-fair.html) | [Handshake](https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/career_fairs/5644?ref=recommendation-collection-show) \- Wednesday, October 10, 2018 at 9:30 AM – 3:30 PM

[Triton Fall Career Fair](http://career.ucsd.edu/triton-fairs/fall-fair.html) | [Handshake](https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/career_fairs/5650?ref=recommendation-collection-show) \- Thursday, October 11th, 10 AM – 2:30 PM

[Meet the Firms](https://www.facebook.com/events/266110564023345/) (Accounting Career Fair for '19 and '20 Undergrads) | [RSVP](https://goo.gl/forms/ThUn4rHRSSLhx6FR2) \- Thursday, October 11th, 5:30 PM – 7:30 PM

On the Career Center website, it notes that for the S&amp;T and Triton Fall fairs, students ""MUST **register through Handshake** AND bring their **student ID** the day of the fair. \*Pre check-in is not being offered.\*"" For MTF, only a RSVP through Google Forms and attending the workshop is necessary.

It is recommended to look up the list of companies attending ahead of time through Handshake and making a prioritized list of the companies that you would like to visit for day-of. Remember to bring copies of your resume and ask for business cards (if applicable, I'm not sure if this applies too heavily outside of business).

**Applying for Jobs**

Handshake is a helpful tool for checking job postings, and there's an [Upcoming Events section](https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/recommendation_collections/4) as well for more specific campus visits/office hours/career events. Some companies may not post on Handshake and might have their own applications through their websites, so check there as well. Additionally, companies may require you to submit both an application through Handshake and through their own portal, so please read the postings carefully.

**Career Development &amp; Other Networking Events**

* Many pre-professional student-run organizations will probably be hosting other career dev or networking events as well (e.g. bringing out alumni or companies).
* The Career Center also offers walk-in advising.
* Online, there's a student-run UCSD Resumes, Portfolios, and Websites [page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ucsdrpw/).

In general, it seems like the number of opportunities drastically decline after fall quarter. For business especially, fall is a crucial time for recruiting for positions with bigger companies/firms. If there are any fellow accountants here, this is the only time that junior and senior-level students will have an opportunity to apply for Big Four and other public accounting internships/full-time, so **please make sure that you are aware of application deadlines and come to Meet the Firms.**

I know there's a few other student org leaders and successful students who are familiar with the recruiting cycle for different fields on this subreddit, so please feel free to jump in and add more info. Good luck with recruiting!"

I am 21 years old and I am studying a double degree at univerisity in Law and in Business Administration. The double degree lasts 5 years, and I have just started my 4th year, a moment in which I am starting to think about what I would like to do.

I have been doing a summer internship on an important law firm in my city, where I discover how it was to work on the industry. I had a good time, I learned a lot and they were really happy with my work. 

Nevertheless, I have always like the investments field: first I learned technical analysis, then I enjoyed learning about fundamental analysis and value investing (thinking on taking the CFA) and now I am more focused on venture capital and the possibility of starting an startup.

As you can see I don’t know really where to focus my career, and when I think I have discovered where, I start doubting about if I really like it, and all the previous work and time of learning is lost.

This situation of uncetainty is producing on me a bit of anxiety, just because I want to focus on something and stand out, but my ideas are really changing.

I would like to have any advice, not only about my career, but also about how to manage this emotions, because maybe its a bit common and you have felt it.

Thank you!

9ixlb2,1,2018-09-25,I lied in my Resumé and they want proofs,lksdshk,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9ixlb2/i_lied_in_my_resumé_and_they_want_proofs/,"Hi, in this moment I feel very anxious about the whole thing. Sorry for any grammar mistakes (please point them because I am not english speaker).

Basically I have been accepted in a new job after 1 year of unemployment...The thing is...for them, I am unemployed for 3 months.

I lied about the time I spent in a internship, my last work experience. I lied because I lost my job in a very embarrasing situation with only 4 months. And before this job, I  lost a job after 8 months in a big company. So, to not look like someone who can't hold a job, I told them that I was a intern for 1 year till the end of my graduation, and the small company couldn't hold labour costs for a formal employee. Well, this excuse could be very real as we are facing highest rates of unemployment in a shitty economy where labour costs too much thanks to bureacracy and taxes...I am 24 years old and I haven't started my carreer yet.

The problem:

I found a very good opportunity and after 2 interviews I was very excited about the job offer. Last thursday the HR guy asked for contact of my former employer and coworker. Shit! I thought! They will contact my previous boss and discover that I lied about the time I worked there! I pannicked, so I contacted a coworker that I used to have good relationships and asked her to help me if someone reaches her, to cover up my story. Thanksfully she agreed and wished me the best. I sent an email to my former boss (and owner) explaining my situation and also asking him to lie for me...I said I was sorry for putting him in this position as it was something unethical...Well, he didn't answer it. Probably didn't give a shit since he is overseas...and I know that he doesn't has time for bullshit, his company has already enough problems...After this crazy idea, I sent the HR guy the emails.

Still, the next morning they called me to tell me that I was approved and asked for my documentations...Ok, they probaly didn't check anything! One of the documents was the  Reference Letter. Shit again!

Today I went there to handle my docs 99%, ok if wasn't for the goddamit Reference Letter. I told them that I probably wouldn't get it because it was a small company and they don't have HR and my former boss is traveling. She told me that she would contact the Hiring department to check what to do if I don't give them the letter, but still on the next call , she would tell the day I will start (next week) and asks for the Letter.

Now I don't know what to do, because the Reference Letter needs to has a stamp and it will say that I worked there for 4 months and not 1 year.  Even if I wanted I dare they would contact me back...that company is a mess, they probably don't have any documentation about me anymore as I was just an intern not a formal employee.

I am freaking out about the possibility of losing this job over such small thing like that. My position is junior, for inners. Perhaps it doesn't even need to have previous experiences...Like, it is a security company but nothing that they need to full check my background...

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do:

\- Tell them it was not possible to get a reference letter and insist that I can't no matter what.

\- Tell them it was not possible but I could try the other company that is way more organized (still they probably won't do it too)

\- To try and contact my boss asking for a reference letter and photoshop it if needed

\- To calm down that is perfectly reasonable to not have this letter (laws doesn't make it mandatory or obligate companies to give reference letters for former employee).

Anyway, how can I assure my lie?

&amp;#x200B;

I know it is wrong to lie but I had no choice. I can't stay unemployed like this..and I didn't do bad to anyone, this lie is harmless and I am a awful liar."

I am a junior computer science major and am new to this subreddit. I am starting to look for a summer internship for the fall of 2019. I was wondering from ex-juniors how many internships they applied to during their junior year. In terms of of my situation, the positives are that I had a previous solid internship where I did very interesting work, attend Rensselaer (RPI), and have extremely good recommendations from my previous work, but the major concern is my GPA. It is slightly below a 3.0 and I learned some internships require above a 3 the hard way last year (I had an unfortunate experience last year where my recruiter failed to discuss GPA, and after getting an offer at GE, was unaware I needed to turn it down until I saw the offer letter and GPA contingency). In my scenario, how many internships would you recommend applying to? As this is my junior year, I want to get the best final internship from a great company or internship program as possible. While I know I shouldn't over-apply, I just got declined after my final round interview with Google and Palantir this week and am starting to need advice on what is too much or too little in terms of applications.

Secondly, considering my GPA concern, while I am trying my best to get my GPA above a 3 for the summer, I cannot guarantee it will happen by the end of this semester. I will at least be very close. Are there specific companies that may be more open-minded to giving me a way to prove myself through interviews?

400-500, although I could be persuaded for something a bit higher if its a good deal! :)

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\*\* 

 Good battery life would be great- I commute to school so it would be nice if I wasn't always worrying about battery level. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*

 I do want something lighter, but it isn't incredibly important.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\*\*

 Windows

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\* 

 15 inches or smaller. Current laptop is 17 inches and its pretty clunky.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\* 

 I am a data analytics minor, so it would be great if I could run some coding programming like R. I plan to get an internship as an analyst, so it would be convenient to be able to do some things on a laptop. However, I'm planning on building a PC for my house, so if my laptop can't handle it, no big deal. If possible, being able to run some old emulator games (think handheld GBA, DS, etc.) would be fun because I like speedrunning.

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\* 

As mentioned before, it would be great to run some GBA/DS games. I would want the games to run without any lag, haha... shouldn't be too hard because they're handheld titles, mostly. Also- if possible- Binding of Isaac, but this isn't that big of a deal. 60fps.

 \-

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\* 

 Needs an HDMI port, preferably large storage

&amp;#x200B;

\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\*

 I am using this for class, so it needs to handle multiple online web browsing tabs because when I'm writing research papers my current laptop gets bogged down really easily. I'm a junior in college, so I am looking for a laptop that could also double for mundane business operations when I get out of college. Thank you for the help!"

Difficulty hiring new support engineers has made the support manager more and more strict about how long support engineers have to stay. Department I’m aiming for seems to think of support engineers as IT.

I started not quite a year ago at an entry level position (support engineer) for a company that’s involved in hardware and software, as a recent CS grad. I’m in a satellite office away from most of the rest of my department but right in with the firmware engineers, which is fine by me, as I had hoped to get into a more code focused position at some point. I like or at least used to like the work, as I’d go from helping an end customer with a C# or JS issue with integrating a product down to hardware / discrete signal issues, and a lot of my customer-facing work is working with integration engineers, software engineers, and mechanical engineers at companies integrating our product into their application. Although recently I’ve been feeling more and more like I want to move on.

One issue is that while support engineers do get promoted into other departments, the story I heard to start was that folks moved on to other positions when they were ready, and that was often around 12-18 months. Recently I got pulled into my boss’ boss’ office to get a talk about how the requirement/expectation is two years, which is not only longer than expected but also rather stricter. 

A while after, I reached out to my direct boss to mention my plans to look int a firmware engineer position open in my local office, and they warned me that a someone a few steps up from my boss’ boss had gone to heads of several departments to ask them not to hire support engineers from the support dept into their departments until they had put their two years in and said if I did try to take a promotion, boss’ boss would try to put up a fight (a very demotivating conversation).

I had an informational interview with the person doing the firmware engineer hiring, which didn’t lead anywhere, as they had an intern in the final stages anyway. Shortly after, I overheard a different manager in firmware talking about how low the bar of entry for tech support is. Before then, a few different folks in firmware had encouraged me to talk to the manager with the opening, so there’s that at least. On the other hand, I've also gotten things like talking with someone in documentation about plans to try to get into firmware development, and he said I would have to have a CS degree for that, and it got awkward when I said I already did.

Recently I’ve been trying to figure out if I should start looking now or take advantage of the tuition reimbursement to do some additional coursework focused on embedded systems and firmware development. On one hand, most of the culture at the company is quite good, and I like most folks in my office. If I stay while doing embedded firmware coursework, it’s possible another position in the department I want is likely to open up or I would just plain be better positioned to take on a dev job elsewhere. On the other hand, maybe I’m just wasting time doing not-development when I could be in some sort of development position elsewhere.

I'm looking to apply for transfer for Summer 2019, but I literally just got offered a summer CS internship from a pretty big corporation that lasts from just after memorial day to early August. It's in ATL, but I'll be working M-F from around 8-4/9-5.  so I was wondering if there are any late night classes offered or if there are any online classes I can take over the summer to satisfy being a student over the summer, or if I should just apply for fall 2019 and skip on the summer semester :( . I've emailed a transfer advisor but I would like to hear from other students as well if this is viable if I am admitted for the summer semester."

After the first year I have the opportunity (actually, it is mandatory right now) to spend a period of research abroad in a foreign University. Since I have been in US to do an internship also during my Master's degree, I am planning to search something there.

&amp;#x200B;

Starting from the fact that the field of study influences mostly the choice and the location, I would like to know from someone's previous experience how it is hard to contact an US based professor and how it is likely to be accepted as visiting researcher. I am sure I am not the first that plans to go from a foreign university to a US university. I would like to understand if there is a concrete possibility to do so or it is hard for a PhD student coming from outside.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm specifically interested in going to Us because for the field of quantitative  finance there are always challenging opportunity.  Let me know your experiences."

I am reapplying to a top 30 program in Computer Science where i failed out because I didn't meet the core courses GPA requirement, I was given probation numerous times and then asked to retake a core class and get a B+ or higher; I fell a few points short on the final and ended with a B so I was removed from the program. This was in May 2017, I applied again for Fall 2018 but was rejected, I'm currently doing my application for Spring 2019 semester. Also applying to it's sister school that will allow me to transfer my credits (18-21 credits).

What's the best way to tackle the Statement of Purpose essay? There's also another optional essay to explain why I'm now a better candidate than my previous application.

I have been working at a startup as a contract developer for 6 months, now moving to a full time role at a big government organization as a software engineer. I also have a 6 month internship on my resume, a 1 month fellowship, a few projects (some ongoing). My GPA was 2.86, undergrad was 3.2 and major GPA was around 3.35, GRE is 156/158/4.0. I have recommendations from a professor at this school, a professor from my fellowship and a manager from the internship. What do you think my chances would be? I think it hinges on my essays but I'm struggling on how to exactly word my improvement and not seem desperate as well. 

Hope some of you can help me out :)"

I'm asking this a year in advance while I am working towards gathering documents and gaining necessary experience for my future summer job and apprenticeship next year as a web dev, I already have a letter of reccomandation from my internship this summer.
About me:
I'm entering my second year of a 5 year course (french baccalaureate+5) to hopefully be a machine learning engineer/data scientist at the end.
So far I've learnt a lot to do with web development through the course and the internship (SQL/php/javascript/merise/UML/symfony4/nodeJS....)

I have read that my first salary is important as it would define my future salaries, would my salary as a machine learning engineer be based off my web dev salary?
To make it clearer:
I'm entering a 2nd year and planning on having an apprenticeship (where the company pays tuition)
If the salary of my first job won't affect that of my dream job, I don't feel like I should negotiate at all.
Points that might affect the negotiation:
University teaches afternoons so I only have mornings available, I have yet to ask them how flexible they are about this."

I've been trying to find an entry position as a financial planner, financial analyst, or investment analyst. My situation is as such: I studied law in Europe for several years, but ended up transferring to business administration which i graduated from at 28 with a decent gpa (above 3.6). I had one 3 month internship in a finance department but acquired no relevant experience.

I spent a bit over a year searching for a related job in a fruitless market (in spain), and now im 30. I've since expanded my search to include the US as well, but so far no luck.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm guessing the issue is my age coupled with my lack of experience... So my questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1) What can I do to increase my chances of landing one of these positions? (I still take online courses on edx and such to keep improving my knowledge, but I cant really convey that on my CV. I've also been thinking about going for the CFP but it might be a bit much for entry level or to ""test the waters"" as a planner only)

&amp;#x200B;

2) Am I going about it the wrong way? As in, am I being naive hoping for an entry level position for these, or would it be more realistic/ recommended to start somewhere else and move into those? I know at least in Spain my colleagues jumped straight in, but I dont know how it is in the US. If you recommended something else, what would it be?

&amp;#x200B;

3) What are good places to look for such positions? I've been using LinkedIn, Indeed and glassdoor, though I feel there must be better ways to identify promising companies or openings.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be greatly appreciated."
9j6vqg,1,2018-09-26,Former Employer (Government of Canada) Claims I Owe Them Money,govcanadahelp,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9j6vqg/former_employer_government_of_canada_claims_i_owe/,"Hi r/legaladvice,

I'm scared and need advice, so I am using a throwaway. 

**Backstory:** I graduated in May with an engineering bachelors degree. During my final year in school I worked at the Federal Government of Canada (Canada Border Services Agency, specifically) as an intern. I was making around $20/hour. I was employed from late October/early November 2017 to the beginning of March 2018. I was hoping they would offer me a full time position, but they didn't, so I took the best offer I had at the time and went to work for a new, private employer. I thought that was the end of it. Flash forward to today, and I get an email from one of the staffers in the CBSA's compensation department (sent to my personal email) stating that I owe them $2,379.10 due to overpayment.

&amp;#x200B;

I have copied the full text of the email below:

 

&gt;Hello \[FIRST NAME\],  
&gt;  
&gt;I have completed an audit on your account and issued any payments owed to you. There is still an outstanding overpayment in the amount of $2,379.10 (net) that will need to be paid back. The overpayment is due to Leave Without Pay (LWOP) being entered on your timesheets for the period of December 14, 2017 to January 9, 2018 which was never recovered. You were also paid after your termination date for the period of March 3 to 21, 2018 which is also included in the outstanding overpayment.  
&gt;  
&gt;In order to repay this overpayment, you will need to send a personal cheque made out to the Receiver General Of Canada for the amount of $2,379.10. Please send the cheque to the following address to the attention of my Supervisor \[SUPERVISOR FULL NAME\]:   
&gt;  
&gt;Canada Border Services Agency  
&gt;  
&gt;Place Vanier Tower B  
&gt;  
&gt;355 North River Rd, 12th Floor  
&gt;  
&gt;Ottawa, ON K1A 0L8  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have any other questions or concerns please email [CBSA-ASFC\_HQ\_Pay\_and\_benefits/remuneration@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca](mailto:CBSA-ASFC_HQ_Pay_and_benefits/remuneration@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) &lt;[mailto:CBSA-ASFC\_HQ\_Pay\_and\_benefits/remuneration@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca](mailto:CBSA-ASFC_HQ_Pay_and_benefits/remuneration@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca)\&gt; .

&amp;#x200B;

For those who aren't aware, Canada's government has a federal payment system called Phoenix. It's trash and makes mistakes constantly. It's a nation-wide scandal and if you want to know more, read this article (Globe &amp; Mail) [Phoenix Issues](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-phoenix-pay-system-problems-on-track-to-cost-government-22-billion/).

&amp;#x200B;

I never caught this issue because I always filled out my time sheets properly and on time (as seen in their email). It was not my mistake that caused this. Their email provided no proof beyond what I posted above. I definitely cannot repay this amount. I am living independently for the first time and my monthly cash flow leaves me with razor thin margins. My current salary is $55,000 (gross). I have monthly rent payments ($1450, freaking expensive here), monthly student loan payments ($350) and the regular expenses of daily life. I only save around $200 a month as I support my SO as well, who is still in school and not working. We've been together for years and are engaged, planning to marry in spring 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

I am at a loss at what to do. I'm freaking out because I have basically $5000 to my name in my bank account and something like this will basically sink me. Resorting to family help is not possible because of personal issues (and they are not in a position to drop this much money either). The government doesn't allow for repayment in installments, from what I've read. Help?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Poor student with only $5000 gets an email from Gov. of Canada, former employer, months down the line after finding a new job that he owes $2379.10. Can't pay it back and doesn't know what to do."

&amp;nbsp;

**$Selben:** Me! “Technical Team Lead” previously Tier II ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company with a very skeleton-crew helpdesk. There were 10 of us total providing 24-hour coverage (not including supervisors) for 2500+ people company-wide.

**$Snickers:** My cubicle mate, also a “Technical Team Lead.”

**$BadIntern:** Intern2, still in college - got in due to a mistake. Previously called $Baddi, but name changed for clarification.

&amp;nbsp;

*Some of you may recognize parts of this tale, and that would be because it is an unplanned continuation of “The Goodi the Baddi and the Nauti.” Additional information was recently provided while reminiscing with ~~$Snickers~~ an unconfirmed source.*

&amp;nbsp;

$Snickers was checking his email and going through the normal office memos (meeting tomorrow, the ketchup needs to be refilled in the breakroom, a reminder to not take lunch meeting food with someone else’s name on it, set up a conference room next week for a video conference, etc), when $BadIntern returned to their shared cubicle. Having been missing at least an hour, $BadIntern tried to creep in, but $Snickers could see his reflection on his monitor. As $Snickers turned in his chair towards him, $BadIntern quickly put his hands in his unprofessionally baggy pants pockets, acting like he’d been there the entire time. $Snickers patience had begun to severely wear thin several days ago, when $BadIntern was re-assigned to his cubicle after repeatedly telling a female co-worker how nice she smelled (and other uncomfortable things).

&amp;nbsp;                       

&gt; $Snickers: Please, whatever you’re doing, just stop. Sit down.

$BadIntern thunked down into his chair.

&amp;nbsp;

$Snickers returned to his work. Within a few seconds, $BadIntern was playing with a wireless mouse. With a crack and a pop, a piece of plastic mouse shrapnel hit $Snickers in the back of his head. He spun around.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; $Snickers: STOP doing that!

$BadIntern had a look of confusion and shrugged. $Snickers rolled his eyes and glared.

&gt; $BadIntern: Huh?

&gt; $Snickers: Just… Stop…

This is where $Selben, temporarily in a cubicle nearby, observed $BadIntern choosing to do what any rational person would do in that situation, and threw the broken mouse over the cubicle wall. Fortunately, no other victims were hit.

A few days later, $Snickers was working and heard $BadIntern plop down in the chair behind him several hours later than normal. His heightened sense of smell insisted he inspect the situation as opposed to ignoring $BadIntern as much as possible. He slowly turned to see $BadIntern attempting to secretly eat a hoagie—the hoagie was half hiding in his sleeve—he froze upon being spotted. $Snicker’s stomach rumbled in response, but he ignored it and turned back to continue working. After a few minutes his senses were again hit with a similar, yet different overwhelming smell, and turned to see $BadIntern eating another hoagie, from his other shirt sleeve. $Snickers noted this one had bell peppers and onions and was definitely a different sandwich. Before he could begin his questioning, he was distracted by a call.

By the time the call was over (a branch lost email access…their internet was down), $BadIntern had disappeared yet again, leaving $Snickers slightly confused and a bit suspicious.

&amp;nbsp;

The next day $Snickers was on a break and chatting with $Selben while $BadIntern had been shuffled off to “work” with $Selben. He was playing with some ~~tweezers~~ zip ties and kept getting his fingers stuck. Suddenly $BadIntern looked up at what $Selben was doing and shouted out like a young child.

&gt; $BadIntern: OOOH! You’re playing video games at work! They said you can’t do that!

$Snickers paused and looked around. $Selben clearly had work on his machine. He had a website minimized with information about a game, but not an actual game. $Selben explained you can browse the web during your breaks if it is in moderation and work safe. $BadIntern seemed a bit perplexed by this but slowly nodded after pondering it over for several moments.

&amp;nbsp;

Soon after, $Snickers was nominated to train the interns on a new process he had created. He was only able to locate two of them, with $BadIntern missing again. After a brief search he gave up. Rather than crowd everyone into his two-man cubicle, he opted to take the interns into a conference room. They entered the darkened room and flipped on the lights. With a loud bang, $BadIntern jerked up and hit his head on the table he had been, apparently, asleep under.

&gt; $Snickers: Were you sleeping in…

$BadIntern ran out of the room.

$Snickers looked under the table and found a blanket, a cell phone and a small pile of crumbled sandwich wrappers. After a more careful inspection he saw different names on the wrappers and recognized many of them as people from different parts of the office.

It was explained to $BadIntern that the “free sandwiches” that he had “found” were not, in fact, for him. He was reprimanded, and food for staff meetings seemed to go missing less often. $BadIntern was caught napping in the conference rooms several more times and was warned he would lose his internship if he kept it up. He seemed to stop but would still randomly disappear at times.

A few weeks after his internship ended (which he did complete), a janitor made the discovery of “the nest” in a broom closet. He found the exact same blanket from the conference room and a large collection of snack wrappers. Fortunately, it didn’t look like it had been used recently.

$Selben looked over at $Snickers, who was starting to turn red with anger, when they heard the news.

&gt; $Selben: It’s okay, he’s gone now. Breathe."

One job is two days a week at a food manufacturer and I hate that place, but the place I'm at three days a week is a local MSP (Managed service provider) about 5 minutes from my house that I love working at. I started at the MSP about a little over a year ago as an intern making $10 an hour. Around February I was offered a non related IT job for $14.00hr. Only working about 20hrs a week at the MSP I used that offer to ask for full time work at the MSP. The MSP didn't give me full time but they did match the pay and got me another part time job at the food manufacturer for the same pay. So currently I work about 42hrs a week between the two places making 14hr at both. 

I've been dying to work at a single place for a couple months now, I'm tired of having to split my time between two places. I really love the work I get to do at the MSP and I enjoy the people I work with so I would love to get full time employment there. I just feel like I haven't been offered such things because I haven't really asked them for it since February. So Monday I got said I've had enough of working at two places and started submitting my resume to a few jobs in my area. Less then 8 hours later I got a call from another job I submitted my resume to telling me they would like to schedule an interview next week. This job is pretty much covers the same duties that I do now but is offering between $20-22/hr compared to the $14hr i make now. If they offer me the job should I use that as leverage to try to get my MSP job to match their offer? Or is it a bad idea to try to use another job offer to leverage better pay twice in the same year? I'm prepared to take the new job if needed, but I would really love to get hired full time at the MSP as I enjoy how much I get to do there, the people I work with and how much I learn on a regular basis. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!

Edit: I should have mentioned that my in the past my supervisor did mention to me that if I ever received other job offers to inform them so they can evaluate the offer and see what they can do for me regarding possibly matching such an offer. Not sure if this is common practice or not but I figured I should include that detail. 

TLDR; Possibly getting offered an IT job with better pay. I really like my current job but could really use the increased pay. Should I use this as leverage to get full time work and better pay at my current job?"

I am just wondering if anybody has landed Freshmen/sophomore internship? (like summer after 1st/2nd year of your program)

If you have, would you mind sharing what did you add on your resume?

I am thinking of applying around but in fact, I realize I only can present few side projects that I did to understand some concepts in cs.. and don’t even have any GPA to show yet either..

I do have some club activities that I am participating but I don’t assume that’s enough..

What would be factors that the companies are expecting/looking for potential freshmen/sophomore interns?

I don't get it? Are these ""years of experience"" supposed to count for just using the language in school as well? If not, why the hell would I have 3+ years experience and be applying to entry level positions? Do you just check yes for all these questions? The sheer amount of ""requirements"" for new grad positions is frustrating. I know they're wishlists, but I've actually had companies ask me if I have all these requirements over a phone interview, and immediately lose interest when I say ""no, I don't have 3+ years of experience working with objective-C and .NET as a college student"" (don't remember the company name, it was some construction company posted on Indeed).

I see things like ""have 2+ years experience working with X, Y, Z machine learning algorithms and developing models"" for an entry level data analytics position, or a startup I've never heard of requiring ""2+ internships with prestigious companies, such as Google or Amazon"", or similar. These aren't exaggerations either.

Believe me. I want perspective on my ""supervisor's"" actions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Double caveat: this is a student-run college org that pays minimally; everyone unless specifically stated otherwise is an undergrad student

&amp;#x200B;

So I worked one job where the work environment was toxic. The general manager (who is my ""supervisor"", but since this is a STUDENT led org, she didn't do much) didn't follow her own rules, gossiped like mad, cursed and made slurs loudly in our paper-thin cubicles, and never had a positive word about any other employees, but only when they weren't present. That aside, they expected mandatory work outside of our paid hours. I had to leave, but didn't know an exit. Then an internship I applied to MONTHS ago finally got back to me and I got the job!! Pays significantly better and the work environment...well, anything was better than where I was. However, I had to start that week as they needed someone ASAP (they had a website overhaul, which is related to my position there). 

&amp;#x200B;

I wrote a formal, polite resignation letter, explaining why I had to leave (only mentioned my new job and the start date, not the terrible work environment), that I would finish out my tasks, and gave one week's notice as I had to start my new job ASAP (this is not ideal, everyone deserves at least three week's notice). I did not offer to train anyone as I just wanted out, people (again, should have offered, but I did not want to stick around...that and they wouldn't pay me for training). I would also finish my hours for the week, but not attend the staff meeting (again, no pay, and it's for weekly catch-ups only, I didn't want to create drama). I sent this to the faculty member in charge of the org. 

&amp;#x200B;

Triple rainbow round caveat: My NORMAL resignation letter (only had to write it once): apology, reason for leaving, three weeks notice, offer to train new people or help with filling my position, highlight what I've learned from the company, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then I get an email from the gen manager and she wants to set up a meeting. Come meeting and she doesn't let me speak. She begins by asking if I knew she was my supervisor. Then it devolves into her telling me I'm rude and disrespectful for not emailing it directly to her (I really did think faculty handled this kind of thing...I did apologize, but she cut me off and said, ""Yeah, no."") I was ""abandoning my team"", ""jumping ship"", and ""burning bridges"" by leaving. She then said I must be a terrible employee because to her ""as a supervisor"" I seemed to just skip around from job to job and I should have negotiated a different starting time with my new job. I just sat there. She finally gives me a chance to speak and I'm so stunned. I explained that this super-rigid start date was abnormal for me, but she says as an employer it just makes me look disrespectful. I even offered to do training, but she says that since I didn't communicate that at the beginning, I clearly didn't care (and she's not wrong). Then she makes me move around my new job schedule to attend the last staff meeting. And guess what?

&amp;#x200B;

She wants me to ""apologize for abandoning my team"" at the staff meeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do....do I have to do that? I am not doing that. And she removed me from the office group chat, so who knows what they're saying in there. She did ask everyone else in the office about me, so who knows. And these idiots are not going on my resume or references, lol, they never were on there. 

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT DO I DO? How do I handle this? I just feel like screaming. "

Extra info:
I asked for a title change at my current company, but it was denied because they don’t believe in senior titles for IC roles.  

I asked for feedback in areas where I can improve. However, my manager could not think of anything for me to improve upon at my last review.  

I directly stated my desire to advance to my boss and my boss’ boss. I report to both of them.   

I go above and beyond in my current job. I manage interns, mentor new employees, lead meetings, initiate extra projects, and volunteer for extra work.

I always like to plan for the future as well as is gives me good goals to work towards. I’ve always wanted to move out west (Colorado, Cali, that general area) which I’m sure is extremely common with CS majors. I’ve grown up in Indiana all my life and have been craving any chance at a new start and scenery. However at this moment it seems like I’ll end up moving to Michigan and I wanted to know what the scene for computer science majors is there. What big companies are there, general salaries, opportunities to grow and such. I love Michigan but I’m scared it’s work scene may be the same as Indiana which I hear isn’t the best (besides the rare cases of Eli Lilly’s and such). I’d love to hear everyone’s opinion, especially if you live in said areas. Thank anyone and everyone to any information given!"

I need outside voices basically.

So basic run down, I am in my late 20's.  First time college did not work out as planned and well going back into it again.  I am going back to Community college as in TN once you are a resident for a year and pay taxes, you can get your AS for free.  Now I have two options.

The community college offers three A.A.S programs in programming, networking and cyber security.  Each program will prepare you for the workforce and helps you get an internship on the second year.  

Now that sounds great and really appeals to me seems like I can get into the work force and work my way up easily after that.  I know some people in the industry don't even have a CS degree but doesn't mean its not useful to progress in the field.  Which means I would have to go for a CS but only handful of classes transfer towards that 4 year degree.  I would have to get my AS towards a CS degree, but I would already be in the work force. 

Or option #2 I can just get my AS for free and transfer to finish my CS, but there is no internship assistance. 

I know it looks like basically do I want to pay for 4 years of school (with the two free years already done) with option 1 but be in the work force already, or pay 2 years only with option #2 but bit harder to get into the workforce.

But in reality what really is making this a hard decision is my age, if I go with option 1, I can get into the work force earlier and work towards a CS on my own time.  And by going with option 2, I finish 2 (maybe less) years earlier but I would be older and I feel my age may hold me back on getting interviews.  

Am I making the internship aspect more important then it is?

edit - Forgot to ask, if you were to choose an AAS, would you go with programming, networking or cyber security?  I was looking at the networking. (I know answers with differ but I am just curious and why you would choose it)"
9jdd8j,1,2018-09-27,"Two Job Offers- Should I take a high-paying Contract Specialist job at a large healthcare company, or a low-paying entry-level ""Growth Hacking""/digital marketing position at a startup?",FreelyFlourish,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9jdd8j/two_job_offers_should_i_take_a_highpaying/,"Thank you for clicking into my thread- I am feeling very split and nervous right now, and feel like the decision I make right now is going to be extremely pivotal in the direction my life takes. I spent a decade working in food and beverage. Then I found my way into a call center/ inside sales position, where I have been for 6 months making 30k with a 10k potential bonus every year. I now have two job offers, both expecting me to start on the same day.

&amp;#x200B;

# About Me:

I have put in my 2-week notice, but am not sure which to take. I am a 26 year old male, I live with my girlfriend in a med-high cost of living city. I feel so burned out doing the work that I currently do, hence why I searched for other positions. Other than food and beverage experience, I only have 6 months of inside sales experience (barring psychology research work I did for previous professors). My ideal area of work would be in healthcare, but in the realm of functional/holistic/lifestyle medicine. Perhaps being a thought-leader, or working for a clinic in some way that works from this paradigm. I love travelling, backpacking, being out in nature, and optimizing my health in all ways.

&amp;#x200B;

# Contract Specialist Position:

The pay at the contract specialist job is more money that I thought I'd be given the chance to make with my level of experience, at 55k/year base (I grew up lower-class, went to a cheap college and got a Psych/Neuroscience bachelor's degree). The work sounds mundane, I would need to commute into the heart of the city and take a shuttle over to my building, and there would be no creative process involved in the work- from what it sounds. The money is a huge appeal, and I really leveraged inside-sales experience and nailed the interview to be granted the position. I don't really see this as an enjoyable career path, nor a job that I can leverage to go and work in an area I enjoy- but I could be wrong. Are there good career paths for someone who works as a contract specialist? My partner would prefer I pick this job, I believe, as time and balancing responsibilities in the household is an issue for us.

&amp;#x200B;

# Start-Up Growth Hacking/Digital Marketing Position:

The start-up company is small; I'd be about the 8th employee in-state. I would report to the office (down the street from my house) a few days a week, and work remote the other days. The caveat is the pay is low, especially initially. I have to undergo a 4 month (maybe longer) internship period, where I have to work 40 hours a week at $2,000/month. I will also have to complete 8-15 extra hours of consulting work (given to me by the marketing manager for other businesses), for an extra $1000 a month, for the duration of the internship to supplement my income. So $3,000 a month, on a 1099, working about \~50 hours a week. After the internship period, if I do well, I would be hired on with a W2 and payed $45,000 a year, working a normal 40 hours per week with some remote days and ""unlimited vacation policy"". I had to do 3 ""test-projects"" for the start-up before they would hire me on as an intern- of which they loved my work. I enjoyed doing it, to a degree. The area they work in isn't perfectly in-line with my interests.

&amp;#x200B;

# Noteworthy pieces of the puzzle:

I enjoy writing, and there is a certain charm to digital marketing (I disdain the title ""growth hacker""). I would have a creative outlet, but I struggle enough as is commuting downtown to my inside-sales job, shuttling to work, and coming home in all the traffic to go to the gym and attempt to cook dinner. A lot of times, dinner-cooking falls on the part of my partner- among other responsibilities, which puts a strain on our relationship. The experience of the digital marketing job would be great, because I could work as a social media manager or something for a functional medicine clinic down the road after a year or two at this company (My ideal area of work is healthcare, but functional/holistic/lifestyle medicine)- but the initial time commitment and low pay could hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a lot, and I am deeply thankful for anyone who has taken the time to read this. I feel the trajectory of my life could, to a small degree, be hinged upon this decision. Any input here is appreciated. If you would like more details, I am happy to provide these.

Thank you!"
9jdkye,4,2018-09-27,Complete 180 changing major?,haiyleel,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9jdkye/complete_180_changing_major/,"Hi everyone, I’m in need of some advice. Right now I’m a junior in college and have 81 credits towards an Accounting Major. Accounting is something that comes decently easy to me as I’m good at math; it’s like putting a puzzle together. I know I could do this as a career and it’s a very realistic in the sense that accountants are needed everywhere. I get good grades and don’t really struggle that much, even at 300 level classes. 

My issue is, I hate every component of Business school that ISN’T accounting. I’m stuck taking marketing, management, statistics, and finance this semester (along with one acc class) and I fucking hate them all. I feel like they’re a waste of my time. And I know they’re literally required for me to graduate with a bachelors in business administration, but shit I’m not happy at all. I feel like I’m wasting my good energy on the bullshit projects they keep giving me that don’t pertain to my major at all. After this semester it’s mostly just accounting classes but I’m finding it harder to push through with no motivation. I’m also going through a major depressive state and that doesn’t help with motivation at all. I see people in business school around me getting internships and doing student organizations and everything but I don’t do any of that stuff because I don’t know if that’s really what I want out of life. I’m also not a people person and going to any organized activity makes me a die a little inside and I refuse to do it. But people keep telling me I need to to make my resume look better. Again, no motivation.

I’m to the point where even though I’m almost done with my major, I kind of wanna switch to something else; something that will fulfill me in terms of interest. And it sucks because if i wanna switch what I would want to switch to would be Physics/Astronomy, a complete 180 from business school. Physics and astronomy are things that capture my full interest. I took 2 astronomy classes for general education my freshman year and loved them so much more than any other class I’ve ever taken. But I know if I wanted to do that, I would more than likely need to go to grad school. I don’t want to teach anything, ever, and that’s what many people do with a degree in physics/astronomy. I want to do legit research, but I know the job market for that is not the best if you don’t have like a PHD. 

So I’m stuck; im scared to switch because I’ve put a lot of time and money into this accounting major, that is more realistic. I guess you could say doing something in physics or astronomy is more my “dream” as i’ve always wanted to be an astronaut (even thought that’s also very unrealistic, NASA takes like less than 10 out of 1300 people training to be astronauts a year). But I’m honestly scared to chase it because I know for a fact that physics would be a way more hard and intense degree than accounting. I could do this switch and start to fail and it would have all been for nothing. I also have very low self esteem and self confidence so making a leap like that is very hard for me to even contemplate, but people around me always tell me I should follow my dreams and do what makes me happy. 

Also, I was thinking, though it doesn’t really make sense, what if I double majored? I like school, it’s one of the few things in life that comes easy to me. It just sucks because I kind of want a masters in accounting as well. I like going to school, but I don’t wanna do this for like 8 more years and I feel like that’s where I would be headed if I decided this. I don’t know. I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. I want to challenge myself but I also don’t want ruin my life or other opportunities. 

If someone could give me advice that would be great, I’m too scared to talk to my friends and family about this. My family kind of pays for my college and I don’t want them to think their money is going to waste. And my friends don’t really help they just say “do what makes you happy” but I don’t even know what does anymore. "

When I was recruiting, there didn't seem to be any way to receive individual career coaching unless you were at a target school. I'd like to change that and offer mock interviews, resume reviews and career guidance catering to your specific circumstances. Everyone's story is different and presenting yourself in the right manner can completely alter the course of your career.

One job is two days a week at a food manufacturer and I hate that place, but the place I'm at three days a week is a local MSP about 5 minutes from my house that I love working at. I started at the MSP about a little over a year ago as an intern making $10 an hour. Around February I was offered a non related IT job for $14.00hr. Only working about 20hrs a week at the MSP I used that offer to ask for full time work at the MSP. The MSP didn't give me full time but they did match the pay and got me another part time job at the food manufacturer for the same pay. So currently I work about 42hrs a week between the two places making 14hr at both.

I've been dying to work at a single place for a couple months now, I'm tired of having to split my time between two places. I really love the work I get to do at the MSP and I enjoy the people I work with so I would love to get full time employment there. I just feel like I haven't been offered such things because I haven't really asked them for it since February. So Monday I got said I've had enough of working at two places and started submitting my resume to a few jobs in my area. Less then 8 hours later I got a call from another job I submitted my resume to telling me they would like to schedule an interview next week. This job is pretty much covers the same duties that I do now but is offering between $20-22/hr compared to the $14hr i make now. If they offer me the job should I use that as leverage to try to get my MSP job to match their offer? Or is it a bad idea to try to use another job offer to leverage better pay twice in the same year? I'm prepared to take the new job if needed, but I would really love to get hired full time at the MSP as I enjoy how much I get to do there, the people I work with and how much I learn on a regular basis. Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks!

Edit: I should also note that the new job would be about a 35min-45min drive one way compared to my current job which is about 4 minutes from my house.

Edit 2: I should have mentioned that my in the past my supervisor did mention to me that if I ever received other job offers to inform them so they can evaluate the offer and see what they can do for me regarding possibly matching such an offer. Not sure if this is common practice or not but I figured I should include that detail.

TLDR; Possibly getting offered an IT job with better pay. I really like my current job but could really use the increased pay. Should I use this as leverage to get full time work and better pay at my current job?"

1. Is this too much for a transfer during this first quarter?
FRS 003 041 - First-Year Seminar
MAT 021C A03 - Calculus- Dr. Tavernetti
MAT 022A 001 - Linear Algebra- Dr. Moore
MAT 022AL 002 - Linear Algebra Comp Lab
WLD 923 001 - Wkload - Math Co 21C
POL 108 002 - Public Sector Policy- Dr. Hosek
POL 124 001 - Pol Global Ineq- Dr. Kono

2. What's the difference between Stewart's and Thomas' (UC Davis) Calculus: Early Transcendentals and is it easy to adapt to this book and 21C since I took Calculus I and II at community college? Does it also help that this is technically the second time I'm taking 21C since I took Math 53 (a combined 21C and 21D class) at UC Berkeley over the summer but didn't pass?
For Stewart, I found difficulty in it when I took Calculus I and II in community college since there was less examples and more problems which sometimes didn't have examples to refer to.

3. Planning to double major in political science and economics. Wondering about advising, only met Political Science advisors at Orientation. Do we need to contact the College of Letters and Science advisor first or will they contact us for the mandatory advising appointment?

4. Could it just be the flu or is it actually the classes or both of them that is making me more worrying and stressed lately?

5. Trying to prevent any disqualification and probation the entire time here, is it doable?

6. Planning to graduate on in 2 years since I only went to community college last year, doable? Would I need to 
stay here another year for more upper-division Math classes needed for grad school or can I take them in grad school?

7. Would I need either internship or research experience for grad school?

8. Is it okay if I just make classes my priority and extracurricular activities as something to think for later? Not currently interested in anything but getting through the rest of my time at the university. Does EOP count as an extracurricular as it's something I'm part of and I can sometimes get good support from it?

9. First homework (not collected) assignment from Dr. Tavernetti's Math 21C's class:
The tag  (as needed)  means I expect you can do them all. Do the odd problems, do the even problems, do every other odd, whatever you feel you need.
Problems are from the 13th edition numbering:
Section 10.1: 1-90 (as needed). 91-97 (odd), 98, 101a, 104a, 107, 108, 111, 113, then 115 and 116 using formal proof. Make sure you can work through the proof of Theorem 5 -  the key sequences that converge. 
 Doable through the flu with co-class starting today? Don't have textbook yet, not good with Inclusive Access edition and just bought physical edition that would arrive by Saturday.

10. Not really feeling the mood to do more than school this quarter. Is it okay to come to classes and back and not do anything else? Feels like question 8 but could have different response.

11. Will adapting to the Davis environment get better in every way (physically, academically) eventually?"

I'm now kinda freaked out. What do I need to do to prepare for finding a job besides getting good grades? 

I know I should try to find internships, go to career fairs or do some projects but I have no idea how to start with them and pick one which is more doable for me as a starter. Like, where can you find some career fairs and what do your do at career fairs?

If you already find a job or an internship, what did you do to build your resume and which one do you think is the most important one? Where did you look for your job and how did you apply for it?

Another thing I am worrying about is that I am right now 3rd year computer engineering major.

I can't exercise as much as I used to because I am constantly so busy. All my school work is disinteresting to me and I really only care about my research project. My relationship with my friends and family is deteriorating rapidly because I spend so much time doing homework or working and also because it's soccer season so my parents are always at my siblings' games and I like never see them. On top of all of this I have college applications and I'm super paranoid that my GPA will collapse because I'm under so much stress right now. I keep skipping meals or dodging exercising to do the work I need. I basically talk to nobody all day. I can't remember the last time I had a real conversation with anyone except for my boyfriend/best friend. I just feel perpetually lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel really irresponsible and like I'm losing all self-control and I feel so paranoid about it. I keep having anxiety attacks and hyperventilating. I can't even manage most normal conversations without getting really sad afterwards.

I am not happy with my life, and something needs to change. My biggest issue is that I am absolutely clueless as to how to start making that change. I feel as though I succeed in every other aspect of life except for being an adult, and that's very unsettling to me. I'd like to think that I am a great friend, son, boyfriend, and human being in general, but when it comes to being a great adult I feel as though I'm failing.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to college for four years. I spent 2 years in general studies trying to figure out what I enjoy in life. I then completed two more years of schooling, but this time I had graduated with a dual major Bachelors degree. I studied computer engineering technology as well as electrical engineering technology. I feel as though these 4 years of my life were a waste! I hated, absolutely hated, computer engineering tech. I've come to realize that writing code is just not for me as it was one of the most miserable experiences of my school career. I didn't mind the electrical engineering aspect of my schooling, but I feel as though I am ill prepared to even attempt any form of electrical engineering in the workforce. I graduated in 2015 and with each day that passes I feel less and less confident in seeking a job in this field. Any potential employers would say, ""We like what we see in your resume, but can you show us any experience?"" Well no. No I can not. I did not participate in any internships while in school, and I've come to realize that I have metaphorically speaking, shot myself in the foot. I have grown to believe that I am more of a hands on learner than an academic learner. I have had a few people recommend that I should look into learning a trade, but as I mentioned above, I don't even know where to begin. I am afraid to waste even more time an money going to school for something that I hate. So I guess overall, my first goal is getting out of this miserable liquor store job and finding something that I'm passionate about. Unfortunately, the only thing I'm truly passionate about is music. However, you can't get a comfortable paying job in the music profession without being an exceptionally talented individual, which I am not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I need to get out of this house. I'm 25 years old, and I love my parents, but I don't want to live with them forever. I don't feel that it's possible to move out on my $250 per week liquor store pay. I need to become more independent and really begin my life. This bird needs to learn how to fly.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. Please help if possible. Thank you all in advance!"
9jhjg2,5,2018-09-27,I think I’m inspiring my mom to get diagnosed and it’s so bittersweet and heartbreaking. It all makes sense now.,ocean_gremlins,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/9jhjg2/i_think_im_inspiring_my_mom_to_get_diagnosed_and/,"My parents didn’t really believe in psychiatry. The last few months after realizing I have ADHD, I was really bitter about that because it felt like my life would’ve been easier if I got diagnosed a long time ago. But I finally told them about my diagnosis and at first the just laughed... and then I told them what it meant and what my symptoms were. I could see my mom starting to relate more and more. 

She told me she was struggling and depressed in college and she actually tried to get psychiatric help, but they just told her to exercise more. (Probably why she didn’t take me to a psychiatrist.) She would be finishing her internship work HOURS after everyone else left every day (she still works literally twice as much as anyone else in her position— she’s paid for part time but she works two extra days to catch up because she’s slow). She could never figure it out because she’s so smart, she tests so well, and yet she often ends up feeling like the slowest stupidest person in the room...

So now I’m seeing  her read dozens of articles about this and binge-watch every How To ADHD video. She’s learning that there are millions of people who have gone through the exact same thing and figured out strategies that help, while she’s been doing it the hard way for fifty years. I went through the same process a couple months ago, but I can’t imagine how much worse it is for her. 

And it makes sense why I’ve always thought I could will myself out of my symptoms by trying harder. Because she does. Not that her symptoms are managed, but she’s never stopped holding herself to the same standard as everyone else (if not higher). No wonder we’re so scared and stressed and guilty and proud of ourselves at the same time. 

I guess this is just a ramble. Anybody have a similar experience? Or parents you thought would never believe you and then they turned out to be supportive?"

Will this be different if 2000 other clients with varying internet speeds try to access that same server at the same time?

2. Does OS have a role in network speed on a same laptop? I have windows 7 or 10 which one is better for above scenario (if it'll make any difference at all)?

Here are my stats:

&amp;#x200B;

African American (1st generation Nigerian) 

3.69 unweighted GPA 4.13 weighted. 19th out of 474, top 4%.

1380 SAT, 700 r&amp;w, 680 math (will probably retake one more time and send in those scores if I score higher after I apply)

AP Classes:

9th: AP US History - 2 on exam

10th: AP US Gov - 3 on exam

11th: AP Stat - 3 on exam, AP Lang - 4 on exam. I also took a physics course at my community college over the summer and got an A

12th: Currently taking AP Lit, AP Chem. I'm also taking  AP Comp Sci A online because there's no teacher for it and AP Calc AB online because of scheduling conflicts. 

Will also receive the IB Certificate for completing HL IB Information Technology in a Global Society (ITGS) for both 11th and 12th grade.

On track to complete the Project Lead The Way program (an engineering program) at my school. I've taken several classes related to mechanical, electrical, and industrial engineering and computer science. These classes are Honors weighted (+.5)

Also took Foundations of Computer Science in 11th where I learned HTML and CSS.

My grades have been an upward curve; I started out with a few A's, mostly B's and one C ( :(( ) in 9th grade, a couple B's and rest A's in 10th, and all A's in 11th.

&amp;#x200B;

Extra Curriculars:

9th: Varsity Track and Field; Chorus

10th: Key Club (barely volunteered throughout high school); Worked at Subway for the summer

11th: Attended the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory STEM Academy where I learned coding languages Python and MATLAB; SeaPerch, here I assembled an underwater remote controlled vehicle and competed with it at the US Navy Academy; CyberPatriot, here I learned about cyber security and participated in security based competitions; National Honor Society; National English Honor Society; African Student Association (ASA); Played the keyboard for my church a few times.

12th: Will probably attain a computer science internships in the coming weeks; The Johns Hopkins thing but now I'm taking a circuits class; National Honor Society; Will most likely continue SeaPerch, CyberPatriot, and ASA depending my schedule

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say that my essay and short answers are very good. I consider myself to be a good writer when I have enough time and I have my English major cousin who will look over them.

I'll also use a recommendation from my one of my Johns Hopkins instructors. He's a professional engineer and can really speak about my character.

I think I've demonstrated a good amount of interest to UT as an OOS student since I visited the school this past summer, signed up for email and phone contact, and have spoken to a couple admissions people.

I am currently planning on applying to PhD programs in computational linguistics. (So, primarily linguistics departments that have this available as a concentration). I am currently in a master's program studying business analytics and will be graduating this upcoming spring. I have already cultivated good relationships with two of my professors in this program, and I have already asked them for a recommendation and both have thankfully agreed to write me a good letter.

However all the applications require 3 letters, and this is where I'm stuck. I don't really have a great relationship with any of the other professors I had last year. I'm developing some good relationships with professors I have this semester, but I know I can't ask them for a letter when they haven't known me for very long. So for my 3rd letter these are my options:

1. Professor for a marketing technology class. I have what feels like an awkward relationship with her so I don't feel comfortable asking, though she is the only other professor I've had in this program that I've actually talked to outside of class.
2. Professor for a database design class. This was an online class and I didn't really talk to him at all, however I did very well in the class.
3. One of my undergrad professors. I graduated with a BA in linguistics back in 2010, so it's a tall order to ask any of them to remember me and write me a letter. Also, I went to UC Santa Cruz, where professors provided written evaluations along with letter grades - so in essence I already have recommendations from these professors.
4. Last resort option - I did a summer internship as a business analyst at the headquarters of a major retailer. I had a very good relationship with my supervisor, however I don't think that he would really be a suitable person to ask for a PhD recommendation. Just adding him as a possible option.

Please help me decide, as the first deadlines for these programs are December 1 and I want to give them as much time as possible to write me a good letter. Thank you!!!"

I hope this is the appropriate place for a question like this. I'm a recent grad with a BA in psychology and a minor in CS. I realised fairly late in my time at university I wanted to do CS, and I only had space to finish a minor. Because I was committed to working in my lab and finishing a thesis I don't have any experience or internships under my belt, just a small project built in my own time. I've been spending time post grad trying to shore up my skills by practicing problems on various sites and working on projects, and I'm considering attending a boot camp in the bay area. Would a bootcamp increase my chances of being hired? Would it give me skills I didn't have time to pick up in my minor, or would it just be a rehash of what I've learned and a waste of my money? "

9jk7gu,2,2018-09-28,Staying in school for more internships vs Getting a full time job,cs2016student,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9jk7gu/staying_in_school_for_more_internships_vs_getting/,"As a student in a coop program, I've found that internships are an amazing opportunity to try out various different career paths before finally settling on one that you're comfortable to commit to as a full time job. While I understand that its perfectly normal and common for full time employees to switch jobs for career growth, I'd image it would be much more difficult to make these changes as frequently and without repercussions as interns.

The purpose of this post is to hopefully get the opinion of those in full time and those who are taking internships to weigh in:

Is it worth staying in school to take more internships before settling on a full time job?
(I'm thinking of staying around 6 1/2 years and doing 8-9 internships of 4 months each)

*[EDIT: Realistically will probably merge the last few into 2 8 month internships so something like 4x 4month internship and 2x 8 month internship for a total of 6 different internships]*

Some arguments I can think of against staying in school are as follows:

* opportunity cost of the job offers you turn down to take additional school term offset slightly by the pay from the internship that you'll take
* some just want to get out of school and start creating/contributing to something they believe in
* more tuition debt
* full time jobs are different than internships and a good experience as an intern in a particular environment might not translate to a good experience as a full time employee in that same environment (just my speculation here - please confirm/deny)
* some companies will raise an eyebrow at you for applying to your first full time job after being an undergraduate for 6 years (just my speculation here - please confirm/deny)
* some companies will not hire interns who have been in school for over 6 years (just my speculation here - please confirm/deny)

Some arguments for taking multiple extra internships: 

* get to better understand oneself and what type of career/life you want to live
* get to establish connections across a broader network through your extra internships
* by the time you graduate you'll have much more places to choose from if they all gave you return offers or at least you'll be able to get referrals (just my speculation here - please confirm/deny)

I'm  just about to finish my undergraduate degree in 2 months. I have lost all motivation. My life seemed all planned out. I'm not sure what exactly happened along the way.

I have medical school lined up right after I finish my degree, currently doing a paid internship at a big  IT company (Forbes Top 50 regarded Companies). Broke up with a loving girlfriend of 3 years.

Over the past few weeks I haven't gone to work, left without a notice, I couldn't deal with the pressure from college and work. Instead of focusing on finishing my degree, I just keep procrastinating. I feel sleepy all the time and cannot do anything. I'm starting to struggle with my degree, just passing everything. I just need to pass everything to get into medical school. My girlfriend couldn't deal with it, so she left.

I have spent hours and hours programming, ""improving myself"", constantly working to get where I am. In this process, I have lost all friends, most were too busy socialising and networking at the time.

I've started hating my passion of programming, I don't think I can handle any more programming, it feels like demeaning work. My other subjects all seem difficult and every time I try to catch up I just feel like giving up. I feel like I've blown my internship, no one has called me, I haven't received a word yet. I don't feel like waking up these days. There's nothing lined up for me.

Right now the only thing which I feel could make my life better is - if I got into med school and became a doctor. Even this idea seems to be slipping away. 

I regret not going to work, I regret not telling anyone about this. I regret spending so much time working - work which seems to have led to nothing. I regret not spending time with my friends or my girlfriend.

I feel like I've fucked up my life. I don't even know what the purpose of my life is anymore. There has been nothing that made me happy for months. Am I just a tool for society to function better? I don't know.

I keep wanting to dream in order to spend time with my friends from school and my girlfriend, I wish my life was simpler. I wish that I took my life a little easier, I wish I still lived with my parents. Maybe my life wouldn't suck.

My mind has been hazy for a while now, so please ignore grammatical errors etc. 

I know harming myself won't fix anything, I've attempted it once and decided never to do it again. =&gt;

Sleeping pills + Alcohol + cold beach. In the face of death I just laughed and realised that it was pointless, the things leading me to death were pointless.

But now I feel like life itself is pointless, so is death. Death right now sounds like a happier option.

Long story short:  
Should I still try med school? If so how can I motivate myself to study/do things I hate?

How do I deal with loneliness?

How should I deal with my internship?

How should I deal with wanting to have friends and my girlfriend?

How should I deal with suicidal thoughts?

How should I deal with the meaninglessness of life?

How should I fix my hazy mind?

Anything I may have missed due to my hazy mind?"

IB Student here,Monalreal,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/9jm13n/what_are_my_chances_of_getting_in_ib_student_here/,"Hey everyone, I'm thinking of applying to the University of Waterloo and was just wondering what my chances are of getting in. My predicted grades are 36/42 points or 38/45, as of right now. 

My End of year grades are 33/42; they are: 

Maths HL - 6 

Computer Science HL - 7

Economics HL - 6

Physics SL - 6 (Predicted 7)

English L&amp;L SL - 5

Spanish AB - 3 (Predicted 5)

I would want to major in Computer Science and am an international student (Indian). Would a scholarship be feasible with these grades? I don't mind paying the high fees though. My Ec's are decent with CS-related internships and other CS-related activities. Also, with what grades did you get accepted to Waterloo?
Thanks a lot!"

- Graduated college in May with CS degree a year early

- Because I was so young, opportunities were limited

- Interviewed for one particular FT job

- Got an offer... but it was for PT that's ""like an internship""

- Pay was $15/hr which was below the norm of $22/hr for 3 month interns in CS

- 40hr/week no benefits, no holiday pay


**Frist off...** After some advice, I come to the decision I want to work elsewhere. I've been here 5 months now and still an ""Intern."" They told me ""FT was in the works... its in progress... its just taking extra time sorry.... its happening just HR taking a while"" for the past 2 months. (no official offer, just being told this by a supervisor).



**Second...** I apparently learned that 40hrs a week gives me benefits legally. I'm not concerned about getting them, but seeing that I was given low pay at the start. Called an ""intern"" but did FT work normally, can't take a 30min break to eat lunch without losing money... this was a ""imagine my shock :|"" moment.


**So...** my peer told me ""yeah sounds like they are just taking advantage of you for cheap labor"". IDK if they are... Idk if they are maliciously saying ""yeah we can not pay him and save money! lets do it!"" or if they are just naïvely doing it because they think ""oh he's fine with it.""


Same peer told me: **""even if they aren't intentionally trying to use you as cheap labor, its not a good relationship. They should care about you as an employee. They should care enough to secure you as FT because you are qualified and not truly an intern. A good employer would offer FT because they know it benefits both you."" - agree?


---


**So, I've started applying to other jobs..** and am actually getting several calls back. If I'm lucky enough to get an offer, what's the best way to approach this situation? My current company has no idea that I'm applying and want out. I'm waiting to press them on FT big time until I get another offer. 


1) I doubt they will offer as much as someone else offering that I've interviewed with (if they do offer)


2) even if it matches it... I probably wont take it and will leave


What's the most professional way of doing it while being honest and straight forward without it biting me in the ass

The second position is a systems analyst position where you’ll be using “SQL and business accruement”  (I’m an MIS Major so I’ve taken a lot of business classes and I know some T-SQL from two database classes I’ve taken.) 

With that being said, will I be at a disadvantage if I apply to both positions to intern at? I would honestly be happy interning in either position especially at this certain company, but i don’t want to hurt my chances overall."

Over the last 4 months, I have sent out hundreds of applications. I had over 40 interviews some went better than others, spoke with more recruiters than I can count.

Feedback I get from interviews is not helpful at all. Most places say that they are really happy with me. Give me feedback along the lines of ""you clearly have the skills, good personality  and are eager to learn but we've already filled the position"". I got this sort of email from 5 or 6 companies. At everyplace that offered me an interview, I got through to the last stage meaning I'm clearly doing something right if first stage interviews are always successful. 

I'm essentially living below the poverty line, my saving are long gone and I'm staying alive off of selling personal belongings. I'm desperately trying to avoid relocation because I can't afford it and will live a miserable life. I have followed every tip I could find such as having a github repo with personal projects, learning new skills through online tutorials etc.

I am honestly defeated, I feel like giving up. I don't know what else I could possibly do. I will soon need some sort of a job which in turn will mean perusing career in CS and attending interviews will be almost impossible.

It really has a toll on me, mentally speaking. I find myself having constant stress and anxiety whenever something is going wrong when in school or at my internship. It doesnt help the fact that i continued with this second year of study when I was already considering switching to another study (European Studies) in my first year. I applied to that school and passed all the requirements for enrollment but in the end I didn't go through with it for a number of reasons:

1. I feel like this period of disappointments will go away so quitting now will be premature.
2. My mentor from my last years internship said I had it in me to become a teacher and I kinda feel obligated to continue so I dont dissapoint her.
3. I really like working with the kids, I just find it very hard to handle the parts of being an actual teacher (organizing a lesson, explaining certain things so they understand).
4. I feel like im exaggerating with how I see things. I feel like I cant handle dissapointments when they happen and when I continue with this study I will learn how to deal with them.
5. I have alot of self-consciousness, so I always think how people think about me (if that makes sense) so I dont usually go through with certain things I have doubts about.
6. I feel like my friends and family will judge me for being so indesicive. I already had troubles with deciding what is best for me during the time when I was applying for university. I feel like when I change my mind again it will affect my relations with the people I know and care about. And I know I shouldn't do that but I can't help myself.


There are also a number of things that stop me from continuing this course:

1. I have my moments where i REALLY wanna stop with my study but I always convince myself that it is only temporary and usually that feeling fades away when I'm home and feel safe.
2. I have this lingering thought in my head: what if I did switch studies? Would I have been happier right now?
3. I don't know if I have the skills to be teaching those kids. I find myself struggeling todo all the things an average lesson has to offer, organizing, being clearwhen explaining subjects, staying calm in my head and prevent all the thoughts in by mind from distracting me.
4. It doesn't help also that I really don't like my current mentor at my internship or the person who is supposed to help me with these kind of thoughts. I feel like my mentor is constantly judging me over my actions and doesn't like me. I try to impress him and do my best but from inside I always feel really... discouraged.
5. Mentally, I'm completely drained after just two months of school and I dont know if I can keep this up.
6. I sometimes feel like I owe it to myself to give myself a break and just quit. But I always think that im thinking to much about myself and the feeling fades away for some time until something bad happens again.
7. I feel unappreciated for my work sometimes. At school and at my internship.

When you're reading this please keep in mind that my mind is al over the place, I have trouble concentrating and I know that I said some things that may need further explanation or things I haven't mentioned at all, feel free to ask about those things so I can help you guys help me :)

I on a whim applied for an internship at a major tech company. I’m a computer science major with average grades at an average state school, so I really didn’t expect anything. My last year of school was rough, and felt I wasn’t smart enough for university and computer science. 

Well I got through the first round of interviews, then the next, and made it to the last round. I told myself I was proud that I made it as far as I did, and I’d be ok even if I was rejected. But I guess I really got too excited, and finally felt like I was doing ok at my dream. 

I got rejected, my recruiter sent me a polite email with no feedback, which I understand. I thought I’d be ok, but I just feel crushed. Working two minimum wage jobs and trying to support myself and sending money back to my family I really felt like this internship was my ticket onto better things. 

I feel like it was a fluke I even made it this far in the interview process, and have been faced with rejections from all other internships. I tried asking my friends for advice or help getting over it, but they all have good internships at top companies where they have relatives working, so they didn’t have any advice on rejections or the interview process. 

I feel bitter and miserable, I’ve been crying on and off for a few days. How do you move on from a rejection for a position you wound up putting so much hope on? I just started my junior year with no internship experience, and feel like I’ve thoroughly screwed myself by spending too much time trying to pay bills and not enough on finding smaller internships that were less competitive, so now I have no chance. I feel like I made a mistake pursuing this major, even if it is what I love. I feel like I’m just not good enough. 

How do I make the most of it, and how do I better take charge of the time I have left before I graduate college? "

With this client, they had students from universities work in the summer after a couple years.  Too often they got shiny, new laptops.  We also made a New Hire sheet with all the info for them to start here first, including how to change your password.  Every so often, a new hire or in this case, the Intern, came to me with how to change it.  So I pull my usual solution of getting a copy of the New Hire sheet and said
&gt;Well, on the New Hire sheet, it says here...

  

Next issue, and the main reason for the post, was at the end of the day, were I typically was the busiest trying to wrap things up (and users came to me with last minute issues knowing I was about to leave).  Intern came to me needing a network cable for the next room, a minor request, however I was dealing with a moderate networking issue of some kind and asked him to wait a couple minutes.  Rather than wait, he looked around my little office of a server room, spied a network cable that appeared to be available, and tried to take it.  However, that was for THE server and my presence there was the only thing that stopped him from disconnecting the main server.  Only person I recall needing to order out of the server room.  Yes, he did still get his cable.

  

Last IT related issue was that despite being an intern with a brand new laptop, he didn't take good care of it and in the 2 weeks he was there, it was stolen.  His replacement laptop was an older model, recently repaired.

  

Finally, he wasn't just brash with IT, and I could clearly tell that while some other interns, including his best friend there, would comeback for other internships or job offer, ""sadly"" BadIntern did not.

  

TL;DR Intern can't read New Hire sheet, nearly unplugs server due to impatience, loses new laptop.  Does not come back."

This is my second semester doing an online MSW Program. I will not mention any names nor the school I'm from.

Placement begins the second year. I was responsible for going out of my way and choosing the agency, schedule interviews and then report back to the university in order to coordinate my placement. It is already difficult being an online program so communicating back with staff and finding agencies was a nightmare. 

So I get placed at this agency, yay! At.....around the end of august. So.. as standard procedure there are HR things that need to be completed such as background checks, drug tests, and training in order to start interning and being around clients. I wont argue that, I understood the requirements in order to start. The training thankfully was all done online and worked well with my part-time school status. I mentioned this to my supervisor when we met for the first time and mentioned I was also taking another course. 

Fast forward to the training. This training was a lot of material. I get it, it is an agency devoted to helping clients with an assortment of mental health issues and I need to be competent. I was on board to do the training and even enjoyed doing some of them.  The more I would continue with the training, the more I noticed my start date would have to be pushed back. I reached out to the HR coordinator and they mentioned it was fine I was taking a little longer; that some people complete it in a week but to continue taking my time on it.  My supervisor was communicated on what HR said. So.. Start date was pushed back so I continued.. I would communicate with my supervisor and mentioned what was going on.. that the training was lengthy and I was trying to get it all done even with my part-time school status and life. They agreed it was a lot to ask for the interns and I felt that the empathy regarding this was acknowledged. 

Fast forward again to when I reached 40 hours (this was already 2 weeks in doing the training) I started doing the math for all the modules (because it says total completion time) because I wanted to know how long this would be. It all amounted to 70-80 hours!! It is unheard of for someone to complete all of this in a span of a week UNLESS YOU FAST FORWARD AND SKIP THROUGH EVERYTHING. I didn't skip through everything. I wanted to give a fuck and learn and digest this material because I cared. Well, I guess I should have done that and taken the easy way out because I was eventually let go from my placement due to not having completed my training and start date was pushed back twice. That I had a lot going in my life and I should sort that out and that it wasn't ethical to hire me given my health problems and inability to prioritize the internship training. 

This was my supervisors first time supervising, mind you. I thought they were nice. I learned a lot about therapeutic/professional boundaries towards the beginning of the training and decided to start using these skills building trust with them. I communicated that I was experiencing physical problems as part of my PCOS early on before I started the training and they thanked me for being honest and open. I mentioned that I would *possibly* be undergoing surgery sometime in the semester. Because my hours were 16/wk, two days a week, this would work out in getting this POSSIBLY done on my off days. I communicated that I was a part-time student and the training was starting to affect my own personal life. My stress levels were starting to go off the roof, as expected. 

Fast forward again to when I finally completed the training and managed to finish in mid September. I thought it would never end. Mind you, I have a life and also have other courses to attend to. I met with my supervisor and I'm given a document listing our interactions, push back dates, etc. The director was called in as well. I was already nervous but I went with it. I had a feeling I was going to be let go.  I'm not sure if I screwed myself over during this meeting by saying something or if my supervisor was bad at being assertive with me. They never really said it wasn't going to work out, or that I was fired. It was only through our conversation, which was done in a reflective listening style that I understood they required more of me and that it wasn't going to work out. I communicated I have health issues I'm dealing with as well as a life to attend to and that this training was starting to take longer than expected. I mentioned it was affecting my school work as well. They said no one had ever taken that long to complete it and I still think its because people rushed through it and did not gaf. 

The agenda list they provided  had quotes of things I said in confidentiality via e-mail and it was not until after I left their that it dawned on me how shitty this was. The supervisor claimed I kept dodging  calls and would quickly respond via e-mail to  after I would miss calls.  a) I don't always have my phone on me b) I didn't just want to call back, I wanted to make sure first it was okay to call so I sent an e-mail. It was mentioned how I was two-faced and how when we met in person I would say one thing and when we would talk via e-mail I was another person. Completely dismantled my integrity as a whole. Assuming, and assuming. I was already anxious and stressed so I was not able to respond and think correctly. What I kept understanding was that I did not make this training a priority. I should have made it my life despite me telling them I am a part-time student and also have a life. The supervisor followed to say how they would have started immediately. That they would have made this their #1 priority, basically. I asked if I was supposed to do this over the weekend and they would ignore the question. 

I was left without a placement until further notice now and I don't know what to think. I get to keep my hours, but fuck. I was never told the consequences of not completing this training in time. Nothing was communicated to me, no notice, nothing. My school hasn't done much about this but that is another story.  I have never felt so many emotions all at once in a single day. I was mostly shocked, though. I guess I should start getting used to being fucked over, right?

ANY advice would help. What could I have done differently? Should I have prioritized this even though I have my own life to attend to? How have your initial weeks at placements been? How have you dealt with a first time supervisor?

Thank you for reading\~

2. An internship at a large reputed company in the field I wish to pursue

7. Did research in artificial intelligence (the field I want to pursue), couldn't publish again.
8. I've done an extra curricular activities like being a part of the debating society (not sure how much it counts)

9jxnzw,1,2018-09-29,Should I take this job?,Harag_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9jxnzw/should_i_take_this_job/,"I'm currently a desktop developer in C# and has been working full time a little over year and I had an internship at a local multi for a year before that. At my current company I earn $20k yearly(gross). For the past year I managed to fit in quite well into the company and my managers said I was one of their best people. Since other programmers are leaving the company left and right I happen to be one of the most experienced person in my team currently. Since this means that now I'm responsible for designing the software components and training and mentoring the new hires(the HR doesn't want to hire senior people) I asked for a raise from my boss(starting from january 2019 not immediately). I asked around and turned out that I'm currently underpaid compared to my friends back from university so after a bit of research I asked for $34k which was more or less what I found out to be the realistic pay(again yearly and gross).

My boss has basically ridiculed me and said I was out of my mind for asking such a huge raise. He then promised that I will get something but definitely not this big and he doesn't know how much but definitely ""something bigger than a few %"". So I decided that it's time to take a look at the job market just out of curiosity.

Soon a recruiter contacted me at set me up for a phone interview. The company was foreign and I talked with two people who would be my boss should I start working for them. They asked who I was what I did before and I told them that I was a desktop developer who did winforms and wpf so far and they were quite happy with it and scheduled a personal meeting with me. On that meeting we had the EXACT SAME conversation and then they sent me an offer. They would give me the $34k and a nice yearly bonus but...

they never had a technical interview with me. Had I just lied through the whole process they would be none the wiser. Also on the personal interview my only would be colleague in my country said that looking at my resume he wouldn't dare to ask me about programming. It kind of worries me that they would just send out an offer while basically taking my word that I could do the job.

What also worries me is the I would be doing Integration using BizTalk and googling it gives me an impression that it's a dead technology. Does anyone know the state of that technology?

 When i asked about work-life balance in the company and other similar questions they just said that they don't want to answer this question yet. (But then they just sent me an offer and that's it)
Maybe I'm just paranoid because the process was just too smooth but the company gives me weird vibes. However the $20k to $34k salary jump is quite tempting and it might be an opportunity I shouldn't pass. What do you all make of this story?

I finished my BA in 2013 and I am really interested in getting my masters. I like school and studying and I miss having it in my life in a structured way. I am thinking I would like to get a masters in something technical, but I don’t know what specifically I should look for. 

Some background:
My undergrad was anthropology and economics, both with a focus on emerging economies/the Middle East. After college, I worked in digital marketing at a few start ups, including moving to Jordan for a few years to get international experience and improve my Arabic. Spending so much time around technical people encouraged me to study computers, so I did a boot camp in full stack web development and an internship as a developer, and now I work as a marketing technologist (at my company, that means I do a little light coding and I am the link between the engineers and the marketing team). I absolutely LOVE everything code-related that I’ve done so far, but a lot of what I know is self-taught and I feel insecure about my ability to describe my skills. I would like to get a masters in something related to what I’ve done so far so I can become more technical. I really like python and ruby languages and writing algorithms. Can you please give me advice to programs I should look into? I feel in over my head, and I don’t mind at all the programs being hard (they should be!) but I’m having trouble deciding what to look for. Thank you so much in advance!

Its so laid back but its so darn expensive and there are so many people moving there so its only going to get worse.

SO are there any cities similar to Denver/Boulder in culture, activities, &amp; landscape that isn't so crazy expensive? I have to at least choose a state to settle down in by the end of grad school (2 years from now) so that I can begin my internships to get licensed but I just don't have the time or money to visit a ton of cities to get the feel myself so I'd love to do some research and then visit the top 3 or something.

 I have considered places like Portland (no sunshine), Seattle (equally expensive), Salt Lake City (air pollution, political climate, and overrun with mormons doesn't sound great, no disrespect), and Asheville (but can it be in the south without having the southern culture?)

My first reason is that I hate the distance from home. My school is 1500 miles away from home, and so traveling back and forth during breaks is extremely exhausting (and not to mention expensive). I hate flying in general.

Number 2 is that I really don't like my college's location in the Midwest. It's nice for the first month or so, and then it becomes freezing cold and ugly and depressing. Plus, my city is not a very nice city.

Number 3, I know that after college, I want to live and work in my home state or one state over. Although my state school is ranked much lower than my current school, I feel like in my major (CS) a local school that more people know of would be better for getting internships/jobs in the location I want than my school right now. Plus, in CS the ranking of your school is not a huge deal (outside of Berkeley, MIT, etc.), so I don't think the drop in ""prestige"" would matter in terms of landing a job. It makes travel to companies for interviews/internships much easier. They also might want to hire locally, which going to a state school would help with.

I also don't have too many friends here, but I am introverted in general so it's not a huge deal, as I will probably have the same social life here or there. At least near home, I can visit family whenever I want to, and I'd have a car so I can be a bit more mobile.

The thing is, I am not, like, depressed at my current school. It does definitely have its upsides for being a midsize private university as opposed to a huge public school. I'm just unhappy because of the reasons above and am wondering if transferring would be a good idea, especially in terms of getting an internship or job.

Hey all!

Quick intro to my issue: So I already graduated with a bachelor in Mech. Engineering. After working for 1 year as a CAD drafter (the job was half-automated through VBA macros with SolidWorks API), I realized I wasn't learning anything in my position, and felt like I would be stagnating after a few years there with nothing new in my head to climb up the career ladder. I do like the mechanical engineering subjects, especially material mechanics and fluid dynamics. 

At the same time, I have discovered programming to be quite interesting as well, with what seems to be very varying everyday life with new problems to solve and a lot of on-the-job learning. I'm also interested in living a ""digital nomad"" life eventually, to travel the world. I am an active investor as well, and I can possibly see myself working in this sphere later on through for example programming trading algorithms also.

&amp;#x200B;

This year I started my 2nd bachelor degree in Computer Science. It is fully paid for by the state (I was one of the lucky few who qualified for a budget place), and I get a good deal on my student loans (once the degree is completed, only 60% has to be paid back). Financially it is a good option, and since I have a hard time finding jobs/internships in programming without any experience in it and an ME degree, I decided that taking this free education would be the best option. After this first semester I will look for part-time jobs/internships to start filling my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

My worries nowadays though is that I'm doing something unnecessary; as in if taking a 2nd degree is worth the time? I feel like I would lose out on so much by spending another 3 years in university, when that could have been spent working full time. At the same time, it seems like the right thing to do to give me an entry at least to the programming field. At one point, I would love to utilize both my mechanical engineering education and computer science education, so below I have listed a few options I am considering:

1. Complete enough of my CS degree to qualify for a full-time job as a programmer, through also doing internships/part-time jobs. Drop out of the CS program and work full-time for 2-3 years, gain enough experience for more advanced positions.
2. Fully complete the CS degree, with internships and full-time jobs. With a full degree, I can probably apply to more advanced positions for software engineering etc.
3. While studying CS, keep doing ME related jobs or internships. This would allow me to build a stronger ME foundation to get more advanced design jobs, with a foundation in programming to allow me to work on software as well, either automating design processes or FEA calculations etc.

What I hope to get to one day would be a job within robotics or aerospace, or CFD/FEA calculations, or a programing job. I don't know other possibilities for combining ME and CS, so the above options are kind of what I have at this point - feel free to suggest more. That is more long-term though, and being able to live the ""digital nomad"" lifestyle for 1 year or so is something I plan on doing regardless, to travel around the world. I am also interested in start-ups, and I figure having both mechanical and software skills for both hardware and software design could be benificial.

To the ones that read through all of this; kudos! And thank you.

Looking forward to your inputs."
9k5f9r,0,2018-09-30,I’m planning to do an international internship in NYC and stay with my girlfriend there. I’ve got a few questions about this so I don’t run into any legal trouble.,bravasphotos,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9k5f9r/im_planning_to_do_an_international_internship_in/,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning to do a 6 month international internship in NYC next year for university. My girlfriend lives and works in NYC and has offered me a place to stay with her and her roommate.

I’d love to take this opportunity, because it’ll make it awfully affordable to live in NYC’s centre. 

However, I don’t wish to risk her contract with her landlord and to get in legal trouble myself *should* something happen there. I’ve looked online for a bit, and I would pay rent to my girlfriend as compensation, because that’s fair. I think this falls under ‘*subletting*’. I’m not too familiar with the English terms, sorry. 

I read a few sites that basically come down to this: it’s fine to let someone stay with you for a couple of days/weeks if they ran into trouble. But because I’ll be staying there for half a year, I want to know the limitations and/or rights we have. I’ll be spending a week with her next month; then I wanted to take a look in the contract before possibly contacting the landlord, too. To know the specifics. 

So here are some questions:

1.	What (general) laws should I know about subletting?
2.	Would my girlfriend and/or I run into trouble if we didn’t tell the landlord?
3.	Is this at all legal, illegal or is it a grey area?

After reading the contract, and hopefully seeing no restrictions or penalties, I’d like to be transparent with the landlord. Hopefully this would be the cause for good-will.

___

In short: I don’t want to cause any trouble if I were to stay with my girlfriend for 6 months in NYC.

**Thank you for your time and trouble!**"
9k61xv,2,2018-09-30,UofT or Waterloo for MEng in Mechanical Engineering?,doonerfour,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/9k61xv/uoft_or_waterloo_for_meng_in_mechanical/,"Just received my offer of admission for UofT this past week and had already been accepted into Waterloo, so now I need to make a decision.

I'm leaning towards Toronto since I'm an international student and the name carries more weight where I'm from (in case I have to return home at the end). Also seems like a pretty cool place to live, but that's just a bonus.

But I'm really concerned about internships, since my undergrad was really weak in that department and I only have one pretty short relevant work experience. So I'm really hoping to amend that now, and chose the extended option to give myself plenty of time for work.

Does anyone have experience with internships as a grad student and how it compares to Waterloo? I'd also appreciate any other feedback on reasons to choose one over the other. 

Thanks."

9k7f3g,147,2018-09-30,I do not feel respected at work,HistoricalMarsupial,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9k7f3g/i_do_not_feel_respected_at_work/,"Hi all! I am a recent college grad who just started a few months ago as a full time SWE.

There have been too many instances where I felt like I am just not...respected? Especially compared to my cubicle mate, who is also a female RCG (just like me) who started around the same time I did. We are both on the same team, but I just get the feeling that our lead takes her work, suggestions, and statements more seriously than mine.

For example, there are times when I will update him on the status of something I am working on, and he will just give me a very...dismissive ""ok, thanks for the update"", while with her, I can see that he intently listens to the things that he is saying and actually takes what she says seriously. Also, one time I was taking more time than I needed to finish a task, and he asked my office mate to help me with it, which my she and I found pretty offensive (on behalf of me), because it was such an easy task.

I am not sure what it is...I have done a lot of things that geniunely made life easier for the team, and I can objectively see that me and that cubicle mate makes the same amount of progress that I do. But for some reason she gets more respect than I do?

It has been really making me upset lately, and I am not sure what I am doing wrong? This is not the first time this has happened either; at my last internship, my mentor spoke to me in a really condescending manner...im front of everyone numerous times, and I always just took it (which I really regret). What am I doing wrong? Should I stick it out (seeing it has only been 3 months), or what? This project I am working on will finish in 2 weeks...and I may not need to work with this lead anymore.

And before anyone asks, no, this coworker (my cube mate) is not conventionally ""hot"" or anything...the only thing I can think of is that I do sound more timid compared to her (my voice begins shaking when speakimg with people).

Tldr: why have my leads and mentors always been condescending towards me? If it happened twice.....then it is obviously me....(or is it)? "

9k7meo,61,2018-09-30,What I learned from my first internship interview,Atomograd,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/9k7meo/what_i_learned_from_my_first_internship_interview/,"* **Apply early** - One of my friends missed out on this interview because he submitted his application late despite being a stronger candidate. Don't be like him. Also lots of firms will have a set number of spots, this means that the chances of you getting one of them goes down the later you do your interview.
* **Try and arrange internships for yourself as early in University/College as you can** - The more experience you can get of interviews, the better. Even if you don't land the internship you get valuable experience.
* **You are also interviewing them to see if their internship is a good fit for you.**
* **Ensure you send an up to date and relevant CV** - I sent them an out of date copy of mine and it thew me off slightly and make the process harder than it should've been.
* **Prepare yourself for a much longer day than you were expecting** - Make sure you try and eat before so you don't get fatigued if the interview process takes longer than you expected. The whole interview process took around 4 hours for me, which was much more than I was expecting. 
* **It's always better to dress more smart than less** - They aren't assessing how you dress, however you will feel more confident when you look smart.
* **Arrive earlier than you think you need to** - Again, much better to be very early than very late.
* **Be friendly with the other candidates** - I found that some chat before and after interview sections helped calm my nerves. However if they try and tell you that they aced their interview and they haven't made any mistakes or stumbles then the chances are they're lying. The other candidates who did this with me didn't get offered the internship.
* **Social skills are paramount** - I would argue that social skills are harder to learn than the kinds of tech questions you will be asked in an interview. Tech companies are expecting to have to teach you lots about the technical side of the business but much less about social interactions with your coworkers. If you already have good social skills you will be a much more attractive candidate than someone else who may be a much better technologist. 
* **Don't be afraid to say you don't know something or it isn't one of your strengths** - This is much better than lying about your experience and being discovered later. 
* **If you don't know something try and work out an answer using the knowledge you do have** - Lots of questions will be designed to stretch you. They want to see how you deal with a problem and are able to apply your knowledge.
* **In a group interview don't stand out** - It's very easy to be the leader of the group or to sink into the shadows. The more difficult thing is to get your opinions across and work with others without being too pushy or complacent. Don't be afraid to disagree, but have justifications for your opinion.
* **Always ask questions** - You are likely to be interviewed by a senior developer or someone who knows the business very intimately. This is a valuable opportunity to get advice. Don't waste it.
* **Try and get feedback when you hear back** - These are the areas for you to work on for the next interview.

Thank you for reading. :)"

My interviewer turned out to be the guy i spoke to at the info session for about 20 minutes with, so the interview was more of a conversation than an actual interview, but regardless, it went great. On friday they messaged me saying they would like to invite me back for a 2nd/ final round of interview that consists of a dinner, 3- 30 minute interviews, site tour, lunch with a superintendent, and a meeting with a company executive. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really am grateful because I have never been this far in an interview process before (my internship was just a simple interview and an offer later on) and I am very nervous for the dinner, and lunch with the superintendent. It's just crazy to me because with my not very high GPA, I have made it this far with my dream company whom I have been applying to for a position for 3 years, and never heard back. Now, I have the possible opportunity to join full time.

Do you all have any specific advice for the dinner? Also with 3 separate 30 minute interview, do you have any guesses on how these might go?

I know most people on this sub will say projects are the best ways to pad your resume but I have nothing to show.

I taught myself java and have a decent understanding of the language and have also began to pick up Android (framework to display my knowledge). Though I have a good understanding of the language I haven't applied it in any way and want to know would finding a project from recommended project boards supplement my lack of an internship?
