b7wcir,1,2019-03-31,Should I bother trying to finish my degree online?,OtherwiseDevice,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b7wcir/should_i_bother_trying_to_finish_my_degree_online/,"I left school about 2.5/4 years into a program after doing an internship at a fairly large tech company for a full-time job. I left because frankly, I was sick of school and didn't really enjoy the school I was at and received a very good offer. I've done pretty well and received raises and a couple promotions since and am compensated very well. I have a pretty decent network now and don't feel like I would have much of an issue finding a new job if I wanted to leave.

Do you think it might be worthwhile to try to finish my degree through something like Athabasca University? It wouldn't be in computer science anymore, but I could get a BSC in computing and information systems. I've already completed a fair amount of the core computer science classes (discrete math, algorithms, etc). The only major one im missing is operating systems. Is this at all even valuable to employers? Is it worth the cost?"
b7wl6o,0,2019-03-31,Will tech giants offer housing as a perk?,CSisLife123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b7wl6o/will_tech_giants_offer_housing_as_a_perk/,"So this is something I've been wondering for a while. Living on college campus has been one of the best experiences of my life and has really made me feel like a part of the community. With tech giants offering a large number of perks and free things, it seems to me that offering free(or substantially cheaper, therefore incentivized) housing would be an interesting addition to the list of benefits. Interns at Amazon, Facebook, and many other companies already receive corporate housing for their work term and it really helps a lot of them deal with needing to find accommodation on their own.

Of course building housing isnt cheap, but it wouldn't be too big of a deal for larger multi-billion dollar companies to invest in the infrastructure and continue with the maintenance.  Building corporate housing also seems like a good idea to help reduce some of the community resentment a lot of locals seem to harbor for tech companies apparently increasing neighborhoods' cost of living. More housing for employees = less employees taking up local housing.

Now obviously a lot of people won't be wanting to live in corporate housing, which is their choice, but it seems to me that many would love the option (myself included). Being able to walk to the office within 10-20 minutes is such a huge convenience, and being surrounded by friends and acquaintances seems like an ideal situation. What do you guys think of tech giants offering corporate housing for full timers? Will it happen in the future?"

I’ve been dealing with stress and anxiety the past few weeks because I feel like I won’t be good enough for the job and because I suck asking for help at work.

Every internship I’ve had, I’ve SUCKED asking for help. I would have to build up the courage to ask for about 30 minutes (which wastes so much time), then I’d get anxious going up to the person to ask for help. Sometimes I need to ask a single question but it takes me an hour to psych myself up and ask it. I always, ALWAYS feel like they’ll think I’m stupid, think my question is dumb, or think I’m wasting their time. I’ve wasted so much time building up the courage to ask for help because I’m always nervous about what the outcome will be.

I really really want to get better at asking for help because I know asking for help would help my employer and myself. I want to give this new job my 1000% and I need help getting over this speed bump.

It feels like I am not good enough and that I cannot make it into a reasonably good college. Everyone in my high school goes to bottom-tier Christian LACs, awful state schools, and Grand Canyon University (for being the fastest growing college in the US, I'm surprised y'all don't talk about them more). I do not want to end up like them, but it looks like I might.

I read several threads of people with SAT scores 100+ points higher than mine with significantly better ECs getting denied to schools I thought I could get into with some sort of a chance. I am extremely stressed and high-key scared about the whole process and getting denied to a school I used to view as ""safe.""

To be honest, I could have tried harder in high school; while I do extremely well academically and have made it a point to challenge myself in high school, I did not participate in many extracurricular activities because I am extremely poor at socializing and getting myself out there. I would mention that in my college essays to serve as a deficit filler, but it seems like all colleges want these days are extroverted, cancer-curing, debate-team captains. I feel like mentioning my lack of social skills will hurt me during the admissions process. 

Also, I have no college councilor because my school is extremely small and private, so I have no one to guide me.

So here I am, a junior entering Q4 of the school year practically tearing my hair out over what I should do next. 

Should I go gun-ho on a match school I really like and apply binding early decision and pray, or should I try and reach for higher-tier colleges? Please help me out.

I guess I just felt that I was missing out on a lot of my “college experience” because I was tied down in a long distance relationship. But I realized too late that I was just a fucking idiot and ruined something great because I was selfish. Now I just feel completely alone. I feel like I’m a complete loser and should just end it. All of my peers are in relationships, getting job offers, and are doing great. Meanwhile I’m broke, failing my classes, and have absolutely no one there for me. I just feel like a waste of space and I should end it now instead of spending another minute watching everyone succeed. All I want is to feel happy, to not be a loser in any one aspect of my life, but I have literally nothing going for me. Every job or internship I’ve applied to has turned me down. Every girl I’ve opened up to has rejected me. All I feel is failure and loneliness 

I really don’t think I’m going to make it past graduation. The only thing that stops me is my parents. They have only ever been loving and supportive, and I can’t do that to my mom or dad. Still, every day that goes on gets harder and harder, and at the rate that I’m going I really don’t feel like I can make it much longer. Something needs to change. I just want some form of success whether it’s a job offer or a girl that’s actually interested in me. But no one wants to hire a lazy fuck that’s at the bottom of their class, and no one has any interest in an unattractive self loathing loser. I threw away the one shot I had at real love. The one person that actually cared about me, I don’t feel like there is much worth living for. I’m never going to find a job and I’m never going to find anyone like her so why spend any more time suffering."

Cons:

Not as prestigious as UMich for engineering

Doesn’t have aerospace engineering as a major


Pros for UMich:

Is well known for engineering 

I could play club water polo there (not good enough for D1 at SB)

I received a type 1 Air Force ROTC scholarship and would pay no tuition there 

I could choose to Major in Aero E

Cons:

Very cold and far from home

ROTC would possibly make it difficult to go to grad school if that’s what I end up pursuing


I am visiting UCSB on the 13th and I am planning on visiting Mich in later April. I believe visiting will really help me decide, but I am looking for others opinions.

b818uk,0,2019-04-01,I don't feel prepared to take a job outside of my programming intensive's network?,CaliBounded,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b818uk/i_dont_feel_prepared_to_take_a_job_outside_of_my/,"So I am a student of an amazing programming intensive geared towards giving urban youth opportunity. It comes with all kinds of benefits: I attend for free and receive an educational stipend, training to succeed in corporate America, and access to a network of alums that work for a ton of other huge companies; after we finish 6 months of training in our chosen field (I'm a software development student) we go to a Fortune 500 or 100 company internship for 6 months, then we graduate. About 40% of us get hired on by our internships and if we don't, our school gives us 4 months of job-search assistance, after which 96% of us are hired. 


I see this all as an amazing opportunity, and our grads go on to do fantastic things. It's just that I really want to be aggressive with my job-searching, because 1.) I started teaching myself front-end web development 8 months prior to entry of my program, lurking on this sunreddit a ton, and learning about the culture surrounding programming interviews and I get the importance of doing so, and 2.) we don't receive a stipend during those 4 months after graduation, and while I've been saving the portions of it that I don't use, living off my savings makes me super nervous. If we don't job search ourselves, you're essentially waiting for the company to get interviews *for* you with other companies. I don't want to wait.


What makes me nervous is that the companies we're affiliated with (there are lots: Equifax, Google, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, IBM, AT&amp;T, etc.) know who our students are and are a little more patient with incoming hires I think. I don't know if I even want to work for a huge company (though where I'm at now will look amazing on a resume) so if I go off on my own, I guess I'm afraid I won't know as much as grads from colleges that I'll be competing with. I have a 4.0 in my classes here (our classes count for college credit) but I also know that the curriculum we were taught was nothing compared to what we learned on the job. I switched from Frontend to Fullstack and while it's exciting, I have much much more to learn. I guess I want to know what I can do to prepare? What I can do to not look good on paper and totally blow it if I actually get hired somewhere? I've heard of imposter syndrome and I'm not sure if that's what's going on here but I'm honestly terrified. If my program DOES get me a job with one of their partners, awesome. I just want to have a ton of options so I'm not spending months of my rent money waiting for them to do the work for me.


So far I'm good with HTML/CSS/JS, functional with Python and SQL, and am learning Ruby on Rails for my internship (a Rails-only shop), but I will be starting on Django soon, since my city has NO jobs in Rails. I have been working in sqlite3 but I know I need to move to a legit database like Postgress, which is what I've been requested to use once I have my schema more or less set in stone. I have 4 more months until my internship is over. I'm just really spooked too because I don't know how much a Jr. Fullstack dev is expected to know and to what degree... How many questions to my coworkers are too many? The sort of questions that I've seen people post for interviews also seem pretty scary... Can I accept a job and start a month later if I wanted to start applying a month BEFORE graduation?


Any tips would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!"

I do like maths but I don’t want to do mathematical research for future career. I had a little bit experience in programming and I really like it, especially things like algorithms and machine learning. So I’m thinking of getting into IT industry.

However, my school doesn’t provide opportunities for us to take CS courses, so I think I will have to learn it by myself during holidays. And I know I will need to spend time practicing programme skills. I’m here to seek advice on the following issues:

1. in a tech company, are there any job posts where people with maths major actually have an advantage? Basically I want to avoid direct competition with cs majors because I obviously cannot have as much programming experience. Also, I don’t want to make it a waste of time to study maths for three years. I hope I will be able to apply things I learned at school in my future jobs.

2. Which are the areas of cs that I should learn, given that I don’t have much time? I’m thinking of concentrating on algorithms and data structure, as well as machine learning. Is it advisable? I don’t want to be software engineer, then can I not skip things like web/operating systems/data mining etc? 

3. What are the required skills that I should master so that I can secure an internship?

4. For a math major to get into cs industry, is it advisable to do a master/phd other than directing going into the working world after undergraduate level? If yes, are there anything I can do to prepare myself for application for prestigious cs-related master/phd programmes?

Thank you guys!! Any advice will be extremely valuable to me!

b82la9,1,2019-04-01,I am a medical doctor but I want to become a theoretical physicist M28years,iwanttobecome,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/b82la9/i_am_a_medical_doctor_but_i_want_to_become_a/,"So basically the premise is in the topic title.... PM english is not my first language. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I read a book when I was 14 about physics I loved physics. I loved the stories the implications and I understood (I think) what the true beauty is about it. I excelled at school in math and physics (and biology) and had a perfect score when I ended high school in Math. However I doubted really strongly that I could do physics, because in my head people who studied physics were probably way smarter then me. I also I didn't want to be seen as a nerd (bad motivation I know). My parents also pressured me into not doing physics and I choose my second idea: medicine. 

I like medicine also a lot and I have been a doctor for some years. I love my job, love learning about the body and cracking cases. I dont really like the stressful job times and it can be quite physical demanding. 

During my medicine studies I tried doing some physics courses and the first time I did an exam in a physics course I was shaking in happiness (I was 22 I think). I really tried doing physics next to medicine, but my internships already started and I had to be in the hospital from 9 to 5. Studying in the evening for medicine AND physics was too much. I let go of physics.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now financially in a good situation. Physics is still nagging in my head. People often say I should join medicine and physics love by become nuclear medicine physicist, but I just want to do theoretical physics. I know it sounds bad, but only theoretical physics is my main interest. I like all physics, but I want to truly understand the principles. I love teaching as well and would like to become a teacher on a university. 

&amp;#x200B;

However... if I now stop working and start studying physics I will throw away my medicine career. At the point I am now I should choose for a medical specialty, do a PhD or start profilering more in my career. If I quit now I will pass this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second problem is that in my country they don't allow you to study a second study if you finished your first. Well they allow you but at truly insane rates. I don't have the money for that, and I don't want to go extremely in debt for the study because I am afraid I can't pay it off in the future (because job uncertainty as a theoretical physicist). The option is that I go study 500 km away in a different country where they allow second studies for really low prices, I can easily pay that for a couple of years without working. This will be very difficult for my girflriend, who is still studying in my place, she cant transfer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do. The most safe and best bet is to stay a doctor and profilare my carreer. I will have less worreis in life. If I stop it is a true gamble, what if after studying phsyics I cant find a job as a theoretical phsyscist. Also I need to emigrate. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR I am a doctor but I want to become a theoretcal physics. If I stop working I throw away my medical career. I also need to emigrate to a different country. "

[February's update](https://np.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/avswky/im_keeping_an_extensive_record_of_job/)

In those posts I got some feedback and a lot of support. You all have been great, and your ~~three whole karma~~ *interest in the data* is why I'm making an effort to make these monthly posts. As always, please let me know in a comment if you have any suggestions for any measurements or figures you'd like to see that I don't already include here.

As an introduction to myself, I am a chemical engineering student graduating early May. My extracurricular and internship experiences emphasize mechanical engineering and mechanical design for aerospace applications, and my ambition is to land a job in the aerospace industry. To that end I've made this enormous push in applying for jobs in mechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering, processing engineering, thermal engineering, systems engineering, quality engineering, test engineering, and more. My GPA is sitting at a brow-wrinkling 2.99/4.00 with the very reasonable expectation of being above 3.00 upon graduation. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/vVzylky.png) is a graph of my GPA over time, with my expectations for this current semester included.

I've had a lot of really great interviews this month with a few followups but no offers as of yet. Some of you have shown concern over this given the literal hundreds of applications I've submitted, but I remain optimistic as my resumes, cover letters, and interviews are improving all the time and I always get positive reviews when I ask for feedback. You are all nonetheless welcome to express your thoughts in the comments and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have.

All that said, let's get to the good stuff.

If you compare that to last month's table, you'll see that not much has changed. The standard deviation is up by one day, and that's really it. Five days is still the record holder for most common response time, with three more appearances in my records to help hold its spot. I've also added a new row that shows how many times I've been automatically rejected same-day, which happened a few more times this month due to some filters with JACOBS. They were all for mechanical positions, but I was not filtered for other positions I believe I am less qualified for and some other mechanical positions, so I can't say with any certainty as to what exactly cause my applications to be rejected so quickly in these cases.

For some more specific details, here is a [monthly column graph](https://imgur.com/65dyaya.jpeg) showing my monthly progress and the diversity of who I applied to. I changed color schemes so that there is much more contrast between neighboring companies. Even though I couldn't possibly hope to include a legend containing all of the company names, this at least helps show rough proportions. I have my own pivot table with all of the exact figures for specific comparisons. But even with just this figure you can see that my monthly submissions is down this month, but company diversity is actually up by one company.

Only two companies have more 50 or more applications total, and they are Lockheed Martin with 213 and Boeing with 193. UTC Aerospace is a distant third with 49.

A time line would be way too dense to convey any meaningful information about individual applications, but this [time scatter plot](https://imgur.com/tb94iKT.jpeg) is my attempt to do just that. The x axis is the date going back to my first job application submission and the y axis is how many days it had been since that date until I received a response. Each point is an application. The points are 75% transparent to help recognize stacking. Fully opaque circles are 4+ applications. This plot includes all applications, not just ones I've received a response for. So the 11 same-day rejections are mixed in with the 376 no-response applications. The orange lines are a sort of time line that has a slope of -1 day per calendar day, with the most opaque line corresponding to today. The right-most line serves as a boundary, where it is impossible for any points to lie above. Each line following that is separated by 30 days. This means all of the points you see between the right-most two lines are approximately all of the responses I've received since my last update post. Once you understand how to read the plot, I think it is the most informative, visually speaking. For example, you can instantly see I had a large burst of applications at the end of August/early September, and that I am still receiving responses from these applications seven months later!

This takes a bit more hands-on upkeep to maintain, but I also like the [response time histogram](https://imgur.com/aR2ExSh.jpeg). Compared to last month when I had just recently doubled my total application submissions, this month's histogram is much more smooth and the tail end of it has leveled out. The exception to that is the island of responses around (140, 160], which I suspect is due to some deadline from Lockheed Martin recruitment. You can actually see where this island corresponds to a cluster of points on the time scatter plot around August 31, 150 days.

As always, I saved the best for last. I know a lot of people's favorite figure is the [animated heat map](https://giant.gfycat.com/PlasticPastelGuillemot.webm) that shows where I have applied to which progresses over time. This month I opted to do an update only animation, so it just shows my progress between the last update post and this one. I did this because the full animation either takes a long time to see anything interest or speeds by took quickly to catch what's happening. I haven't submitted any applications the past few days, so that's why it stops on March 27th. It takes a second for all of the prior entries to pop in. Probably the most distinctive feature in this animation is the growth in west Ohio after a day of applying to some automotive positions.

####Feedback Requests

1. The list of figures was a last minute idea. Please let me know in your comments if it helped you at all and if you think it's worth including.

2. The animated heat map has previously shown the full timeline. Do you think it was a good decision to only show the new applications? Should I include more context in the timeline, such as two or three months? Should I just include the full-length animation as well?"

This is what happens when you Endure.,cruller_,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/b83fyl/learning_programming_is_about_endurance_this_is/,"I'm sorry in advance for the wall of text but I have been a lurker on this subreddit for along time and I see the struggles that others are going through that I myself have gone through. I just want to share the fact that the struggles are worth it. Even when you feel like calling it quits, don't.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen a few posts before about peoples success in finally getting a job as a programmer. However, I want to be a little different and try to cover somethings that I didn't know about or have before I started work. I hope the following will benefit someone in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure you've all heard about little startups taking a risk on junior developer, rather than blowing big bucks on a 

more senior and experienced professional. The idea is that potential is looming under the surface of the junior and the company makes a decision to invest. Build the skills of the junior and hopefully in return get loyalty and a moderately skilled employee after a year or two.

Well in my case I wasn't hired as a junior, I was hired as a complete and utter blank slate.

That me explain that last part.

I had finished university many years before (6 with a big S). I hadn't been working since. I had taken time out to travel and do other miscellaneous things but my CV suffered and I had a massive gap in my employment record.

When I decided to go for a programming job I polished my CV as best I could and mentioned technologies I had been practicing with: node, rails etc.

I was getting no where.

Then I get an email asking me for an interview. I sit in the room with the co-founder and senior developer for 1.5 hours. It was more of a casual chat than a formal interview. I asked so many questions about the company and their responses got me genuinely excited about it. To be honest on the day of the interview I wasn't bothered about it as I felt I wouldn't get it. So I was very relaxed. 

I was brutally honest about what I did and didn't know. But I emphasized the things that I didn't know that I really wanted to learn.

So it's been one year on the job. There was no training. I was thrown into the deep end. Everything I thought I knew about programming and the stack we work with was all worthless. And I thought I knew a lot. I struggled so much at the start. I was doing so bad that I thought I would be fired. But I stuck with it. I saw a few younger people who were in as interns switch from programming to some other role as it was too much for them. I was so glad I persevered. 

I did a few side projects then I was trusted with building a small piece of the core project. The project itself is a jungle and I'm still learning about how it all works. But my confidence in attacking my tasks and completing them has grown significantly. I find myself asking less questions than I did when I started and this is a kind of indicator that I have progressed. However, since this is an ever growing job, I found the questions get less in number but more sophisticated in complexity.

Several things I learned that wouldn't have learnt outside of the work place:

* Listen carefully to the task. - No matter how it is presented. If you still don't understand, it doesn't matter if you see yourself as slow to pick it up or understand. People have different ways of explaining things and if something is very technical just ask to have it shown a different way. I like to go to the Project Manager and have them show me a live demo of what they want. This has also boosted my people and communication skills. I can stand up in the open plan office and everyone will know I'm asking my stupid question but I don't care that it's stupid anymore because it's going to help me get my job done.

&amp;#x200B;

* How to ask questions. either in person or on google - Everyone's time is precious so I learnt to slowly develop my questions to get to the point and make sure I get the correct answer. This goes for searching online or asking a colleague, either by email or in person.

&amp;#x200B;

* Git is so important - Git is bloody scary. I was so nervous the first time I pushed my commit. I did (on more than one occasion) break the project but my colleagues saw it as a rite of passage and waited patiently whilst I fixed things. Most importantly it keeps track of what I have done. Learning to merge and rebase into master. Learning how branches work and making a backup of the commits I make in the remote server. Its something I never considered before and I'm so glad I have developed this small but important skill. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't Rush - I got so good that I flew through my tasks. Small ones will be done in no time. But then, like a boomerang, they come smashing in the back of my skull and more time is wasted fixing things. Now I double check every little task, no matter how small to make sure I'm pushing the correct code and it does as it should.

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't panic - There are no deadlines in my company and the boss is very easy going. This made me even more stressed out. I had no idea how long I could take at something and if I couldn't do something or it was taking weeks I would be worrying about what everyone was thinking of me. Any discussion with my boss put my mind at ease. Everyone knew I was starting from scratch, they know what I can and can't do and they know I need to struggle to learn. Having everyone on my side, as quiet as that was, really helped me to relax more.

&amp;#x200B;

* Take regular breaks - every so often I open up Reddit, or hacker news. Other colleagues check sports news or read up on celeb gossip. Take your mind out of the task and even away from the screen now and then to clear the head. This is a really life saver when I'm stuck on something. Its only when I go for a walk during lunch or stretch my legs in the corridor that a solution might present itself.

&amp;#x200B;

* Get good rest - A fresh head in the morning has helped me tackle the toughest of tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't give up - This way there is no regret to what could've been. Its a hard career to tackle and it will not always be easy but it's worth finding out.

&amp;#x200B;

* Be confident - If everyone else who has a programming job can be a programmer then so can you. This isn't reserved for the brightest or the most well educated or the wealthiest of people. Anyone can do this. (This is going to sound really cliche....) Your only limitation is you. And I know that's a crap thing to say when you're applying to jobs and not getting anything. But it is true. Try changing your CV, emailing local companies about your situation and how you would like to build a career with them if they'd like to take the risk with you etc.

&amp;#x200B;

* There are stupid questions but its OK to ask them - For the first few months I had nothing but stupid questions, so many I can't list them here and I was so embarrassed when I asked because the guy next to me was so loud that everyone heard my problem, even if I whispered. But, my work got done, I learned a lot and now it's got to the point where developers are asking me questions.

&amp;#x200B;

* Take responsibility - Own your code. If you break something, its on you. Not in a harsh way but know that you broke something is a really good learning experience. It shows how your code is a building block in holding this massive structure in place and without it, it all crumbles. That said, when you get a code review, swallow hard and accept it. It's never personal. I'm very happy to have my code reviewed and I can tell you that you will learn loads more stuff from others reviewing you. Whether its a Senior, another Junior or the boss themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't wait for books - allow yourself to be thrown into the deep end and drown for a while. It will be painful and you'll struggle a lot but its the best learning tool. Books may be helpful but should only be used as a reference. Build what you need to build. And if you build it wrong, so be it. Tear it down, learn from it and start again. There will be 1001 ways to do the task you have assigned to you. Never forget that.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:dr

&amp;#x200B;

Complete clean slate is fortunate to get a decent job.

Learnt the following:

Be confident, struggle, ask and most important - keep coming back for more.

Hope this will help someone in some way."

&amp;#x200B;

So for a little background, I'm a little more than a year out of school. I graduated from an ivy league with a dual degree in CS and a heavyweight design field. The design field is my passion, and CS was a tool to expand my abilities in that (and I focuses appropriately), however I'm first-gen low income and the design field has a trend of unpaid/next to nothing pay entry level. I need to be able to pay my debt, support myself/have healthcare, eventually pay for a masters, and would also like to take care of my parents so tech seems the way to go (and I don't mind, it's my second passion).

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I bring this is up is pre-professionally, I prepared mostly for the design field and never did a tech internship. My CS skills are not bad, I have some personal projects, I'd say for CS at my school I was average or very slightly better, mainly because I know a lot of full stack tech and tools and many people come out of school only having strong algo skills.

&amp;#x200B;

Over this year, I'm a few hundred job apps, a few onsites etc. deep. I definitely fucked some of my onsites up (my first ever was a Big N and I was too anxious to properly do anything), but a really common trend I have is just ""sorry, you don't have enough experience."" I totally get this - maybe it's just my imposter syndrome speaking but I'm assuming there's usually a student who's just as good as me but also has tech experience, and except for Big Ns I've never had my second degree mentioned/commented on (in fact, it's often something I have to explain - ""so are you looking to stay in tech?""). Often times I'll get through the rounds, have no issues with the leetcodes but my recurring feedback is ""more experience, sorry."" It seems at this point I've gotten everything else down when it comes to algo skills and communication, and am working on having a better and better github.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm still jobless and experience-less, besides a pretty predatory 4 month contracted gig I took on specifically because I didn't have any prior tech experience and didn't really end up being good for growth.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been getting spammed constantly by recruiters from random staffing companies. Usually, their deal seems a little shitty (really low pay for CS, no benefits, 3-6 month review into fulltime). However, they seem to be at ""big, but boring"" companies where at this point I wouldn't mind working. It's always that they act an intermediate and I sign a contract with them first.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth talking to these recruiters? How often do they transition into fulltime? Does this experience look bad on resumes? Is it worth taking when I have nothing else? It seems the longer I don't work in tech, the more suspicious it seems that I've been without a tech job for so long."

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;DR: International Student graduating in CS this May. No internships, no work experience in CS field. Limited income to try different things. Overwhelmed with what information and subjects to focus on to become a junior developer in Java (or any entry-level position).**

&amp;#x200B;

I am a college senior graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from an average university in May 2019. I am an international student, and was a collegiate athlete for all 4 years. Due to these reasons, I did not have time or was unable to get an internship, and as a result, I feel that I have fell behind compared to my peers. I constantly feel I don't know much about things, and although my theoretical knowledge is decent, I struggle in practice of coding and creating projects. I have a good GPA (3.6), and typically had good grades in programming classes, but I feel that my university classes that heavily focused on coding were very shallow and nothing that I couldn't learn by watching youtube for 20 minutes a day.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I have started the grind on LeetCode, primarily using Java. I have purchased a couple of books to help with programming for additional practice. Additionally, I'm looking forward into learning Java frameworks and libraries like Node and React. I am also thinking about learning SQL and getting proficient in it. The problem is, I am overwhelmed in the amount of material that I think that I need for landing a programming job of any scope. Eventually, I would like to be in a cybersecurity field, but most of them require experience and multiple security certificates, which I cannot pay for yet (to take tests etc). So for now, I am focusing on getting an entry-level job as a Junior Developer, preferably Java (I have solid foundational knowledge of C++, Python, and Lisp as well but not comfortable with them). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not looking for a Big N or a dream $200k+ position right out of college - I am comfortable with an average/slightly below average pay for an entry level position. That is not to say that I am not dreaming big, but I feel like my current skills cannot land a big position job just yet. My biggest objective is to have stable income for now - as an International student, a lot of companies cannot sponsor my stay, so I feel like it's going to be much harder for me to land ANY job. Any stable income is important because I do not have much monetary support from my family. Fortunately, my Optional Practical Training (OPT) involves a 3 year option to stay and work in a CS related field due to STEM option (instead of just 1 year for non-STEM fields). Therefore, I do not need a work visa immediately (something that, looking from job postings, employers tend to avoid).

&amp;#x200B;

With all that in mind, to sum it up, a couple of questions:

1. What should I focus on to improve my skills in Java programming (frameworks, libraries, templates, anything)
2. Should I narrow myself down to coding (&amp; coding exclusively in one language), or should I expand my field with different languages and focus on different subjects (in regards to probability of landing an entry-level job)?
3. How likely is that a person with no internships or work experience in CS fields get employed in entry-level positions (companies of any size)
4. What would be an optimal approach into learning skills required for cybersecurity positions (technologies, certificates, languages)

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus: I have a lot of accomplishments in my sport that I have participated in college. That is the only thing that makes me stand out from other applicants, resume-wise. Do CS field employers care about that? (I know that for some jobs, athletic achievements are a huge plus on the resume - a show of acquired skills beneficial to the job culture and environment)

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, unlike the OP of that post, I am not behind in my classes. My advisor told me that I am actually ahead! (I am a college freshman at Purdue University studying Computer Graphics if that matters)

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, I volunteered at my local library teaching kids reading as well as arts and crafts. I really loved it and it made me realize how valuable a teaching career is.

&amp;#x200B;

While I am not deadset on becoming a STEM teacher, it is certainly a career path I am considering. I have applied to companies for a proper software engineering/graphic design/development role. I have also applied to one company for a teaching position at a tech camp. The tech camp company reached out to me saying my resume was impressive and they wanted to schedule an interview to go over the internship opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

Given that I would like to explore the field of being a STEM teacher/educator, would you say this internship opportunity is valuable for me? Even though I am not 100% deadset on being an educator over a regular engineer/designer, would you say this internship would be relevant and useful on my resume? If I ultimately decide to work in industry, would this internship harm me? Am I better off declining the offer (should the interview go well)? Does the advice that was given to OP of that post apply to me as well? 

&amp;#x200B;

It is not confirmed yet (as I am yet to have the phone interview) whether I will be teaching kids or teens. Will the age group of my class matter? (I've personally worked with little kids before and LOVED it)"

I'm planning to take 9-10 AP courses, I'm almost an eagle scout, I'm in an elite program called misk (they basically pay for you to go to a top tier university for their summer program), I volunteer almost every month, I'm top of my class in mathematics, computer studies, English, economics, and business studies. My hobbies are guitar and skateboarding.  Although I have a tight schedule, I still want to do more. I'm thinking about joining toastmasters and doing an internship in the summer, but I still want to become more impressive. The environment in Saudi Arabia isn't very well suited for people in high school trying to find extra-curricular activities. Is there anything I might be able to do to make me look more ""impressive"" while I'm applying to universities later on?"

I am a software implementation consultant making 90k in a remote position with decent benefits and bonuses. I have a family, and a mortgage etc. I have been going to school full time for computer science, and was applying for internships. My end goal is a career in either software development or big data engineering. 

Situation:

Well I had an interview for a Big Data Engineering internship with a Fortune 50 company, and after 2 long weeks they finally called and said they want to bring me on full time, skip the internship and hire me as a Big Data Engineer 1. Great news, but the position will be a 3 month contract to hire and I will need to take a pay cut to $30/hourly during the contract (About 63k)..They are saying after that, I would be at least 80k, which I'm okay with but I don't necessarily trust the recruiting agency...I am trying to negotiate but outlook is bleak right now.

I enjoyed most of my essays and I don't think they were too bad. I read one of my 3 recommendation letters and it was stellar. For the other letters, 1 came from a high-profile scientist I met through teaching and another from a teacher at my school.

I think my strongest points were my companies which I dedicate nearly all my time to. I should have centered my essays more around them.

MIT was the main dream school for a while and I tried extraordinarily hard on that application--much more so than any of the schools I was accepted to. Unfortunately I was rejected to MIT but now I've gotta go and show them that they messed up.

Now that it's over, I'm very happy with how things turned out.

b8berk,3,2019-04-01,Advice: internship before college?,Fickle_Theory,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b8berk/advice_internship_before_college/,"So I'm 18 and leaving college in the UK in a few months (similar to US high school). Usually students go onto university now, or work, or take a gap year and travel.

I applied to some universities, but there's only one university in the UK I really want to go to. I don't feel the UK has a good range of universities, like the US does, that could offer me what I want from a university. I got into my other choices which I guess rank well in world subject rankings (e.g. Warwick for maths), but not really my main one (CS at Cambridge). I have the chance for second consideration in August if I meet certain grades, but I doubt it'll lead to a place this year. I'm thinking about reapplying (transfers not allowed), I don't think elsewhere in the UK is worth it to me, I don't think it'll lead anywhere and the courses aren't exciting. I probably should've applied abroad so I had more options in case my one choice failed, but too late now I suppose.

I don't know what to do in a gap year, though. I don't really want to travel alone or something like that, I doubt it'd be a worthwhile experience for me. I considered working. I *think* I'd be appropriately qualified to do an internship or something similar in software engineering, but it's probably unlikely places would consider me w/o a degree since internships seem to be competitive enough as it is.

I've done programming for quite a few years. I've freelanced on some relatively large projects, some medical software that's in use currently at a clinic, bunch of work for websites and backend stuff, plugins for games, made a small standalone game before, freelance system administration, sell my own digital products, and have some projects on GitHub that I've either made or contributed to (though these are less impressive), and other stuff. Though I haven't done as much of this in the past ~10 months so a bit rustier, I think I'd have enough experience and ability to do something meaningful in an internship or job.

Would I be able to get some kind of software engineering thing for a few months to a year, do you think? If so, any places that might offer? I'm in the UK, but I'd rather be in the US or elsewhere in Europe to be honest for the year. If it's just simply not going to be possible, any other advice, or something else I can do for a year? It'll be from July 2019 till September 2020, any period or duration in between is fine, doesn't have to be the entire period obviously.

I don't really feel like working on solo stuff / remote anymore, I kinda want to work in a team even if not actively working with people on a specific project, at least collaborating more or surrounded by other programmers. And I want to work on something meaningful, ideally, if I'm going to be spending a year of my life on this. So either a good experience or a good project to work on, ideally."

The offer (so far only over the phone) is a \~100k salary with \~10k in stock options, benefits, as well as 3k in what is essentially a relocation bonus.

I had 2 phone interviews and they recently flew me over for a day to meet everyone and where I had several more coding interviews with various staff. Everyone was super friendly and it seemed like a genuinely cool place to work in a subject and programming language I enjoy. Not to mention that it allows me to move to a place with a lot of growth and opportunities.

I am a new grad without internship or work experience, and I live in Florida. The reason for this post is that after looking through the salaries and offers in the designated posts (of course the sections for New Grads in high CoL locations) it seems that while the salary is pretty good, the lack of a signing bonus and such a small relocation bonus seems off to me. In addition, I had to ask if there was any additional help they could provide with relocation, because originally all they mentioned was reimbursement for some of the costs. I am now waiting to get full details, and I am genuinely excited about the opportunity, but I am not sure whether I just need to negotiate up or if I am expecting too much.

1510 SAT

33 ACT, 34 Super Score

Approximately 3.8 UW GPA, 4.25 Weighted (9 out of 449 class rank, top 2%).

Rigourous course load. Almost all honors, with all my classes this year being AP.

Planning on taking SAT II for Math II, World History, and German (I also don't have 4 years of a language, only 3, two of them being in Middle School. How much of a detriment is this?)

**Honors:**

Spotlight on the Arts Debate Award (state level)

Social Studies Award (School level)

Honor Roll (school level)

Likely National Merit Commended

Likely National AP Scholar

**EC's** (Also, is this a good order to list them on the common app?)**:**

1. Debate, Lincoln-Douglas Captain (20 hrs/wk, 35 wks/yr) - 4 years

Taught JV and novice debaters. 

State Champion in 2019.

Section Champion in 2019. 

2x National Qualifier. 

2x state semi-finalist. 

Ranked 1st in the state.

2. Paid Political Science research internship (20 hrs/wk, 11 wks/yr) - 1 year

Used GIS technology to map swing districts/precincts across the US, as well as just general research on swing districts.

Worked with my professor to author and edit a new Political Science textbook. 

3.  Page internship, Minnesota Legislature (45 hrs/week, 1 week program) - 1 year

Paged for representatives while in session. Worked directly with my representative on bills. Oversaw committee hearings.

4. Girl's State, haven't been accepted yet, nor have I actually done the program, but I'm very certain I'll be my school's representative based on certain factors from my school)

5. Volunteer researcher, County Historical Society (6 hrs/week, 51 wks/year) - 2 years

Researched WWI veterans to update out-of-date records. Research featured in statewide exhibits. Wrote about history for Dakota County publications. 

6. Library Volunteer, County library system (2 hrs/wk, 51 wks/yr) - 3 years

 Organized bookshelves to make them accessible, as well as day-to-day tasks. Organized summer reading programs for youth. 

7. Junior class officer (should likely be a senior class officer as well. this is basically a student government position) (2 hrs/wk, 37 wks/yr) - likely 2 years

 Worked with administration to plan prom, homecoming, etc. I am currently working to bring Grand March attendance from less than 20 to hopefully around 100 or more.

8. Math League member (3 hrs/wk, 14 wks/year) - 2 years

Competes in regional math competitions about number theory, statistics, and algebra. Contributor on the team event. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also: 

* I'm currently trying to get onto my state's Youth Council, which is a legislatively mandated council in the government which works directly with representatives to oversee real bills concerning youth. The people that serve on the council therefore help get legislation changed and work as a member of the government on legislation. It's not super competitive to get on the council since not too many people apply, but the people who do tend to be fantastic. How much would this add to my application? 
* Should I become a math tutor? I kind of want to show that I like math to the AO's, which is rare for a Poli Sci person. I need the money too and think it'd be fun.
* Also, can I list 'Reading' as an EC? I dedicate a lot of time to reading. Like, I set a timer to read at least 1 hour a day, even on the most busy days, track my reading on a spreadsheet, and spread so much on my summer on books. I want to display that, but I don't know if I can do that on the activity section.

&amp;#x200B;

I expect essays and LOR's to be nothing bad, but nothing amazing either. I really don't know how to rate my own writing. I've been practicing writing recently, though, to get better. I also have started writing supplements, but more so just to try them out rather than actually writing a first draft.

If I were to take one more year at CC I'm sure I would raise my gpa a little and complete all of the **required major prep** to UCB, UCLA, and complete all the possible **recommended major prep** to UCSD in addition to getting some work experience. (I'm lookin for opportunities)

Now I am not rejected yet or anything, but if I do end up getting rejected from UCSD, is taking 1 more year to transfer worth it ? Especially when I could raise my chances for admission to UCLA and UCB in addition to my dream school. Or should I go for UCI (last year of CS TAG) and start looking for internship opportunities and get my Bachelor's done already.

.

.

.

stats if relevant:


Transfer GPA - 3.92

SAT - 1970 ACT - 29 

**TL;DR**

Still eagerly awaiting admission decisions. could do 2-4 courses major prep for UCB, UCLA, UCSB, and UCSD if I wait a year. Should I go to UCI (last year to TAG for CS) if rejected from dream school UCSD or do more prep and get work experience at CC for a fourth year ?


Whatchu guys think? Waste of time and throwing away a good opportunity at UCI if I stay at CC ? How is CS at UCSD vs CS at UCI ? I'm hoping for that CS@UCSD admission rn honestly but im thinking its kinda competitive for some1 with NO ECs after high school lol...

can't wait to hear back already :D"

I got an offer for a summer internship at:

Abbvie -&gt; RPA Developer (Robotic Process Automation - Summer Hacker)

Forcepoint -&gt; Cyber Security Intern.

&amp;#x200B;

I would say I am more interested in Software Engineering and Automation, but I feel like RPA skills can be learned on the side.

Cyber Security is also interesting to me and is very good to know, but I don't see myself doing low level stuff as a career.

I feel like I will learn more in a Cyber Security Internship, but the RPA Developer sounds a little more interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your guys' opinion for a first year summer internship?

Which internship would look better on a resume?

Do you have any experiences in these positions?

(I'm a complete noob to computer science, tried learning some swift and java syntax but that is it.) I'm still lacking the bigger picture of CS and I'm guessing that is what I will learn in college, right now when I think of CS, I think of variables, loops, booleans, etc, but know nothing about these things exist.

Next, I read how in order to be competitive for a job, one must do ""personal projects"" in college and do at least 1 internship.

 1: what do these personal projects entail, coding a website, game, bot? 

2: how do I land an internship without much background in coding, especially my first one? Do I show off my personal projects, get a high GPA, and have just good interview skills in general?

I'm an international prospective student, so please forgive me if this is common knowledge or something. I'm in the process of deciding colleges right now, and would love some advice.

1. My main concern would be how theoretical/practical the CS classes at Berkeley are going to be. Say, if tomorrow I woke up and figured out what the next big thing in tech was going to be, could I bring it to life with all that Berkeley would teach me?
2. Moreover, I'm wondering about how many opportunities or even what kind of opportunities would be available to me. Researches, internships and the like. How do they benefit an individual, in terms of either going for a masters or going straight to industry?
3. Another thing that I'm concerned about is the fact that I *really* don't do well in cut throat or antagonistically competitive environments. I struggle to imagine holding a conversation about who's GPA is higher, for example. Can someone give me an insight into how this works?
4. Lastly, I think I'll be interested in heading into entrepreneurship. What is the start-up culture like? How many people participate in it or at least indulge in it? Is it encouraged or simply existent? Do people come together collectively to work on ideas?

At this point I have been part time teaching basic computer courses for about 3.5 years.  I have reached what is feasible with out a master's degree or such.

I have interviewed for a couple of helpdesk job's but no bytes.


So I'm thinking maybe I need to skip the helpdesk because I'm overqualified or look like I'm not in my 20s.

So I have some books on Python, SQL, Java I have experience in writing in all 3 mainly in classes and script's for my jobs.

My plan is to improve my Python, SQL skills and showcase projects that will sell my skills and work on getting into database jobs. Then to spend time on a site called hackthebox that I have seen mentioned here to make me more aware of potential holes in my coding and because IT security is interesting but I know hard to jump into.

Basically I'm angling for thing's that I can do on a budget because this teacher is paid crap. I'm also looking for ways to improve my cloud skills as I understand cloud is hosting database's. I don't have as much experience in the field of cloud computing aka renting someone else's computer resources. 

So any advice on how to firm up the plan to skip helpdesk? Thing's I may be ignorant of or perspectives I have not considered?

I’m currently a state school student set to graduate next December with a degree in Finance as well as MIS. I’ve got a ~3.6 GPA and I am graduating a semester early. I have an internship set for this summer at a BB which leads to a full time rotational program over the course of two year. However, this is mostly BO from the people I’ve talked to and pay is hourly prorated to ~$53k a year. 

While this seems great out of college there are a few things. I really busted my ass to get my dual majors with such a solid degree and I feel as if I can definitely do better with a starting salary out college. In addition I really enjoy what I study and don’t want to go into an ops career where I barely use any of this stuff. Also, due to the graduation date and the program start date I would have roughly 5 months of nothing between graduation and working.

What I’m thinking about is this:

1) I have been really interested in corporate finance and I am wondering what the best routes to get into this would be for me are.

2) I don’t really have an interest in investment banking very much.

3) I’m not sure when I would want to apply for full time positions. Would it be the end of summer, the middle of fall, or once I graduate?

I am just looking for some potential career advice given my degrees, GPA, graduation date, and any other factors. All opinions are appreciated.

This week I travelled to see B(I Will call B my gf for the whole story) because She wanted to see me and talk about our problems. B Is finishing her master degree and Is doing an internship abroad right now, she's ahead of me in Life and really want to get Independent soon. She said She wanted to work out the issues we had and fix them we were even planning a small vacation for the upcoming easter holidays, but when we spent time together things didn't go well, I discovered she met her ex bf, because the football team She was working with played against the team of his ex but She didn't tell me about it and I felt betrayed because for the First year of our relationship She couldn't get rid of him because he's a sort of Psycho Who stalked her sometimes. Now we already had lots of problems mostly because I want to pursue my dream of becoming a data analyst for professional league of Legends teams and She thinks this is really stupid and it's only a dream that won't come true, but I'm pretty good and already got offers that weren't good enough to drop out of my Bachelor, but still I study statistics and this Is really valuable for teams that look even for people with no knowledge at all of the game, and I've been top 1%(diamond+ for those Who know LoL) of the european server for almost 3 years now doing analysis by myself of gameplay and coaching of single players.

B basically have a low consideration of me like I'm still a teen that Just wants to play videogames and find a way to keep doing it.

I did the IB diploma so I don’t really have a GPA, but I tried to convert it and it was about a 4.0 weighted (with an upward trend). 

SAT - 1360 (I know this is bad, but if you’re applying to the school of cinematic arts at USC they aren’t going to care too much, just try to make sure you’re at the 25th percentile at least, but it matters for other schools) 

*Hooks*

First gen, LGBT+, international (not really a hook but I tried to make it one), no aid

*Recommendation Letters*

English Teacher - this one would’ve been REALLY good. my teacher was really excited to write it and I love English and had a ton of participation in class discussions so he would’ve had a lot to say

Film Teacher - Helped explain a bad grade I got, and I think he wrote about my enthusiasm for all kinds of film and how I made LGBT+ and feminist films

Counsellor - not really sure about this one, wouldn’t have been bad, but wouldn’t have been glowing either 

Boss from summer internship (only for USC) - don’t think this would’ve been amazing, but he would’ve been able to write about my enthusiasm for design as well as working with other people

*Extracurriculars*

- Video Internship with company that makes videos for kids (1.5 years)
- Video Internship with marketing company, made videos for large aviation org (1 year)
- Digital Marketing Summer Internship at edu-tech startup (&lt;2 months)
- MUN (2 years) [won best delegate at national MUN]
- Founding member of student tech help desk at school (2 years)
- Yearly Web Design Competition leader at school (4 years) 
- Built houses in Laos (1 week) - bad lol not sure why I even put it on my app 

*Essays*

These are CRUCIAL for film schools so make sure you do them well! If you want any specific info feel free to ask!

Common App: Story about how stories I read as a kid (like Tracy Beaker) that featured strong female characters inspired me to be more confident so that I could win MUN, but how the real prize was being able to pursue my interests w/o worry and make friends too!

b8jt5g,4,2019-04-02,I am trying to choose either Computer Science or EE/ECE. Which career job is most likely to be monotonous?,leboi22,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/b8jt5g/i_am_trying_to_choose_either_computer_science_or/,"Hello, I am on my first year of community college but I am still undecided about what I should major in. I skipped a year of school just because I didn't have the answer to this question and its still very tough for me. I havent spoken to many people in either profession. What worries me is the actual sticking to your job and working for someone else part since it seems once you pick something you will need to do for a very long time so I want to be sure that I enjoy what I do and that I dont become miserable and find that I wasted my time/money. 

With that said, I am not picking ECE or CS for the money. I truly have a passion for it as far back as freshman in high school. I took time everyday to read physics and electrical engineering books, go to the library, and I especially invested a large amount of my time learning programming. I taught myself to program to the point where I can say I learned it enough to specialize in the Javascript ecosystem and I am fairly good at it. I have launched various small projects since 2015 and a couple months ago launched a React native (javascript) app that has about 2k users and actually makes some money (not much, about 200 a month) from real paying users which is awesome. However I am starting to feel a bit burnt out by the fact that many of my ideas haven't really taken off and a software project takes months to complete for it to inevitably fail and you realize you just wasted your time. I know this goes for EE too but it seems in EE the challenge itself makes it worth it. Anyways, reality has set in and I've realized that for the time being I should pursue a degree and work for someone else to be able to sustain myself.

I like coding but I dont really like the sitting down all day aspect to it and I dont like how its for the most part intangible. I prefer ECE because it is more rigorous and because having ECE skills enables you to develop technology in some of its purest form. I like robotic systems, specifically anything mobile (rockets, automobiles, boats, etc). My primary reasons for ECE/EE are

1. ECE seems to be more ""practical"" than CS (CS locks you into the digital realm whereas the possibilities of EE projects are much more numerous)
2.ECE is much more of a raw science and more rigorous which I like
3.might be a misconception but it seems like ECE has higher paying jobs with lower competition if you are actually skilled and specialize in it. There are a ton of CS majors which has created inflation and more competition.
4. This reason is kinda a double edge reason. I know much more CS than EE and since I love learning I want to pay for a degree where I will actually learn more.

Now my reasons for a CS degree

1. I think I might already be able to land an Entry level job without a degree with perhaps I just need an internship to obtain some office experience. 
2. I really love CS and have invested a ton of my time into it, I know if I enter the field, give it my best and have that cash reward as opposed to just doing it for free, I could become a great programmer.
3.A CS degree is easier, both to get into and to land a job in. Havent looked at the specific salaries but I know entry level is aroung 60k here in FL.

some cons about CS

1. I hate sitting down in front of a computer for 8 full hours a day just typing. When I program I usually fully concentrate for 30min-1hour take a 30 minute break and then continue coding. I could do this well into the night, i just would hate that pressure of my employer expecting me to code my best 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, all the time. I would burn out.
2.Being that I have spent a lot of time in front of a computer, there have been some occasions where I get extreme migraines where I cant even stand up or open my eyes. Its a b!tch to endure and I need to abandon all screen time for a week or two.

Even though I have made this about CS vs EE because they are my top two choices, ive also thought about

1.Mechanical Engineering(almost a complete noob in this)
2.Statistics(specifically actuary/data scientist)


Sorry for the long rant but I would appreciate some input.

TLDR- Would appreciate if you could shed some insight into what you would consider is you had to choose between CS and EE."

Fall 2019 Course Selection for Career Goals,keepitsalty,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/b8l7ig/is_it_too_early_for_this_fall_2019_course/,"I just got accepted into OMSCS and am really excited to get started. From what I understand, registration can be a tricky beast. Thus, I'm not putting any weight on _when_ I will take these classes. But at the moment, these are the classes that I think will really give me the knowledge to boost my career. 

Some background on me: I have two BS degrees in Financial Economics and Applied Mathematics - Statistics. I'm currently in between undergrad and grad school doing an internship at a national lab. I'm really fascinated with research that sits at the cross-roads of CS, Statistics, and Economics. I'm not sure if that means I want to be a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Software Engineer but I want to do something along those lines. For example, this framework would be a dream for me to work on: 

https://github.com/idaholab/raven

My current plan is to eventually pursue a PhD in Statistics but I want to get industry experience and I believe that nowadays you have to approach this field from the CS route. Too many mathematicians stick their nose up at technology and ML in general, and DS seems too vague to really invest a lot of time and money to potentially end up as a business analyst. 

So to wrap things up, I want to be a research scientist working on tools that leverage statistical modeling, require high performance computing, and are in the domain of economics. (Is that really so much to ask?! haha I also realize that the need for a PhD is almost certainly required but I haven't made it that far yet.)

So here are the classes I am thinking of taking. Please let me know if you believe this will aid in my path to getting to where I want to go. 

**Core:**

* Graduate Algo

I'm currently a freshman Computer Science student in Canada in a co-op program, meaning that as part of my degree I must take part in five to six 4-month, paid internships related to my field of study over the course of my degree, the first of those internships taking place this coming May to August. I was originally set up with one such opportunity when the employer cancelled the position two weeks ago and have been since left to find a job in the remaining time I have left before May begins at risk of failing this term (my program has six work terms in it but you are allowed to ""fail"" a maximum of one of those terms, meaning you may be unemployed for one of those terms and still obtain your degree).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been searching on Indeed and the individual websites of potential employers and I have applied to many places already but I'm still looking for more opportunities. If anyone hear knows of any, please let me know! It must be paid and software-related to qualify, and must take up the better part of four months. I'm based in Toronto/Waterloo area in Ontario, Canada but am willing to relocate, and have experience with Java, C, and Scheme.

Hi everyone. It is a rather long post but i realy need your guidance. I feel trapped right now. Please help me.

Let me intoduce myself:

I am a 4th year student at one of Turkey's best universities, studying math with a 3.25 gpa. I will graduate next semester i hope. I came to my university to be a math professor, but the things have changed. I was lazy and procastinated everything for the first two-three years of my studies. It is due to depression and anxiety. I recovered a lot since then but not completely, i believe. For the last year or so I don't want to be a mathemathician, because i think i am not great at it. Recently, i begin to think a data science career would be great for me.

The problem is i didn't have any courses related to Data Science other than Probabliity and introductory C++, don't know any programming language, and didn't have any internships.

My escape plan:

I think doing a MS. in computer engineering in our school, or better, doing a M.S related to Data Science in Europe would be my best plans (I would reaaly love to work and live in Europe). However, i have to support myself by working while studying, since i don't have any money. So i thought studying in a public German university while working would be the only choice i have in this situation. (I don't know German, too :D). For example, Munich Technical University has a Mathemathics in Data Science Master program. But it would be hard for me to get accepted, i believe.

This is my plan. Do you have any other alternatives, and do you think plan plan sound good? Or what are other German, or European schools can i apply, and support myself while studying?

Thank you for reading."

However, the internship is focused on embedded systems and I have much more interest in other software engineering applications with higher level languages like creating RESTful APIs or managing databases. (the company has all sorts of software engineering positions)

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm wondering is lets say I land the internship. Afterwards, lets say the company likes me enough to offer me a position full time. I would assume that they would want you to continue working on the same product or team? That would make sense to me...or is it reasonable for someone to do a software engineering internship with one team and then start working with a different team afterwards?

&amp;#x200B;

Basically what I'm trying to determine is whether I should even apply to the job...I love the company but am not super interesting in embedded systems in the long run (more of like a side interest for me)...I feel almost like I'm deceiving them if I do an internship with a certain sector and don't really have interest in pursuing that in the long run for a career, just to get my foot in the door with the company. I mean they could spend a lot of time training me all for me to just want to work with a different team and toolset on different applications.

I graduated with my BS in Aerospace Engineering in December. I always did well in school, and I did exceptional at both of the internships I completed.

At the beginning of each internship I was given adequate training and resources, as well as given a mentor to whom I could ask any questions I have.

Fast forward, here I am. 3 months into a new job, and I am starting to get discouraged. The role I am in is very technical and I use what I learned in school on a daily basis. My department is very small, and I work directly with 2 other engineers on our project, both of whom are very nice/helpful. I was given no organized training and basically thrown straight into a project with a very short deadline. Every day feels like a struggle to keep my head above water. I have been asked to complete tasks that are far above my experience level and it is very hard to ask my coworkers questions as I don't want to constantly pull them away from their work, placing our project even further behind schedule. I have been putting in long hours to try to get my work done and make a good impression, but it is very hard to be successful with the training I have received and I feel like I am set up for failure.

Pretty cheap compared to some colleges, but the problem I have is I have 2 years free at my community college and my state also offers something called NJSTARS II which will pay for your second 2 years at a state University if you maintain good grades and a few other requirements. 

My concern is that I will have trouble getting a good internship that I will be happy with which will impact the job I get after college if I start off at community college.

b8tjth,17,2019-04-03,Existential crisis anyone?,fluffypiranha20,UCSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/b8tjth/existential_crisis_anyone/,"Anyone else just having an existential crisis here? 


I keep getting advice from smart, educated people but it’s stuff that doesn’t really help or make me feel better. Honestly just confuses me or reiterates what I have been told a million times.


I don’t even know where to begin for this post or what to expect as the outcome, so sorry for the jumbled mess.


But it’s mainly around my future career, internships, life, you know all that stressful stuff that you only get one shot at. 


Short background: I am a Junior female COGS, machine learning major. I transferred from CC this past fall as a CS major but switched. I have had jobs since I was 16 in management, tutoring, and now a mundane office job. I also play a D2 sport. My main interest is in AI and video games.


You ever just look around and see a bunch of people and think I’m glad I’m not that guy, he’s not going anywhere? Then take a second and think what if I go no where? Some of the places I’ve worked at have such incompetent people. But so many people have their own cars, homes, and families, so it can’t be that hard, right?


I spend so much time looking for internships or jobs online that I find interest in. But I keep running into the qualifications and think there are probably so many people that are better than me for this, or I don’t think I know enough about programming and freeze whenever someone asks me a question. Then have a shower conversation with myself of a million better ways I could’ve answered.


Now I’m supposed to graduate next year and I feel like I’m not ready to lose all the resources and people here but at the same time I want to do something with my life. 

Now, I’m not lazy, depressed, or unwilling to work. I don’t have any debilitating health issues.  I don’t have anything hindering my performance. I genuinely am happy.


I pride myself on my work ethic and competence. I guess I just struggle with the first steps. I make great relationships and get promoted quickly. But just getting the job or talking to people, hanging out, going for lunch, submitting my resume, going to interviews, it’s a lot. I am fine now with a stable job, good grades and I’m healthy but what’s next?


I already feel like I’m running around from place to place, barely getting a break. So how do I do more and maintain everything else? I don’t want to give up my grades or my sport. My job I can if I get a better one that’s paid. 


TLDR: I am competent but feel totally incompetent at the same time. How do you know you’re making the right choice? How do you know the next step to take? 


Any advice, anyone struggling with the same things, or different but similar things, please just let me know this isn’t an isolated existential crisis.

b8tr8j,7,2019-04-03,Is it bad that I'm already questioning my partner's commitment this early into the startup?,Hazemt3,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/b8tr8j/is_it_bad_that_im_already_questioning_my_partners/,"TL;DR at the end

I had an idea a month ago for a startup related to the sports industry. My friend and I are both very passionate about sports and he's fairly smart so I just talked to him about it and about the idea of turning it into a business. He was instantly into it, and later that day we developed a very long plan to how we would execute it, from building the brand, gaining users, marketing, getting funding. Now, we're both still students and don't have any startup experience, so this will also be a big learning curve for the both of us.

We have a shared calendar set up where we put in all tasks and deadline we would like to accomplish. The only problem right now is that we live in different cities, because I have an internship a few hours away. I am expected to go back end of April though, so not a big deal. However, for the last month or so, I've been repeatedly trying to schedule phone/skype conversations with him where we could discuss certain aspects of the business, as well as work on some tasks that require both of our input. Now due to work and school, I only try to have no more than two of these per week, and 1 in person meeting on weekends (I go back on weekends). Initially, he always agrees. The first week where we got this set up, he already cancels one of the meetings without rescheduling, whatever I say, it's not like we have **too** much work to do.

Last week, same thing. He's going to watch hockey game on Tuesday with his dad, so cancels. Ok, no big deal. But he's going skiing on Wednesday as well. Sure, let's just work on Thursday then. I text him after I get back from my 8 hour shift asking him when he'd be free to spend a few hours. He says he's working until 8 and then he will give me a call. 8 o'clock, nothing. 9 o'clock, nothing. Only at 10pm does he finally respond and we do as much work as my tired self can do at 11pm after a full day of working. 

Fast forward to yesterday, we have a quick chat over text about some great ideas that we could implement and this really excites the both of us. We end up setting up some common work time for what is now today, so we can really discuss how to implement what we we're talking about. I text him at 8:30PM, asking him where he's at. He says he's out drinking with 2 friends and won't be able to work on it tonight. Mind you, he confirmed that he was going to work on this at 3PM, **earlier today.**

At this point, I go on a little rant and I explain to him that this can't continue like this. That I shouldn't be on his tail all the time to work on this and that if he feels like this is already a hassle this early into the startup, before any of the real challenges actually come up, that it isn't for him. He tells me ""we'll just do it tomorrow"". Only thing is we already had something else planned for tomorrow, and this has just pushed everything over one day. He is quite stubborn too so arguing with him is just annoying because it makes him seem like he doesn't care. I tell him: ""Look, just because we're friends does not mean that I'm gonna be chill with you just acting however you want whenever you want. If you aren't motivated enough to work on this then it's completely fine, just let me know so that I can find someone else. This isn't a school project, I expect you to be mature about this"" 

He then replies that he's sorry and he really believes in the business, and that he would be working on this full-time if he wasn't in school. Then again, he cancelled to go drinking impulsively... He says that he wants to work on this and will be more proactive in the future. I have my doubts as it's already the 2nd time in just 3 weeks we have a talk like this. I'm seriously considering finding a new partner before I just get really fed up with him and let it ruin our friendship.

Also, to reiterate, I'm very flexible with his schedule. However, I do think he's still immature, so he will often prioritize fun over other things. Whenever he has last minute work, a family function, or even anything that was planned in advance, I have no problem adjusting my schedule to adapt to his. Mind you, I am the one working 40 hours a week, and right now 25+ hours on the startup. It's only when things like today happen that really annoy me. 

I'm not sure if it's the long distance that is causing this, and maybe being together in the summer will make everything easier.

Or maybe it will make it worse, who knows.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Went into a startup with my friend. He loves the idea and is constantly reminding me about how much he wants to make this successful. However, he never puts in the physical hours and I always have to almost convince him to set up some time to work on this together. He then cancels these meetings for immature reasons, like going to hang out with friends, or going out drinking, without rescheduling, most of the time last minute. He often just says ""we'll do it tomorrow"" without even thinking what that implies. I then question him about his commitment, just telling him that I have no problem with him moving on if he isn't mature or motivated enough. He reassures me he absolutely wants to continue doing this. I'm not too sure what to do."

I’ve been admitted to USC dornsife for their IR and global economy major. I’ve also been admitted to UIUC to their James business honours program as well Babson college. As of now I’m probably gonna do business or Econ. I’m deciding between these three schools and I’m quite confused. I know the business school at usc is really good but an internal transfer isn’t guaranteed. The biggest problem with usc and babson for me is the cost (70-75k). My family can afford it but I don’t know if its worth the extra 20k a year as compared to UIUC, which is coming up to around 45-50k. Would the internship opportunities be the same at these schools and after graduating how would the placements look like? 

Thanks a lot :D

I am about 22 days away from graduating with a degree in Business Management with a minor in Sports Management. Throughout my time at the university, I have been fortunate enough to have participated in tons of internships, volunteer work, and actual jobs that relate to the sports management field. A majority of my experiences have been specific to sports event planning/management/operations. Towards the end of my college career, I have had the opportunity to gain leadership positions in large-scale and small-scale events with about 20-50 people under me. 

While all of these experiences have been a huge benefit to me in my personal and professional development. I am at the stage where I am struggling to get even an interview with any type of sports related companies/organizations. After some reflection, I am not even that dedicated to the sports industry. What I am dedicated to is the work attributes that the sporting events have provided me. 

This has had me going on a search for jobs containing these specific attributes: 

* The ability to lead a team
* Problem-solving on a daily basis (problems large and small)
* High stress/fast paced job environment 
   * I love being constantly moving all the time, always on the go doing critical objectives. 
* Thought provoking tasks/work
   * I hate menial, repetitive tasks. I like my work to mean something and contribute to the overall goal. 
* Jobs that require me to think fast and think critically. 
* I do not want to ride a desk, I would prefer always moving. 
* Planning and orchestrating anything. Does not have to be events, maybe even how to reach a goal. 
* I'd prefer not to do lots of labor, however I am not against it.
* Interaction with people
* Not heavy on the math 
   * I am not smarter than a 5th grader when it comes to mathematics 

Does anyone have an ideas that would fit any (if not all) of these points? I have done some research, I just have a mental block that stops me from thinking about anything besides sports related opportunities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any input you have would be wonderful! I am on a search to find a place I could be happy and grow. Sports is not what I am dedicate to, but rather the points I have listed above. Sports have just been where I could find a lot of those points. 

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate all of you! Have a wonderful rest of your week. :)

b8xq60,23,2019-04-03,[Serious] 3rd year CSE student in a meh-tier college; would like to study further (but not necessarily research) but tired of the typical Indian education system. Looking for options.,LightsKnifeSpyglass,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b8xq60/serious_3rd_year_cse_student_in_a_mehtier_college/,"(Sorry for the long post, this is half a rant and half a request for advice.) 

As I said, I'm tired of the Indian education system. College consists of teachers reading from slides half the time, exams consist of memorising everything, even code; we're still learning about CRT monitors for no real reason, and worst of all we're treated pretty much like children (though it's not as bad as in some colleges) with attendance, dumb assignments, and worst of all lab files that are just tedious busywork involving writing out code on A4 pages.

I do want to study further, though. Just...in a decent university. One actually worthy of being called one. So I'm trying to explore my options.

IIT/NIT/IISC are out of the question. First of all, from what I've heard IIT and NIT aren't that great on the whole ""being an actual university"" thing anyway; secondly, I know my strengths and weaknesses and I know that there's no way I'm going to get in the top 1% on the GATE. There's simply too much bullshit in that exam. There's too vast a syllabus, too many questions that require you to know and have practised a shortcut a billion times rather than actually understanding the question - it's just the JEE's big brother. Talking of which, I actually did much better on the JEE than I expected - managed to just clear the cutoff - which is why I'm in a meh-tier college rather than a shit-tier one.

However, as I said, I know my strengths and weaknesses. My English is pretty good, and when the syllabus for exams is smaller and has less stuff to memorise, I do pretty well on exams. (I got above 90 percentile on the SAT for example. Hardly Ivy League level but like...good enough that if I was American I'd probably be studying at a T3 college with any luck. I did get into a few colleges, but got no scholarships so zzz.) I think I could do okay in the GRE, but the vocabulary is pretty crazy there. Also, going abroad is expensive.

 I've only just started wondering if I should maybe go the MBA route - I should be able to do decent in the CAT, but it's pretty unlikely that I'll be IIM level good, and I'm just not sure if an MBA will be decent enough for me anyway.

As for coding, I'm again, _okay._ I'm obviously way ahead of all of the people in my class who're basically just taking CSE because their parents told them to; but I'm not on the level of some of the guys there who do coding contests all day or fiddle with algorithms, etc. I've done a couple of small projects, but nothing that really matters, nothing to really put on my resume.

I'm searching for an internship now, but it's looking really difficult - only ones I can find seem to want a very long duration, and my college won't allow me to do that; I can only do internships during the sem break. Obviously, having no internships is a huge red flag to most places, so this is making me wonder if I'll straight up need to do a gap year and work at wherever I get placed before I do a Master's - but I would _really_ want to avoid that if possible.

So to summarize:

- Want to do a Master's but in a decent college.
- Finding decent colleges in India is super difficult and I'm not even sure whether to go for a more technical MBA or a direct MTech
- Going abroad is _possible_, but I don't have remotely the resume for it; I should be able to do well on the GRE, but I _will_ need at least some level of scholarship, and only American schools really accept the GRE anyway, right?

So I'm just really looking for advice on what kind of plan I should have.

b8y32d,27,2019-04-03,Starting my Masters in Embedded Systems - any advice?,Jedibrad,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/b8y32d/starting_my_masters_in_embedded_systems_any_advice/,"Hey everyone,

I'm graduating with my BSEE in about a month, can't wait! I was accepted a few months ago into University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)'s [**Embedded Systems MSE**](https://precise.seas.upenn.edu/education/masters-program) program. I've always wanted to go to an Ivy, so this a dream come true. After my MSE, I'm hoping to move further into avionics / real-time image &amp; video processing / FPGA design.

I'm having a bit of imposter syndrome, though. The degree is split between EE and CIS, and I don't have a very rigorous comp-sci background. I've looked at what the program lists as ""recommended prior knowledge,"" and it's all stuff I've worked with before, just not necessarily in an academic setting.

Here's a list of specialized classes / electives I've taken in my BS:

* Problem Solving &amp; Programming in Python
* Digital Circuit Design
* Microprocessor Systems
* Advanced Processor Systems
* Digital Signal Processing
* Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning
* Digital Communication Systems
* Embedded System Design
* *&amp; the rest of the base EE curriculum: circuits, controls, EMF, microE, C, etc.*

In addition to this, I've been working at a major defense contractor for the past two summers full-time as an intern + my entire senior year part-time (10-20 hrs / week). I've worked with uC and FPGA serial comm interfaces, VHDL modules and testbenches, ADC &amp; stepper peripherals, Red Hat Linux clusters &amp; desktops, radar and image post-processing, Python and C++ algorithm development, GUI work in Java, and software integration with Git / Jira / etc.

I'd say I have a pretty healthy split between hardware and software - although lately, I've definitely shifted more towards programming. With that being said, I've never taken formal classes in data structures, algorithms, software testing, or operating systems, so I feel a little behind.

I was thinking I could take an online class or two from Coursera or EdX over the summer (while I'm working full-time) and fill a couple holes in my undergrad curriculum. Does anyone have recommendations for good (*&amp; hopefully free*) online courses, textbooks to read, or fun projects? Does anything stick out as a **major weak point** in my experiences thus far?

Here's a few classes I was looking at, by the way:

* [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-algorithms-part-i-339)
* [Algorithms, Part II](https://www.classcentral.com/course/coursera-algorithms-part-ii-340)

During my undergrad, I did 1 internship (data science). After graduating with a B.S. in computer science I only did an internship for a couple months. After that, I've been unemployed until now and out of \~200+  applications I've only received \~10 opportunities to interview, which isn't something I want to go through again. Prior to this I was hell bent on doing research as an undergrad, but now I'm more concerned about my future employment opportunities as a software engineer. What should I do?"

Just for some context: I'm a second year EE student but this is my 3rd year in university, basically take less courses to make it easier. 

Been of Feb I started applying to numerous co-ops and internships through online job sites. Everyday after my classes I would try apply to max. 5-10 job postings, would adjust my resume according to posting and as of now I am just still applying.

There's only 2 weeks till exams and end of the semester and most of my friends who are taking 3rd year courses got internships already ( cause my uni has a portal and which makes sense on why they got it ). But I know some 2nd year students who got internships as well. 

As the semester comes to an end, I have only gotten rejection from companies, which makes me feel like I not going to get an internships, even though I don't give up and shit and I'm applying , it just feels like an endless loop now ( if that makes sense lol). 

So, what are some other ways to obtain an internship positions or make my chances of getting an internship better ?

If you got any advice for me, please share "

I recently graduated with a B.S. in Biology in December, and picked up a lab job in January to be able to work and remain in Boston. I went into college pre-med, but after four years I realized that I was not passionate enough about medicine to subject myself to medical school and residency. I pivoted my last semester and thought that with my Biology degree, I could translate that into a career in environmental law. I took the LSAT and did well, but after talking more with some lawyers, I ultimately realized that I wouldn't enjoy law either. 

I've had limited experience with programming in the past, but I think that I would enjoy it. I've taken two courses that involved computer science/programming: Fundamentals of Computer Science and Biostats (which used R). I've also had some light experience with python during one of my internships. 

I'm hoping to apply to ~~internships~~ CS jobs next summer (2020), and I would appreciated any advice. I have a copy of Learn Python the Hard Way. I'm also able to go through the required courses for my undergrad's CS degree, and check their syllabi for topics. Also, I recently found Harvard CS50's youtube videos, and I've been using them to get a very broad understanding of computer science. I've dabbled with HTML and CSS in the past, but I don't really have the artistic eye for more front end stuff. However, it would still be good to learn more about it, though. 

What would you recommend I do to best prepare me for a ~~summer internship or~~ full time job in 2020? I'm open to either a SWE or DE, but I think I would prefer a SWE. 

Also, last note, what are you thoughts on the Software-Engineering Certificate (or Programming Certificate) from Harvard? Since I am a full time employee at Harvard, I can take extension school courses for 40 dollars~~, with a max of two classes a year~~(turns out there is only a cap for regular Harvard courses). Would it better to stay with this current job another year to get the four courses required for the program or simply try to get a new CS job?

Thank you!!"

(Military Veterans Welcome),HuskyZero,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/b90pmc/helpadvice_desperately_needed_warning_wall_of/,"Before you read any further, let me say that it's going to be a long story made as short as possible, to put things into perspective, so someone can give the best possible advice with all the factors involved. Thank you for any advice ahead of time, anything is welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start with saying that I am a veteran. I served in the U.S. Army, honorably discharged from active duty in 2009. Following my discharge, I've had a tough run here in the South Houston area. I've never been happy where I was or what I was doing since I've been out. I've tried to do the whole soul searching thing, to no avail. I've dabbled in so many different career paths, all ending in failure. I've sold cars, worked as an iOS Senior Technical Advisor at Apple, Inc., drove a big rig for a short time, Installation Technician at AT&amp;T, and finally I was an intern as a Process Operator at a chemical plant. The internship was voluntarily given up yesterday for a myriad of reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years ago, I gave up my job as an Installation Technician at AT&amp;T to go back to school. I started working towards an Associate of Applied Science in Information Security. After only a single semester, against my better judgement, the prospect of money pulled me away into an AAS in Process Technology for the petrochemical industry with hopes of giving my family an amazingly comfortable life. This, was a mistake albeit one with the best intentions. 

&amp;#x200B;

After nearly two years of working towards this degree, receiving an internship and literally being a month away from graduation, I've walked away from the internship and the degree program. It isn't it. It wasn't the right choice. I've wasted nearly all of my Post 9/11 benefits and almost two years of my life and time, and that of my family's, to be right back at square one.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that I have EVER been passionate about is computers. Every aspect of them. The quiet beck and call of an IT career has always been in the back of my head. I've always wanted to pursue it (and haven't due to unknown reasons; perhaps simply fear of it being too large of an undertaking), but being that I'm 33 now, I feel like I might be behind the curve while that of some of the other younger generation folks might be on their peak at 10 years my junior. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have 12 months remaining on my Post 9/11 benefits, no job now, and I feel like I'm running out of time to make something happen here. I feel that I NEED a career in IT and I have full-time commitment available to the right prospective path. I feel that it's the only thing that is going to stick. My wife is essentially supporting us right now (I have some income from the VA for school and other benefits), but we need to use the GI Bill to keep the income coming in for as long as possible so we don't sink as we're just *right* there with the extra income from the education benefits. We could sustain as long as the GI Bill BAH continues while I pursue this, if it's even possible.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what is it that I need help with? Well, it's pretty simple. I need the best possible path to get myself into the IT world, that can work within the confines of my remaining GI Bill benefits of 12 months (Vets who've used the GI Bill, you know that 12 months doesn't always mean 12 months with how the VA calculates the time used). I've looked tirelessly and I just don't know where to go, what to look for, what resources are available that're actually legit and recognized as such. I know I'm going to be fighting an uphill battle with the confines of the GI Bill, but I don't have a choice. This is my Hail Mary. The rubber has to finally meet the road here. I desperately need guidance as to where to turn to make this career path a possibility. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some further information to help any recommendations. I have some experience (self-taught) here and there. I've brushed up on a little bit of the new A+ certification, but haven't taken it. I've taken a networking course during that first semester of college, but never took the certification either. I'm currently in the process of dabbling in HTML, CSS, and Python, but with this new ""crysis,"" it's on hold right now. Obviously and of course, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to start at the bottom and work my way up. In no way do I expect to walk away from any training of any kind and start out at $80k+. I'm a realist.

&amp;#x200B;

I do have an itch and interest in InfoSec (primarily and mostly) or Networking. To be honest, I haven't a clue what'll really pop out at me as a dedicated path here after I get started. I don't think I would like to code all day, everyday. But it's a possibility. That's why I've started to dabble in a few languages to see how I feel. So far, not a huge burning desire, but also not a lot of time dedicated to it either. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you've made it this far, thank you. What in the !@#$ do I do? There are so many for-profits, non-profits, bootcamps, colleges, vocational schools, IT apprenticeships and probably other veteran resources that I haven't a clue about. I just don't know where to go or where to start. I know many people might say go the self-paced route with something like Cybrary or Codecademy, but I need to use the GI Bill to keep the funds rolling (but I'm happy to do it in addition to). Plus, I could really use job placement assistance that many of these places offer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm leaving a whole lot of stuff out, but this is long enough as it is. It feels like I'm lost and sinking and I don't know what to do. I'm not usually one to post things like this, and I don't ask for help. I'm too prideful. But as my wife always says, sometimes you *have* to ask for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, Reddit. Veterans. IT Pros.

Would it be a good idea to take a gap year and strengthen my ECs/SAT score or should I just go to a 4-year school and try to transfer?

Initially, I was considering biology, but AP Bio is scaring me away and I don’t think it suits me well enough. I’ve been leaning towards computer science because of my tech-savvy personality and my interest in coding. 

My main concerns are cost and what I really want to major in. My cousin went to ODU, majored in CS, and got an internship and was offered 80k. GMU is also good for CS, and 3-4 of my friends are also going. If I attend ODU, I would live with my one friend. He’s pretty much set on ODU. If I went to ODU or GMU, I would major in CS, and Biology for VCU. What about transferring?

Berkeley's known to deflate grades (course policy is to keep the average grade per class at a 2.8 - 3.3). I had a good GPA last semester, which was also my first semester, but after taking a death trio of classes I'm afraid that my GPA will plummet. I'll have three more semesters to make up for it by taking less classes per semester (I took this set of courses so I can start upper divs faster) and while I really do feel like I've learned a lot, taking killer exams at 8PM when you're an early sleep just isn't easy.

For reference on how wonky the exams \[here's\]( [https://tbp.berkeley.edu/exams/6137/download/](https://tbp.berkeley.edu/exams/6137/download/) ) one from my data structures class. The kicker is there's no curve to these classes either.

What's shittier is that I thought I wanted to do EE but when I came to cal as an EECS major (I'm a transfer and I applied to EE in every other school but ) I saw how fun cs was and now I want to start a career in that -- but that means that I've got no projects and I'm technically a junior taking data structures and now.

I'm just wondering how stressed someone like me should be at this stage. I don't want employers to think I'm lazy because I'm really trying my best without sacrificing sleep and exercise (I already sliced away any social life I had).

Any insight or advice appreciated.,mmmmmNope,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b9c8cm/a_position_has_opened_up_not_sure_i_want_it_any/,"A little less than a year ago I took a low-level job in an animal welfare organization. The position was a small step down for me but it's the sector that I want to be in (and had no previous experience in) so I figured I get in, get some experience, and hopefully either move up there, or to another position at a different org. 

Ten months in and this job is doing absolutely nothing for me. It's not much different from the very first job I had when I was 15 and I'm not being developed professionally at all. 

There is a summer position that usually goes to an intern that I asked to be considered for and was basically told that if they could get coverage on my current team it would be mine. That job has the word ""coordinator"" in it, so at least it would look better on my resume than ""office associate."" I've also expressed interest in the fund development side of things and am trying to pick up little projects here and there to prove that I'm serious and actually have some professional skills. 

I had originally planned to see how this summer goes. Do I get that coordinator position? Once I'm on the admin team can I spin that in to something permanent? Can I wiggle in to fund development? And if not, then I'd look for work elsewhere. BUT now the lead on my current team just quit and another full-timer is likely going down to part-time in a few weeks, which means in order for me to get the coordinator position, they will have to find even more coverage than they originally thought. It doesn't look good for me, but this all went down only 2 days ago so no one has said anything about it. 

Then there's this .... the executive director wants to fill the lead position internally and there are only two candidates that makes sense. Me and co-worker B. B would be good at it, but is somewhat unreliable with attendance and is going to ask for a significant raise that he probably won't get. And I don't think he really wants the job anyway. I don't necessarily want that position, because I don't think having ""lead"" on my resume is going to do much, there are a few members of the team that are frustratingly unmanageable, and I don't want to be on that team for very long anyway. I need to move up or out. BUT if I'm not going to get the coordinator position, the extra money would be nice until I can get something else. 

Any thoughts, advice, and/or insight would be helpful. 

Taking this job was a gamble and lately I've been feeling like I lost. But there's still time to turn things around.

Hey all. 

I graduated with a degree in MIS (not IT per se) in December. My resume includes a data internship (mostly repairing db and queries), a stint in the military (fixing heavy equipment) and a self run tech sales based llc for the last 4 years (lot of in person sales;net around 35k/year working that part time).

I was just hired hourly (FT) as a solution support analyst at a IT company (basically handling cases and proposals in salesforce).

They mentioned they will look at direct hiring in 6 months but as it's just a contract job I assume they could rinse and repeat vs starting a salary and benifits. I make $22/hour right now with no PTO/benifits/and a mandatory 9 hour day (with hour unpaid lunch alotted oye)

 

As such I'm looking at getting into a entry level field in IT/my degree that has room for advancement. Option to work remote or even a decent part time gig would be awesome as my llc that can net me some on the side if I have the time allocated. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm posting here as well as other forums to try to see what I should expect/be looking for in the Northern Midwest sort of area. Looking for reccomendations of positions to look at, salary ranges to expect, possiblilty of more flexible positions etc.

It helped but only slightly bc I always found myself straying away from the tasks I needed to commit to doing and I found it took me really long to complete certain tasks that should take at most 30 minutes. I had stopped going to my psychiatrist bc I wasnt able to manage a schedule with seeing her so I was again using methods of taking caffiene and trying to manage what I could.  I realized that not being able to hold on to tasks was getting to my head and having a multitude of thoughts was affecting to my mental health in ways where i became unmotivated to tackle my issues head on. so I ended up eventually going to my college's counseling services where i was placed a psychiatrist who prescribed me 30 mg of vyvanse after telling him about my experiences. The first time I took the pill I was extremely jittery, felt anxious, and my heart was beating really fast. I also feeling the need to exhale to cool myself down and it made my mouth so dry so I kept drinking water. It took a long time to have an affect so at first I thought it was a placebo. But i realized it made me extremely productive, i cleaned my living room, bed room, and organized whatever i could before tackling my homework. I ended finishing my hw very quickly and applied to an internship i've been procrastinating on. It was the most productive i've ever been on a short amount of time. I felt that this pill wasnt something I would like to do everyday though so I only take it on days where I feel I need to, especially when my attention is toward whats important. today, I took it again, and I honestly felt less jittery this time. Still feeling very productive, I am actually on the pill as I am typing this post. I was very attentive in my microeconomics class and took some organized notes, although i dont feel as much as a rush I was feeling before when I took it the first time. I'm not sure if this is a placebo effect but if it is can someone let me know of their experiences and if it's similar to mine."

Cons: Very large school, which I'm concerned I may get lost in and end up a bit lonely. 
May not have access to as good internships and coops than in the US. 


Northeastern Pros: Solid CS Program. 
Very good access to coops and internships because of location in Boston and connections to Silicon Valley 


Cons: Less well known and less highly ranked than Northeastern.


Notre Dame Pros: Comparable good program to NEU and even a bit more well known than NEU
Strong and friendly community and alumni network


Cons: Unsure about the access to good internships 
Location kind of isolated
More white and less diverse than the other 2 schools


I want to learn a lot in college and prepare myself for working in the tech industry, while still having a good time and a great student life. Right now, I'm leaning towards Northeastern because of the opportunity to progress in the tech industry, but UTSG is still a choice because of the uncertainty of living in the US right now. Notre Dame is number 3, but I'm definitely considering it a lot less than the other 2 schools. 


I also have the option to choose UBC, NYU Shanghai, Purdue, Boston University, Santa Clara University and UMass-Amherst, but the 3 schools I mentioned are my top choices. What are your thoughts on where I should go and why?

I have also lost the motivation and my interest in the field due to the lack of satisfying and rewarding outcome (I tend to blame myself for this, but I had almost no supervision during the last year). If I stay in Academia I will most likely be jumping from post-doc to post-doc contract in mediocre/low level research groups for the next decade.

I have recently started to consider pursuing a career in Data Science: job offers seem to be abundant and the salaries are good, plus it seems that it is possible to work in many different fields once you are experienced (which is something I love since I'm interested and curious about many, many things).

&amp;#x200B;

I currently lack the core-set of technical skills a data scientist should have (R, Python, SQL, Statistics, etc.) and I will not have that much time left to take on-line courses until I write and defend my thesis. However I have strong experience working with other programming languages and I know that I could easily get familiar (not talking about proficiency) with everything needed in short time. After all, everything should be conceptually much easier than the theory of my PhD/MSc and I also have a good background in Statistical Mechanics.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys have any advices or experiences to share on how to make this transition? I am a bit afraid of the real world after I finish. Also, what would be the most optimal way to get a data scientist job after the PhD? I have thought of looking for an internship, but I do not know if I could just do it by taking on-line courses and doing things on my own.

b9gs0n,77,2019-04-04,Was it Worth Studying a Data Science Masters? (My experience),osbornep,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/b9gs0n/was_it_worth_studying_a_data_science_masters_my/,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Since completing my Masters in Data Science, I have had a number of people contact me asking for my experience with the course and whether it is worth recommending. Therefore, I thought it best to summarise my decision for starting the course, what I have achieved during my studies, and the outcome in the years following. I created this article for Medium but thought it would be good to post it here as well to help discussions as I often see questions about Data Science Masters and whether they are worth it. 

### Why did I choose to study Data Science?

It was the spring of 2016 and I was coming towards the end of a 6 month internship at one of the largest consulting firms in the City of London. I had taken this role to gain experience and figure out whether becoming an Actuary was the correct route for my career. I quickly found passion in the data analytics of the role as I was being pulled into meetings to discuss numbers I had crunched or was able hack together a tool to automate previously manual tasks. However, I also found that the traditional track I would be heading on if I moved onto the graduate scheme no longer interested me due to years of standardised exams and little to no creativity. Furthermore, most of my work at this point was within Excel and I was gaining little to no coding experience.

It was at this point I also started to explore a magical term that kept coming up in my job searches: *Data Science*. I had come from a background in mathematics and, due to the nature of the job market in the UK, had been nudged towards the well-founded traditional roles such as accountancy and actuarial consulting. And yet, here was a new role that defied all the expectations I had set for myself of my future career. Where becoming an Actuary I would be solving problems by learning regulatory standards, Data Scientists are encouraged to creatively find solutions that fit within the commercial environment. Furthermore, the role opportunities were no longer fixed into a few select firms but almost all companies were looking for some variation of a Data Scientist and the idea that I could move into a completely new industry, from fashion to finance, greatly appealed to my interests.

However, as I started to apply for Data Science roles it quickly became apparent that **I was lacking two key skills: applying Machine Learning and coding.**

### What were my options?

The first solution was to simply teach these myself, I had the statistical experience to learn machine learning and had done enough coding in MatLab to feel confident that I could learn Python or R. However, if I was to do these I was unsure if this was enough and how I would clearly demonstrate my newly acquired skills on a CV to employers.

I considered online boot camps but they were often fixed in their content and I was unsure of how repeating someone else’s work would be received by employers. Furthermore, there was no guarantee that these were credible to employers and were expensive to self fund. Today, only three years later, the list of courses supported by universities makes this much more of a viable option and is something that is definitely worth considering but at the time these were lacking. Unfortunately, boot camps were a costly risk that I was uncertain would pay off.

Therefore, I decided to look for the options available at universities. At the time there were two types of courses that fit within my goals; business analysts courses and computer science machine learning. The former focused on applying analytics within commercial environments but, as this was run through business schools, was far more expensive at over £25,000 for one year of studying. The latter provided the teaching through academic research and focused more on teaching the underlying theory than the application. Furthermore, as this was an academic course run through the Computer Science department, the cost was considerably less for the year at £9,000 (for UK citizen).

### What did I choose?

In the end, I decided to play it safe and commit a full year to the academic masters in the hope that I would gain the applied knowledge in machine learning and develop my coding skills through project work.

Therefore, I joined the 2016/17 cohort of the Data Science MSc at City, University of London’s Computer Science department. This was the second year the course was offered at this university and, at the time, was the only university in London that offered a Data Science Masters (though others had some variations of this).

### What did I learn in the course?

The first term consisted of the three main topics of Data Science: fundamentals of data science, machine learning and visualisations. Each module consisted of a coursework component that we were given a choice of any publicly available dataset to apply our newly learned methods on. With these, I was quickly able to improving my coding skills and even built the confidence to start sharing [these projects publicly](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2017/06/27/test/).

In the second term we had two core modules, Big Data and Neural Computing, and were given the choice of two optional modules. The list of options was comprehensive and enabled us to pick specialisms from computer vision to data architectures. I chose Data Visualisations (a continuation of the first term’s module) and Software Agents (the basics of AI by applying Reinforcement Learning). Again, these modules included coursework and with the fundamentals from the first term, I was really able to expand my applications and think creatively. Big Data also introduced text data and natural language processing.

Over the two terms, I had been given a broad overview of most of the Data Science topics and had a deep knowledge of Machine Learning and Neural Networks from the core modules. As we moved into the first component of the course, the dissertation, we were given the choice to complete this whilst in an internship role (and be provided an extension on the deadline to account for balancing whilst working). I found a suitable role, defined my research topic and over the following months applied all the skills I had gained so far towards [applying AI within business](https://www.philiposbornedata.com/2018/03/09/masters-thesis-summary-constructing-a-narrative-using-markov-decision-processes-applied-to-data-visualisations/).

### Did I gain the skills I needed from the course?

I had two goals to achieve; to demonstrate that I understand machine learning and apply these with coding. The course not only provided a clear ‘box tick’ against these on my CV but enabled me to continue to expand my skills after with more and more interesting projects. Part of any job application is to get past the initial checks and I was now doing this much more consistently. Furthermore, as I moved into interview stages, I had all these project to discuss and truly demonstrate confidence in my understanding far more than I would have achieved on my own.

The Masters opened up all the doors that I had previously been knocking on and even had recruiters contacting me directly following the projects I had posted publicly. In the end, I found that I enjoyed the research aspect of my dissertation and the freedom to pursue the field and have since move onto a PhD in Artificial Intelligence. Ironically, this is the last thing I would have considered back in 2016 but as the field is constantly expanding it is incredible to be at the forefront of this, particularly because many problems require an applied mindset and fit within commercial problems and are not simply theoretical.

### What advice would I give to someone considering moving into Data Science?

This is always a hard question for me to answer as each person’s position is different so will try to offer some advice based on my experience. In short:

1. **Establish** that Data Science is the right route for you and find a topic or detail to motivate this. For me, it was the ability to apply data analytics in a creative way and become a valuable asset in a business to help others improve their decisions.
2. **Evaluate** what the jobs you want are asking for and where your set of skills currently fall short. Although I had the technical background, I had not demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning or code and needed something to achieve this. For others on my course, they had not come from maths or stats backgrounds and so needed these to strengthen their knowledge.
3. **Review** the options available to you to gain these missing skills. For example, boot camps are increasingly more credible in the industry but they are often following a single path (i.e. learn on the same data and apply the same methods). This may work for some but I wanted to demonstrate my abilities in unique ways to stand out to employers. If you are considering a masters, thoroughly research the modules and who is organising the course as variations will exists between different departments, particularly business and academic schools.
4. **Expand and challenge** yourself through the course, don’t simply pick a course that covers topics you are already comfortable with to tick a box. Find something challenging that will encourage you to develop new skills.
5. **Demonstrate** your new skills by publishing your projects online, either through GitHub or Kaggle or your own site. Building a portfolio of project has taken me further in any interview than trying to describe these within the time limit would allow.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you find this post useful if you are considering how to get into data science and will do my best to answer any questions you have about this. Am UK time so will most likely reply to questions tomorrow morning when I have some time.

b9hvnn,2,2019-04-04,Should I settle for an interdisciplinary degree?,Pandastry,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/b9hvnn/should_i_settle_for_an_interdisciplinary_degree/,"Hey Reddit,

I've reached excess credit hours at my university and I really don't want to pay a surcharge of $105 per credit for my remaining 10 classes (roughly $3050). I've been told by my advisor that I could finish now with an interdisciplinary degree instead of Computer Science (my major).

I guess my question is how are interdisciplinary degrees viewed in the world, especially in the Computer Science domain? I have 3 internships in the field as well, so would that experience trump the non-technical degree? Should I settle or finish my Computer Science degree and pay the extra surcharge? Lots of questions, I apologise but I hope they can be answered in somewhat unison.

I am currently located in the Lehigh Valley area. I have held two internships while attending university and was also a member of the American Marketing Association (2015-2018). I have been out of work since graduation and have been actively applied to all the entry level marketing positions I can find within a 35-mile radius. I've written more cover letters and have re-done my resume more times than I can possibly account for. I have also attended career fairs, mock interviews, and resume critiques. I have even started applying for marketing positions out of state, saying I'm open for relocation. In college, my internships were part-time so I do not currently qualify for unemployment benefits. My savings will run completely out in about two months so I am freaking out and have fallen in a deep depression. I just applied for a part-time position at Lowe's and McDonald's. I know most of you don't want to hear my problems, and I don't blame you, but I thought I'd reach out because I could use some support before I lose my mind.

kids who are passionate(in rare cases, with good guidance, a few lucky ones are able to fake passion) but not ABSOLUTE geniuses, have been preparing to get into the world’s best colleges from 9th grade (or earlier) and have built their resume accordingly (started organizations, built websites and apps, done internships and small research)

A few rare overachieving geniuses passionate about their field (Olympiad Medalists, Kids who find cures for diseases, make breakthroughs etc.)

Kids with lots and lots of cash


I am naturally inclined to exploring many fields and connecting them. I naturally prefer breadth over depth. I built myself as a rounded individual, the best where I live (my peers call me GIFTED, A GOD, but I KNOW that I’m NOT) at Music, Science, Math, Debate, Quizzing etc. without knowing anything about college admissions.

I am your sterotype Asian Male who’s good at everything with super high scores, but not exceptional at anything, but I ended up being this way without trying to. In fact, I have been ridiculously lazy so far in my life because my intellect is so much higher than those around me (I know for a fact that it is nothing compared many people on this sub alone) and my natural curiosity makes me a fast learner. I didn’t do everything for college. I really enjoy doing lots of different things, but admission officers won’t believe that...

I don’t like one subject much more than the other. I am equally good, and GENUINELY GOOD at whatever I do, and don’t want to give up my diverse interests just to get into a certain college... Besides, I won’t fit in with such focused, passionate people and am not in a position to compete with individuals who have done so much to win a seat already.

I don’t think college should mean shaving down your interests. Instead, it should be an opportunity for deepening and growing them. 

My parents won’t let me attend a liberal arts school as they want me to have the opportunity to work after graduation incase financial issues arise.

What college, if there is any, caters to lost, but not dumb people, like me? People who are hungry to learn more about EVERYTHING under the sun, be it STEM or the Arts.

b9juzv,2,2019-04-04,I'm having trouble negotiating my summer position with my employer?,dumbstupidchild,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b9juzv/im_having_trouble_negotiating_my_summer_position/,"I work for a summer camp year-round doing design work, videography, web, social media, etc etc. I'm a student at the same time finishing up my GD degree, this position actually started out as an internship that kind of evolved into a pseudo full time/part time gig last year. During the winter months I'm brought down to part time. During the summer my role changes a bit and I'm hardly doing any design work - instead I document everything taking video/photos full time collecting content for marketing purposes.

&amp;#x200B;

This summer I'm going to be promoted to a managerial role where I'll be directing a team of about 5 people doing the job I did last summer, as well as fulfilling any design needs the camp may need.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year there was talk about me possibly working remotely during the summer (I didn't hear this directly from my boss) and while I understand that's probably not totally realistic trying to communicate with my team with limited to no internet access; I'm trying to work something out where I can work from the HQ office some days - I was thinking work 4 days on site and then go home 3 days. (The camp is about 1.5 hrs from the office and my apartment) I had brought it up to my boss this morning discussing how the summer is going to go for me and he basically said the most they can give me is 5 days a week on site and then 2 days off.

&amp;#x200B;

I also need to give him an estimate to how much money I need to be making to cover my apartment costs and bills. Generally, all staff get a pay cut over the summer as they're provided with food and housing.( I probably made about $30 a day last year working well over 8 hours)  Last summer I luckily did not have a lease to pay for so it didn't bother me as much. However, I now have a place and live with my boyfriend and my cat. I will need to be making much more than that to sustain myself for 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel really bad dumping my cat onto my boyfriend for the entire summer, especially since I'm the one who adopted him from my parents after he was attacked by my mother's dog. I also feel guilty leaving my boyfriend to sit alone in the apartment for most of the week :/ I hardly get to spend time with him as is and this means we'll have to miss out on going on a vacation together, missing out on conventions, etc. I understand he's a grown man and can take care of himself, but I know if I were in his shoes I'd feel really lonely. I'd take the cat with me so that he could feel like he could leave the apartment for more than a day but the cabin I'll be staying in is about 6x4ft with little to no AC and that's not really fair to him either.

&amp;#x200B;

So, on monday I have to have some sort of estimate for how much money I'll need biweekly to cover my expenses and a schedule in mind.(weekends off, certain days, etc) Do I give them an honest number? I'm thinking that about 1k biweekly would definitely cover everything, but I also don't want to ask for too much. If I work less than 5 days a week I wouldn't be able to make that much. How much cushion should I add?

&amp;#x200B;

This situation is far from ideal, and I feel stuck. I understand that I signed up for a full time summer job, but I think that most aspects of my job can be done off-site. I'd like to be able to spend time with my boyfriend, maintain my place, and make sure my cat is getting taken care of properly. On the other hand... I don't want to ask for too much. What would you recommend I do in this situation?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My current job will be transitioning full time job over the summer the requires me to work on site 5 days a week on-duty that entire time. (Well over 40hrs) I'll be taking a pay cut as well. I tried to negotiate working on site 4 days and working off 3 days, but they don't think that's a good idea given the unpredictable nature of the job. I also have to let them know how much I'd like to be compensated as the current base pay would not be enough to cover my bills. What do you think is fair?"

&amp;#x200B;

A little background first:

* Year: Sophomore
* Majors: Economics, Computer Science
* Semi/non-target
* Prior S&amp;T internship at tier 3 bank, will be returning for summer 2019

&amp;#x200B;

I have been invited to interview for a Nomura S&amp;T 2020 internship, or a Point 72 financial analyst internship through a program that sets up accepted students with partnered companies. Unfortunately, the program only allows me to choose one opportunity to interview. Thus far, I've been leaning towards Nomura S&amp;T. I think I would be more prepared for that interview and I think that my past experience in S&amp;T, although not a  full 8 week internship program, would give me a leg up in the interview process.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of interest, the Point72 opportunity and the chance to work at a hedge fund straight out of undergrad is more appealing to me. However, I have no experience with hedge fund recruiting, and am not sure if I feel prepared to take on that interview. I've also heard that Point72 only extends return offers to 50% of their internship class, and that even if you receive an offer, job turnover rates will be very high. I'm wondering if these statements are accurate of Point72? Additionally, what type of questions can I expect with hedge fund recruiting, or Point72 recruiting specifically?

I would just want to work as a web or mobile developer. I like designing UI/UX but I would be alright with any kind of coding job. 

I don't think I'm motivated enough to teach myself enough to be employable so it seems like my options are a Boot Camp, College Diploma, or University degree. The thing with a degree is it covers so much theory and mathematics which I don't think will ever apply to what I want out of a career. Plus having to take classes for 4+ years seems excessive and the large student loan could be a problem too. I might be able to swing it but I don't feel comfortable taking on that much debt. 

If it's possible to land a junior position with only some education that would probably be the best option for me. Here in BC Canada they have both Bootcamps and Diploma programs. The Bootcamps are about 4 months while the Diploma is 2 years. They both cost about the same.

I feel like a Diploma would be a good middle-ground between self-taught and University degree. If I do my own projects and possibly an internship is it possible to land a Jr. Developer job? How easy or hard would it be compared to having a full degree?

I'm newbie in Reddit, i come here to ask if someone can suggest me something before i do my Technical Interview.
To tell a little bit of my background, I'm an Information Systems graduate, I used to do lots of programming language (especially Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP). But the problem is, i haven't touched till now for like a year, and i forget most of it.

So, apparently, i applied for an internship, and they require me an experience in programming, which i did before, and i was accepted after the interview with HRD.

Now, i'm kinda panic because i only have 3 days before the Technical Interview. Do you guys think it's possible to catch up everything in this short time? I'm trying my best now to review what i've learnt. But, yeah.... i don't know, 
please suggest me something about this.

Thanks guys!"

As much as people say that college prestige doesnt matter much(only to some extent) and it’s more about what you do in college than where you go to, I want to go to MIT. Either as a transfer in 2nd year or in grad school. I just want to go there. I dont care about its prestige, it just has been that distant dream for me since high school. 

Some preface here, i’ve had really bad high school grades, decent ECs and SATs, and have finally committed to a decent undergrad school in New Jersey(for CS) that meets my financial needs.

As much guilt i have of wasting the last 2-3 years, i plan to convert all of it into working as hard as i can so that i can look up to myself and not feel as bad when i graduate. So i’m totally up for working my ass off in college.

From what i could make out, it seems like the first two year of undergrad are pretty relenting, and rigor of courses only goes up in the final two year. (Please do correct me if i’m wrong)
As most people usually ease off the high school and admission stress in the first year, can you suggest me what i can do to get a lead? Also, getting a summer internship under a professor or a company after the first year seems unheard of, so can someone guide me(the courses, projects, other work to take) in order to make that possible? 

Additionally, i’m completely off as to how grad school admissions work, so can you also suggest what exactly does the admission committee look for aside from the usual stats and Internships?

I know that these questions seem naive and quite cliche(“i didn’t get into my top choice help me for grad”), but as much as i feel bad that i didn’t find r/ApplyingToCollege in my freshman year, I dont want to lose the 1% chance i have for my grad school. The most common advice might be “just take it easy, get into college first then think about it in the later years”, but i’m quite a procrastinator already and you dont need to chime in else i’ll be posting the same questions for in some Phd sub 4 years down the line."

Given my situation, should I do it?",Captain-Katsura,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/b9php9/fdm_group_given_my_situation_should_i_do_it/,"First of all, I want to thank you for taking your time to read my wall of text. I appreciate any advice. 

I've scrolled through posts on here relating to FDM group. I've read the Glassdoor reviews. I understand the general consensus. 

I'm graduating with a BE degree in CE this May with a 2.8 gpa and I've only recently started applying for jobs.  I've recently been getting interviews from companies like resideo, disney, etc for entry level positions.. 

However, I lack industry level experience. I don't have any internship experience, primarily because I didn't really commit to applying to any (personal reasons).

 I've done numerous projects (mainly school projects) that uses a variety of skills ranging from software development in Java, C, C++ to hardware development in VHDL &amp; assembly and I'm confident in my knowledge of fundamentals in everything I've learned. 

My only relevant experience is working part-time as an AV student technician for one of the buildings in my university for about 3 years now. But that is not what I want to do for a career. 


Anyways, the junior software dev. position from FDM really caught my attention because of the transition from classroom to industry environment and the training/certifications that reinforce and expand my knowledge in Java with respect to industry standards.  

But we all know the catch.  Subpar salary, and shady compensation w/ 2 yr contract.

FOR THOSE WHO'VE WORKED AT FDM, 
what are the chances you get relocated? I'm willing to relocate, though I already live in NYC with my parents. This is primarily the reason why the compensation doesn't bother me, allowing me to prioritize the experience more than the compensation. Unless I'm relocated elsewhere... But NYC still has the highest cost of living. 

I know I haven't started my job search yet, much less graduated, but reading some of the posts from people who've been job hunting for years is really daunting. 

Given my situation, I'm not sure what to do. Do I take the FDM route? Do I keep looking?  Do I take an internship that leads to a full time position? 

TL:DR
CE student graduating soon but has no industry experience. Already live in NYC, so the FDM compensation shouldn't be much of a problem..  What should I do? 



I'm grateful for any tips and advice.

Hello there, I will be graduating this June and am working full time as a developer for a company that I have done my internship. However there are some missing points; the project itself is not quite challenging and not using new techs and so. The salary was quite low for average salary in the market. I can say that my mates earn 1 to 1,5 times more than that. I could have been reasoning such stuff when I was searching for a job I had to rush to choose a job and so.
Its been 1 month since I started. I can't say the job is hell but I know there are better opportunities too (also I get frequent contact from headhunters). I don't want to leave too early because the company wanted to work with me and I said OK, so I should do my best when I am here. Also, I think 'being employed by a company that I also worked at during the internship' is a good indicator meaning ""He's employable"" for potential employers. Plus I am gaining Java experience so I am getting more experienced for future employers. So I wonder what's the good strategy to follow considering job manners and normals?
Thanks!"

That being said , I had a meeting with my supervisor and his boss to discuss job opportunities and they want to offer me a job on the software development team. I am told I will have an official offer letter by the end of next week.

Recently I got in contact with another company only a few minutes down the road from my internship that is offering a good starting salary and I would be on a team that is just starting a brand new project that sounds very interesting to me. The recruiter also really sold me on the work environment there being not so corporate unlike my current position.

Do I owe it to my internship to stay because they are trying to give me more exciting projects and offering a position that I said I would be more interested in or can I make my decision to change if I wanted to the other company?

b9s9j0,16,2019-04-05,My Experience as a Music Major,taka2424,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/b9s9j0/my_experience_as_a_music_major/,"Hello! I thought it would be interesting to share my experience as a music major for anyone interested. I apologize in advance, this post may be lengthy. 

Currently, I am in my senior year of undergrad at a small four-year university. 
I attended a low-income, high-poverty high school with a limited budget for the arts. Despite my small, struggling school, I had a great experience (or so I thought) with the band program. I started clarinet in 5th grade. I enjoyed making music with my friends so much I decided to pursue a degree in it - Instrumental Music Education. What I discovered was how big of a challenge majoring in music would be coming from a smaller school with limited opportunities. I had no music theory or vocal experience. My clarinet skills were extremely lacking. I was unaware of the need for a private instructor, and my band director was primarily a brass player, which didn’t help my case. I never made all-state. I never even made all-region. This later became problematic in college.

My transition was rough. I didn’t live on campus, so I missed out on a lot of the ice breaker events where everyone met each other. By the first week, everyone seemed to have friends, and I didn’t.  I came to school for classes and practice. My social life took a hit when I started college. I spent a lot of time sitting in my car during breaks between classes and crying. In some way, I didn’t feel deserving of the friendships of my peers due to their advanced musicianship, so I pushed them away and didn’t bother. I was embarrassed by how far behind I was. I had developed this silly mindset that I was there to get my degree and leave. The only thing that did was make me miserable. I was anxious about every social interaction in that building. It took me the first two years to feel comfortable around my peers and to open up and make friends in the music building. My advice to anyone entering college: Go to social events. Make friends. Talk to your peers. Chances are, they may be experiencing similar things. 

Your first couple of years, you take four semesters of Music Theory, Sight-Singing/Ear Training, and Class Piano. These classes are essential to developing good fundamental music skills. A professor once told me their purpose was to weed out the weaklings. I don’t know if that’s entirely true, but I can tell you my first semester of Music Theory had around 30 people, and my fourth semester had 8. You also take private lessons from your primary instrument’s professor, in addition to other music classes over the course of four years. 

All music majors are required to take a fun little class called Recital Attendance every semester of their undergrad. It is a 0-credit, Pass or Fail class. In this class, the 1:00 hour every Friday is devoted to putting on a student recital. 5-10 students perform for the department faculty, staff, and student body. Every music student must perform a piece some point during the semester. In addition, there are these things called “recital credits” that must be fulfilled by the end of the semester. For every “credit” you must attend a nighttime recital and bring a program back to turn into the music office. Our university requires us to complete 8 of these during a semester. That number may vary depending on the university. 

The education classes on the other side of the degree are something else. The music educators are looked at as aliens in the education building. Much of the content we are required to learn is not applicable to the band or choir room. We took Intro to Education, Educational Psychology, Classroom Management, Diverse Populations, Practicums, and Internship. The field experience in the Practicums and Internship are the most valuable experiences the Education Dept. has to offer. With Practicum, you are placed with a mentor teacher in a public school and required to complete 40 hours of observations, teach a lesson observed by your professor, and various other assignments. In Internship, you are placed with a mentor teacher in a public school for the entirety of your final semester. You are observed by a professor 3 times. After completion of Internship, you may graduate. 

As a music major, the schedule is rough. We have the second busiest schedule, right behind the nursing program. Every semester is jam-packed with events, concerts, practice time, education hours, and classes. The set degree plan for music education at my university consists of 130 hours total, around 15+ hours/semester plus some summer classes, in addition to extra hours for all the ensembles you are required to be in if you’re on a scholarship. Most generally finish in 4 1/2 years.

Something that stands out from the past few years is the pros and cons of living off-campus. I still live with my parents, so I get free, home-cooked meals, which are nice. I get to help plan vacations and trips because I’m home all the time. However, it’s particularly frustrating to live off-campus due to all the nighttime events and concerts you are required to attend. You can’t just hitch a ride with a friend like other students do. You either spend your entire day on campus and eat dinner after recitals at 10 pm, or drive home, eat dinner, and drive back and put more miles/gas money on your vehicle. In addition, it’s particularly hard to find quiet time if you live with other people off-campus - not optimal for studying. Living off-campus is great for some people. But for music majors, it’s an absolute nightmare. 

I’m not gonna lie, it’s been a rough four years. However, through all the challenges, all the struggles, all the difficulties, at the end of the day, I wouldn’t change a thing. For every frustrating moment that has made me want to quit, there is an inspiring moment that makes me remember why I did this in the first place. Those moments mean everything to me. I experience them in performances. Practice sessions. Eating lunch with my fellow music majors. Getting to know our amazing faculty. They make this thing worthwhile. 

For anyone wanting to major in music: take any and every opportunity you have to develop as a musician. You will thank yourself later. Get a private instructor that specializes in your instrument/voice. Try out for all-region/all-district. Aim to make all-state band. Work on chamber music. PRACTICE. The only way you can learn and grow is by practicing and developing the skills you need to practice well. 

Being a music major is not for everyone. It will make you angry. It will make you cry. It will frustrate you to no end. But if you stick through it, it will be the most rewarding experience you could ever hope to have. 

Currently, I am in my last semester of classes. I’ve finished all my music and education courses, I just am completing the gen eds I need for my degree. I plan to do my student teaching next semester, and graduate in December. I love what I do! I’ve worked hard in college, and I am proud of my accomplishments. It may be difficult sometimes, but it brings me a sense of pride and joy I don’t experience anywhere else."

As far as I can tell, these are two companies each have distinct pros and cons. There are a few areas where I'd like to get a little bit more input on:

1. Which one will open the most doors for future career prospects? This can be in any regard -- recognition on resume, new connections, etc.
2. At which company am I more likely to learn new skills/do something impactful? At the unicorn, I feel like I'll have a more hands on experience with the actual product.

Basically what happened was I had to leave my off-campus apartment and move back home, but I didn’t want to just keep paying the rent when I wasn’t even living there. My friend recommended that I try subleasing my apartment in a Facebook group specifically for off-campus apartments for my university. It was pretty active and it seemed safe enough, and at this point it was my only option. So when I posted in the group and received a message saying that they were interested, I quickly responded. At that point I was just so relieved at the thought of not having to pay rent for the next 4 months. The person who messaged me said that their daughter was interested in my room because she was going to the university in the fall and needed to move there for an internship over the summer. She told me information about herself, sent me pictures, even sent me her driver’s license to prove that it was her. I was going to call, FaceTime, or meet her in person to further confirm everything but there were two things holding me back from this: 1) She lived on the west coast while i live on the east coast, so it seemed impractical to fly out just to meet her and 2) She told me she was deaf, and i don’t know American Sign Language and I didn’t know if she was able to talk, and I didn’t want to come off as insensitive by suggesting we talk on the phone or on FaceTime. At this point, I just decided to trust her. I hadn’t received anymore messages with offers on Facebook and rent was coming up and I had no money, so I was pretty desperate.

After talking to her everyday just confirming things for about a week she sends me a check in the mail for $4,800. This is where I get confused, because my rent is only about $730 a month and she was only going to be living there for 4 months so if she was going to pay for all 4 months at once the check would be for $2920, maybe she would’ve rounded up to $3000 at most for reservation fees or something. She then texted me to confirm that i deposited the check, so I did. Then, right after i deposited the check she told me that $800 was for the rent and that the other $4000 I was supposed to wire to some car service who was gonna ship the car to the apartment. I was going to ask her why she couldn’t just wire it herself or have her dad wire it because he sent me the check in the first place, but I thought maybe it had something to do with her being deaf. I thought maybe she and her father were deaf and there was some step in the process that required audio or talking that they couldn’t do, so I just went through with it. She kept texting me to confirm that the wire transfer was done and to check with my bank to see if it had gone through and just kept hounding me, it was so annoying. My bank called me about the wire transfer and when I told them all the details, they told me that a wire transfer is completely done online and there should be no reason a deaf person couldn’t complete a wire transfer. They also told me that just because i deposited the check and the amount showed up on my account, doesn’t mean that the check couldn’t bounce. If the check bounced I would be responsible for the $4000, and i was already broke. So I contacted the girl asking her why she or her father didn’t wire the money themselves and she couldn’t give me a straight answer and just kept on trying to find ways to get me to send the money. I told her I wasn’t gonna go through with the wire transfer anymore and she said that was fine. Then, I asked her if she had been in contact with the landlord and she said yes, and when I asked my landlord he said that he hadn’t been in contact with her. I called her out on it and told her I was no longer going to sublease the apartment to her and that I will send back the money once the check is cleared and if it bounces, I was going to report her for fraud. 

I ended up telling the bank to cancel the wire transaction because I suspected it was fraud, but I already spent the $730 on rent because it was due, so I think i’m supposed to put $730 in to make sure my account isn’t overdrawn when the check bounces. But what I’m really worried about is the fact that I gave her my apartment information. I don’t live there anymore but my roommates still do and I’m scared I may have put them in danger somehow. Also I have no idea how to go about reporting this, I don’t even know if the girl in the pictures and the ID were actually who I was talking to. What should I do?"

I've worked internships at small places and more corporate places, and I found I really enjoyed being thrown into the thick of things, being forced to learn a bunch of new things on my own, having an impact on the product and generally not doing the same rote tasks over and over. I also found that I'm pretty good at doing a wide variety of things and generally can handle pressure very well, with some of my previous work involving massive amounts to do + long hours + short deadlines. I have yet to truly hit a wall, so the challenge excites me (and the possibility of failure/breaking scares me).

&amp;#x200B;

The current company I'm considering is very small, (like 10 employees small) and they want to take me on as a business development person though I have no experience in it. This would be completely different from my degree. I can afford to take on the financial risk. My main concern is, even though I haven't really liked working in my degree's field, I worry that completely going in the opposite direction will close off future options and might pigeonhole me somewhere or make it harder to break into the corporate world if it ends up not being for me. I also worry that the pressure at a start-up might surprise me and affect me more than I'm expecting it to. On the other hand, I think that my personality would mesh well with a start-up and I like the elements of project management that a biz dev role would get.

So I'm just kinda freaking out here a bit. Worried about my visa status. I'm attending college right now in the United States. I'm on an H4 visa here in the U.S (with an Indian citizenship) dependent on my parents who have H1-B visa. It's been frustrating to say the least.

I've been living here practically my entire life so this is my home (I moved here when I was very young). Honestly, I'm just anxious right now about what's going to happen after I graduate and get my CS degree. After next year, I'll be an international student (on F1 visa) because that's when my visa expires.

I'm wondering if I'll get a visa sponsorship if I apply for an IT job or will I have to go back to India where I feel like an intruder in my own home.

I'm so anxious about the future.

As of now I'm hopelessly applying for internships but all of them are paid and I'm not allowed to get paid due to my legal status. I tried looking for unpaid internships but to no avail. I need to get more experience these next couple of years. Is there anything I could do to get an internship or any kind of experience that would boost my resume?

So if anyone can reassure me or if anyone has any details on how I can obtain a green card and later a citizenship in the United States. If anyone is in the same situation as myself feel free to hit me up."

Subjects: Prisoners 1-12

Donors: Specimens 1-12 

Abstract:
We are attempting to discover whether certain chemicals made in Humans' bodies can be beneficial to other galactic species, and following that, whether they can be synthesized in a lab. Our problem is that not all species are alike, and that the effects and side effects of these chemicals are unknown in other sapient galactic species. We harvested 12 Humans to use as donors as well as 12 prisoners to subject to testing. We injected these prisoners with naturally produced Human chemicals both by themselves and in varying combinations. The results were inconclusive; nearly ALL of the tests went horribly awry, but we will need to harvest more humans and volunteer more prisoners for testing. It would seem that Humans are uniquely adapted to utilize these secretions in any combination. In these tests we have given the Human names of their body chemicals for clarity.

Test 1:

Prisoner 1

Epinephrine

Prisoner 1 injected with ""epinephrine"". Initial dose too high. Effects included extremely elevated [heart] rate and pressure, constriction of circulatory system, dilation of respiratory organs, dilation of pupils, [nausea and vomiting] before [blood] began leaking from Prisoner 1's orifices. We were not able to stop these effects in time to save Prisoner 1's life. Good riddance.

Test 2:

Prisoner 2

Melatonin

Prisoner 2 injected with ""melatonin."" Prisoner 2 reported feeling tired and wanting to sleep immediately after injecton. Prisoner 2 laid down to rest on cot and immediately fell asleep; unfortunately, while Prisoner 2 DID survive this test, he had a nightmare so vivid that when aroused he was catatonic for several days. Prisoner 2 still refuses to discuss this nightmare, even days later. We did have to fire our intern as he would clap or make another similarly loud and sudden noise upon entering 2's room after the experiment; while the results were amusing (involuntary incontinence) they were highly unprofessional. 

Test 3:

Prisoner 3

Prostaglandin

Prisoner 3 was injected with ""prostaglandin"". Prisoner 3 initially reported no ill effects but attempted to stand up from the table and promptly lost consciousness, fell, and hit his head on the sharp corner of the table. After losing a significant amount of [blood], he was stabilized, operated on, and transfused with fluids. Prostaglandin seems to cause widespread dilation of [blood] vessels; as such, 3 experienced acute onset hypovolemic shock which was made worse by sudden trauma.

Test 4:

Prisoner 4

Leukotriene

Prisoner 4 was injected with ""leukotriene"". After several moments, 4 simply coughed extremely hard, until eventually [blood] and mucus and pieces of his respiratory system were violently expelled. His death did not take long, but it DID look extremely uncomfortable. This chemical is apparently responsible for causing violent contractions in a respiratory system to clear it of contaminants; overdose can have paradoxical effects such as excess mucus production and difficulty breathing.

Test 5:

Prisoner 5

Thromboxane

Prisoner 5 was injected with ""thromboxane"". Effects were immediate. 5's circulatory system constricted and it caused his [blood] to solidify rapidly. This was a fatal experiment and horrific to watch. 5 seemed to be alive and conscious for a short time after administration and effects; the expression on his face is one of agony.

Test 6:

Prisoner 6

Insulin

Prisoner 6 was injected with ""insulin"". Effects were near immediate, 6 immediately degraded into an altered mental state before falling unconscious and having a [seizure]. 6 unfortunately could not be saved, as we are not totally sure of how this chemical works. It appears to  deplete energy levels in the body. Perhaps it could be administered to hyperactive youth, we'd just need to experiment to find the right dosage.

Test 7:

Prisoner 7

Motilin

Prisoner 7 was injected with ""motilin"". Prisoner 7 promptly expelled digested and semi-digested food from the end of his digestive system, violently, before passing out. Upon further thought, perhaps this chemical doesn't have any benefit at all, its effects are rather disgusting. What sick turn of evolution would require this? Prisoner 7 is currently in the hospital ward recovering from this experiment.

Test 8:

Prisoner 8

Oxytocin

Prisoner 8 was injected with ""oxytocin."" Prisoner 8 promptly entered a convulsive state similar to Prisoner 6 in the insulin experiment, except she died with an almost-smile on her face. Residues from her reproductive system were found inside her clothing at autopsy. This chemical may have promising use as a euthanasia drug for our elderly and terminally ill populations. Strict control will be needed to prevent its abuse.

Test 9:

Prisoner 9

Prolactin

Prisoner 9 was injected with “prolactin”. We were initially baffled because there seemed to be no effect, but after a few weeks of testing and daily injections, 9 not only lost any interest at all in mating, but the prolactin stimulated production of fluid in his [anal glands]. We have absolutely no idea why this occurred, but we CAN say that 9’s room will never smell the same, even after repeated chemical and ultraviolet disinfection.

Test 10:

Prisoner 10

Androgen/Testosterone

Prisoner 10 was injected with “testosterone”. 10’s drive to mate was immediately higher, as his reproductive organs began to drip with secretions. Additionally, over the course of several weeks, we noticed both a huge increase in muscle and bone growth at the cost of increased aggression. 10 thought he “heard an aide wrong” and very nearly started a physical confrontation. We tried everything to rectify the situation but nothing we did helped; it appears that 10 discovered a way to relieve the aggression as his cell now glows under a blacklight. The splash-stains even reached the ceiling 10 feet above.

Test 11: 

Pristoner 11

Estrogen

Prisoner 11 was injected with “estrogen”. Being that this was a female prisoner, we figured that the female chemical would make more sense. After just a few short hours Prisoner 11 complained of abdominal cramps, bloating, and wild mood swings. A fortunate side effect was how healthy her skin and spines appeared afterward. Physical aggression was also increased, although this seems to be secondary to the mood swings and not due to increased libido or bone or muscle growth. Further tests will be necessary on male AND female subjects.

Test 12:

Prisoner 12

Cortisol

Prisoner 12 was injected with “cortisol”. While the effects of this chemical were less noticeable immediately, 12 commented that she felt better after exercise, lost weight, and had more energy. Unfortunately, cortisol appears to have had an effect on her body’s natural defenses against disease. One of the Humans managed to break free from isolation one day and “sneezed” on 12 during exercise time, causing 12 to become ill with some exotic Human ailment. 12 quickly became congested, and the inflammation from infection spread to her respiratory system and gastric system. We could not stop the [vomiting] or expulsion of waste matter; she passed away from hypovolemic shock. We DID discover that this ailment can cause voiding of the bowels upon “sneezing”, however. Very unpleasant.

In conclusion, we are not certain exactly what the mechanisms and functions of these chemicals in Human bodies are, except that they seem to be extremely delicate considering how tough the Human body actually is. We believe that all of these chemicals may have pharmaceutical use, such as for stimulation, impotence, aggression, hyperactivity, and... recreation. Further testing and strict secrecy about the effects of these chemicals will be required."

I will be graduating next month with a BS in CS. I have a 4.0 GPA and have completed an Android app, with internship experience in front-end development under my belt. The awesome thing is the app I developed is going to be marketed by my university because I built it through a grant for the state of SC. It’s a health app for tracking health information and finding local health resources using Firebase. I added simplistic buttons for maps, phone calls, quick chrome access for resource websites to each resource in a card view for each location! I wrote the entire app working with all ends and perspectives from the UX, Firebase, SQLite, and even handled a good bit of the marketing including the name and logo. 

My strong suits are definitely in the above, web design, with a lot of work in Java and Python outside of those projects I mentioned above. 

I really have no idea what I want to do, but I love the experience of building something. This pulls me towards front-end design. I have been working with web design since High School so I have a soft spot for it. 

My professor is asking my class to put resumes on job search sites and I have! This week alone I have gotten around 20 inquiries between phone calls and emails from recruiters. I am not interested in most, but I would love some interview experience so I’m playing along.

My question is this; I have no idea what salary I should be aiming for. I am a quick learner and I believe my experience over the past four years has been very rich in learning between all of my classes, but also my mathematics minor. I know this only scratches the top of the ice berg, but I have spent the past eight months not only learning how to make an Android app from scratch, but also having weekly meetings with stakeholders and marketing. I also have given 3-4 presentations so far with a couple more to go. I love speaking. 


I just wanted to try to get a little summary of myself out there. I try to be humble and if it’s not expected to be that high out the gate that’s understandable. I understand that college doesn’t teach you everything from my experience at my internship and this app! 

If you have to put a number on it (outside of the valley) what should I aim for in you guy’s experience? I am willing to move almost anywhere, valley included if you believe I have a chance. Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you!"

Understandably, I've been attempting to scrape through life, with little success working two jobs, and doing whatever I can to get in the University's good graces including taking ethics classes on my own volition, going to voluntary community service, and going to weekly therapy sessions to try to untangle some of this. I recently sent my petition to reapply to the university. Within the next few days I'm keeping my hopes up that they will call me in for a meeting with a dean, and not repeating the texting-while-driving car crash that was my last hearing with them.

ba1qki,9,2019-04-06,Internship Advice,Domo4772,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ba1qki/internship_advice/,"To introduce myself, I am a student studying Information Security and I recently landed an internship at a large IT company. At first I assumed that I'd be doing usual intern work at the office and shadowing full time employees. Of course I took this because I saw it as a way to get my feet wet in a wide range of areas (Security NOT even being one of them). However, it is now the second week and they have sent us on calls to a couple customers. This didn't come as a surprise, because when reading and speaking about the details of the internship, we were told that we'd  go on calls with techs to gain that experience. But what did surprise me was the fact that I am expected to drive to distant locations, by myself, in my own car, and not get reimbursed or whatever for my gas. No one ever mentioned having to drive my own car to customer locations. And it's not like they are paying us a lot in the first place, because it is an internship. 

&amp;#x200B;

After experiencing this stuff, I'm starting to think that this may not be a worthwhile experience. I might as well look for another entry level position or internship geared more towards security. The part that has me hung up is, someone stuck their neck out for me to get this internship. Would I really look that bad if I were to leave? I mean I feel like I have valid reasons, but I just don't like the fact that I may be burning bridges... And I feel like if I decide on leaving, it's better to leave as soon as possible so that the company doesn't waste time on me. What do you guys think?

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to stay, to keep good standing, would staying for only a month and a half even be worth it? In the summer, I have classes and volunteer events that I attend and that would probably be when I'd have to leave. Let me know if you guys want me to elaborate more on something, I'd be happy to.

# A brief history of my issue

I am a very slow learner whenever I try to learn new information or a skill. I have been like this as long as I remember. First time I noticed this was by my inability to remember directions to a place even if I have travelled there a hundred times.

I visited psychiatrists several times and they said I don't have any specific learning disability but does have some issues with memory.

In high school, I could never keep up with the lessons in class. Teachers never understood and complained that I don't pay attention in class. I would go home and study on my own phase until I understood. I am creative and disciplined. I experiment with different learning techniques. Somehow I pulled through and got 3A's and a B in my AL's (Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Maths). 

# Learning programming

I'm in the third year of my Bachelor's degree and currently doing an internship as a software engineer in a good company. 

Conventional programming advice never worked for me. For example.

&amp;#x200B;

**It's a bad idea to memorize syntax. You can always refer to the documentation when needed. When you code long enough you will automatically remember the important syntax.**

For me, I don't remember anything unless I put a deliberate effort to do so. This is not just for programming but even for simple things like a cooking recipe.  After months of no progress, I threw away the conventional advice and started using [Anki (spaced repetition software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)) to start memorizing the syntax I'm working with. I create flashcard decks for all the things I learn.

[https://imgur.com/h6mfope](https://imgur.com/h6mfope)

My flashcards are little snippets like this. (Just a basic example here)

[https://imgur.com/EnXKGkJ](https://imgur.com/EnXKGkJ) \- Front

[https://imgur.com/Z5SDDXO](https://imgur.com/Z5SDDXO) \- Back

&amp;#x200B;

And for the first time in my life, I feel like what I learn sticks in my memory. I started using Anki when learning any new information including people's names.

# Understanding the existing code base

This is the next problem I faced. Again the conventional wisdom is,

**When you work with a codebase you will be familiar with it. Use a decent IDE.**

Again this didn't work. I would never remember the methods or classes I work with. This means that I would also find it very hard to understand the programming logic used. At the end of the day, you have to remember some details about the code to understand it.  I didn't know how else to tackle this. So, I used Anki again to remember the code I'm working with. 

[https://imgur.com/Kwh2inw](https://imgur.com/Kwh2inw)

This felt excessive and people will say that it's a waste of time. But this is the only thing that has worked for me so far!

&amp;#x200B;

I have low self-esteem because of my learning problems and feel alone, helpless and unsure about my future. There is no one to advise me on learning and succeeding with my specific problem. I have to figure everything out by trial and error as I did throughout my whole life. My life would not be easier if I choose another profession. Any profession would require to remember information in the short term and long term. I am not even sure what kind of advice I am looking for.

I am disciplined, hardworking and creative. But I have this problem. And I tackle it with a weird way that no one else (that I know of) does. Will this work out? Or will I be overwhelmed? Even software engineers who don't have these issues sometimes fall behind and work extra hours to cover up. Will I even be able to survive in such an environment?

I've been in touch with a few professors regarding RA funding opportunities, and the gist I got was that there wasn't a lot of funding available for terminal masters students, and if I *were* to get offered funding, there'd be kind of an implicit expectation that I'd continue at that school to do a PhD.

I'm hesitant to commit to a PhD at this point because I don't want to burn bridges at that school if I either decide to leave or to pursue a PhD at a different school (either better reputation, or program that's closer to what I'm interested in). I also did not apply to PhD programs anywhere this year because my application wasn't competitive enough (not enough LOR's, no undergraduate research experience, last 2.5 years I worked at a small company doing a mix of product design, IT, software development, and data analysis).

Obviously I'm going to try to find money either in external scholarships or TA positions, but my thought is that, if I accept, I'm probably going to end up paying for at least some of it myself. My thought is either self-fund for 1-2 semesters and then if I like the program, try to get funding later to do the PhD, or just pay for the whole thing myself and network like a motherfucker to try to get internships during the summer to try to put myself in a good position once I finish.

The two points I've been banging around in my head are:

1. I'm financially solid enough that I won't have to take out any private or PLUS loans. The loans I would be taking out are eligible for income-based repayment, so in the case I end up getting a crappy low-paying job, I don't think I'll be in an awful situation. The debt might affect my ability to buy a house or some other major purchase down the road, but I'm not super worried about it at this point. I also have a lot of web/app development experience from my current job, so I'm 75% sure I can get a decent paying part-time job to help offset the cost.
2. The area I'm interested in going into is control theory, dynamic systems, robotics/automation. For one, I think that's going to be a pretty high-growth field in the future. The existing job openings for those fields seem to all require higher degrees. This may be kind of alarmist, but I'm also beginning to wonder if maybe it would be more expensive for me *not* to go to graduate school now. I'm 25, and I'm not sure mechanical engineering is going to be a job in 25 years, at least not the way it is now (advances in technology might enable one engineer to do the job of dozens).

The reddit hivemind says paying for your own graduate school is always a horrible idea, and isn't worth the debt. Is my reasoning to pay for it myself sound, or stupid?

&amp;#x200B;

So I was somewhat bored over spring break and I thought it would be fun to extract, clean, and display some of the salary data that's been accumulating over the years in the 'official salary sharing' threads. I also have a somewhat vested interest in interpreting this data, since I am a student myself and will be an intern this summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do note that this graph only shows salary data **averaged** across each company. Some companies only had one salary listed, and thus, may not be accurately represented by the salary sharing data. For example, Two Sigma is listed as over $80/hour because of one salary, but in reality, most interns will not get that (there was a bidding war for the person with said offer). If you are unsure of why something seems off, I would advise looking at the raw data below, since the graph was constructed from whatever is listed.

&amp;#x200B;

I choose to ignore additional details like housing stipends and signing/relocation bonuses. Everything was converted to hourly rates by using the following metrics: 40 hours/week, 4.35 weeks/month, 52 weeks/year. matplotlib was used to plot the data.

&amp;#x200B;

This was originally posted earlier under a different title, but I re-uploaded it after fixing a few things.

They pulled me out of school to pursue a sport that was a nightmare for me because each time I was losing or winning while playing poorly, my father would beat me up while my mom watched motionless. Each time a tournament was approaching I was doing my best to injur myself so I wouldn’t play and save myself from another beating. A couple years ago I found out that I wouldn’t be able to play again due to a pretty severe injury and honestly it’s been the best day of my life. I profoundly thought that not playing anymore meant that all the stress that I’ve been under and all those sleepless nights that I spent praying to die would finally stop. Little did I know that my father would continue to physical and mentally abuse me for any little things that I would do, including not remembering the rout to our hotel during a holiday. 

Despite all this, I continued to be hopeful and got back to school so that I could escape my parents through education. After a 4 years absence from an academic environment I managed to recommence my studies and participate in several volunteering projects and internships. Now, at the end of my senior year I am third in my class, I have the highest SAT score (1560), and some of the best ECs, but still, it isn’t enough.

I've felt like i've been trans for a very long time, and recently those emotions are starting to come back very fast and very strongly. It's just really really complicated and I need some advice on what to do.

I think I must have been around 13 when those feelings really started. I started imaging vivid fantasies of being , I'd try wearing the odd bit of clothing but nothing really serious. I don't know if my parents were aware of it back then, but I definitely tried to keep it to myself as much as possible.

At 17/18 things really started getting heated. I had a lot more access to the internet so I was able to find out alot more about being transgender and what support was available. I felt I was finally able to put a name to the emotions that I had been feeling for so long, and for a time I truly felt that I was female (Or at the very least non-binary) I wanted to explore those emotions that I had and see if transitioning was a real option for me, and if so when I could start that. With alot of courage, I started coming out to friends and family. I don't think I was faking it or I was just confused, I remember being quite certain about being female. 

I think that coming out, at least at that time, was one of the worst decisions that I have ever made. I lost a considerable amount of friends out of the small group of friends that I did have, and the people that did take exception told everyone else at my college and that just amplified the problem until I was just a complete outcast that no one dared talk to. My school did actually put some measures in place, and I thank them so much for that. But they couldn't change the fact that I was abhorred by my peers. As for my family, I think they tried to understand. Mom tried to make me more comfortable with myself, she would let me wear more female clothing and try wearing makeup at home. I looked fairly androgynous at the time anyway so dysphoria wasn't that much of an issue. I think my dad was rightfully concerned, he sort of went along with everything but I could tell deep down that he was somewhat disappointed. Whether that was because of bigotry or having to cope with the fact that he wouldn't have a son any more I don't know, and it probably isn't important. They were always reserved about it and I didn't like transitioning so slowly, so I tried to speed it up a little: I'd try wearing just a little more makeup and making my clothes just a little more feminine. They took notice and immediately flagged it with me. They were very angry and there was a lot of yelling and arguing. I was angry and wanted to leave the house, just to get away from them, just to run away until it all cooled down. My dad blocked the door, and when I tried to walk out, he pushed me away. I tried to walk away again, he did the same thing. I tried to walk out a third time. He punched me and slammed me into a wall. My mum was screaming and I was just barely conscious. I think in some kind of daze I ran upstairs to try and jump out the window to safety. My dad followed, backed me into a corner in my bedroom. I thought he was just going to keep hitting me. I had to defend myself and the only thing that I had was a hunting knife in my drawer. I didn't want to stab him, and I didn't, but if he had come any closer I might not have had an option. My mom pulled him away before anything more happened though.

Luckily my GP was actually able to meet with me without my parents being there and I told him what happened. He recommended me to a youth clinic that would let me meet them without contacting my parents. Considering that I had only a few months of college left before I could move out for University and thus get a bit more leniency, I was glad. But something happened. I don't know if I genuinely wanted to back out of transitioning, or if everything that happened in the past few weeks just made me snap, but I never went to my first appointment. Letter after letter arrived and I took no action. I can't remember what I told myself, but it was something vague like I was 'not male' and 'I don't need to transition' or something. After that I just kept on working. I forgot about what happened, I told myself that that was not a valid thing to feel. More than that, i wanted to remove that part of me so that it wouldn't cause any more damage. I tried to be more masculine out of some form of obligation. I essentially created a false persona to protect myself from any more harm from being like that. I tried to make amends with my family too, and we eventually got to a good - if somewhat distant - relationship.

And life just went on for a while after that. I worked hard, got pretty good grades. I didn't pay any attention to socialising because I didn't think it was important. I was happy with solitude, but there was always something off that I couldn't place my finger on. I think I knew that I was in denial so I kept on excluding that part of myself until those feelings went away again. Rinse repeat for about a year or so. I was depressed and suicidal but I just sort of dealt with it, It became normal to feel like jumping in front of a train each morning on my way to college. I had the odd breakdown but I just kept going afterwards. I planned suicide often but never went through with it.

I moved very far away for University. So far that the only way that I could actually reach home was by flight. I still had family near where I had decided to go and for the first semester things went OK. Things were a bit shaky at the start but I made friends and enjoyed myself. I'll never regret going, that's for sure. 

But recently things have been getting really really weird. I've been having a lot of stress related to work and my course (It's a lot more demanding than most courses), and I think it's just been so much that it's inadvertently popped the bubble that I created to hide my trans identity. One of my friends is a lesbian and something about that just sortof hit me and made me realise everything that I tried to forget. I really identified with that and the thought of being feminine and so confident makes me happy and makes me forget about all the dysphoria and sadness for a moment. I haven't told any of them but they'd definitely be understanding.

And here we are. I'm 19, at a 1st with a Internship already planned out, nearly finishing my first year and in the middle of a complete gender-identity crisis. I almost want to laugh, I should be happy with all of this. But i'm sad. And I can't even cry anymore. I feel like a husk of a person just going through life without any emotions or feelings left other than despair. I don't think I can continue on living like this any longer.

So I suppose my question is: ""*what do I do now?*"" I want to start transitioning but I'm scared. I'm so lost and confused and at the same time every second I think I'm wasting more time. I'm only 19 and it feels like I've thrown my youth away. The health services where I live are useless and I would be waiting upwards of 8 months for just an evaluation, probably 2 years just to start HRT.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I'm trans, I repressed it for more than a year after ostracization and abuse, and I just feel empty inside. I don't know whether or not to start transitioning. 

Thanks for reading this far, it's nice to that I'm not just screaming into the void here."

Yep, I had lots of credits per semester.

My GPA was solid, I had a project or two I thought were decent, but no internships. Lots of work experience, both in working for myself and for others. Good recommendations (I assume). As graduation time got closer, I hadnt heard back from a single place about a job. In the end, after 2 off site questionnaire interviews, I applied for a teaching job and got it. It is technically an amazing job. Yet ive been extremely depressed and feeling at the end of every day like I accomplished nothing. I also question whether I deserve my degree. I have to assume my resume was bad, despite many tweaks from career centers and experienced hirers. How do I break into this industry? What am I lacking? I cant bear the idea of teaching forever, and my loans want a bigger salary. "

I’ve visited the big 5s’ careers websites and didn’t find any suitable positions, so I’m wondering what is the recruiting timeline? When do they usually start posting the internships? Do they post in September to November for the following summer or do they post more than a year in advance given the accelerated recruitments?

I know that in the US, recruitment has started and penultimate internship is so important if I want to break into IB after graduation, so how does it work in Canada. I hope I haven’t missed anything.

Intended Major: Computer Science

Cost: I am in state at UMD and out of state at Georgia Tech. My parents have agreed to pay my in state tuition at UMD. If I go to Georgia Tech they would instead put that money towards part of my Georgia Tech tuition (walking out of college with 
a total of anywhere between 80-100k in debt). 

Campus: I prefer Georgia Tech's campus more as it is beautiful and right in the heart of Atlanta. 

Social Life: My big concern for Georgia Tech is not having much of a social life because of school work. I have heard people at Georgia Tech struggle to balance their academics with their social life. At both schools I have very good friends already committed.  

Academics: If you are familiar with how Georgia Tech's CS program works I like the flexibility the thread system offers, but people seemed like social life was hard to balance with the rigor of the CS curriculum. Also at Georgia Tech it sounds easier to get an incredible paid internship during college and a great job lined up after graduation. 

Overall the overarching question is Georgia Tech really worth the investment compared to UMD? If so would Georgia Tech completely compromise my social life?

I also have an internship I need to study a lot for so I'm feeling very overwhelmed. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

GOAL: Write a PEP/8 machine language simulator that simulates the PEP/8 computer and instruction set for only the following instructions:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Instruction Specifier**|**Instruction**|**Addressing Modes**|**Status Bits**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0000 0000|Stop execution|NA||
|0001 100r|Bitwise invert r|NA|NZ|
|0001 110r|Arithmetic shift left r|NA|NZVC|
|0001 111r|Arithmetic shift right r|NA|NZC|
|....etc ||||
|||||

Specifics: 

Use an array to represent the memory.

Use variables or arrays for the PEP8 registers. I recommend putting it all into a structure. I also recommend using an array of 16 bit values for A, X, PC, SP so that you can use the ***r*** bit from the instructions to point directly to A or X. You do **NOT** have to include the Status bits (see extra credit).

Use unions of structures to break up the registers and instructions into the correct bits (for example, use a structure that can be unioned to break up the 8 bit specifier into the following bit combos (4, 1, 3), (5, 3), (7, 1), (8). This will allow you to instantly extract the instruction, register and addressing modes from each instruction. Also use a union to break up the 16 bit operand into two 8 bit values.

Have the instructions be inputted either through the command line or better yet, through a file, in the following format for each instruction:

6 Hexadecimal characters per instruction

After each instruction in the program is executed, output the PEP8 machine register values."
bab00n,2,2019-04-06,What to do about my living situation?,Mrflamexd3,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bab00n/what_to_do_about_my_living_situation/,"Hey all,

Currently a junior in college living in the Bay Area.

I pay $1200 for a single room in a house with 3 other people. I get access to the laundry room, a bathroom I share with two other people, and the kitchen.

The landlord lives in the house, and she owns the house, but she sucks. She acts like she's in her 20's (she's 40), always claims she has ""anxiety"" when confronted with anything, and does not take responsibility for her own home. Pretty sure she only owns the home because it was her parents or her grandparents.

She has a dog and a cat that just roam anywhere. They're very untrained and leave a mess that she never cleans. She has this automatic feeder for the dog who just spits it out on the floor. She never cleans that.

One of the other roommates is in his 30's and has lived there for about 5 years. He's extremely forgetful, has broken a lot of stuff, and is generally self-centered and rude. My landlord complains about him a lot but does nothing about it. Also, super shitty she talks behind his back and I always avoid saying anything and try to leave the situation. She even installed sensor lights just for him because he never turned the lights off. These lights suck and turn off if you aren't constantly moving, meaning it's hard to do anything in the house at night. 

The last roommate is in graduate school and generally keeps to himself but is super passive aggressive towards me. He accused me of playing music and movies too loud all night for months, even though I ALWAYS wear headphones when I watch or listen to anything. I even had him stand outside my room while I listened to something with headphones to make sure he couldn't hear it. He has never brought it up again and never apologized.

The two guys I share the bathroom with have no interest in communicating about what their shower schedule is, but then get passive aggressive when I take a shower during when they want to take a shower. HOW THE FUCK WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW? All of our schedules are wildly different and changing every week. Some weeks they leave at 6am and other times at 2pm. 

Nobody ever takes out the garbage, ever. Maybe once in a while, but it's always me when I'm fed up with it being too full. Then they forget to take the garbage can out on garbage day, meaning the trash can gets too full and raccoons start picking at it. One time I got an extremely passive aggressive text for taking out the trash because my landlord had to clean up all the stuff from a broken bag a raccoon opened up, and she said if the trash can is ever full I should ""do something else with it.""

The kitchen is a fucking disaster. I used to cook every week and deep clean the kitchen afterwards, but I've since stopped cooking and stopped caring. On top of the garbage problems and ant problems caused because of it, people leave shit all over the counters and dirty bowls in the sink for days on end. As I mentioned earlier, the dog spits his found on the floor and it's NEVER cleaned. I tried for a while but it kept coming. When I asked my landlord if she ever fed him something different, she changed the subject and it was like she wasn't even listening to me. So now I worry about stepping on dog food pebbles whenever I walk in the kitchen. I also think she's a hoarder so there's too much stuff everywhere and I have no authority to say anything because it's technically her house.

Also, for some reason both the Wi-Fi bill and PG&amp;E bill has doubled in the past few months. I've been accused of this, but I'm never home (in fact I actively avoid being there) and used no more than I did a few months ago when this wasn't a problem. She usually agrees with me afterwards, but it's always so accusatory. I'm sure she does it to the other roommates too.

I also have a car and street parking is a nightmare. I live in a more suburb-y area right outside SF but there are ALWAYS cars everywhere. It's so fucking frustrating. There's street cleaning two days a week and I ALWAYS see older people move their cars right when it begins and ends. It's like they have nothing better to do, and they NEVER move their cars during the week. I have to walk 10-15 minutes after I've parked if I get home anytime past 6pm. The other roommate my landlord complains about? He gets the parking spot on the driveway all too himself because of seniority. He also pays for it, but honestly I'd pay for it too and I've expressed this. He would obviously become resentful of me if I took it from him, so I haven't pushed.

The worst problem is that I've gone on Craigslist to look for a new place and most ads are just as bad. I let a lot of red flags go when I moved into this place because this was my first time not living at home or on campus dorms, but now I know what to look out for. I also don't have all the money in the world to rent even just a studio. Most ads are for rooms in people's homes with a lot of rules about what you can and can't do. My parents were less strict, even they let me use the kitchen.

I also don't even know where to live next. I work at 45 minutes away from the campus, and am starting a summer internship in downtown SF in June. Do I move closer to my other job? Do I stay closer to school and the job this summer? Will the summer job stay my job during the following school year? Should I move out east and take the super long commute everywhere?

I realize this is more of a rant than anything, but I'm at such a loss. Hopefully I'll find a reasonable place soon and can move. Also applied for on-campus housing again so we'll see if I get in.

I have one more year of school so I'll probably stay, especially because my parents are paying tuition (I play rent and food and all that). But after that, I hope to get the fuck out of the Bay Area, unless I get a good enough job to sustain myself."

We're essentially people that are pretty green to a technology (compared to mid-level or senior developers) and we know how to do enough to be functional. I hear alot of Seniors on this subreddit say that it's a part of their job to make sure that the Juniors grow, and have received advice that we should ask tons of questions, but... that can't be it? You hire a bunch of greenhorns for 50-90k a year who know way less than your other employees *just* so they can get their foot in the door at their first tech job and learn?

bac87d,5,2019-04-06,Questioning My College Choice,DJPham,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/bac87d/questioning_my_college_choice/,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am a software engineering (SE) major at Robert Morris University (RMU). I am considered a junior but I have only been in college for two years. I wanted to post this after seeing a bunch of videos on what other college students with the same or similar majors are doing. I always see how college students are doing such amazing programming using languages like C++ and Java. But, when I take these courses in my school, I feel like I am not even learning the correct thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, I took my first ever programming language in college, C++. I struggled hard as the teacher assumed you did programming before which I never had the opportunity in high school. Now, I hear that in C++ you are not supposed to use ""using namespace std;"" but that was what I was always taught. I know it is a bad thing to do but I still can't grasp the concept of not doing it since I was never taught it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to go on an internship in China where I will be using C++ and I fear from what I learn in class and what I was able to self-teach myself would not be workable for the company. You can only do so much by self-teaching but you need to have that professor who can guide you, not Stack Overflow and Google. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason I question going to RMU is my academic advisor/department head and her way of teaching. For example, I am in a class called, Computer Architecture for Software Engineering, a couple of weeks in she hands me and my lab partner a breadboard and tells me to do this lab. I, for one, have never done circuits in my life. Yet, she expects me to complete this. She has made me and other fellow SE majors consider switching our majors because of the way she teaches and what she expects from me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am ranting but it does make me question if I am really ready for the real world. Just seeing what other college students do in class makes me kinda jealous. ""Gosh, it would be nice to learn something that may be valuable in the real world than spending three weeks on explaining Big-Oh"" and still be confused about it. It also doesn't help that I am about to graduate soon and I fear what I have learned since will not be much of use.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any advice anyone can offer? I know that I have to keep pushing and deal with it but I also feel like you should question your choices like this. I also apologize if this is not really structured or breaks one of the rules. "
bact0l,6,2019-04-07,Take Dream Job or Fulfill Family Obligations?,BrunchLifestyle,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/bact0l/take_dream_job_or_fulfill_family_obligations/,"I need some advice. My mom passed away last summer (it's currently April), which has left me, my brother, and my dad by ourselves. My mom was really the glue to our family, so her absence has been heartbreaking and a huge adjustment. Here's the thing. My brother lives about 4 hours away (he is graduated from college and in a full-time job), and I am a junior in college which is about an hour away from my hometown (so I'm still close by to my dad's house and can help him out when needed).

This in itself is a hard situation but there's more. My dad isn't great on living by herself. He has an alcohol and prescription drug abuse history and has been to rehab for it but still doesn't do well without constant intervention. He had a joint replacement surgery last fall and my brother and I literally had to portion out his pain meds into little bags and tell him where they were twice a day via phone, so we could make sure she had enough pain medicine, but wasn't allowed to access the whole bottle himself.

Not only that but the house we live in is a big two story house, with the only shower being upstairs. My dad doesn't have the best knees (hence the surgery) so i'm always worried he's going to fall or something and no one will be there to help him. Basically, he needs to move to a smaller house now that it's just him, and he knows that. But when my mom passed away last summer, she said she needed a year to process everything then he'd start to think about moving/selling the house.

And there's more. In January, my dad got sick with a serious infection and long story short, has to be on antibiotics until early summer. Since they are IV antibiotics, he's been in the hospital since January and will be there until early summer.

While my dad's been in the hospital, we've decided as a family to start thinking about selling the house because the house isn't safe for him anymore, it's way too big, and it seems like a good time to transition to somewhere new, since he is in the hospital anyway. We've been in contact with a realtor, and things seem to be moving really fast. We already have people interested in buying it. But the task of moving out in itself is going to be bigger than my brother and I have ever done. My brother and I are going to have to pack everything since my dad won't do it/doesn't know what needs to be kept/thrown away. And let me tell you, I've moved out of one bedroom apartments before and I was shocked at the amount of stuff I had. I can't even begin to imagine how much stuff this two story house is going to have.

Here's where it gets tricky. I applied for my DREAM internship for the summer and I really thought it was a long shot since I had already been denied to some internships closer to home. However, I learned yesterday that I was one of a few people in the whole country to receive the position!! It's located several hours away, not close enough to drive home on the weekends during the 8 weeks of the internship duration. It's literally my dream field, my dream job and I've always wanted to work there. I just can't believe I even got it. I do have another internship offer, which would allow me to stay at home and commute. It's not a bad offer, but its not my dream job or in my area of focus/interest.

But, how can i leave for the summer when my dad would just be getting home from a several month hospital stay and will inevitably be weak? Also, my brother will have to be responsible for selling the house, cleaning everything out, packing etc. - a HUGE task all alone. (Not to mention finding my dad a new place to live and moving him in..all while living and working FOUR hours away from our home).

So should I

a. Take the dream internship, leave my family for 8 weeks, when my dad's health is unstable, my brother lives 4 hours away, and i'd be putting so much extra work and stress on him to take care of dad &amp; everything while I'm gone

or

b. Stay home this summer, take the closer internship so I'd be able to help my family out.

I'm seriously in a dilemma. My family is really pushing me to make my own decision but I just feel so guilty and like I'm abandoning them at the worst time. Reddit please help!"

* Consistently good grades in school computing lessons, sent to take classes at a university at grade 10 but kicked out of the programme after 1 semester because I got a B+

* developed android apps in use by the school to this date (grade 10)

* Founding executive member of school's computer science club (grade 11)

* after previously-mentioned cybersecurity internship, participated in many CTF competitions, placed consistently well. 

* best placing was a Gold Medal (top 4) and Best Defender award at arguably most prestigious national competition (run by our military) (Grade 11-12)

* got an offer to join the cybersecurity unit for country's military (where I will spend the next 2 years in), will likely accept because I feel it's good work experience

*MUN* (began grade 9) 

* competed/delegate approx 9 times including 1 Best Delegate Award

* Chaired/Directed at ~a dozen conferences. (mostly because of networking) invited to chair a few with remuneration/free flights and accommodation. chaired at some ""prestigious"" international conferences (organised by Harvard, Yale, Georgetown)

* Substantive executive member of 5 conferences (including 2 international) 

* I've mostly done specialised committees (whether as delegate or chair), fairly well-known in my country for contributing to crisis committees

* probably spent the most time and effort in MUN out of any EC throughout my high school life

**Additional Info**:

* only person in entire high school (math and science academy) who takes history, get consistent As (5.0). 

* at grade 11, diagnosed with depression after a string of personal issues, destroyed my grades quite badly (had a semester of 1.x/5.0 GPA)

* doubtful I can get good reccs from school teachers

* math grades aren't very good (~4.0/5, most other people get high 4s) despite good computing grades

* zero academic awards, like, ever

Honestly, I'm quite lost. I'd think my ECs are decently strong but my grades, stats and reccs seem pretty dreadful (especially relative to my schoolmates, and even if you disregard the semester where I struggled with mental health issues)."
baeqip,13,2019-04-07,Stuck in Investment Bank after graduation what I should do next?,trashaccountcs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/baeqip/stuck_in_investment_bank_after_graduation_what_i/,"**Tl;dr**: Graduate without much skills popular on the market stuck in Investment Bank without chance to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm CS grad. I've never been a programming wizard but I managed to get 6 months internship after uni but I was not offered extension as I was told they need someone more senior and independent.

After that I landed a job in big investment bank where I've been working for 2y now. The good thing about it is friendly atmosphere, nice people, CV boost and not bad salary as for career start. I make around 3600$/month so in place where I live I can save half of it.

The bad thing about it is that we use old tech - java 5 and some 'in-house' build language which is not used anywhere else. Unfortunately in my role I mostly use that custom language.

First 1-1.5y in that role was interesting cause I could learn that language, learn how it looks like to work in a big company with co-located teams etc. but for now I feel I hit the wall and can't progress any more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dude, talk to your manager!**

Yep, I talked and advice I got is... if I want to learn new stuff and progress I just have to change a job because there is nothing else they can offer me in the office in that location. There is no option of changing projects they can offer. There are few other teams here but all of us are doing roughly the same thing using same tech and tools.

They are happy for me to stay because there is still plenty of work to be done... even if boring and repetitive from my perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

**What's my problem?**

I've graduated from average Uni without any advanced skills or knowledge of frameworks like React/Angular/ML/Databases etc (Uni is not a bootcamp). I heard about all of these, I can learn them but probably I wouldn't be able to go to the interview and answer questions about those. I'm not sure if I'd be able to learn any of these to advance level in 1-2 months studying just after work.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I think I can potentially do**

1. For next 1-2 months I can just learn general coding skills and interview questions and apply to other banks. That could guarantee salary increase but on the other hand probably working with some other custom things which are used only in one company.
2. Trying to learn more common frameworks, tools and apply to software companies where I probably will be offered same salary as now or lower which is not what I want but probably I would be able to work with more modern languages/tools without corporate overhead as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone been in similar situation? What your advises would be?

What's important for me in case of changing job is:

salary increase, working with tools/languages which I'd potentially be able to use in other companies in the future."

Have only had temporary jobs/internships since and it really drains me. I have gone through some very dark periods, doubting myself and scared about the future.

Now I'm in an internship again. What I would like advice with, is how to stay motivated and showing my best side while at work. If an opening shows up, maybe I will be in a good position to get it, who knows. But it's hard to put your best face on and stay motivated when you're working full time (some days overtime), same as everyone else, while getting just what I got when I didn't have any job (like government benefits). The sense of unfairness creeps up pretty often and the feeling that I'm just being taken advantage of me.

&amp;#x200B;

The internship lasts 4 months. I have 3 months left. The thought of going back to square one terrifies me.

&amp;#x200B;

Would love to hear any advice or just from someone who's in the same boat. Thanks!"

Unfortunetely, I'm terrible with decisions like this, and so I would greatly appreciate some help.

1. Get an office job working at a bank; this is where I'm doing my internship, so I can certainly get a job there. Upside is good pay and stability, downside is it might get repetitive and I don't know if I want to work for a private corporation.

2. Get a job working for the police; I've always wanted to be a police officer. Upside is that I can see myself definitely enjoying it, but the downside is that I don't know if I could psychologically handle it.

3. Go to law school to become a lawyer, most likely going into corporate law. Same upsides and downsides as the first option, except the pay would be better, but debt in the short run.

4. Join the military; majority of my ancestors were in the military, so it's definitely a family thing. Again, I'm not sure psychologically, but this is certainly something I could do to honor my family.

5. Go to law school and join the military as a lawyer. Best of both worlds, as I get a higher paying law job, but also get the positives of the military.

What do you guys think? Have any other options I should look at? What would be the best? Thanks!"

Or do co-op summer and fall?",thr-away-acc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/baimk2/should_i_take_this_summer_internship_then_fall/,"I want to preface this  by saying I am in no means trying to humble brag. I don't care about  karma. Respect to those still pumping out applications and interviews.  You can do it!  


I got an internship offer in early March for one  company, which sounds great, but given what I was told in the interview,  it doesn't sound like I'd be working with different  technologies/frameworks compared to what I worked on in my internship  last summer. It basically sounds like a repeat of what I had last summer  (creating RESTful web app with Java and Spring Framework) but with a different company. The co-op also pays more (not astronomically) than  the internship.  


On the other hand, I was told I'd definitely get  exposure to full-stack work with this co-op, which is what I want, and  the tech stack is different there than what it would be at the  internship (C# I know for sure). I informed my would-be supervisor and  the recruiter at the co-op of my internship offer, and they said they  would be fine with only having me for fall.  


So my two choices  are, do the internship for the summer, then the co-op for fall, or start  the co-op this summer and go through the fall. Obviously I'd have a  longer exposure to whatever I'm working on if starting the co-op in the  fall, but I feel taking the internship for summer will net me that many  more professional contacts if I do well there, which I intend to do.  Location isn't an issue as they're both within 30 minutes of my house or  school.  


I told the recruiter I would let her know by  end-of-workday tomorrow. I obviously keep vacillating between the two  choices, but right now I'm currently leaning towards internship now,  co-op in fall.

However, I also have an offer at Amazon for SDE internship - I think I want to go into product, not just software engineering post-graduation, and I really don't think I'd like the work. The Amazon offer pays a lot better, and obviously I'd have that Amazon brand name on my resume which might help me later on - my question is should I consider taking Amazon for those reasons? The other job is so much more exciting to me and I'd learn so much - it's also pretty prestigious I'd think to be an intern at a VC but from people I've talked to theyve said if I want something like Google APM my senior year, I should go with Amazon."

This fall I will be my senior year at a university. My major is finance and Economics right now. I will keep finance for sure but was wondering what econ majors and people who have do both would suggest? I have not take an upper devision courses from econ expect intro to macro and into to micro. Why econ? I want the finance as the micro and econ as the macro for better analysis. If I proceed with both concentrations, this fall I'll be at 19 upper devision course units. Finished all my General education. Acquired 15 degrees from community college. 

My delmia is deciding if  between two choices

1. Take the course overload my last two semesters as a senior and get the Economics concentration of business. I would graduate with 2 concentrations but most likely would not be able to get an intership or job related to my concentration. 

2.  Get only the finance concentration and take the most useful economic courses which would be about three (macro,money &amp; banking, econometrics) and maybe take python coding language. This would really make my schedule less tense and give me the opportunity to start acquiring experience/internships, networking harder.


Is work experience worth more then a second concentration in business?

What would you recommend would be the better option based on the two choices because I know sometimes if you have no internship then It can be hard to find a job if you don't have good network...

baj9jb,1,2019-04-07,Question about Work Experience,TheMayoras,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/baj9jb/question_about_work_experience/,"Hello all,

I just wanted to post a quick question about how valuable my work experience is. 

To explain a bit, I'm currently a chemical engineering major with a minor in CS, but I would like to move over to the software development world after I graduate.  I currently work at a chemical company; I did a 6-month coop and work there part-time while I am back a class.  

I'm technically  a chemical engineering intern but 100% of my work is creating Access and Excel applications with VBA. Everyone from my company is practically technology illiterate, so I work to automate a lot of the paper-based stuff that gets tedious and repetitive.  For example, i created some excel documents that track all of the batches of chemicals that get made (every chemical has a set of tests we run on it).  The tracker inserts batches with problems into an Access database, so that we can run statistics.  Everything is done with VBA in the background, so it extremely easy for the users to use the application. 

I have also created two Access applications.  One is still in the works and  the other is used to track new sales orders that the salesmen put into the database. It then calculates the new increase/decrease in raw material usage. 

I feel fairly proud of these applications, but I dont know if they're actually worth anything as CS work experience. I am just trying to get a realistic view of my chances in getting a job. 

Last thing, I have been learning Java and Spring for a few months now, and I am working on creating a website on my own. 

Thank you for any advice!"

I just finished 2 books about Server 2016 (Jan Smets - Netwerkbeheer  Windows server 2016).  I feel the WDS part was lacking a lot of information. Like most Youtube video's it just show's you to install WDS by clicking next &gt; next ... Until the part where you deploy an image, then show's you how to make a capture image and that's it...

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm at my internship and I need to configure 40 laptops and I don't know where to start... They do this manually with Clonezilla, I want to do this more efficiently. I'm also quite confused about the UEFI/Legacy booting. In VMware 15 Pro I can only get the WDS client machine to boot PXE if I set it to BIOS mode. Adding DHCP option 66 with the DC's IP and/or DHCP option 67 with "" boot\\x64\\wdsmgfw.efi "" or "" boot\\x64\\wdsnbp.com"" does nothing for me...

I read something about configuring a IP helper or DHCP relay agent, but I'm quite confused what would be the normal recommended method to use WDS?

balb0n,145,2019-04-07,"Yall need to stop making community college out to be this ""amazing alternative"". Read this if considering community college",StardustNyako,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/balb0n/yall_need_to_stop_making_community_college_out_to/,"So I ended up going into community college half out of necessity, because my mom lost her job the summer after I grafuated high school, and half because I did whole heartedly believe it was a good idea.

The first time I tried community college in 2014, I ended up dropping out after a year cause I was majorring in Japanese at the time, and the school had no classes for that, so I felt like I was in this drawn out process, having to balance general ed classes I did not care about, while going to work, and then staying up to do homework, cause my mom made enough that I got no aid for community college at first. So if you think community college is a easier route with less work, you may end up being wrong if you haev to end up working to help pay for it, and even then there is more work than high school gave you.

I dropped out because of how drawn out the process was, it felt like with all of the class requirments and how tricky it was sometimes to get into classes/ keep my schedule running on Tuesdays and Thursdays so that my work availability remained decent, there was just no end in sight, and the amount of money it cost to study at a 4 year university in my state, and how many classes I'd still need to take scared me. Many majors have class plans that you have to essentially  psend 4 years to go through the whole program cause that's how the program is designed and it's hard to get that changed unless you can show you're a prodigy of sorts in that subject already. Even then it's hard.

I dropped out and came back to study Comp Sci, it was easier to stayh motivated since I was able to study that at the college while finishing Gen Ed, the Comp Sci program didn't teach Comp Sci per say, it mostly was a whole bunch of classes for different programming language introductions. It's comparable to , if you want to be a doctor, the program giving you fairly surface level courses of the different systems in your body and the problems you may face with those parts and how to solve it, without delving too much into the science behind it, or the why it works that way. That may not be the best explanation but you get the idea. So you have to, when you transfer, hope you get into a good school where you can learn that deeper content from the ground up even though it may, again, take you longer than 4 years to graduate. 

And then comes transferring cause with few exceptions, in most fields an Associates won't really get you in the door unless you really kill that networking game. For many schools, your cchances of getting in as a transfer are much less than a first year. This applies to the Ivies especially, and in some schools, they don't allow transfers at all or don't allow transfer students into he program because it's a strict 4 year program you need to follow. Even worse, in ,any schools you need to apply to get into a mahor which is not guaranteed. Having good grades so you can transfer in is easier if you had more time at that school to get used to it's rigour.

Lastly uh, internships tend not to favor community college kids in general, many require you to be enrolled in a four year program, and even if they don't explicitly say that, you can bet they still prefer and choose those applicants in the long run.

I dunno about the party scene, but the school events weren't that much better than high school, same with clubs. 

The quality of classes is probably as mixed of a bag as any college but probably are easier, but not the walk in the park some claim they are by any means, especially math classes and English / Humanities classes if you don't like writing.

Also commuting can really throw a wrench into things including your finances and time management, depending on how far you need to travel to get there and what methods you have available to get there.

Honestly, the one thing that makes me definitely not regret community college is the saved money. I know this post seems like a downer, but it is important to really expose the disadvantages of community college and things you should consider before just deciding comumnity college is the best option to take.

I am 18 years old and live in CT with my mom and my dog. I graduated high school in 2018 and have been working and figuring out what I want to do for the past year. I landed on being a vet tech and theres a fantastic program in my area not 15 minutes away from my current home. Now my mom has been talking about moving and is serious about it. She also encourages me to apply for the program (I have) and to attend starting this summer. 

Small problem is that the area in CT where I'm located is very expensive and completely out of the question for someone my age to live alone with a part time job (30hr) and school on top of that. I have an internship lined up and connections in the field in the area lined up for internships and possible jobs later on.

My mom seems to understand but also doesn't seem to want to help me? Im confused about everything she says, she will say things like, ""apply and go and you will figure it out, you don't need me!"" I personally don't feel confident doing that, I know I'm going to need a car and a place to live in 6 months. She has told me I can not come with her and hasn't decided where she's going to move but demands there won't be enough space. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have looked at rent, the cost of a car, insurance, and my school fees and I am a wreck trying to pretend I can do it. I will have to move so far away from where we are I would have to quit my job (a beautifully managed kennel/daycare) and drive at least 45 minutes to school everyday. 

A bit more information, I have an older brother (26) and older sister (20), both of whom are still somewhat supported by my mom. My brother, the oldest moved out a year ago after getting his first job and drives the car all of us kids previously shared. My sister is amazing and does do the best she can, she is still in school and needs her mothers financial support as anyone would. My brother just rubs me the wrong way, he lived with us and was financially supported 100% by my mother well into his 20's and she's asking me to move out at 18 fresh out of high school. 

I've worked since the day I turned 16, didn't manage my money well but I do well now. I fully support my dog, I rescued her myself and all of that cost I handle, she is extremely important to me. I am at a point in life where I'm very happy and my mom is not. 

She is older and I think she's done with children, I still need my mom. A lot. I know no life skills and I tell her this to which I'm told I'll figure it out. I don't know what to do. 

We have never been close and I feel very little connection to her because of lots of different incidences and honestly the way she treats me. I've never felt as happy as I do on average but when she talks to me I just feel more alone, more lost.

I don't really know what I need, but I need help. Im genuinely so scared my life is going to fall apart when she moves away from here without me. Please Im open to any suggestion you could think of I just need to know where to go now.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My mother (whom I've had serious problems with since a young age) is kicking me out at 18, to retire and move away. Where we live is where I'm attending school (no dorm), working at a great job I'm very happy at. Final note, my brother lived at home until 25 and my sister lives at school and doesn't come home if she can help it. What should I do? How can I make my mom care about whats going to happen to me? Should I just give up and move away myself and start over?

Is it worth finishing CS degree?,CraftyGarden7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/banc0p/what_do_i_do_next_is_it_worth_finishing_cs_degree/,"Okay I just want to start this off by saying that I am extremely grateful to be in this situation. Currently I am a 3rd year/junior at a top 25 (US News Report) school and I am technically a Biology and CS major. I say technically because last year during the spring of 2018, I was just a biology major and after trying to learn python to work on a project for my genetics class, I kinda fell in love with coding. I made it my mission to get an internship in Software Engineering for the next summer and after a shit ton of hard work, I managed to. I spent all of last summer learning Data Structures and Algorithms, I learned python, C++, java, and javascript, during the semester I prepared for all my interviews using AlgoExpert, Interview Cake and Leetcode. Side note, highly highly recommend interview cake and algoexpert, if you're struggling with leetcode! Anyways, so During the fall of 2018, I declared a CS major and officially started taking Data Structure and Algorithms at my school (I was able to skip intro courses because I learned most of that info during the summer). Like I mentioned before I go to a top school so most Big-N companies recruit at my school, so I was lucky enough to secure an internship in Seattle this summer at a Big-N. My problem comes with what happens after I finish my internship. I have completed the requirements for my biology degree already so that's out of the way, but I have only taken two CS courses so far (DS&amp;A and discrete math) with 8 more left to graduate (at least 12 more for a masters if I do the combined BSMS CS program with my school). I honestly do not care if I graduate with a CS degree, but I don't want to limit my career options because of not having a CS degree. I am pretty confident with my technical interview skills, so at least with getting internships, I think I can secure those just fine, just not sure if I can get passed resume screens for full time without a BSCS degree for new grad positions.  What should I do? I have attached potential plans below, Also if you have any tips on what to do to prepare for my internship, feel free to share!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am a biology major who just started learning CS less than a year ago, I got a pretty prestigious internship this summer, what do I do next?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Plan A:

Intern at Big-N this summer, go back to school for the fall and spring, graduate with a Biology degree with a CS Minor in spring 2020, and hope companies don't care when I apply for full time that I didn't finish my CS major

Total: Minor in 4 years with 1 internship

&amp;#x200B;

Plan B:

Intern at Big-N this summer, Do a Co-op at another Big-N during fall, Go back to school in the spring, Do another internship in the summer of 2020, then finish degree in biology degree with cs minor in fall

Total: Minor in 4 years with 2 internships

&amp;#x200B;

Plan C:

Intern at Big-N this summer, go back to school for the fall, Go back to school in the spring, Big-N internship in summer of 2020, Finish Bio and CS degree in fall of 2020

Total: BS in 4.5 years with 2 internships

&amp;#x200B;

Plan D:

Intern at Big-N this summer, go back to school for the fall ,spring, summer, graduate with bio and cs degree by the end of summer 2020

Total:BS in  4.25 Years with 1 internship

&amp;#x200B;

Plan E:

Intern at Big-N this summer, go back to school for the fall, Go back to school in the spring, Big-N internship in summer of 2020, Head back to school for the fall, spring, another internship, one more fall semester and get my BS in Bio and CS and MSCS

high school was not a fun time for me. i'm looking back right now, sad and upset that I didn't have a good experience. some people feel nostalgic for high school; i feel nostalgic for experiences i never even had.

i always told myself i'd change in college. but... will i really? probably not. because i'm so used to reaching for some unattainable goal

and so, college will be the same, endless cycle of trying to get good grades and internships and get positions in clubs to get into grad school

and then grad school leads to a job

and then you've got a job - and so what? gotta do well at that job, gotta rise up in the ranks, gotta compete, gotta be better than those around you

and you're still not good enough.

the people who are happy - really truly happy - don't need a good college, they don't need a high-ranking internship, they don't need a well-paying job. I think they're at peace with where they are, and they are happy making a difference in their little corner of the world.

How do I achieve that?

Problem: I was offered $10k in federal student loans to cover living expenses for my first semester of graduate school (Fall ‘18). I accepted it all, as I was a full-time unpaid intern and couldn’t afford rent without the loan money. Now, the school’s financial aid office says they made a mistake and I only qualified for $6.5k. They want the remainder of the money back (~$3,700) and won’t let me register for classes until I pay it in full.

Background: I’m a fellow in a program that covers the full cost of tuition over the course of my 2.5 year program. I am now working full time and NYC takes money out of my pay check to cover the cost of tuition at the university. The loan was only for text books and living expenses.

While I understand that I need to pay back that $3.7k to someone, I only borrowed it under the impression that I’d be paying it back slowly over time. How can a college dispense a loan to me and then say “oops” several months after the fact? The money has already been spent and I don’t have $3.7k to fork over all at once!

If the hold remains on my account and I can’t register for classes, I am looking at extending my time in graduate school by at least another year. (No thanks!) The financial aid and bursar’s offices have been curt and unhelpful.

According to my Federal Student Loan account, I only borrowed $6,500.

What steps can I take moving forward? If this is only between me and the financial aid office can it follow me if I transfer to another school? Do I have grounds for taking legal action if they refuse to let me pay them back in installments?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! I have no idea what to do!"

The commute is an hour each way, with a 9 to 5 Monday through Friday schedule. All in all it will probably take up around 10 hours of my day per week day.

I don’t want to burn out, as I am a freshman and still have plenty of time to get internships, but it would help my career a lot.

bap5d9,4,2019-04-08,WIBTA (M19)for leaving my abusive/overprotective father after he has been the sole provider in my life?,eliasjewel,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bap5d9/wibta_m19for_leaving_my_abusiveoverprotective/,"Buckle up friends this is gonna be a long one. My father immigrated to the US in 80s and settled down with my mom in the 90s. My mom, brother, and myself, have always been under his roof. Since I was young, he would beat us if we did anything wrong, and him and my mom would have arguments a lot, and sometimes he would hurt her too. My father would never really support me whenever I wanted to do extracurriculars or if I wanted to do anything outside of school. It was always getting good grades. Nothing else was going to help you survive in life. Growing up I was always isolated, I would make few friends, and I could never hang out with them outside of school. He was always afraid that if I hung out with friends I might get into drugs or do other stupid things, even though he raised us to not do stupid things.It was probably around high school when I realized that I was ‘trapped.’ He never has fully trusted anyone of us, to this day, I have never been able to go out alone at night (past 6 pm), gone to the theater, hung out at a friend’s house (excluding group projects), or other teenage/young adult things. But the problem is that he has been basically the sole provider in my life. The house I live in, the car insurance, the health insurance, everything he pays for. My mom never worked much because he would always maker her quit within a few months. He believes in the old school mantra, “women belong in the kitchen and are supposed to raise the kids”. Thing is I’m 19 and my brother is 22, yet we’re treated as children.When I was younger he always felt like a decent father, he was always honest and did everything he thought was best for his family. But since I've gotten older I've come to feel the extreme overprotective nature that he has,it’s like living with constant noose around your neck. It’s gotten to the point where I have just stopped asking for anything whether it's material things or to go eat lunch with friends. It’s impossible to disagree with him, because he just gets angry and abusive. All of this has led me to finish college early. Thanks to AP credits and extra classes I’m on track to graduate by spring 2020 (3 yrs instead of the traditional 4). I want to leave. I don’t want to stay with someone who controls every aspect of my life from what type of haircut I can get to not even being allowed to grow a beard (as silly as it may sound). If I had money I would leave right now. That’s why its imperative I graduate with a full-time job so I can leave and live on my own. My brother and I have discussed leaving with my mom, but we don’t have enough money to, especially since he is a grad student and doesn’t make enough as a research assistant. Both of us go to the same university and have been blessed to get scholarships to pay for our tuition. I have landed an internship this summer, and in a perfect world I get a full time offer from them and I can start the process of leaving his house. I know the day I set out to leave he will do everything in his power to stop me. He is a hypocrite, he has cameras set up inside his own house to watch us, he travels for work and feels its necessary to 'protect the house.' I live in a gated neighborhood, and there's barely any crime in my area. This is my first post, so apologies for it being so long. For all I know this might be the wrong subreddit to post in but idk. I feel so alone and isolated. If you've made it to the end, I appreciate you for taking the time. 

TLDR; Dad has given his whole life for his family, but he is a control freak and overprotective not giving myself, mom, or brother room to breathe. Is it time to leave?"

I had an internship at a startup for about a year and a half where I learned a lot, but the crunch was insane, my boss never paid on time (sometimes 3-4 months no pay but since we were interns he took advantage of us. He still owes me $$ 4 months after I quit), and I generally felt I was teaching myself more than having the traditional mentorship that I've seen others experience with internships. There were perks: super flexible hours, great networking for meeting people in the tightly knit industry circles, and the experience for my portfolio. While most of the negative experience was due to having a bad boss, I also believe that part of it imprinted a negative connotation to working for startups in general since I've seen other interns at startups outside of my own being treated similarly. I've applied for several other positions but most of them want either no to low pay, and the corporate jobs seem almost impossible to get a foot into the door even with prior experience. What should I do for income in the meantime? I'm currently taking classes fulltime, which are pretty course intensive since they're mostly game studio projects and upper division CS classes like AI, Linear Algebra, and Graphics Programming. Should I even worry about another job for now or just pursue school fulltime? Right now my husband is supporting me, but it's become clear after 4 months of living on a single income he wants me to go back to work but I want to finish school as soon as possible without any more distractions. Should I look for another internship at a startup with flexible hours? And if so, what are the red flags to not get sucked into a bad situation again--OR should I apply for a corporate 9-5 with little to no consideration for my school schedule, or should I just stick it out to finish school fulltime without a job? Any suggestions or success stories of those who have done this and come out on the other side are much appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

Here's my dilemma: I have been working for 4 years at a retail store. I really want to leave there, the store and managment have given me 4 anxiety filled years. The reason for this is i just feel like an idiot when i'm there and am constantly critized.

Im also not that great with greeting because i have trouble speaking sometimes.

Is it still used?,Manucarba,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bat7q2/is_learning_angularjs_useful_is_it_still_used/,I started working as an intern and even though I know JS they use AngularJS too so I have been learning it for a bit now. The thing is that I am not motivated in learning it since I feel it is a very antique and obsolete technology and that I shouldn’t put as much effort to understand and use it well. At the moment I just want to learn the basics and as much as I would use at work but nothing else. Am I wrong?
batvku,0,2019-04-08,UCSD vs UCB vs UCLA,soma64,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/batvku/ucsd_vs_ucb_vs_ucla/,"hello all! so these are my top choices right now. all cost around the same price, so that really isn’t a factor. alright here’s my pros and cons list.

UCSD

pros:
- directly admitted to computer science (my intended major)
- nice campus with lots of amenities, food places on campus
- I don’t mind that it’s socially dead (I’m quite introverted)
- san diego, nice area

cons:
- not as prestigious as the other two
- I really don’t want to pass up my opportunity for ucla or cal
- a person I dislike will go there

UCLA

pros:
- when I walked on the campus, I felt like I was at disneyland
- the atmosphere was so chill
- better food (but this doesn’t really matter to me)
- located in westwood, so pretty safe
- I might return to socal after college, so having an internship in socal might be helpful
- school spirit, great in sports
- collaborative
- housing guarantees for 3 years

cons:
- got admitted into cognitive science, as I didn’t apply to CoE
- less prestigious than berkeley (despite now being #1 public school)
- one of my friends will go there, but I prefer going to a school where no one else is

CAL

pros:
- prestigious, comparable to that of ivy leagues to companies
- admitted as intended comp sci in l&amp;s
- near silicon valley
- loved the campus, the Greco-Roman feel
- bay area is my spiritual home
- my personality probably matches cal more than the others
- no one from my school is going there

cons:
- housing crisis
- unsure if I can declare cs l&amp;s since the gpa cutoff is 3.3
- relatively unsafe area, peddlers and muggings
- cutthroat competitive? or so I hear.
- grade deflation
- school colors remind me too much of my high school #triggered"
batx86,1,2019-04-08,Any insight is welcome,valentinesteddy,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/batx86/any_insight_is_welcome/,"Hello, Im a senior in high school. Currently I am trying to figure out which school I want to attend next year. I have two very different choices narrowed down. Essentially a community college vs a 4 year uni.

 I have an interest in majoring in computer science. If I attend the CC I will transfer after getting my basics done. The cost is great for the CC dont get me wrong and there is a transfer credit agreement with many schools. I am just scared that if I attend a CC for the first two years I will be missing out on a lot of opportunities such as networking and internships that I could have gotten going to the 4 year. The CC also only has the intro cs class so it doesnt give me a lot of chances to explore the field. I am also worried that if I choose the CC that I will transfer with an intended major, but then change and feel even more lost. I feel like there are more opportunities to discover your interests in a bigger environment. 

The only thing that is really stopping me is the cost for a 4 year. I feel stuck in this small town, but a 4 year is very expensive. I was only offered student loans from FAFSA lol. I just need some guidance, my parent’s are telling me to stay and go to the CC but at the same time I don’t want to. Any insights will be great.

[Link to u/LightningInADream's Post, ""Here's What I Learned The Hard Way."" with lots of his advice and advice from fellow seniors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bah3y8/juniorsunderclassmen_heres_what_ive_learned_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x)

\&amp;amp;#x200B;

This is basically an abbreviated version of pretty much everything I say throughout the year; hopefully, it's organized in a way you can find useful.

Junior year is where your college admissions journey starts for real. Unlike freshman and sophomore year, you now have quite a few items to tick off your to-do list, but don't freak out if you're already a spring semester junior. You have plenty of time to get all this done.

Please note that my views about this might be different than the advice you hear from other sources or even other students. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.

## Rising Junior Summer (Summer before Junior Year)

**GET INVOLVED WITH STUFF**

* Yourself (Exercise healthy habits, engage in personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, get a job, learn something new that’s good for your brains like guitar or Italian, practice mindfulness and meditation).
* Your family (Help with sibs or grandparents, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, or take care of dinner one night a week).
* Your community (Community service can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects. Volunteer to play your instrument or play games at a retirement home, coach a kids’ team, make sandwiches at a food bank, or make comfort bags and drop off healthy snacks and water to the homeless).

**GET A SUMMER JOB:** Just an old-fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. A summer job also shows determination and resiliency. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.

**PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT:** You take it in October, and it helps you qualify for National Merit if you score high enough.

**PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT:** Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of the junior year. Definitely take one in the early part of the spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start senior year.

**TAKE SAT SUBJECT TESTS:** Especially if you are considering applying to highly selective schools. Take one or two in June or August that fit with classes you’ve just studied.

**ENJOY YOUR SUMMER:** This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. That’s part of being involved with yourself. Be sure to take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.

**START YOUR RESUME:** If you haven’t already, make a list of all the activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old-fashioned summer or part-time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to more traditional research, internships, and in-or-out-of-school clubs and sports. If you use the Coalition App, you can start on your application “locker.” Keep this list updated throughout the next two years. Create the following categories: Education, Extracurriculars, Work Experience, Community Service, Interests and Hobbies, Awards, Honors

**EXPLORE THE WORLD OF ADMISSIONS:**   Read some college admissions websites and blogs. Some of my favorites are Georgia Tech, MIT, Tulane, Harvard, and Tufts. They are open about the realities and anxieties of college admissions.

# Junior Fall

Pretty much all of the summer stuff applies still.

**TAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN:** Colleges say that your course rigor counts for more than your GPA and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. I recommend that you take four years of:

* Science (including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)
* Foreign Language (many highly selective colleges like to see it. I know you don’t want to. It’s also good for your brain)
* English
* Math (ending in calculus if it’s offered -- or higher)
* Social Science (History, Gov, etc).

**GET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS:** Visit them at office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. Speak up in class. Ask for help when you need it.

**KEEP UP YOUR GRADES:** I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials. Meet with your teachers after class. Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other Youtube videos if you’re struggling. Don’t wait and get far behind. Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now

**READ READ READ:** Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. Read real books, magazines, newspapers, and more real books. Read books that are required for school and books just for fun. I can suggest lots — just ask.

**KEEP PREPPING AND PRACTICING FOR THE ACT AND SAT:** Start testing in the late fall or early spring of Junior Year.

**STAY INVOLVED:** Keep up with everything I listed for summer. Also, get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or simply do individual activities that add to your school environment. Sit with someone new at lunch once a week. Make an effort to say hello to two new people a week. Find a need and fill it. Or, as [this Georgia Tech blog says, ](http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) find what makes you happy, and do it.

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** See what they have to advise and how the process works at your school. Every school is slightly different.

# Junior Spring

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. I encourage you to ask junior year teachers who teach you in core academic subjects. I prefer one from a STEM subject and one from a humanities subject, but some colleges have certain expectations, so be sure to read college admissions websites about what they are looking for. Ask your teacher in person or by email and then follow up either in person or by email. Be sure to include a basic info cheat sheet about you for them and a resume. Now’s the time to start thinking about which teachers you should approach for LORs.

LOR Cheat Sheet has your resume with your most important activities on it, and then it also has your answers to the following questions:

* What was your favorite part of the class?
* What was your most memorable activity or project
* What part of the class did you find most difficult?
* What did you learn that you will carry with you after class and why?
* Be sure to write a thank you note to the teachers who say yes.

**COLLEGE VISITS:** Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you might consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Hang out on campus.

Then, if you can go on college visits to schools you might find interesting, do so.

* Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also wander around.
* Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear?
* Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night. Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospective student and, even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Move on and find a kinder person.
* Check out the dining hall and the gym.
* Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one. Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable.
* If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get a feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.

**COLLEGE LIST:** Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but also you can lot on the internet, social media, and by reading books.

* Reddit: A2C, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.
* Colleges’ websites. Sign up to receive info and get on their mailing lists.
* Common Data Set.  Google college name and common data set.
* Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on Instagram, twitter, facebook, and snapchat. Clean up your account and use your real name and then you get brownie points for interest with those who consider demonstrated interest -- and it’s also super helpful to know more as you write your Why College essays!
* Colleges’ newspapers and news feeds.
* [Niche.com](https://feeds.niche.com/)
* “Colleges that Change Lives” by Loren Pope (book and website)
* “College Match” by Steve Antonoff
* “The Best 382 Colleges” by Princeton Review
* “The FISKE Guide” by Edward Fiske
* “Insider’s Guide to Colleges” by Yale Daily News Staff
* “Where You Go is not Who You’ll Be” by Frank Bruni

**SOMETHING TO CONSIDER… Your SureFire Safety School** \-- Make sure you have at least one Sure-Fire Safety School and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity. A sure-fire safety school is a school where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions AND you would like to go there, AND they are a financial safety. Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure-fire safety until you have been admitted. I like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety out of the way. You must LOVE your safety. Research it and imagine yourself there.

**COLLEGE FIT:** Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big old list. Having a ton of schools on this initial list is ok. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter schools out. This includes thinking about and potentially creating a spreadsheet for:

* *Financials:* Will you need full financial aid?  Will you qualify for any aid? Do you need full merit aid? These are crucial considerations. You and your parents need to spend some time thinking about this and going through net price calculators on various college websites. If you can’t afford the price of a school, it’s not a good fit.
* *Geography:* What areas of the country appeal to you? Open your mind here, too. I can’t tell you how many kids say no to the Deep South or Midwest without really thinking about it, and in doing so, deprive themselves of some excellent options and merit aid. Also, do you want urban? Do you want rural? Do you want an enclosed campus or one that’s incorporated into the cityscape? Do you want beaches? Mountains? Corn fields? Do you want to get out of your comfort zone here or stay with the familiar?
* *Weather:* Also important. If you really, really hate the cold, then moving to Boston or Chicago or Maine might not appeal to you. If you have to have four seasons, then the Midwest or the northeast might have good options.
* *School Culture and Vibe:* Are you looking for that stereotypical American big college experience with the big game on the weekends? Or are you looking for the quirky school? Or something that has it all?
* *School Size:* Do you want a big ole state school with loads of options? Or are you looking for something smaller or even mid-sized? Do you want discussion-based classes where you can develop strong relationships with your professors or are do you want to be in big lectures where you can take notes or go to sleep?
* *Potential Major:* If you don’t have one, don’t worry. You have plenty of time to figure that out, and it actually frees you up a bit. If you do think you know, research some schools that might be strong in your major. Maybe touch base with a professor or two.
* *Your Stats:* Where do your grades and test scores fit in? Are they right there in the middle? I like my students to be well above the 50% for most of the colleges they are applying to. This requires putting a lot of thought into what you want out of your experience and about who you are and who you want to be. It doesn’t require pulling out U.S. News \&amp;amp; World Report and listing the top twenty schools.

**ADMISSIONSMOM'S COLLEGE BOOK CLUB:** (I don’t actually have a book club, just a list of books you should read.) Here are a few of the books I recommend:  *The Fiske Guide*, *Colleges that Change Lives*, and *Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be*. See my list in the back of this book for a full list.

**COLLEGE RESEARCH SPREADSHEET:** Include info like test score averages, requirements, distance from home, school size, programs that might interest you, climate, and anything else you feel might be important. Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) for the one I use.

**NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE OR TIME:** Make a No College-Talk Zone or Time in your house. In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it. For other families I know, it might be all day on Sundays. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year. Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your home for the next year. That’s not healthy for any of you.

**NET PRICE CALCULATORS:** Sit with your parents and do the net price calculators at a few colleges. Begin the financial conversations.

**NEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS:** Make a new college-only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! I recommend this because then all your info from colleges won’t get mixed up in your other emails. I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to it if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes, so you don't miss important info!

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**COLLEGE INFO SESSIONS:** If a college comes to your town or close to your town or school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in.

**COLLEGE FAIRS:** Go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.

**WRITE:** I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what? It’s not! It’s just not. Even the timidest of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early. I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.

* Write Every Day. Even if it’s just a sentence or two.
* Read and listen to essays on [www.thisibelieve.org](http://www.thisibelieve.org). These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects. I like that they aren't college essays.
* Check out [www.collegeessayguy.com](http://www.collegeessayguy.com), and start perusing his stuff. His website is brimming with tips, hints, and suggestions about writing college essays.
* Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you. Your application with your shiny stats and activities is for impressing. Your essays are for expressing.
* Try to avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays, and when you read those, then you get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes you great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive, boring essays for the reader. I can’t tell you how many essays I’ve now read that start with “The sweat dripped down my brow as I (tortured my way through the math exam, debate tournament, community service project, track meet…..” You pick). I will be writing a lot more about what I feel like you need to do for strong personal essays and supplements.

**READ BOOKS:** Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes. Reading good fiction and also self-help books will help you learn to discover your voice. Here’s a list of fantastic books to read. Some are just for fun, and others help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing, and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays.

* *The Mindful Teen* by Dzung X. Vo
* *The Mindful Twenty Something* by Holly Rogers
* *10% Happier* by Dan Harris
* *Meditation for Fidgety Skeptic*s by Dan Harris and Jeff Warren
* *The Happiness Equation* by Neil Pasricha
* *You are a Badass* by Jenn Sincero
* *Big Magic* by Elizabeth Gilbert
* T*he Year of Yes* by Shonda Rhimes
* B*rave Enough, Wild,* and *Tiny Beautiful Things* \-- all by Cheryl Strayed
* *F\*ck That - An Honest Meditation* by Jason Headley
* *Catcher in the Rye* by JD Salinger
* Anything by Vonnegut, Faulkner, Steinbeck, or Hemingway
* *Me and Earl and the Dying Girl* by Jesse Andrews ( I like his voice.)
* Some of David Foster Wallace’s short stories

**TAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER:** Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key. There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad. So, how do you deal with it? What do you do? Besides post and comment on a2c??? :))

* Be involved. And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.
* Get a job. This might be a good time to get a job and start saving money for the things you will need in school. An old fashioned job where you earn just a little but learn a lot from the experience of taking care of customers or working with others who might never have the chance to work with is invaluable at this time. It also can help you with time management.
* Practice gratitude 🙏. Make a daily list of things you are thankful for. Even during all your stress, what is good? Are you happy for air conditioning or heating? Are you grateful for ice cream? Or for that amazing teacher who sparked something in you. There’s nothing too small here, but when we stop and think about it, it can take away some of the anxiety and stress.
* Be like Elsa and Let. It. Go. If Disney Cartoons aren’t your style, maybe this story about monkeys and coconuts will resonate. Hunters attach a coconut to a tree, cut a hole in it, and place a banana 🍌 inside. A monkey comes along and puts his hand through the hole and grabs the banana. The unfortunate thing is the hole is too small for his fist to get back through, so he is stuck sitting by that tree holding on to the banana. To be free, all he has to do is let go of the banana.
* Horses with flies. This is a silly one, but it can help! So, you know how horses make their skin quiver when a fly lands on them? That’s what you do here. It’s a super quick tension reliever. First, shake your hands, then your arms, then your head, then your feet, and your legs, and your belly. Raise your hands high over your head while shaking, and then quickly drop down and reach for your toes and come up. Make sure you make a silly noise when you drop down! Then, feel how alive your body feels and pay attention to that smile on your face!
* LEAN IN.  Lean into your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress. Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. It is knowing that this is just what’s happening right now and it’s ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it. Lean in and face it and embrace it. Think about it. Assess it. If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience is so much about the journey and not the outcome. And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a particular school. It’s true. It pisses you off when we say it, but it’s true.
* Mindful Meditation. Take three minutes every day and focus on your breathing. That’s all — no need to clear your brain. Just focus on your breath. Be mindful of what’s happening to you. Is your mind wandering? Cool! That means you’ve been successful with your mindful meditation because you discovered that your mind had wandered away from focusing on your breathing. It’s no biggie. Just come back to your breath. This is such a simple practice, and so many people get caught up in the “I could never clear my brain. Or I can’t relax” part, but that’s not what it’s about. You don’t have to clear your brain or relax. There are no rules. Just focus on your breathing for three minutes. It’s that simple.
* Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air. Eat Healthy Food

**OTHER…** If you are a low-income applicant, I want you to be aware of and explore these amazing programs and possible options, if you’re not already:

* Questbridge Program:[ https://www.questbridge.org/](https://www.questbridge.org/)
* Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program:[ http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/](http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/)
* The Posse Foundation:[ https://www.possefoundation.org/](https://www.possefoundation.org/)

Juniors, you are in for the journey of your life. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible. Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming. Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger.

I'm looking forward to watching your transformations; you got this! This is a prime opportunity for you to take advantage of digging in and getting to know who you are. Instead of focusing so much on getting in, let’s instead focus on getting inward.

# Rising Senior Summer


# Senior Fall

All of the above....plus:

Finish up any **college visits especially for EARLY DECISION POSSIBILITIES.**

**COLLEGE LIST:** Begin to narrow your college list. Make sure you have one or two SureFire Safeties (see above) that you love and that will be good financial fits, as well as a collection of matches, reaches, and lotteries (if that’s your thing).

**COLLEGE APPLICATION SPREADSHEET:** Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics — and look for overlap. Testing info. Contact info for your regional officer. Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) for a spreadsheet.

**FILLING OUT APPLICATIONS:** Start with the details if you didn't do it in the summer. Fill out activities, family history, etc.

**EARLY ACTION:** Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available. Make a calendar of deadlines and essay requirements and work through them one by one.

**FAFSA AND CSS:** Make accounts and start gathering and filling out information.

**FINANCIAL AID:** Reach out to the financial aid offices of schools on your list and establish a relationship with them.

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and ""cheat sheet"" if you haven't yet.)

**YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR:** Check in with your guidance counselor or college counselor if you aren't in regular contact. They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**SAT/ACT/SUBJECT TESTS:** Finish up any testing you have left to do.

**ESSAYS:** Start writing your essays for real now. Focus first on your Personal Statement. Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates. How many Why College Essays do you have? When's the first one due? Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the Extracurricular Essays. Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. And then group the others. Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1.

**INTERVIEWS:** Be sure to check your email (and voicemail and trash and spam folders for interview invitations). Every school has a different method for signing up, so read the website carefully. Some you are automatically signed up. Others require you to sign up yourself. In most cases, they are optional and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity. Don’t worry (as long as you’ve checked your trash and junk mails). I do suggest that you do them though — even if they’re optional and you’re nervous. Lean into your fear, admit it to them, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go.

**LOCI:** If you are deferred Early Decision, be sure to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest).

## Senior Spring

**FINISH UP APPLICATIONS:** Add any schools to your list that you need. There are plenty of colleges still accepting applications throughout the spring (and summer).

**SUREFIRE SAFETY SCHOOL:** Make sure you have a SureFire Safety School. If you don't have one yet, look for good fits for you that are still accepting apps. Read above to see what that is if you don’t yet.

**KEEP THOSE GRADES UP:** Being rescinded for grade drops is a very real thing.

**TAKE TIME TO CARE FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUR BODY:** Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal. Breathe. Acknowledge that once those little baby applications have flown away from your computer, you no longer have control.

**EMOTIONAL PLANNING:** Plan for the worst, but hope for the best. Recognize that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too connected to any college except for your SureFire Safety. Keep in mind that there are far too many amazing yous to fit into the tiny teacup of colleges you’re all trying to squeeze yourselves into.

**GRATITUDE:** Think about what you are grateful for. What are the good things in your life? Try to make a mental list every day. Be sure to write thank you notes to all those who have helped you along the way: counselors, teachers, parents, admissions officers, and interviewers to name a few.

**ENJOY THESE LAST FEW MONTHS OF HIGH SCHOOL:** Connect with friends and family.

# tl;dr

* Junior year is when the college admissions prep really kicks in, and you got this.
* Follow this guide while adapting it to suit your own needs
* Check with your high school counselor.
* Be involved. Figure out what makes you happy and do it.
* Read.
* Take care of yourself.
* Personal Essay is about inside you."

bav80t,8,2019-04-08,When is it time to scale up?,Necroking695,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/bav80t/when_is_it_time_to_scale_up/,"So right now my agency is pulling in ~$15k/month in revenue. All included, current expenses are ~$5k/month, this includes marketing which can be adjusted at any time, and is about 40% of expenses.

Its worth noting that last month revenue was $10k/month, was at that for about 6 months, and before that it was climbing from 1.5-7.5k/month, over the course of 6 months. So growth has been pretty rapid, but it can stagnate. 

Right now its essentially just me working out of a sublet office of the family business that they are letting me use for free.

Here's the problem, I'm begining to cap out on what i can handle. Im massively behind right now and things will only get harder from here.

I have potential interns that want to join, but would only do so if i move the office to the city, which would cost an extra $1k/month, potentially more if i actually get them seats. Eventually i would plan to hire one of those interns after 3-6 months and get them a seat.

Should i keep grinding away on my own, or start expanding. Is it too soon? "

At the same time, I'm still a MSc CS student at a pretty good university. Recently, I've realised, that the scope of responsibilities I have isn't exactly my dream and since I'm pursuing MSc degree, I should do something more ambitious or at least in some well-known company to get some more strong resume entries. Just out of curiosity, I applied for internships in a number of big n companies, which resulted in invitations for interviews in couple of them. Should I actually consider a downgrade from my middle-level full-stack position to an intern SWE position in one of the big N companies? Is it a good move in my career? Will this be seen as a career upgrade (mediocre company to a prestigious one) or rather as a failure in a search for another full-time role? "
bavikx,2,2019-04-08,Unhappy with my CS job - can I find a better one or should I think about a change of career?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bavikx/unhappy_with_my_cs_job_can_i_find_a_better_one_or/,"Hi all. I'm a 34 year old developer. I've been programming since junior high when I taught myself Visual Basic. I liked solving problems using code. I've been doing software development professionally since my early 20s. These days I'm really struggling in my job. My friends and family tell me I need to find a new job when I tell them about the problems, but I've worked for the same company for over 10 years now (the only companies I worked as a programmer for before this were internships) and I'm having trouble separating the issues I have with this specific job with issues I have with the field.  Could anyone help me out? Long post ahead.

I find searching for a new job to also be very stressful. I'm going to start with info about my current job. A lot of this I know is related to the company I work for and not the career, but after I explain my problems with my specific job, I'll explain the stresses I find in trying to look for a new one.

What do I do? Basically anything related to computers

* Desktop application development in C#
* ASP.Net development
* Windows and Linux server administration
* Server support
* Desktop support
* Printer/scanner support - I never claimed to know about these things and yet I've been instructed to take stuff apart and attempt to repair
* Support for pretty much anything with a power cord - even our HVAC system


My company is a small company and we're trying to do a lot of things. They'll assign me some 10-15 tasks that they keep me on long-term while the 2 people above me skate by doing almost nothing. When I get reviews, the boss of the IT dept will spend 2 minutes telling me how the work I did was good, and then 20 minutes basically complaining that there are projects I don't work on. He literally expects me to be able to do everything this department needs (this is not an exaggeration). If there is a single thing that anyone in the dept does that I can't, he'll talk at length about how he wants me to learn it. Other execs of the company told me I should be ""happy"" to be assigned so many tasks because ""it shows that people trust me."" 

My ""supervisor"" barely looks at our helpdesk tickets, watches movies at his desk and he literally runs his own business from his desk here at this job. He tries to get me (and now another hire we picked up last year) to do most of the work. He and everyone above him take tons of vacation and take unscheduled days off, but get upset if I don't make it in for a day because for example I got a nail in my tire (they've told me I should use my spare tire for the week and have my tires fixed on a Saturday). He's even been getting me to mentor our latest hire who could use a lot of help, even though I'm not a good teacher and don't enjoy teaching, and even though he gets paid as a supervisor, not me. He basically can do whatever he wants because one of the executives really likes him. I think he's the biggest problem this company has.

So the company has me do a lot of things. They basically will look to me to solve nearly any technical problem. I don't actually necessarily mind having a lot of things to do, but the problem is that none of the bosses really pay attention to how much stuff I do, and then when we have status meetings, I have to go on the defensive about why I didn't complete certain tasks because I was so bogged down doing unplanned/support stuff. Though what I DO mind is they want me to become basically an expert on so many software packages we use and administrating/maintaining them and they expect me to have an endless brain capacity for these applications even though the applications themselves are dealing with financial subjects and other things that I don't know about. And again, I could learn these things but I am only human and I can't learn and remember everything! They expect me to answer complex questions about anything anyone uses at any time.

Recently the son of the owner was hired and he in some ways is kind of nice but in other ways is also a problem. He moved me to a new area, sitting not with other IT people but with the internal users of the project he wants me to focus on (which is fine as I get along with these people quite well). He took some of the ridiculous tasks off of my plate. He's somewhat more understanding that life happens and sometimes people can't make it into work for a day. But he's also really strict on trying to get things done to the point where he's been requesting people stop taking smoke breaks mid-morning and mid-afternoon so work can be rushed (and not because of a deadline right around the corner or anything). He's causing his own issues. He asks for status updates on a multi-week project multiple times within a span of hours and when nothing has really changed. I like that he moved me away from the other IT people that I generally don't like much, but he's still doing things that majorly stress me out.

So when my friends and family tell me to look for a new job, I totally agree that I should go elsewhere. This company doesn't manage people well, and the ""office politics"" here is insane. Various managers of departments step on each others toes because they don't get along. Drags everyone down.

But when I look for new jobs, I see a lot of issues. I check sites like Monster and Indeed and most of the listings I see have a lot of stuff that sounds awful to me:

* They list like 20 technologies they want, literally so many that I've never met a programmer that would qualify for many of these ads.
* They're temp or temp-to-perm, because programmers don't deserve stability in their lives or something? This job was ""6 months temp-to-perm"" and they hired me after 3 years (and I had no health insurance for a while because of them)
* Agile methodoloy w/ daily scrums. My experience in my current job is that there is no such thing as a meeting shorter than an hour, and almost never have I been to a productive meeting. Every single meeting I have, too many people are invited, people ask the same questions every meeting, and 100% of the time I'd be better off with people sending me an email so I have their points written down. I'm also just not comfortable with face-to-face meetings in general and Agile seems like it would make things a lot worse for me.
* Location - too many companies concentrated in the large cities. I've got to choose from slim pickings if I want to avoid sitting in traffic (whether I'm in my car or on a train) for an extra 2 hours a day. Can't afford a decent place in the city, either. My state is ridiculously expensive and getting worse at a rate far beyond inflation.
* On-call - I work 8 hours a day and I put my work down. I'm not going to answer emails from home. I'm not going to take calls from home. I'm not going to work on projects at home. I see a lot of ads expect too much from people.
* Lots of the jobs seem to be for contracted positions working on projects outsourced by clients. I don't think I want to work in an environment where nobody feels connected to the work done. That seems like the kind of environment where nobody cares about quality and you get rushed constantly to increase output.
* I see lots of ads specifically demanding that people be able to work in ""high stress environments."" Why would I want to work in a high-stress environment? A lot of these positions aren't even paying very much. At least they're up-front about it, I guess...
* There are companies like Dell that have laid off so many people I know. Companies known to lay off people while trying to hire other people instead of managing their staff. I know that one position they want to hire for might be different than ones they are laying off, but that's nothing that training couldn't fix. I feel people deserve stability in their life, and not layoffs, and not having to constantly reapply to other departments (like when your project is about to finish) to stay employed.
* Working with external customers - No offense, external customers, but I definitely have zero interest in working with you. I'm looking to code for a living, not deal with people who won't know what it takes to do my job or appreciate the work I do.



What DO I like about programming/IT?

* I like developing a relationship with my users when expectations are reasonable. I like to work together with them and solve their problems. I just don't want their problems to be shifted en-masse to become my problems. I like to feel like part of the team.
* I like designing solutions to technical problems. I do get satisfaction from solving problems.
* I don't mind doing the variety of things that I do (but I don't want to go into a meeting and have to defend why I didn't finish a programming task because I spent a bunch of time doing desktop support).
* Due to some health issues, I like that I'm not doing too much physical work. At home I do things like work on cars, electrical, plumbing, carpentry, and just about whatever, but I like that I'm not expected to do this for 8+ hours at work because sometimes my health issues prevent me from doing that kind of stuff.



Is my view cynical because I dislike my current job? Is this field not for me? Is there a certain type of company I should look to that might fit my expectations? How do I evaluate job listings properly when so many of them just sound like they tick so many boxes of stuff that I want to avoid?

Also, I've lost contact with literally every manager from previous jobs, because I've worked at my current one for a little over 10 years. If I search for a new job, how should I handle references? I've inquired with some companies who will only allow references from direct supervisors, which is tough for me. Do I need to look for companies that will take any reference and just give them people that I trust to not ""out"" the fact that I'm looking for a new job to my current supervisor/manager?

Thanks all. Even if you don't have a reply, if you read all of this, thank you for your time."

Am I screwed?",Idonemessedupman,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/baw97e/lied_about_my_gpa_got_an_internship_offer_and/," 

Hey everyone, so this past year I have been grinding to find an internship for this summer and was having a really hard time with my subpar GPA. Im a damn good programmer and have been doing it for a long time, but I am not good at school. I do well in all my CS classes and have a high CS GPA, but my institutional GPA is not great as I struggled with depression heavily my freshman and sophomore year and ended up failing an art class and getting Cs in speech and english and physics and things like that. So my GPA is shit.

At the start of the spring semester I decided that I am competent enough to do a good job somewhere and that I could be a productive member of a team so I bumped my GPA a little on my resume. I went to the job fair, got an interview, killed the interview, and got an offer from said company to do an internship. I accepted the offer about a week ago, and now they have requested an official transcript from my university along with various other information.... I did not expect this.

I know this was a bad thing to do, I just figured that everyone was probably lying about somethings on their resume and that I was just putting myself at a disadvantage if I wasn't. Should I just not send my transcript and effectively quit the job or send it in and hope that no one notices or no one cares? Its a huge company so it seems like it may be possible for it to just go unnoticed as I already accepted. Can anyone outline the likely repercussions of what I have gotten myself into?"
baxb90,2,2019-04-08,How to quit?,modularsynthesis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/baxb90/how_to_quit/,"Now, I understand that the obvious answer is to give a two-week notice and leave, but I just wanted to bring up my scenario and get some advice from you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I'm a (junior) java developer who's been working for about 2 years. I actually do not have a degree (dropped out from electrical engineering) and got this job after taking a java bootcamp. That being said, I can program, but not as well as I want to. I want to be able to write cleaner and faster code. Because of that, I'm currently working towards getting a computer science degree. Right now, I'm the only other back-end developer. Above me is one senior back-end developer. Because I only have one mentor, the amount I've learned has been good, but could be better. I want to be on a team that holds regular code reviews where we can improve each other's code.

&amp;#x200B;

Now with all that, where this becomes tricky for me is the fact that I've talked to my boss about my future plans and I told him I'll probably be here another year or so. And that due to there only being one other back-end developer, that I'd let him know ahead of time if I started looking for other jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been seriously applying for jobs, but I have been looking recently because work has been pretty slow. All that being said, should I let my boss know once I seriously start applying for jobs? Or should I wait until I land an interview? Or should I actually just wait until I get an offer then let him know.

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason I'd want to tell him ahead of time is because I don't want to burn bridges like I did in my internships. However, I'm not contractually obligated to do so at all.

&amp;#x200B;

What would you guys recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Forgot to mention the fact that I'm considering grad school for an MBA or a Master's in Computer Science in the future, and I'd most likely want a recommendation from him as well. But I feel like that wouldn't be an issue once I'm settled into my new job."

I really want to go to graduate school after graduation, and I know that having a publication and past research experience gives you a really good shot at joining some of the top professors/labs in the nation.

I'm really interested in Computer Architecture, and that is what the research will be on. My goal is to go to graduate school and specialize in an area of Computer Architecture. The Internship is a SWE role and nothing to do with Computer Architecture :/. Obviously, I can't do Research while interning so I'd have to go back on my offer at the company. This will be really tough for me as I hold my commitments to a high degree.

I am currently 24, living at home, unemployed, and uncertain of what to do next.

I regrettably didn't do an internship during college. After I graduated I applied for Programming jobs but quickly became disenfranchised after getting nothing back. I realize that you only need one hit but I wasn't even sure if I wanted to pursue a career in programming. 

After about a year of being unsure and floating around the idea of becoming a programmer, I got injured at my gym. The injury was swiftly followed by a speeding ticket. This on top of the fact that I had no idea what I wanted to do with myself, left me in a slump until around the end of 2018. (sorry for the petty sob story but I want to make sure you all have an understanding of my current standing)

As of 2019, I now feel like I'm back on track. I know my best bet is to pursue programming as a career. I have been fooling around making small programs using JavaScript (nothing portfolio worthy) and helping one of my friends learn fundamentals in JavaScript. I am also planning to make some programs using C# with a friend in a similar situation as me. During this time, I have been applying to jobs (Central Long Island / Greater New York Area) with little to no response. 

Today, I got a call from Revature, a company known for picking up recent graduates and locking them into a 2 year contract. They wanted to schedule a phone interview with me for employment. I looked into them after I graduated and decided against exploring it further. The problem is that at this point, I am unsure if anyone will take me.

Here is my question, Do I bite my tongue and go with Revature or take a risk and try freelancing?"

Just found out (after 6 months of being waitlisted) I may be joining BofA for their summer analyst program. I already have an offer from Best Buy, and now well I literally have no idea what to choose. I have made a list of deciding factors. Some may be pros for whoever reads this, some may be cons.

Deciding Factors with BofA:

\- almost double pay

\- closer to home (I have many plans this summer)

\- developer role for the Chief of Data Office

\- 10 weeks

&amp;#x200B;

Deciding factors with Best Buy:

\- in a new place where I have never been (Minnesota)

\- luxury housing

\- most likely will be doing full stack (something that sparks my interest more)

\- only intern on the team

\- 12 weeks

&amp;#x200B;

I will also be doing Codepath's technical interview course this summer. I don't know if it's best to go with BofA to give me time to study whilst taking this course, or stress with Best Buy. Note: I do not know if they give Best Buy interns amazing projects or not. Any sort of advice would be great, thank you!"

I am chubby given my demographic (upper-middle class 20-year-old Asian girl), at a skinny-fat BMI of 20-23 depending on my eating habits, and I am terrified of gaining weight when I'm older. Only recently I've started to sit down in therapy and truly try to work out my issues.

I'm used to going hard when it comes to sports, academics, competitive stuff ...And what high school sports coach or a slavedriver tiger parent in my mind would tell me (yes, what they've said still sticks with me) about how I can do better, how I should be faster, still gets to me. 

The voices in my head tell me if I feel satisfied for having a stomach or thighs this big, or if I feel happy with where I am academically, I'd better kick myself in the ass and think twice. I'm way behind.

There are things that I am irrationally ashamed of such as how my body is shaped differently from other people's. I'm considered on the thin side in America as a whole (BMI is 20, 22-23 now that I have been emotionally eating lately), but it seems most girls in college have super skinny thighs and much lower BMI's in general.

I don't care that the average American is obese or that I'm thin ""on average."" I'm considered fat and dumb in the environment I want to compete in.

I feel defective because I can't even apply ""get motivated!"" or ""stop caring about what people think"" at the same time as ""hit the gym!""

I don't know how I'm supposed to take my therapist and nutritionist's advice seriously (told to eat carbs, protein, apples) every three hours when what seems right is to only eat however much your body truly needs (1500-2000 calories/day, which is much less than my body wants.) 

A lot of ""self-improvement"" advice like ""hit the gym!"" and ""eat right!"" has been more detrimental to me. I can't exercise without feeling irrationally disgusted about how my body looks compared to other people at the gym. Even if I try to separate health from looks by running or working out alone I still have the ideal body in my mind and I am so ashamed from how far away I am from it. Worse of all I am ashamed and I feel weak for not being able to exercise for health rather than for my own vanity. 

Running triggers me and I can't eat clean. I envy those gym bro's who can bulk and cut without going on self-destructive rants in their head against themselves, or those treadmill girls who can just run and run for an hour and eat salad without feeling like they are starving.


I am terrified of how I'll look when I'm older and I have less opportunities to be active.

If it helps to tailor any suggestions to my background: 

I'm a female student at an Ivy League college studying computer science. My GPA is about 3.67, which is pathetic given that I haven't taken all four CS courses a semester (I take at most 2 a semester.) I have a business internship at a company that most people my age have heard of, but it's no Google or Facebook. Nor I am not good at business internships (I'm too quiet, not motivating to listen to, work ethic needs improvement)

I'm not popular but I would say a good fraction of people in my classes know me. Most people would not know what the mental struggle in my head is like every day since I have a sunny exterior and I like to make people feel better about themselves."

1. What are the career paths for both jobs?

Failed all (didn’t bother with Twitters because I hear everyone gets it) except Western Digital where I went on site but didn’t get the offer. 

Obviously this means I lack the technical ability for an internship so I’ve been grinding LeetCode and HackerRank in preparation for next summer but I don’t want to just sit around on my ass all summer. I already have 2 pretty substantial projects on my resume (both are relatively intricate and consist of solid front-end and back-end design) so I’m not sure if a third project would really do my time well. 

I’d say despite not having any internship experience, my resume is pretty solid because I did hear back from 6 big companies, just didn’t have the data structures and algorithms skills to proceed. 

My uncle and I are thinking about starting a summer camp for kids where we’ll teach them the basics of coding and making a business out of it so that’s going to be pretty cool, but I definitely feel like I want to do something MORE. My friend gave me a referral to another company and they said if their current round of interviews don’t make it they’ll give me a call but I don’t wanna get my hopes up on a “maybe.” 

I was wondering what are things I could do this summer (besides the obvious LeetCode grinding) to make myself more hirable for summer 2020? I honestly just really want an internship and regret messing up all those coding challenges because with the level I’m at now, I could have definitely passed Google’s and Amazon’s (in retrospect, they really weren’t that bad, I was just a lazy idiot who did no LC prior to AFTER failing the challenges). 

Do you think companies would let me potentially shadow Software Engineers? I’d even do it for no pay at this point. I just want something to put my foot in the door of the industry. Any tips are appreciated and if you guys know of any companies who are still looking for interns (Bay Area/SoCal preferred) I’d greatly appreciate letting me know.

On the other hand, Palo Alto is like the tech capital of the world. I'm interested in entrepreneurial things, and for a while it has been a goal to get a job at a place like Google.

**Math/Logic Test**

I'm sure many of you are worried about this. Don't be, but its better to do some revision and practice before the test. For my test, questions on surds (mostly on conjugates) and some algebra came out. I can't recall clearly because its been over a year but I think some logarithm questions came out too. There were some H2 Math series questions that were tested but they aren't hard tbh. Differentiation/Integration weren't tested.

I prepared for the test by getting the MA1301 textbook and a stack of tutorial/past year papers to practice on. I'm not saying you should do the same, but I wanted to be well prepared and got them for only $5 on carousell :D (Revising on the Olevel Amaths topics should be okay I guess, but it will be safer if you read up on H2 topics too.)

Oh and the test format was pretty weird where for each question you  attempted and got it wrong, they deducted your marks, but nothing gets deducted if you leave a question blank. (I would suggest attempting those questions that you are confident of getting correct.) There were about 25 MCQ questions to finish within the 30min limit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Interview**

The interview was pretty chill. There were 2 professors interviewing me. They mostly asked about what I wrote in my personal statement and for me (Why I decided to switch from CS since I got a place for IS the previous year). For the interview, I showed them some of my side projects I worked on and how they were related to what i thought CS would be. I also shared about my internship experience. They asked me some questions which I can't really remember but something to do with what were my opinions of a systems engineer/software engineer, something like that.

Even though this year's interview may be different, I hope this helps! Good luck for your interview! :)"

* Food:  Living solely for food is probably unhealthy, especially considering that I tend to binge eat. But honestly, there is so much good food in this world. I want to eat the bacon egg and cheese bagel from that deli one last time before I die. I want to try the new curry place that opened. I want one last bowl of my mom's beef noodle soup before I make the decision to go. 
* Tuition: I don't think my school refunds tuition when a student dies before the end of the semester. Or maybe it does, but I am not part of whatever tuition refund plan they have. If I want my parents to get their money's worth, I should at least wait until this semester is over. 
*  Paper due this week: I don't want others to think that I killed myself because I ""couldn't write a paper/incapable of dealing with school stress what a pathetic and weak loser.""  If I leave, I should leave with a clean slate right? All assignments turned in, all responsibilities fulfilled. 
* My brother: I can't leave him to grow up alone. I want to be there for him as he hits all the milestones and whatnot. I want to see him graduate from high school. I want to see him go to college. I sort of have plans to pay for his college. And I really really don't want him to grow up with the pain of having a sister who committed suicide. 
* My parents. My mom. My dad. My dad especially. He'll probably lose it. My mom too, but she's always had to put on a strong face for our family. But I know what could happen. I've read about what parents become when their child dies. Hey, but I'm not a only child! My parents still have my brother! But no, I can't do that. Not to my brother. Not to my parents. 
* Possible internship?? The lady said she would get back to all the candidates, even if they didn't move on to the next round. She said she would try to get back to everyone by Monday (today). Obviously, that hasn't happened, but I keep telling myself: maybe she just needs some more time. Maybe she'll notify everyone tomorrow.  I know I probably didn't advance, but as long as hope exists, I can delude myself as much as possible.  And I can live another day, just for her email. 
* Friends I guess. They are really nice and smart and amazing people. One of my friends is already down on herself a lot. She's been through a lot, and I kind of worry that she has depression. We're not that close, but I feel like she would not take it well. 
* Classes: Honestly, my classes this semester are interesting. Obviously I don't exactly enjoy the homework or stress that comes along, but I like the material. I'm learning. My French professor makes me genuinely want to continue learning French. 
* Spring: The weather is really nice right now. There are flowers everywhere and the sky is always so blue and clear. Sometime I hate the beautiful weather because it doesn't correspond to how I feel inside. But sometimes, waking up to the sun streaming in gives me a little more motivation to get up. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are all the reasons I can think of for now. Sometimes, they don't seem like enough, even though they should be. They really should be. My life is honestly great. I once read in a book something like, ""Life is about delaying pain."" I guess these reasons are how I ""delay the pain."" One day after the other. To live. Just find one reason to live for another day, or hour, or minute, or even second. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to anyone who reads this post. I hope you have a nice day, and I hope you can find some reasons to live just a little bit longer too."

bb6c8v,6,2019-04-09,[CAREER ADVICE] What to do now?,crankthat99,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bb6c8v/career_advice_what_to_do_now/,"Hi guys, I've thought a lot about my career and finally feel like posting this on r/india and getting advice from you'll is the best option rn. This will be a bit long though, sorry about that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've completed my B. Tech in 2017. Initially, I've decided to do MS in USA and applied for some colleges for Fall 18, even got admission from a good university, but did not fly due to financial risks I've felt at that time and advices from friends who are already there. So, I've not tried for any job for about a year. Later, I've started focusing on learning programming. While I was at that, I had a good opportunity to work for a couple of months in sports management, took it and later continued pursuing my tech career as I've always been a tech enthusiast.

&amp;#x200B;

All this while, I was doing online work and earning more than 20k per month by working for very little time, I still do. My passion though has always been to work in the tech industry and make a career in the same but I feel I don't have the required skills yet, I am able to do some basic automation projects for myself but it's probably not enough. I've decent computer networking skills as well but it's pretty much like \*Jack of all trades\* atm. Now, the bigger problem lies in the fact that my parents are unhappy with me especially my mother who says \*What should I tell our neighbours and relatives?\* I asked her to say that I work online since I do make money somehow and at the end of the day, what you think about me is important and how does it matter for them about what I do. But my Mom keeps saying \*That's not how it works\* and I just can't convince her in that regard. My dad on the other hand although has a little of the same problem still has confidence in me as I do help him in his business through Excel automation and all other computer related stuff plus save money as well. I'm glad that I have parents who still listen to me most of the times but my Mom's worries about me make me worried, she's quite sensitive and very superstitious (sometimes blames I don't do enough Pujas), could say she's insular as well. I've tried applying for few internships on Internshala but did not get the right reply yet, some were asking for Industry projects and some were like \*Are you a Fresher? Sorry\*. I mean, why would an experienced guy try an internship for 5k per month at an expensive city like Pune?

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm thinking of lying to my parents that I did get a job and move to Bangalore and search for a job/internship with the help of my close friends who are already there and I could live by myself with the money I've earned till now while continue working online until I find the right job. I don't mind working for very little until I get the skills right as my family is financially stable and don't bother how much I save. Of course, they want me to earn high but right now, I think it's okay to tell them I earn around 25k like most of my peers. I just want to move out of here (Hyd) and live independently for some time, I'm hoping that could give me more motivation to boost my skills and keep trying harder living around the IT hub at B'lore.

&amp;#x200B;

As I regret some of the decisions I've made in my life so far, I seriously need suggestions or bits of advice from you guys about what to do. Please, tell it right on my face about what I shall do next. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I've completed my Engg couple of years ago and still searching for a tech job or rather the right path. Want to move away from my concerned parents, live independently and search for a job."

bb8ojp,80,2019-04-09,How to learn computer science as a beginner in 2019,mattupham,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/bb8ojp/how_to_learn_computer_science_as_a_beginner_in/," 

So you want to learn to code or become a software engineer but don’t know where to start? Below I’ll be breaking down the 3 main ways to learn when you’re just getting started.

If you prefer video format, make sure to check out this video below:

https://youtu.be/FdguW3EkbD0

The first avenue of learning how to code is getting the traditional undergrad degree. You can get any type of tangential tech degree that involves coding (electrical and computer engineering, robotics, etc), but the most straightforward way to becoming a software engineer is to get a computer science degree.

With a traditional degree, you get out of college with a potentially large network of peers that you can keep in contact with throughout your career. This can help you with jobs, advice, and other opportunities. Also, large companies will most likely come to your career fair specifically in order to seek out students for internships. This can increase your chances of getting experience during college, before your first full time job.

A huge drawback is that colleges don’t usually teach the most up to date skills. Most computer science degrees are very theory driven, and chances are you won’t come out with hot skills like web development, data science, or AI, unless you’ve done some learning on your own.

The second way of learning is by going to a coding bootcamp. Most bootcamps are focused on web development. This is the avenue that I took after finishing college with an Industrial Engineering. I found that the coding bootcamp really fit my learning style, and was one of the best investments I’ve ever made in my life thus far. These bootcamps are generally 3 months long, can be competitive to get into, and are generally geared towards people trying to make a career change.

With a coding bootcamp, and major plus is that they’re created with small groups of students in mind for the best learning experience. Bootcamps also can iterate much quicker than traditional educational institutions, so they are much more on top of teaching in demand skills in the industry. They provide arguably the best environment to learn how to code as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Coding bootcamps can require a large upfront cost to get into. Less bootcamps in 2019 are offering the model where you pay after getting your first job. These bootcamps also are not certified educational institutions, which could be a turnoff for some. Lastly, you will most likely have to drop everything (including a job) for 3 months in order to go to a bootcamp. While some offer part time remote bootcamps, these can take up to a year to complete. It’s much more efficient to do the 80 hour a week, 3-month route.

The final avenue you can take is the self-taught route. 

This route is great because it’s free or low cost. There are so many online resources you can use to supplement your teaching. Another thing to consider is that you will need this skill anyway if you pursue this career path. Gone are the days when education is over after you get out of school – you’ll need to be consistently learning to stay up with trends and new technology throughout your career.

Some cons of this route are that there is no structure or external pressure provided. You are really on your own. This is potentially the longest of the three avenues to becoming a software engineer. The hardest part is that you “don’t know what you don’t know”, and there’s nothing guiding you in the seemingly infinite world of technology.  You can check out the Ossu program on GitHub which is a great resource for people who are self taught! The final and biggest con is the confidence issue. The hardest part of technology (in my opinion) is not the technical aspect, but the confidence part. Imposter syndrome is real, and when it hits, you’ll have nobody to talk to or relate to. You’ll need to find someone to relate to, whether it’s an in-person or online community. 

Overall, there are many avenues you can pursue depending on your stage and life and financial position. I would recommend for anyone younger to think about getting a college degree or going straight to a coding bootcamp. If you’ve already pursued a different career path and want to make the switch, start with the self-taught route to see if coding is for you, and then go into a coding bootcamp. If you already have external mentors, or other people who can guide you, go the self-taught route. But you’ll need some kind of reference to keep you on course throughout the journey. This is just my advice, but depending on your situation, feel free to do whatever suits your needs, learning styles, etc. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"

This is because of dual enrollment. 

Basically does it sound crazy to come here for college? I really like the internship opportunities I’d have in the Bay Area + UCB has I think the #1 CS program. Plus I would be ahead of most freshman since I’d have done the equivalent of 61A/B this year. Also going here matches the amount of work I did in high school whereas I was guaranteed admission at UMN because I was already admitted last year. I also know that this is the only way I will get out of MN. I’ll probably get a job in MN if I stayed.

I do realise it's getting late for a grad role. I've applied for quite a few and haven't  heard back or heard back and no follow up communication. Would an internship be a better idea at this stage ?.  

All I want to do is get stuck in. I don't want to be left on the shelf in development. I'll do a boot camp or whatever necessary if need be. It's not even about the money it's totally negotiable. If there's any professional experts you know that could evaluate my job process and eliminate what might be restricting me that would be awesome.

bb99tc,115,2019-04-09,"This sub needs an overhaul sticky posts, Discord, new mods? (a rant)",healspersec,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/bb99tc/this_sub_needs_an_overhaul_sticky_posts_discord/,"As an unofficial subreddit for the biggest university in Washington, and honestly considering its prestige as an R1 and emphasis on computing, I think this subreddit should have a more active users managing it. The Automoderator is currently more active than the human mods, who haven't been online or posted here in months. I don't blame those mods for the lack of participation or care toward this subreddit--maybe they were students who graduated already and have lost interest in supporting this area. Finding people to take over something you created is also challenging. Who can you trust? How do you know they'll do a good job? What if you make a mistake in who you choose? Maybe that's something they don't have the time or interest in putting an energy into figuring out.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, it kind of sucks that the top search for ""university of washington"" + ""subreddit"" is this sub. New students, ever in tune with new technology and social media, are probably looking for an online space for answers to questions, opportunities on campus, and groups of people to find that may or may not be facilitated better with better organization of this subreddit and integration with a Discord server. I mean, maybe I am completely wrong about all of this, and maybe this sub is fine as it is, and maybe I am just obsessed with technology in organization and communication  (I am, I study it). Nevertheless, I see online communities like this as having potential for leveraging networks in ways that make visible more opportunities to students who are interested in participating in events at their university and getting experience in research or helping out other research projects that other platforms like Facebook are not as great at doing (for example, you can have pseudonyms here to protect your identity, content can be regulated by the community with voting, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;

If the old mods see this and are looking for some propositions for what I think should change, here's a list:

* Sticky posts for upcoming campus opportunities like: research assistantships, participant recruitment, internships, colloquiums, job fairs, free food, etc.
* Integrate a Discord server with the subreddit. The Discord servers are going to be more active than here, but they may also generate new sticky posts as students / alumni / etc. bring up new events going on or new information students should have. Having that integration is easy---just include a link to it on the sidebar.
* If the old mods really don't want to participate here anymore, they should at some point make some active members new moderators to help facilitate the above propositions. It's still going to be a relatively low activity subreddit, but it doesn't have to also be an unmanaged low activity subreddit either.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope anyone who reads this takes my rant with a grain of salt. I'm one person who's been mostly lurking the subreddit for a few years. I don't really think the subreddit is in any danger to itself or doing things ""incorrectly"". I just think there could be some ways to make it better."

(Experienced people, need your help!)",theNoodleZone,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bbb6w7/tired_of_contract_jobs_i_want_out_and_no_company/,"I have a problem in my career. I can't stay long enough in one job to be considered a ""known quantity"" that can be recalled upon to vouch for good work. And cannot transition from one job to another before losing the current one. And I know I'm shooting my career in the foot from it.

I never get jobs through recommendations. It's always been some sort of blind job application, and I'm tired of the rat race. Incidentally I have a non-STEM degree but I don't know if it still matters (or if it did matter as the initial ""seed value"" of my career)

Since starting my career, I mostly take on contract jobs. Although usually these aren't the kind of contracts they pay you good money to recognize the value- they're the kind of contracts that pay low because they really like cutting corners. In the first job they told me it was contract-to-hire but that was a lie. I got screwed over.

 Also, being small companies they keep a skeleton crew in the US and most of the technical operations are off-shore, so there's very few people to network with.

Here's a brief collection of my work history as a programmer:

* Jr. contractor, 18 months. Reason for leaving: I was let go for under-performing in the company. 6 months job searching
* Jr. developer. Reason for leaving: came in late too many times (long-ass commute). 2 months job searching
* Contractor, part-time, 3 months. Reason for leaving: Not enough available work. 4 months job searching
* Contractor consultant, PT, 20 months. Reason for leaving: Not enough available work, and took new contract job offer
* Contractor, 18 months. Reason for leaving: Company layoffs. 10+ months job searching
* Contractor, PT, 3 months. Reason for leaving: Contract finished, no more work. 8 months job searching
* Contractor, PT, 6 months. Reason for leaving: Contract finished one month ago

Out of all these jobs, I made some connections from the 2nd job, 5th job, and current job. But they usually don't know anyone that is hiring when I contact them, nor do they really contact me first about work.

I would be very okay with taking on full-time job even if it means going back to a junior job. I think employers assume I'd be too expensive to hire. Hell no. My past jobs paid miserably.

So I am at a standstill on how to build up my reputation after so much time spent not building it, so I can stabilize my career and work-life balance (I don't qualify for unemployment, and depending on a family member is not really that fun).

So what suggestions do you have for me so I can properly build up my credence as a full-time worker and do things a better way?

I see myself with these two options:

* Return to college and complete a CS degree whether as a BS or MS. Use the resources in college to network with people. Talk to professors, join career-oriented clubs, go to job fairs and take internships.

* Apply to larger companies for full-time roles, and interview prep. I don't know of any good reliable sources for interview prep. I'm talking to local developers through a Slack channel to see if anyone has time to interview me, but opening up time is hard.

I am open to other options besides these two. What do you think I should do to build that network and get more used to being recommended/vouched for so I don't have to stay in this rat race forever?"

I chose to study CS in college because I love technology, how technology is all around us, and what you can do with a simple programming language or the newest tech. The thing is, I never really envisioned myself to get into a ""typical"" CS role like software engineering/development upon graduation. I am a little more on the social and soft-skill heavy end personality wise and can not see myself fitting into that role of being independent and building something in a two-week sprint constantly.

I have been going through rounds and rounds of interviews for a bunch of different jobs (support engineer, sales engineer, technical consultant) and there has been one offer of the bunch that I currently have that has stood out the most and I feel like it would be a good fit for me.

It would be a support engineer role. Long story short, the company is an AI based solutions company for document and data management. The location is great, lots of amenities in their office, the team is all in their 20s (something I am looking for after getting bored to death at an internship last summer where the average age was 40), the pay offered is in the mid 70k's (USD) range (more than I anticipated for an entry level-role in Chicago), and what they do is more focused along the lines of what I like to do, which is to fix problems within their software rather than to build it up on your own. Also, there is a lot of vertical growth possible there since almost all of the managers and team leads there now started as support engineers, so I can imagine myself moving up given some time at the company.

The thing is, if I were to take on a Support Engineer role, would that be looked down up later down the road when I may possibly be in search for another job in a few years? For example, will a potential employer look at my resume and say to himself ""Oh, so he took the easier route/job out of college instead of becoming software developer.""? The role itself is technical, but I definitely would not be programming every day, if at all. The other support engineers there had various academic backgrounds, such as electrical engineering, data analytics, information &amp; decision sciences, mathematical computer science, and so forth.

Trying to gauge the idea of whether I should choose a position that fits my personality and what I like doing more or to do the job that most Computer Science graduates choose to do.

Thanks in advance!"
bbdwvz,8,2019-04-09,Effect of graduating two years early on grad school admissions chances?,hortonhearsaboo,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/bbdwvz/effect_of_graduating_two_years_early_on_grad/,"I’m scheduled to graduate from a top 5 CS program two years early with AP credits, and, although this will save me a lot of time and money, I am wondering how much this will disadvantage me in graduate school admissions, specifically if I choose to apply for terminal master’s programs like Stanford MSCS and UIUC MCS or deferred MBA programs like Harvard 2+2.

Assuming I am able to nail the other aspects of my application in two years - do well in my classes (my courseload is around 12-14 credits a semester, which should be manageable), hold two summer internships, and possibly have a leadership position or some other major extracurricular commitment - how much will graduating two years early hurt me? Will I be perceived as too young or as too eager to rush out of college? 

I suspect that this would be a bigger deal for deferred MBA programs, as being perceived as young can be a disadvantage in a business setting and programs like to show that all of their grads got offers somewhere six months after graduation."

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for taking a look into this post. I'll try to have a TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to keep this short and simple, I just need a solution that will work from someone who has been through this or similar, I know we all have challenges in this world.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Story:**

&amp;#x200B;

My father passed while I was in highschool. He was diagnosed throughout my highschool years. He survived cancer 2 times during that time; so the young and naive teenager that I was thought my dad would kick its ass again for the third time. I was wrong... So Wrong. Remember being in the hospice before knowing what it was used for thinking ""Wow my dad is being treated like a highroller before they send him home.""

&amp;#x200B;

After he passed the best way I felt like it was a surreal experience. I really believed my pops would pass when I was late 40s not when I was still in my teens.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, went through the whole sad depressed phase while my mom filed for bankruptcy. Played the pity game until one day I decided to man the fuck up and do shit so I packed my shit in my car and searched for opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

Ended up doing shit. Went to community college fucked up for the first 2 semesters because of depression. Third semester and forward nailed that shit. Transferred to uni nailed that shit too received internships at bulge bracket banks and investments fund with +2B AUM (Assets under management), did all of this while living in my car. My friend recorded me sleeping in my car, I was embarrassed and wanted to fucking kill him! .... We're still best friends to this day.

&amp;#x200B;

About to graduate at top 10% of my program, then grandma ends up getting sick. She has lost the will to go on after recent injuries and starts entering end of life stages.

&amp;#x200B;

My granny was 100 lbs of Old fashion Chinese tiger granny love and was the same lady that has taken care of me for my entire life and whooped my ass with a plastic fucking golf club when I was acting like a little shit. I was more close to this lady than my own fucking mother.

&amp;#x200B;

 Stuck between two choices my career or my last moments with grandma. Picked the morally correct one because turns out I didn't have the big dick and cold heart to forego spending and taking care of grandma over money and yachts. 

&amp;#x200B;

I delayed my last semester received a medical withdraw and ended up tanking with straight B's for my retake of last semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present day, it's been 6 years since my father passed and less than 1.5 years since grandma's passing. I'm working in finance industry as a consultant for enterprise companies, it's not too shabby. Still keep thinking about my G-Ma and Pops. Been thinking more and more about them recently. I started having dreams about them more frequently, whenever I do things that brings up memories of them I start getting sad and teary eyed. This fucking sucks, I fucking hate feeling like this I want to have these feelings gone, they're distracting. It's been worse to the point where I'm up at 4:39 in the morning with work starting 1.5 hours from now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please somebody who has been through this tell me what I need to do to get over this grieving process this is awful I hate it. I want to be done with it already, it's already been 6 years since my dad and 1 year since my grandma how much longer do I have to endure this for please please please, somebody help me, I feel like I'm dying.\\

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

Dad died when I was in my teens grandma died during my early 20s/late teens. I think I'm still depressed and grieving but it's already been 6 and 1.5 years since both of them died. How do I get rid of these grieving signs."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a college student from Canada and will be in Berlin for a few months for an internship. After hours of searching I finally got one reply back for a home that suits my location and budget. However, turns out it seems kind of sketchy to me.

The landlady says she has relocated to another country because of her work. So basically she wants me to give her my details so she can create a basic rental lease and she will mail that to me for me to sign. After that she wants me to give her the deposit amount of EUR 600 by western union after which she will courier the apartment keys through DHL.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I do not trust her about this. But a question just came up in mind about how people who are looking to rent finalize deals if they are in a different country. (Yes I know one option is to live in a hostel for a few days and then go personally apartment hunting). But just needed some advice on this. Is the basic rental agreement she referring to good enough to secure this and (legally) bind me to the agreement?

&amp;#x200B;

bbkwgs,11,2019-04-10,Self doubt just before my annual performance review,rm090,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bbkwgs/self_doubt_just_before_my_annual_performance/,"I was hired as an intern to the company I’m currently working at, after graduating with a masters degree (uncommon to hire a masters graduate as an intern but I was desperate). Six months later, they converted me into a FT employee and gave me a raise, but the salary was still very low based on my qualifications  ($50000 &amp; an unsatisfactory job title). 

Since then, I’ve consistently been performing well but last month, I really hit the jackpot. My primary job responsibility is research grant writing and a grant proposal I wrote was funded ($330,000). Additionally, another grant proposal that I wrote received very good scores from the reviewers and there is a high chance it will get funded too, bringing in another $1.7 M of funding (will know final decision by May/June). So, it is very likely that I would bring in over $2 M in funding this year and to give context, our company has not a won a single research grant in the past year. 

Even though it’s only been a year since I was converted to a FT employee, I’m going to ask for a promotion (better title &amp; a 15% salary raise) during my performance evaluation today. I could even propose that they could if they like, offer me a promotion, contingent on the second grant getting funded. That’s okay; I’m willing to wait a month or two. 

Is my strategy okay? Am I asking for too much or being unreasonable? If they are willing to negotiate, what is the least I should settle for?"

&amp;#x200B;

I have been applying for internships and have gotten callbacks and interviews, but nothing has come of it so far. This is my fourth interview and I think I fit the position very well. I just finished an interview with the recruiter and she moved me on to the next round with the hiring manager, however she mentioned that there could be no relocation assistance provided. This will be there 2nd official summer of having an internship program, but have had interns in the past she said. My interview with the hiring manager is some time this week.

&amp;#x200B;

During the interview, she told me that they do not offer relocation assistance and if it was okay with me. It was in the moment and I wanted to focus on the interview (as I do not have much experience yet), so I said it was fine and that I would do what it takes to gain this experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I would be moving from a relatively low COL (Texas) to California bay area for approximately 3 months in summer. She did mention that interns typically get paid $26 to $31 per hour.

I do not feel as I am in the right place to negotiate and the industry is not very big here in Texas so it's forcing me to really look abroad. I am unsure what goes through the company's mind when they interview applicants that are not local and at the same time, do not offer relocation (this is not meant to sound harsh). I am trying to figure out the logistical matters as well such as if I can even find a place close to work, what about a car, etc. The more I think about these things, the more unrealistic the option looks. With that being said, I have never done an industrial internship before so I am unsure of companies' efforts to help interns get housing etc, but this is an opportunity I'd really like to get.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience with negotiating or advice for someone getting their first internship? I am trying to keep a level head despite interviews going well, but I just want to prepare the best I can."

bbmpdw,1,2019-04-10,42% unemployment rate and job anxiety. Will I be able to find a job after my degree?,EmotionalTomatillo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bbmpdw/42_unemployment_rate_and_job_anxiety_will_i_be/,"Making this post has been a long-time coming for me, and something I've put-off for a few years, but reality is catching-up and I will soon need to find work, again...but the prospect of it has been leaving me extremely scared and anxious. Am I SOL?

&amp;#x200B;

About a decade ago, roughly, I entered the job market, without a degree (I had something that's above HS and bellow a BS/BA in natural sciences - useless in practice). I had no money and no family, so no choice either. At that time the unemployment rate was around 42%, which made it ""difficult"". The average wage for people entering the job market was about 4'000$ (per year), less than the minimum-wage (labour law are excellent, but entirely unenforced), and it was common-place to see people with PhD working in call-centres and McDonalds. At the time McDonalds was one of the highest, if not the highest, paying jobs for people without at least a Bachelor (although, by FAR not the best place to work - we have many, MANY, people making &gt;20k/y, but you need diplomas and to know the right people).

&amp;#x200B;

After years of hell, with employers often not paying you at all, working 50-60h/week, having no holidays or breaks (you'd often get yelled at for taking more than an 8s break), I went to University, my dream since I was a kid (praise be free education). Fast-forward to now, and the very thought of having to look again for a job has me almost crying...help, please. Do I have any chance of finding a job with these skills?: (I'm open to emigrating again after my degree (currently studying in the EU), but would prefer it be within Europe - my country of origin is not part of the EU, but I have EU citizenship).

&amp;#x200B;

**Diplomas:**

\- HS level degree in natural sciences

\- Bachelor in International Relations, with a minor in history and a major in European International Law.

\- Doing a Master's in International Macroeconomics

Note: both Uni-level degrees were obtained at one of Europe's top 20 public universities.

**Skills:**

\- Fluent in three languages, can understand five (the four big languages of the American continent, EN, PT, FR and ES) and Italian. I have a diploma in German, but can no longer speak or understand it at all. I also have some understand of Latin and Japanese, but both at a comparatively rudimentary level.

\- Decent IT skills, specially in networking (Linux, LAMP, etc).

\- Some volunteer work.

**Work experience:**

\- Internship at a large IR organisation.

\- Internship at a primary school

\- Private language tutoring for about 7y (I do not have any paperwork to prove it, things here are always done under-the-table).

\- Miscellaneous positions in tech-support and service jobs. Most of them paid around 2400$ to 4800$ a year. Can't provide proof for almost any of them, besides pictures of me at work. Again, paperwork at the time was ... well, more myth that fact.

**Relatives and friends opinion on job prospect:**

\- No chance of getting anything, except maybe cleaning toilets at a fast-food; skills are too target towards the EU and not at all transferable.

**Factual data:**

\- unemployment rate is about 1/7 of what it was (in my geographic area of origin) and nationally is about 1/3 of what it was a decade ago. Wages and working conditions have barely budged, however, whilst cost-of-living has risen sharply.

\- there is a ridiculous oversupply of skilled workers. Even with an MS degree you will almost always be leap-frogged by someone with two masters or a PhD (or both).

\- Diplomas trump all other skills. A higher diploma always mean you get hired first...unless it's a ""dark"" job (not registered with the state, a small percentage of jobs, but the only one where having more diplomas is bad), in which case you run a very high chance of not being paid as you can't file a complaint.

**Note:** I'm not giving the exact detail or name of my country of origin because the image I'm giving is that of a hopeless place with no jobs. In reality we have a very skilled workforce and a gorgeous nation with amazing people. Our economy, however, is none of those things, but I wouldn't want it to be the only thing you know about an otherwise astonishing place. Also, in case it matters, I'm a Roman Catholic white male with no accent and a European sounding name.

**TL;DR:**

\- After my Master's, I'll need a job. Although on paper I've got decent skills, the reality seems entirely dismal and hopeless. Besides selling my labour extremely cheap, do I have any future? I'm getting extremely anxious and depressed as the end of my degree approaches..."

bbnkl0,18,2019-04-10,"TIFU by not listening to reviews, losing my job, and nearing bankruptcy",RRR3000,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bbnkl0/tifu_by_not_listening_to_reviews_losing_my_job/,"Obligatory ""didn't happen today..."", as the TIFU happened 2.5 years ago, but only now am I enjoying the results. Listen to reviews people!

Just over 2.5 years ago, laptops were announced with a new GTX 10-series graphics card. For those not familiar with computers, this was a new technology for rendering in both games as well as other graphical applications. At the time, I was about to start an internship with a VR company (I was following a study Game Development), and needed a new laptop for developing for VR. I'd found a laptop that had a great deal, €400 off of a €2000 laptop. Looking into it, I found tons of bad reviews on the brand's support, as well as some reviews on the specific model having heat issues, among other smaller things. Asking friends who had the same brand they could confirm some of the smaller problems, but not the bad support, and though they did confirm it had trouble staying cool it hadn't really been a problem for them. I figured the bad-support reviews were just people not happy about having problems in the first place, and that it was probably nothing. The sale was just too good, so I decided to get it anyways, regardless of the reviews. That day, I fucked up.

In the 2 years I'd been using it, it had gotten hot on occasion, but generally held up very well. Especially since I was expecting bad heat management due to the reviews, I was pleasantly surprised it would only really get hot during the hottest summer months. The VR internship lasted about 5 months, and then I did a second internship of about 5 months at a different company. During this entire time, the laptop worked great, and after the internships were over and I had to attend classes again I used everything I'd learned to start freelancing on the side, mostly because my intern companies still had some work for me. This has been my job since then, as I'm still a student, now about to graduate Game Art.

Around last christmas, I started getting notified by Windows10 to schedule an update. Nothing crazy, it usually happens, but since it was some time off from college I was playing games with friends a lot, and usually using the laptop when it asked to update, so I always chose ""remind me later"" and moved on. A week later, the evening of the 29th, my laptop restarted itself while I was in the kitchen grabbing a snack. As I came back to my laptop restarting itself, I assumed it was the update, and just waited for it to turn back on again. Except it didn't turn back on, so eventually I turned it on myself. I immediately notice the resolution having changed, so I change it back, and go to start my game back up. Except I get a really weird error: ""No compatible graphics driver"". Going into the device manager it turns out the graphics card is giving error 43, ""device failed"", and after trying a whole bunch of solutions, nothing seems to work. 

The next day I contact support, and after support has me do some tests they determine it's a hardware issue, not a software issue, and the laptop has to be send back to be repaired. I had contacted US support instead of European support, so I'd have to pay for repairs being out-of-area which would cost $1500 *at least* (the laptop had cost me €1600 2 years prior). They advised me to instead contact EU support where I'd still be in the 2-year warranty, and I agree to do so the next day as support here had already closed for the holiday (time difference). So, the following day I try contacting them, but on both the support chat as well as the phone I get an automated message stating they are currently closed, an to try again later. Weird, but it's new years day, they probably just have the day off. 

For the following weeks, every couple days I'd again try contacting them, and I'd get the same message about them being closed, and I didn't get through to them until the first week of February. At this point, I'm annoyed I've not been able to do anything, but I've been able to use a laptop loaned from my college which has helped me to at least complete homework, study for tests, etc. The only catch being that I couldn't take those home so I couldn't really work. When I finally get through to support, the first thing they ask me to do is the same tests again since they can't look up the case number generated earlier due to a system outage, so I do all tests again, and once more they conclude it is indeed a hardware issue. However, due to the outage, they cannot at that point confirm my serial number so I'd have to contact them again later. So, I wait again. 

Once again I get ""we're closed"" multiple times before reaching them again. By now it's late February, and I'm really starting to lose my patience. So I ask them why I always keep getting a ""we're closed"" message, and as it turns out ""when support gets busy, they sometimes decide to close early"". I don't really understand the logic, but whatever, I'm done and just want to get it over with. So I give them the original case number (hadn't received one the last time due to the outage) and they claim this case number doesn't exist. I have screenshots of the first support chat showing the number, I have it written in my notes, but still it ""doesn't exist"" so fine I go through the whole thing *again* and, who would have guessed, they determine it's a hardware issue. They then go on to tell me how warranty had expired on January 1st, and I'd have to pay for repairs. When asked about the price, they name a send-in fee of €100, and say they won't know the exact price until they've looked at the laptop, but it would be at least €500 more for the graphics chip if nothing else needed repairing/replacing. They also mention that if I send it in and do not agree to the final ""repair fee"" they determine, I'll have to pay an unknown amount in ""reduced repair fee"" to get it returned, or they'll recycle the parts. Me, thinking I must've misunderstood the message (they didn't threaten to keep my laptop hostage *before* I send my laptop, did they?) but nope it was confirmed to be exactly that. 

I don't really understand their logic here, but I ask them to check the original case number again (since that *was* created during December when I'd have had warranty), but again they claim the case number doesn't exist and that there is no cases in my account (you have to login to contact support). Furthermore they tell me that had I wanted to contact them earlier, I could've tried a different way (except whenever I tried *their official website &amp; phone line told me they were closed*). As I'm not sure about paying such a large (and unknown) amount just for getting it checked out, I decide I first want to look up more info online on this specific repair, to see if I can find more info on the actual cost. As it turns out, they'd most likely just try to replace the whole motherboard, which would be more expensive than the mentioned amount from the chat. It's also more than I had put away (partially since there was no income since January, but bills keep coming), so I asked around to see if I could find a cheaper repair somewhere. I didn't have much luck since these boards and chips are usually laptop-model specific unlike desktop computers, since they need to fit exactly in a small laptop design, however I did get a helpful comment from someone on local warranty laws. See, the law isn't just a 2-year minimum warranty, but beyond those 2 years there's also an expected lifespan. For laptops for example, the expected lifespan is 5 years, so within those 5 years they have to replace the parts (though they can charge a cost based on how far into that time I am/how expensive repair would be). We have companies over here who specialize in these requests, and through one of them I requested a cheaper repair, but they denied the request since they have a 2 year warranty so tough luck. 

By now it's April, and at this point I cannot do work since I do not have a working laptop, and I am very close to running out of savings. I contacted support last time right before March, and now beginning of April I'd send the official request (I just heard back from). Currently finals are going on till the end of the schoolyear, hence the larger timegap between those last 2 events. This also means it'll be extremely difficult for me to have a job right now, as I really need to focus on those finals (hence the 4 months of saved up cash). The plan now is to scrape together some money for a new laptop. Any tips are appreciated. Another current plan is to never buy this brand again, and deter others from buying from them. Everything from the reviews turned out to be true, so I guess the lesson is listening more to reviews.

TL:DR; I didn't listen to reviews of overheating laptops &amp; bad support, haven't been able to work since last december when the graphics card fried and support's been unsupportive, and I'm pretty much out of savings going into finals."
bbnlag,6,2019-04-10,22 year-old at an investing crossroad,kitan3000,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/bbnlag/22_yearold_at_an_investing_crossroad/,"Hi PFC!

I am 22 years old and I need some advice from more experienced investors. I currently have $11,000 invested in two Fidelity mutual funds: Fidelity Global Intrinsic Value Class Series B (FID2928) and Fidelity Insights Class Series B (FID5491).

Originally I put $2750CAD into each mutual fund in mid-January 2018 and another $2750CAD into each fund in late April 2018. As of yesterday FID2928 is down 1.44% from my start date and FID5491 is up 11.89%.

When I put money in the mutual funds, I didn’t know how much management fees affected returns until I started entering numbers in calculators and I realized they suck all your returns. I emailed my financial advisor mid-last year asking about the pros and cons of actively managed funds she said this, “mutual funds do have a higher fee but are actively managed and designed to outperform the market in good years and reduce the downside in negative years”.

***I FOUND OUT MY MER FEES ARE 2.31% AND 2.32%!***

Because of this I started researching other avenues to make money/invest and realized that actively managed funds are about 50/50 in beating the market so it makes sense to get passively managed funds because I doubt the average actively managed fund will be on par with the average passively managed fund when you take into account the fund expenses.

I opened a Questrade account on Monday and need to fill out some more documentation but I hope to invest $5000 in a few different ETFs because I’ve read that ETFs have low fees. I plan on making a portfolio with a blend of growth/ growth &amp; income/ aggressive growth/ and international ETFs.

So my question is should I leave my money in my actively managed mutual funds with the ridiculous MER fees or should I take some (or even all) of my money out of the mutual funds and put it into ETFs? I will not need the money as I’m on an internship right now for another 5 months and I have enough money in my chequing/ savings accounts to pay for tuition/ food/ rent/ etc. when I go back for my final year in university. I also don't plan on touching the money for several years and I plan to contribute more when I get a full-time job after graduation. I don’t want to be drastic and pull money out of my mutual funds but at the same time I don’t want to keep money in there because that’s money I could be investing elsewhere with lower fees.

What should I do?

Thanks,

bbo3nq,59,2019-04-10,"First ""Real"" Investment Banking interview coming up late next week...Need advice!",dariussssss,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/bbo3nq/first_real_investment_banking_interview_coming_up/,"Hi all,

I'm a long time lurker of this sub and this will be my first post. I appreciate the help.


**Backstory:**
So I graduated last Spring (2018) from a non-target with a relatively average GPA and a degree in Biology. Long story short, my parents (and myself) are first generation immigrants and they were pretty strict with the whole ""You have to be a Doctor or an Engineer"" stereotype, and didn't really let me study or pursue anything I wanted. Upon graduation I applied and was able to get a few offers from various labs in the North East doing research work and this was meant to be a bridge for me to get into Medical School (pay for these lab jobs was dog shit and it wasn't something I wanted to do anyways). Anyways, right before I was ready to accept one of these offers I was referenced to an internship position at a local boutique investment bank. I speak 5 languages and this was really my big value as a candidate especially since one of the languages I spoke was directly applicable to the geographic area where many of our clients are based. Fast forward a few months, I am offered a full time position (which I accepted) and the firm has offered to sponsor me for my various licenses (63, 79, 82). Additionally, there are a lot of very smart and accomplished MDs at my current firm and they've taught me a lot in the brief time that I've been here. There aren't many junior level people so I am constantly working for these guys and rubbing shoulders with them.


**What I do:**
During my time at my current firm thus far (8 months), I have been primarily responsible for several tasks. These include client origination (business development), client relationship management, production of executive summaries for sponsor firms, production of redacted teasers, investor/buyer research, accounting tasks, and I've had limited financial modeling exposure. Remember, I knew next to nothing about finance when I first started and I consider myself lucky every day to have been able to get my foot in the door. The nice part about working at a smaller firm is that I have a lot of responsibility with front office tasks and do genuinely get plenty of client facing experiences. I've been to many meetings and even serve as a point of contact for several of our sponsor firms. I have never really served as a number cruncher and rarely spend more than 2 hours straight doing excel work. As a firm, we primarily specialize in capital raising and private placements. My group recently closed a deal this year which has been a great talking point. Not much M&amp;A or IPO activity.


**What I'm looking for:**
While I do love my firm, I am looking to make moves for several reasons. Primarily, I'm looking to move to a larger firm with a more steady deal flow and larger deal size. What I've come to learn in my brief career as an investment banker is that I love investment banking and that I'm a total junkie for deals. I love deals and love working on them and being involved in them. I just want to expand my knowledge and exposure. Additionally, my firm is not in NYC and that's somewhere I'd like to be in order to develop my career in this space. Lastly, the pay is not great where I currently work and our compensation is largely dependent on bonuses from closed deals so as you may have guessed it's not ideal. 


**Current opportunities:**
So as of recently, several recruiters have taken interest in my unique candidate profile and were able to get me noticed by several banks. I have a phone screen with a tiny healthcare M&amp;A bank and an in-person with a middle market bank which would include a technical interview with a modeling test. I am excited to be making progress in my journey but at the same time am quite concerned for the upcoming technical interview. I fear that my modeling skills and technical abilities aren't adequate enough and I've been doing everything in my power to study and prepare.

I know this is all a mouthful but I guess what I'm looking for is some feedback on how I should approach this upcoming technical interview, as well as any advice you may have for me developing my career in general. It's been a long journey on a rocky road, especially as a non-target nobody but like I mentioned, I am happy to have gotten my foot in the door and will stop at nothing until I am sitting in a desk at an NYC investment bank. Please share your thoughts, advice, criticisms and anything else you may have in mind. 

I appreciate you guys taking the time to read this."

I don't have access to my report cards and I didn't know my closest friend until I was an adult.**

Edit 1: I'm American for those wondering. 

Hey, I made a [post a couple of weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/b70q86/my_mom_forced_me_to_cancel_a_doctors_appointment/) ranting about my situation when my mom rejected the idea of me seeking a diagnosis for ADHD.  I went to my health provider to cut email and phone contact from my parents, but they can still see the bill when it comes in if I was to schedule something with my GP.

I thought that my ADHD like symptoms limited to lectures and at home, but I now know it may affect how I work at my internship as well.  I thought I was doing well in grad school, but I was recently told by my internship that while I did improve (I'm doing an internship for being a speech pathologist), my response time aren't fast enough (I'm not giving my students spontaneous feedback by 1-2 seconds), it takes me too long to process and gather my thoughts to explain something to my students, and I word things awkwardly.  I always try to arrive to my internship early so I have enough prep time, but it feels like I never have enough time to prepare myself.  I feel like I have nothing together in my life, everything is a chaotic mess, and I'm always scrambling to keep myself composed in spite of wanting to cry because I feel incompetent academically and at my internship.  Every week feels like I barely scraped by emotionally and academically.

I'm starting to wonder if paying out of pocket for a diagnosis is the only way to avoid detection from my parents, but I'm concern about how much it will cost.  I want to get a diagnosis under $400 at the very least.  I don't know the process on how to start looking for specialists who can help me and I'm scared that I will be rejected because I don't my report cards from elementary school and I didn't become close to my best friend until college.  I think about the possibility of giving a self report to my parents and I have a bad feeling about it because they're in denial that I need help.  My family thinks even if I did have ADHD, going on medication would ruin my life because health insurance and future employers would reject me and that I'm not ""trying hard enough"".  The biggest thing that seems to anger my family is having anything written on my health record that there is something ""not normal"" about me.  I feel like I've been cornered and I don't know what to do.

Can someone please give me a breakdown on how to get diagnosis out of pocket and how to start?  If I do need medication, I'll likely have to go to my health provider to see if they will cover it.  I know medication will not be the magic bullet for my troubles, but I need direction on what to do.  I feel like a diagnosis will at the very least tell me why I function the way I do and help me figure out how to manage my life from there on.

I'm also at a loss because I went to my school district office for my transcript , they told me they don't do grades in elementary school.  My school district said that they don't have record of my grades from elementary school, only my vaccine history and absences.  I have my high school and college transcript, but I'm not sure if that means anything and I have been consistently an A- to B- student in later years, although I had two C's in college for classes I disliked.

In regards to grades, I did poorly in early elementary school with C's until I attended tutoring in 2nd grade up to high school, which gave me access to worksheets and exams that the teachers at my school wouldn't give me until days/weeks later.  I practiced those worksheets and exams until I memorized the answers/steps for them.  I did better in middle and high school,  but I had poor study habits and wouldn't study until the night before exams.  I didn't learn to study days ahead until I went to college for my undergraduate degree.  I used to research which college classes with the highest percent of people passing so I could take them to push my gpa up.

My parents may have my report cards and claim they don't know where it is, so I only have my memories to rely on in terms of background history.  My mom thinks there's no point in thinking about the past, but I want to at the very least see my report card with my very eyes for confirmation on things I remembered as a child, like my forgetfulness for assignments and instructions.  I wish I could have something concrete to back myself up because I want to have proof to show to a specialist should I decide to schedule an appointment."

I am a soon-to-be undergrad, and have done only one paid internship so far. I graduate in another month, and my entire college life I have never gone anywhere to travel (I really really really love to travel to places) with friends or made any memories, to be fair. My whole college life was dull and boring save the occasional travelling to a mall or a renowned market or stuff like that. Its the end of my college life, and I really want to have at least one good memory of travelling with friends. Few of my seniors want to take me, but I feel so guilty about using my parents' money for travelling, especially since my dad retires in about two months time. I'm having an internal conflict about whether I should go or not - on one side, if I don't go, I'd miss out and possibly regret it later, another, if I do, I'd probably hate myself for travelling at the expense of my parents.

I wish someone had told me that as a freshman (although hiring continues all year, and some freshman-specific programs open in Winter). 

If you're interested in software engineering, these two guides should cover you:

* [How to land a top-notch tech internship — and a tech job — while you’re still in school](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-land-a-top-notch-tech-job-as-a-student-5c97fec82f3d): A very detailed overview of the CS recruiting process from internships to your first job.

* [Internship Hunting as an Underclassman](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/7wxf21/guide_internship_hunting_as_an_underclassman_and/): I wrote this guide targeted at 1st and 2nd year students, primarily community college students. It's mostly a collection of useful terms and resources to know, like useful Facebook communities (I know a lot of you don't have Facebook, but older people who can refer you to jobs do. So get one.) with links to find out more about them.

The list of freshman/sophomore-specific internship programs in the second one is outdated, so here's a more up-to-date and complete list. You can apply to any internship at any company if you're confident in your skills, but freshman-specific internships have lower standards. 

Almost all freshman-specific programs target URMs or top university students, but you can apply anyway if you don't fit. Sometimes they'll consider you, sometimes they'll refer you out to the company's regular software engineering internship. 

**Impt:** Some of the companies below work on projects that may seriously conflict with your morals and values. If you get an interview, do your research.

**Internships**

* Facebook University
* Google Engineering Practicum
* Google Applied Machine Learning Intensive
* Microsoft Explore
* Uber STAR
* Palantir PATH (low income/first gen/disadvantaged. Limited/no industry experience)
* Twitter Academy
* EA Pathfinder
* Code2040 Fellows Program (Black or Latinx only, must start app before October 17th) (Matches you with high-growth tech companies, like Google or 23andMe. Also offers non-technical roles at tech companies)
* Amazon Future Engineer Program
* Two Sigma Freshman Software Engineering Internship
* Dropbox Launch (Freshmen) (Must have no previous software engineering internship experience) (Must have Python experience)
* Bank of America Global Technology Freshman Summer Analyst Program
* Ford 2019 Information Technology - Intern Freshman Students Only
* Pinterest Engage (I'm 95% sure this was discontinued, but I've seen references to it online so maybe it's still out there)

Also, govt agencies ([NSA/Gov Intelligence](https://apply.intelligencecareers.gov/student-tiles), NASA (NASA also runs a [program for international students](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/descriptions/international-internships-for-students.html)), DOE CCI or SULI, etc.), banks, and non-profits tend to be freshman-friendly (meaning they'll test you, but at least they'll consider you). 

**Programs**

* Microsoft New Technologists Summer Academy (7 weeks, $5,600, no housing)
* UConn has [this list](https://diversity.business.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/985/2015/11/Summer-Leadership-Programs.pdf) of ""leadership programs"", mostly at finance companies. These programs recruit for *all* corporate roles, everything from software engineering to investment banking to HR (depending on what the company provides), so sign up for email notifications for whichever ones apply to you. 
* Square Code Camp (5 day, all expenses paid, women only, due in October)
* Google Summer of Code

I recently had a great interview with a company based pretty close to Silicon Valley in California. I think I might be offered the position! But unfortunately, they don't pay for relocation or lodging for the duration of the internship, they've mentioned more than once that the wage may not even cover rent while I am living there for the 8-10 weeks. I believe the internship could be a really good opportunity to gain experience (I don't have a lot of resume worthy hard skills) as well as being exposed to a lot of the company's inner workings and upper-management type of meetings and such. All in all, it seems like a dream opportunity for me at the moment. The only issue is that it might actually cost me money to take the internship, which isn't great since tuition is going to be difficult for me next year. 

Based on your experiences, would it be worth it? Does anyone have tips for finding some more affordable housing? Any advice would be helpful! Thanks."

My manager doesn't even talk to me normally and he's always said he doesn't want me to always ask questions to other people on the team because it will take time away from their work. I honestly feel like a robot when I'm in the office on my computer for 8 hrs.

The internship ends in 5 weeks, but I'm on edge at this point. Should I just tough it out or quit? I'm honestly thinking of just no showing and ghosting them"

I've worked my butt off applying to about 100 places and about 10 have gotten back to me for interviews. An ad agency I interviewed at 2 weeks ago interviewed me and immediately sent me an offer after video portion of the interview. I like this agency but they're on the smaller side in terms of employees and recognition and they're on the other side of the country. Some pros are I'd get to work with a very well known client and I really gelled with the team I'd be working with. I'v already asked for an extension on giving my decision so I have to tell them this week. 

The other places I applied to are in NorCal and in a city I'd want to end up in the future. I have about 5 places that I'm either going to interview or have done the initial interview at. I all really like what they're doing and what they'll have me doing as an intern. It's also where my partner can easily get a job too. The cons are that the cost of living are a lot higher than the city I got an offer at and the main con of course is I don't have any for-sure offers so I'm risking not getting any internships at all. 

Should I bite the bullet and accept the place I got an offer for or just risk it and hope one of the west coast places will give me an offer?"

Company 1: Midsize startup,  will be working on lower level programming projects (I've been told that previous interns work on 10GbE test apps, working on their build system and testing, working on test software to control test equipment, and writing drivers for some boards). This offer pays very generously

I'm tempted to go with company 1 because of their pay, but I'm not sure if the experience gained at company 2 will give it a greater opportunity cost. Can anyone with some experience in the industry shed some light on how valuable the experiences are in each company?

bbslwe,520,2019-04-10,I Responded to a Slapping Ad on Craigslist Casual Encounters,badgreenapple,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bbslwe/i_responded_to_a_slapping_ad_on_craigslist_casual/,"While most of my ex-colleagues scurried to find jobs or internships upon graduating, I found myself spending my days eating ramen and watching Dr. Phil marathons.

Although I liked the idea of being a hotshot career woman, something about the monotony of the 9 to 5 cubicle life made me want to crawl into a dark closet and never come out. Although I dated various men, I never felt a deep connection that made me want to take the relationship further. Although I wanted to be a social butterfly, lying in bed seemed so much easier. It seemed I just wasn’t cut out for life.

After a couple of months of leeching off my parents, I halfheartedly perused several job boards. Nothing appealed to me. On an especially depressing vodka-fueled night, I went on Craigslist in the hopes it might offer something different, or even random…and then I clicked my way into the strange world of Craigslist casual encounters.

I’d never browsed this section of Craigslist before, but it was entertaining to read the various ads, especially the fetish ones. I have my own fetish, you see, so I’ve never judged—although a few ex-boyfriends have. After my last ex, I was afraid to reveal it again.

The ads ranged from everything from requests for foot worshipping to Tabasco-drenched orgies. It was actually refreshing to see people so explicitly reveal what they wanted done to them. And then I came across an ad that made my heart skitter to a stop.

“I am a 35-year-old male looking for a female to be the recipient of slapping. All slapping will be consensual (a.k.a, I will stop as soon as you want me to stop). Encounter can be either at your place or mine. If desired, regular encounters can be scheduled at your discretion. Feel free to message me in order to receive a photo. No sexual contact.”

It was my fetish.

I responded to the ad. Yes, it piqued my interest. But no, I wasn’t in it to fulfill my sexual needs. I was in it for the money. He emailed me almost immediately, and I responded by asking him whether there would be any sort of monetary compensation involved, and if so, how much. I had a feeling not many women were signing up for a sex-free slapping session. He answered, “Name your price.”

\*\*\*

I asked him to come to apartment. Something about it felt safer, which was a joke, because I was placing myself in one of the most unsafe situations you could think of.

My heart was racing. I kept taking tiny sips of Sprite because my mouth was so dry. And then exactly at two o’ clock, he knocked on my door.

His name was Mark (or so he claimed). He looked better than his photo, which was surprising. Tall, with tousled hair that had a touch of gray, despite being only thirty-five (or so he claimed). He had deep, sorrowful eyes. I’d always been a sucker for sad eyes.

“Hello.” He stayed at the door, looking nervous. God, his was awkward.

“Come in,” I said, trying to sound both welcoming and intimidating.

Mark inched his way in. I told him to take a seat. He sat. I asked if he’d like a drink, and he declined. I sat on the sofa, as far away from him as I could. I was regretting my decision by the moment.

“Can I have the, um, payment now?”

“Certainly,” he exclaimed, and hurriedly reached into his wallet. And then he produced what I had asked for—ten hundred dollar bills. Taking the money from him felt surreal, and for a moment everything around me went hazy. I wasn’t even being paid for sex. I was being paid for slapping.

I had no idea whether I would enjoy being slapped by a stranger. I’d only experienced a single one night stand, and it didn’t appeal to me. I wondered if slapping would be the same as sex—if I needed to receive it from someone I trusted, cared about, or at least knew.

After a few moments of silence, he asked, in the voice of one trying to make stilted conversation on a first date, “What made you respond to my ad?”

“I needed the money,” I said. I felt my face burn. He was a total stranger, yet I felt myself shrinking with how pathetic I sounded.  “And—and I like it.”

“You like being slapped?” Something about my revelation seemed to light up his eyes. Perhaps he also felt like a freak, and was elated at finding kinship with someone.

“Yes, but I could never find someone who liked it. At least not as much as me.” I thought back to my last boyfriend, whose mouth had curled in a mix of disbelief and reluctance. *You want me to abuse you?*

“It’s difficult feeling different,” he said quietly

I didn’t bother to ask him why he posted the ad, because the answer seemed obvious to me. He was a good-looking man in designer jeans with a seemingly impressive wallet (at least in my 22-year-old mind) who wasn’t able to get his rocks off because none of his vanilla girlfriends would oblige his sexual fantasy. His need. I completely empathized.

I moved slightly closer to him. “You can do it now,” I said.

I had worried the experience would be unpleasant with a stranger—that as with sex, it would be less satisfying, less pleasurable, less mind-numbingly exquisite. I was wrong. It was better.

\*\*\*

The fifth time Mark came over, I asked if he wanted to get dinner. Mark seemed hesitant, but agreed.

Over wine and pasta, we talked about our pasts—our difficult childhoods, our terrible exes, our favorite memories. We refrained from discussing details about the present, the illicit haze of Craigslist anonymity still over us. I still didn’t know where he lived or what he did for a living.

Our shared, secret experiences, however, made me feel more at ease with him than with anyone I had ever known.

After his third glass of wine, Mark looked at me above the candlelit table. “You’re beautiful.”

I didn’t blush or feel embarrassed. I’d heard this statement many times before. I knew it was true, but I felt so much ugliness inside, hearing it never brought me pleasure.

Hearing it from Mark, though, felt different. He was the first person who not only knew the sexual part of my being, but understood it.

We had sex for the first time. Afterward, I immediately felt asleep. I’d started feeling tired lately. I was probably coming down with a cold, or all the sexual excitement was somehow draining me (in the best way possible).

After our ninth meeting, I told Mark he didn’t need to pay me anymore. He still insisted on paying me. That should have been a clue.

After our tenth meeting, I was ten thousand dollars richer, and extremely exhausted all the time. Mark started cooking me dinner during our visits. Since the first time we’d met, he was so much more relaxed. There was a new light to his face and a warmth to his voice that made me feel at home. When he left, my apartment felt so dark and cold.

During our eleventh meeting, I firmly told him I didn’t want him paying me anymore. He didn’t respond, only looked at me with his sorrowful eyes. It suddenly hit me that it might be his way of trying to financially support me. But daring to hope that he actually cared…it was an outlandish foolishness I didn’t even want to admit to myself.

Instead of forcing him to respond, I led him to my bed. We lay together, listening to strains of the sad songs my neighbor liked playing, the warm breeze from the window drifting over our skin. I turned over on my side and put my head against his chest.

“Fuck me,” I said.

He did. And in a hoarse voice he spoke dirty to me, which I loved. And then he began hitting me, which I loved. Every nerve in my body burned with a delicious euphoria that sex alone could never give me, a pleasure so deep it went beyond pure physicality.

And then suddenly, he stopped.

“A thousand,” he said, still on top of me, panting.

“What?” I asked, confused.

He got off of me. He stood to the side of the bed, staring at me. His eyes didn’t seem quite so warm anymore. He put on his jeans and his T-shirt. He left.

I never saw him again.

An hour later, I received an email from him.

*My dear, what I am about to tell you will be difficult for you to process. You are now under a curse, and in order to remove the curse, you must pass it along to another individual. This can be done by inflicting physical pain on the individual a total of 1000 separate instances.*

*Keep in mind, finding the means to do so (legally) may not be easy. It is quite difficult to successfully physically hurt a single person such a large number of times.*

*I found several other women willing to indulge in various pain fetishes on Craigslist, but none were able to last the length I needed them to. Until you.*

*Prior to Craigslist, I pondered various methods to pass on the curse, but they all involved risks of abuse or murder charges. (You may think it cold of me to consider murder, but soon, you will see what this condition drives you to do). Incarceration was, unfortunately, not an option for me, as I have a wife and children. I could only consider methods involving given consent, which, as you can imagine, greatly limits one’s options.*

*However, given your current solitary circumstances, and rather pathetic lack of obligations, you may find yourself more willing to participate in riskier endeavors.*

*I’ve always enjoyed aspects of BDSM. My wife, who is a true lady and above such smut, declined to participate in my sexual needs. My urges grew so great I was forced to resort to prostitutes. This arrangement went smoothly until one particular incident, in which a prostitute came to the belief I had roughed her up a bit too much. After binding my wrists under the farce of a bondage session, she proceeded to hit me in a succession of a thousand times. She then explained to me I was cursed, and in order to remove the curse, I would need to repeat her actions toward another person, who would then take on the curse themselves.*

*It baffles my mind why someone under the impression  they had experienced abuse at my hands would want me to go and start smacking around others, but that’s the fucked up minds of women for you.*

*Of course, as a male, finding someone to tie up and hit a thousand times would have much more disastrous consequences. Perhaps, as a girl, you will have an easier time finding ways to go about this mission.*

*I am explaining this all to you so you do not come attempt to find me. It is unfortunate that you were beginning to fall in love with me, but trust me that playing detective and knocking on my door will not bode well for you. As we both know, I did nothing illegal or non-consensual.*

*Happy hunting.*

That night, the apartment felt darker and colder than ever. I stared at the ceiling. I didn’t believe in curses. But something in me was afraid to fall asleep.

After tossing and turning, I finally drifted off. And then I awoke in my bed to a figure, a demon. A child’s body with a witch’s glistening, gruesome face inches away from mine. She sat on top of my chest, choking me, claws digging into my neck. The pain was so great I wanted to pass out, but couldn’t. My entire body was on fire, but I couldn’t move or scream.

That was when they started—the nightmares, if you could call them that. But I knew they were real. No matter where I was—on the kitchen floor, in a hotel, in a different country—she followed me. No matter how little I slept, the experience always felt like hours—hours of terror, hours of raw unadulterated pain, inching along in minute-by-minute increments.

She infiltrated my days, as well. I would see her,  looking at me from a window across the street, or in the reflection of a blank television screen. Always smiling. It was a constant reminder of what was to come. After a while, living in constant dread and fear of the future bleaches away the ability to experience the present.

I blamed myself—my greed, my idiocy, my whorishness. I deserved it. And not only because of what I did with Mark, but because I had craved pain. My twisted desires were being given to me, in tenfold. For so long, I couldn’t bear the thought of passing along this torture to another. It seemed inhumane. I was above Mark. Wasn’t I?

I look at myself in the mirror. Skin and bones. I’ve contemplated suicide. I’ve contemplated many things, for the past five years. I’ve never wanted to harm another person. But I’ve also never wanted to be a hero.

I put on my lowest cut top. I take a photo of myself. I pick up my phone and stare blankly at the wall.  Since my encounter with Mark, the personals section of Craigslist has shut down. But there are other ways now.

I download Tinder. And then I type.

*S&amp;M friendly girl looking for some casual fun.*

Within minutes, I have dozens of messages. I open up the first one. I type out a response. My finger hovers over the send button. I close my eyes. I’m afraid to. I’m afraid not to."

I'm not a CS major, but a CS \*minor\* graduating this May and have started to apply for jobs. I am largely self taught with a few courses under my belt and a brief internship experience with a small local agency. I haven't had much luck with job hunting and have only had a handful of interviews, with just one leading to a paid internship offer (full-stack/but mainly C# related work) but not a ""job"". The hiring manager did say that the internship would \*eventually\* lead to a job. I don't quite know what the pay for the internship would be though. 

I'm also in the process of interviewing with a local company seeking a Wordpress dev but they are offering 20 an hour but are looking for someone with 3 years of experience.  From what I'm gathering, the pay seems to be on the low end, but it also seems to depend on who you ask because some are saying it's an average pay rate for Wordpress. 

Ideally (assuming I don't get any other interviews/job offers in the meantime) I would like to take the internship AND the Wordpress job as a part-time, remote job for extra cash. But this would create a pretty heavy workload and I'm unsure of how much time this would leave me to keep learning - is this a reasonable expectation?  I ask because in my head it sounds like a good idea, but I'd like to know from the perspective of someone who actually might work 60-80 hours a week or knows what it's like. 

 I feel like I sound a little like a choosing beggar because I say I need money, but I'm feeling conflicted because quite a few of my peers are telling me that that 20/hr is pretty insulting for what they are asking for. Is it a waste of time if I don't intend to stay? Should I pass and keep looking? I just wanna know that I'm making the best use of my time and not rushing into things because of desperation. 

Finances are pretty tight. I can hold off for a bit to find the right opportunity (if it comes!), but will absolutely need a job by graduation (loans, parents kicking me off car insurance, paying rent, etc.). So I'm freaking out a little because of the number of job apps I've sent out vs the interviews/offers I've gotten. I know it can take quite some time before I get a job, but really it's a difficult gamble. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if I'm all over the place. I'm mainly conflicted because while I do need money now, I do want to hold out for better opportunities. 

&amp;#x200B;

\[TLDR;\]

Applying for lots of jobs, getting very few, lowball offers. Kinda tight on money, but can wait a teeny bit longer in hopes of better jobs, but am scared this won't happen. Have 2 less than ideal offers, with one possibly remote/flexible hours.  If I take either/both of the jobs I don't intend to stay long term as the compensation, culture, and work are not in line with what I'm looking for. Do I take the jobs just in case or keep looking while I ""improve"" my skills in my free time?

&amp;#x200B;

Relevant info: My stack is JavaScript and Python. I've also dabbled here and there during a previous internship, hence my application to a Wordpress related job. 
Edit: Whoops, I’m in Atlanta. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus Q: Anywhere other than Indeed, Zip recruiter, Glassdoor that I can be using to apply for dev positions?"

I was fired and replaced with contractors (the whole company downsized a lot, only 1 desktop person was kept and most of the other staff either quit before they were fired or were let go and replaced by contractors). I was ""told"" I was being let go because they were unhappy with my performance, but that would imply they had ever let me know I needed to improve something and I might be doing some things wrong...which they didn't do. 

I liked the job, it's the kind of thing I would like to do again, not necessarily long term, but as a stepping stone. However, I'm running out of money. I've been looking for jobs to apply but I'm either underqualified or there's something that stops me from being able to apply. One I'm trying to apply for now requires 3 work references, however I don't know 3 people from a work environment that I could use as a reference and it won't even let me submit the resume without it. I can get a co-worker from the previous job most likely via linkedin/facebook, but the vast majority of the people I worked with I worked for a short time with or I can't find them to even try to contact them. The frustrating thing is I have a sort of IN with this job via a family member and other than the references, I'm definitely qualified enough based on their listed requirements. 

Any suggestions on getting work references? It specifically mentions references from a work/professional environment. I have several non-professional references I could use, but I feel like it would look poor if I put them in and they got called because they're not the type of people to lie and say I did work with them lol. Would I be better off getting some other retail-type job just to have something else to put on the resume.

Because of that, I didn’t take any programming classes my first semester and I’m now taking CS 101 which teaches super basics of java. Ever since I realized I wanted to major in CS I started looking for internships for this summer. I knew I’d honestly have to be very lucky to get an internship having only 3 credits of CS coursework by the summer but I tried anyway. 

I applied to at least 200 or 300 internships and I ended up getting a lot of interviews and phone screens (which I am assuming is due to my academic success) but all of them came out dry. I applied to different types of internships like data analysis or IT or even digital marketing. I honestly just wanted professional experience that could be remotely related to tech. 

Earlier this week I ended up getting my first offer! It’s from a local company (like 20-30 employees), my title would be a SWE Intern, and the pay is $20 an hour which exceeded my expectations! The one downside to this, however, is that it is a remote internship with weekly in-person meetings. It’s not that the company doesn’t have an office, it’s just that I’d need security clearance to work from their office as a lot of their work is government contracting. I’m worried about not being able to learn much from the experience with it being remote, especially since I barely have any experience related to the work I’ll be doing. Should I be concerned about this? I would consider myself pretty good at picking up things quickly.

In addition to interning, the first half of the summer I plan on reading/studying the entirety of Cracking the Coding Interview and the second half of the summer I will be taking classes at CC from 6-9 everyday to catch up with the CS coursework so being remote it would be much easier to have a flexible schedule around my schoolwork.

I set a goal for myself to end up at a Big N by the time I graduate so I honestly want any advice on if I should accept this internship or if there are other ways I can utilize my summer to reach my goal. Any feedback is appreciated!

TL;DR: I barely have any experience but I somehow managed to get an offer as a SWE intern from a local company with good pay, but it’s a remote position (w/ weekly in-person meetings) so I’m afraid I won’t learn much from the experience. Looking for advice on whether I should accept or do something else over the summer; goal is to end up at Big N!"

&amp;#x200B;

Graduating college soon (May) with a Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems. I have about 3-4 years of help desk/support experience through various internships. My resume is below to get an idea:

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://imgur.com/a/0cZMiey](https://imgur.com/a/0cZMiey) 

&amp;#x200B;

In my area I am living, there are some big Software companies that are rapidly growing. They offer great benefits, awesome office culture (tech startup vibe), tuition and certification reimbursement, and in general seems like an amazing place to work with great reviews. I have about 3 of these companies that are similar in my area and have already landed 2 phone interviews with 2 of them. These companies seem like a great starting place to get my foot in the door, work my butt off, and get promoted.

&amp;#x200B;

My question and concern is many of these companies either have roles that don't relate to my experience so I had to apply for their ""Associate Support Role"" which is of entry level and lower pay. With my experience and degree I was hoping to land a decent paying job... but after discovering these software companies and the amount of benefits and how great the company is (they promote company growth on their website) I think I would almost rather start off with a smaller salary with a possibly better career outlook. 

&amp;#x200B;

My idea was to try and find a Junior Business Analyst role or something along the lines of more ""business"" IT to get out of Help Desk after college. I honestly am burnt out on help desk but actually wouldn't mind doing support for an innovating software that's well known. That's why I kind of had a last minute career path change after seeing all these software companies booming in my area.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I am just kind of confused on what I should do to say the least. I'd like to get in contact with someone to help guide me in the right direction and give me some insight. If anyone has been in Software support or worked for a software company - any insight would greatly be appreciated.

I do video editing and graphic design to make money and used a desktop for this until it recently broke. I use Premiere, After Effects, Illustrator and Photoshop mostly. My current laptop can handle word processing and light web browsing and that's about it. My thinking is to upgrade to a laptop that can do both these jobs: powerful enough to comfortably edit video (sometimes 4k) and tackle creative work but with the battery and form factor to pack to lectures and get work done in the library without lugging a charger. Ideally it should look fairly plain since I don't want to draw attention to it (particularly since I might end bringing it to an internship). I already have an external monitor and keyboard, so the display is not a major concern. My budget is flexible because I'm open to something affordable as long as it gets the job done. SD slot a definite bonus and SSD basically required. Gaming not a consideration.

Currently considering: Gigabyte Aero 15x, Surface Book 2, MSI GP63 / PS63 / GS65, Razer Blade 15. Open to something less expensive!

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
£800-£1600

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
Good battery life is fairly important.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
Not so important, but overall size is.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**
Windows or Mac.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
15'' or smaller.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
 Yes! Premiere, After Effects, Illustrator &amp; Photoshop mostly. 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
Not really a consideration.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
A good warranty and decent customer service is a bonus if buying first-hand. Need an HDMI port and ideally an SD card reader. Keyboard and display are relatively unimportant, since when I'm doing creative work I'll be using an external monitor and keyboard, and when I'm away from my desk I'll just be writing. A touchscreen pen as in the Surface Book 2 could be really cool for graphic design.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 I'm interested to know people's thoughts on buying second hand or refurbished laptops? Is this considered worth it, or too much of a gamble?

Thanks very much in advance."

I have a 4.0 GPA (which may become 3.97 when I graduate), amd will have completed courses such as calculus 3, differential equations, and physics with calc 2. I have been tutoring at my college since I was 17 (I am still in HS). Additionally, I am on a very esteemed academic team (the top 0.02% of the state), hundreds of community service hours, and completed a leadership program.
 
The only problem is .... I just started learning coding in August. I had one class, intro computer science (C++). I did great in it and loved it but it was one, singular, introductory class. I learned some HTML on my own and through college resources.

This summer I intend to study my butt off so that I can get more up to speed in things. I have all of my college's course materials for the web design and java classes, so I will be studying those on my own. I was also hoping for an internship where I could learn things on the job -- I would learn more, it'd look good on my resume, and I could perhaps make something. But most of the postings (using Indeed for now) I see they want you to know C#/Java. Or Linux. Or R. Or APIs. All things I practically know nothing about. I would kill to learn them, though, and I think I would be good at programming given my aptitude for math. But right now I am starting from almost the bottom (and some C++/HTML).

The current semester ends on April 25th, and graduation is May 2nd I think. The Fall semester doesn't start until like August 25th. I am transferring to a private school near me and majoring in math and computer science for my BS. This summer I may also take a discrete mathematics course for six weeks. But even with that, I basically have four months free to work/learn.

To begin with, I was not very high on this job but I just wanted to have something coming out of college. It's been a month now and the job search has been extremely brutal and got me feelin a bit down LOL.

So that brings me to computer science and programming. With the job search been so bad (I've been trying to get back into Marketing but my resume is really geared towards hospitality work and I took no marketing internships in college bc I was dumb) I thought to myself, why not try to learn something new, make myself more marketable. Now I've always been interested in computer science and programming. But the one thing that barred me from pursuing the major in college was that I am pretty bad at math. At my school, one of the requisites was Calc 2 I believe and had a tough time with Calc 1.

That being said I have absolutely no experience when it comes to computer science. I've always been the tech-y one in my family, having built my own desktop and worked a lot with CAD softwares and always the one they come to when they were having wifi issues, etc. There was this one HTML class I took in high school LOL.

So at my uni, it is required that each student in the Engineering department complete at least three co-ops or internships in order to graduate. I have already completed one rotation thus far during the last summer and really enjoyed it, but ultimately, I felt the company I was with was not paying enough for the work I was doing. So, I thought I should attempt to find another company to do a rotation with. Once I was back in school again, I  applied like crazy to many of companies over the course of the Fall and attended the engineering career fair with little to no luck. I did the same thing again in the Spring, minus going to the career fair. Instead, I focused my efforts into exclusively applying online to companies; I applied to about 25 - 30 different companies. I heard back from a lot more companies in the Spring luckily, which did make me happy. By early March, I had interviews/started the process with 3 companies, and out of those three, I was given and accepted an offer with one of them recently getting to do server/system administration work. 

Now that I've accepted an offer with this company, I slowly have seen more companies reach out to me. I've had 4 more companies reach out about interviewing/beginning their process with them. I had so much trouble last summer trying to find my first rotation, so having this happen was a bit of a shock to me. 

One company of these 4 has been extremely persistent about interviewing even though I explained to the HR representative that I already have obtained an opportunity for this summer. My general experience with the HR rep of the company has been just kinda awkward. For example, I asked her when the rotation would be, and she completely ignored the question and just replied with how co-op is different in comparison to an internship and can be done ""as long as I'm in school"", which I already knew. She also didn't give me any actual information concerning the co-op and just was extremely persistent about scheduling an in person interview and wouldn't really take no for an answer, which was really odd to me as every other company I spoke with had 2-3 phone interviews before getting to an interview in person. Their hiring manager apparently will be out of town the day we did schedule for, so she's been emailing and calling nonstop (at least once or twice a day) about it. I would be more apt to want to interview with the company, but I literally know nothing about the position's specifics, such as start date/rotation period, pay rate, what the company offers to their co-ops, etc. Plus, she's kinda made the company seem unorganized, and I feel like they're scrambling to find someone to fill the position.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: A HR rep from a company has given me essentially no details concerning their co-op position, and I don't know what I should ask her about the position to get a better idea of what it would entail?"

Getting my masters would be great at some point, but what are my options straight out of the gate with just the BA and certification in CS.

I like working with children (infant to 5 year olds mostly), and would like to do research with them one day. I have experience with applying testing in research labs for a total of two school years, and was a computer science intern for a year coding for back end development.  In the lab I worked with children one-on-one to complete cognitive science tests, and coded their answers for the professors research. In the CS job, I was coding using visual studios in C# and was trusted enough to get verifications past normal intern status.

bc42dl,1,2019-04-11,Why is the software field just so much larger and easier to get into than other IT?,retrovim,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bc42dl/why_is_the_software_field_just_so_much_larger_and/,"Maybe it's just my area/country in EU. But for every sysadmin/networking/devops/QA position there's 10(not exaggerating) of software development, mostly web development. Looking into entry level positions the ratio is even more off. Software positions seem to be much friendlier towards complete noobs with either a degree or a decent github. These classic IT positions seem to give much more weight towards word of mouth(hiring interns through familiarity with professors, familiarity through networking at events etc.) too. In general just a much harder subset of fields to get into compared to software. 

&amp;#x200B;

While the paychecks might even out at senior levels, it seems that a junior webdev(fullstack or backend) is going to be making as much as many mid-level QA engineers and devops dudes, the others don't show up on job sites/boards enough for me to be able to compare. This doesn't make sense to me because my country doesn't provide a very wide array of technical schools, so it doesn't really produce many students with much QA/Networking/Devops/Linux knowledge and barely any certs. This should mean they'd be sought after right?

Is there a reason for this or is my area just cursed?"

Since I can remember figuring out the concept, really, at least since I was like 10-11. Part of that is because I am trans and I didn't deal with my dysphoria well, and didn't know anyone else could feel the way i felt. Part of that is also because I'm autistic and wasn't diagnosed for a long time so I just thought something was ""terminally wrong with me"" and that just because I was some kind of defective human being that I would never be able to relate to anyone or have friends. I have been through an abusive relationship for like 3 years, emotionally physically verbally financially and spiritually abusive, and honestly I'm too tired to bother writing about the details. I have PTSD.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm too tired to write much about, like what shitty experiences I have had prior to that too, but they weren't as bad anyway. I don't think it's relevant enough. Anyway, on to my current situation. after I got out of that relationship i naively felt like i had a new lease on life for a while. I got A's in all of my college classes, I was in an advanced creative writing group, and I was doing work in a couple of psychology labs. I graduated with a double major, though not a great GPA, as that abusive relationship happened when i was in college. i had this choice between continuing with my labs, or taking this internship with a prestigious forensic psychiatry guy because a family friend knew him. I took the internship because I thought having his letter of rec would be a good idea. oh and by then I got into a good relationship with a girl i had had a crush on for a while, and we were living together for a while.  


so, my performance in that job has basically steadily declined. i rarely even get half of the hours in that i am suppsoed to (I'm talking averaging between 70-90 hours a month when i should be close to 160 of course.), i can;t ever meet a single deadline basically, especially ones I set for myself, I cant complete a satisfactory amount of work let alone complete it fast enough, and the only reason this guy hasn't fired me yet is because of the whole family friend thing as far as i can tell. I have basically been racking up like, two years' worth of performance that warrants a bad review. I keep trying to turn it aorund because if I do then I know he'll be willing to write a good leter for me, but i jsut cant seem to do it. on sunday he gave me another assignment and long story short I didn;t have it done when i was suppsoed to (surprise.), which was by wednesday morning, so he just called me and said like, to send him what i have bc he's taking me off that project sicne i couldn't do it. I have to drive in this friday (i work remotely; and i had to drive in anyway) and I'm sure that this time he's going to fire me, and even if he's not, I'm almost compeltely out of any time or chance to redeem myself and turn this around.  


also, i destroyed the relationship i had with my girlfriend. we had a lot of communication difficulties, but mine were way more destructive.  I often would try to bring up something that bothered me and I thought she was ignoring me or just not very receptive to what i was saying, and I felt really frustrated, and eventually like I just started yelling during arguments, I think because I didn't know what else to do, and probably also because of my PTSD. obviously that was a problem. the fucked up thing is that i could never manage to just fucking full stop, never yell, for some reason. I just I'm a total failure who can;t control my own behavior. Anyway she kicked me out recently because of this and hasn't talked to me for a week. I think she will eventually have to still just because I coudn't get all of my stuff out of her apartment in one load, but like i'm sure it will only be to break up with me and for me to get my stuff back.  before wednesday, when i failed that job thing, i had been reading this book nonviolent communication and i was hoping that would be able to help me like, at least learn how to communicate better and how to not yell when i don't want to yell, to control my yelling, and possibly that it could help me reconcile with my girlfriend even though I know that's unlikely. it was a book i had talked about with her before (she didn't really seem to aknowledge anything when i mentioned it) and wanted to read it already, and i was alrady going to have a chance to that week because i had a break from work until sunday, but she kicked me the hell out before i could even bring the book up again or start reading it. i had come back form a weekend trip to oakland on tuesday night and I barely even had a real conversation with her at all befroe she threw me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't see a point anymore. I'm not going to be able to accomplish even the smallest of my goals.  I couldn't even get myself to just shut the fuck up and stop yelling. why should i believe i can do anything else?  So yeah, I don't really know what's left for me. I have been drafting a suicide letter to people in my activist group because they're the only people left who will care that I'm dead, and especially because they'll have to find someone to take on the responsibilities that I was going to take on.   I'm thinking once I finish it and send it out, I'm going to drive somewhere, park and maybe toss the key out of the car, and down a bottle (at least a pint bottle of 90% or above) isopropyl alcohol, probably with all of the rest of the psych meds I have (about a month and a half?'s worth of wellburtrin and remeron, thats all i got. guess i could throw in advil?) and just wait."

One is a prop trading shop in Chicago which pays okay (90k, 13k Bonus, 5k Joining) and the other is Wayfair ( 105K, 11K bonus, 7.5K joining) (Labs Program as of now). I have had interviews with other places in the trading industry, even from the best, think Jane Street, TowerResearch Capital, DRW, Citadel, HRT...(reached onsites for all, except HRT)  but fucked up in small parts in all of them because of which I have been really tough on myself and still couldn't get through it (Idk, my interviewing skill might be a big-big problem). My main focus as far as languages go are C++ an Python and I would love to build a  career in the trading/finance side. The offer from Chicago is for  Junior Developer, and one other concern is that they are putting in a non-compete for a year. From what I have seen in my job search, I do not get calls from tech companies a lot (I got just 2) and now if I sign a non-compete, I will be stuck. But I do not think Wayfair is so much better as well because I have heard terrible things about it ([Wayfair review](https://www.teamblind.com/article/Technical-incompetence-at-Wayfair----is-there-anything-worse-43wn8iLT)) and I do NOT want to build a career in web development as of now (I dont know which team I will get because I am in the labs program rn). I am thinking something like taking the Wayfair offer and then applying to these trading companies again, but I am not sure if they will want to interview me again (partly because I will have graduated and I dont know if I could apply to new graduate applications then and also because then my internship will be the only experience I have with C++). This is making it really hard for me to make a decision and I try to blame myself for making those small mistakes in all the interviews. I genuinely do not know what to do here. Can anybody workin in trading or someone who works in the tech side with C++ give me a way out or give some advice on what can be done in this scenario? The thing is, I do not care so much about money, but I do have bills to pay and a HUGE debt that I need to clear fast, which makes a decision not that easy for me.

I am on the verge of graduating, and I am considering my options for  my graduate employment. 

Just a bit of background:

* Spent one year as an intern at a major CPG (Unilever/P&amp;G) working on personal care products
* Did a second internship, still in personal care products, at a major consumer electronics manufacturer

The second  company has offered me to return as a graduate in fall, and I had a great time working there as an intern. However, recently an opportunity at a VC backed early stage personal care startup has come up, and I am not considering my  options. I would be employee 10-20, better location and competitive pay + 0.5-1% equity.

I feel like I could be a really good fit for the startup, and the employees are very well qualified. I would be trusted with more responsibility than the other company, which I thought could be beneficial to my career. However, I would be missing out on having a strong recognisable household name on my CV, and I am not sure if this can impact my future job opportunities.

What would you all do?"

As a person who graduated recently with an Associates of Applied Science degree in Software Development and had an internship as well as finished my first contract job a few months ago, I am looking for some advice. My parents are usually the people I go to in times like this, but I'm afraid they do not have a good idea of what I actually do past the fact that I work on a computer.



I have been out of work for a few months now and I have been getting interviews here and there but no offers. Unfortunately, I think this may be a side effect of me not having a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. So I am feeling some pressure to go back to a university to get that degree. This would take me probably 3 years to accomplish because I didn't get a traditional AA, I got an AAS degree and most of my earned credits probably won't transfer. I have no problem with going back to school outside of the fact I would have to pay more money to finish. 


It's not all doom and gloom though, I have been offered a job recently. However, it is a network administrator/IT support roll with a little of software development on the side. Obviously the people in this thread would know the difference here between what I went to school for and what this job requires. However, this job pays 45 grand a year in a rural area and I don't know a lot about network admin. My earning power would be a lot lower over time and I am not even sure I'll like doing that type of work. Don't worry, the company knows that I have a lot to learn before I am truly contributing to certain rolls in their company. 


So this is where you guys come in. I was hoping I could get some feedback from people who work in the computer science fields who know the differences between network admin/desktop support and software development. Most of the people in my life think I should take the job instead of going back to school and I'm afraid they just think it's another ""computer guy"" job. Sorry for the long wall of text, and thanks for your time."

First off, I'm currently a first year at a community college. I'm majoring in Psychology currently but was thinking about switching to Business. I've currently only completed mostly general education courses so I'll be clear to swap if I want to. But I have a lot of concerns about both majors so I'm hoping y'all can give me some advice or insight!

The reason I started pursuing psychology is because I like the counseling aspect of it. I'm not sure if I want to become like an actual clinical psychologist because I am more interested in therapy and career counseling. I'm lost and I hope someday I'll be able to help others who are also lost. I also understand mental health issues very well and I love helping people. The reserves I have about this major is that I'm not sure how many years total it will take me to get to the career I want. I'm also nervous about finding job opportunities in such a specific area of study. I don't feel like I'm up to studying in school for a doctoral or PH.D but I also don't know if I need those to be a certified career counselor or therapist. If I could obtain a master's degree and work in these fields that would be my ideal scenario because I honestly cannot continue school for financial reasons. 

Now the reason I've been thinking about switching to a business major is because of job prospects. Business degrees can basically fit into any line of work, and I know for sure I'll be able to intern or work a while at an insurance company that someone I know owns. However, business is not exactly my passion. It is stable though. The problem I found with business is that a lot of students get their bachelor's and go off to work, but employers don't really find business majors as respectable. I'm worried that even with the degree and experience, I will be overlooked because I'm a business major. My end goal with a business degree would just be getting a bachelor's and then going into work so I won't be spending so much time and money in school. 

I've also considered dual or double majoring but I'm not sure if I can handle it/if it would be cost effective for me. My community colleges offers certificates in business and associates in business and psychology. So I'm thinking if having a few certificates or associates would help me in the long run with getting jobs. (Money is not an issue at community college because we have a program for first and second year students) Would getting certificates and associates help at all with this? 

On the other hand, would majoring in one subject and minoring in the other benefit me at all? Is it that much different from dual or double majoring? And I don't even know which subject I would major/minor in. I

I'm just freaking out and I'm honestly so lost because there are pros and cons to both majors. I like helping others and counseling but it is hard for me to continue school financially. On the other hand, I'm just not that business oriented, just thinking about my future. Human Resources (HR) would be the end goal with my business degree. I feel like I could help people in both industries, psychology directly and business indirectly. But really I need all the help I can get. I feel like there is no shortage of anxiety because I'm afraid to mess up my future. I'll be applying to colleges starting in October/November for early admission and I'd be grateful for any and all help you guys can give me. Thanks in advance."

I’ve been fortunate enough to get into both of these schools but am still racking my head into whether UW or UCSB should be the school I go to this fall. I recently went to both campuses last week and ended up loving both of them for different reasons! 

UCSB has really fantastic weather and it’s right next to the beach making it one of the most beautiful campuses I’ve been to so far, not to mention the multitude of bike paths it has wrapping in and out of campus. UW on the other hand is amazing due to how it’s a 10 minute drive from Seattle, making it much better for networking and professional opportunities than UCSB, its transportation system with the free shuttles and light rail for students is something that’s a huge plus as well!

However, after searching around for other posts on what people thought of other schools, some cons for both schools have popped up.

1. Do the capacity-constrained majors for UW (I’m going for econ specifically \*48% admit rate with 3.5 avg GPA) affect how students interact with each other drastically? I’ve heard some posts talking about how some UW students are very withdrawn and highly competitive due to the limited amounts of space in each major.
2. How bad is the “party school” reputation of UCSB? I’m not a party-goer myself, but I’m afraid that I might miss out or struggle on meeting new people without going to parties.
3. How are professional opportunities at UCSB? I’ve also heard many stories about how UCSB students can’t afford to live in Santa Barbara after graduating from UCSB and having to move elsewhere. Additionally, from my initial visit, it feels as if UCSB doesn’t have as many large companies in the vicinity as UW, which might make it harder to score interviews and internships there
4. Am I missing out on experiencing new things and staying in a “bubble” if I head to UCSB? I know its professors are world-class, but would I be progressing more as a person if I head off to UW? (I know it’s up to me to meet new people and seek out new things, but would it be any different/better at another state?) 
5. I’ve been trying to look into what makes each respective econ program from both schools so good, but I can’t seem to find anything browsing through their econ department websites. Is there some hidden source I’m not looking at for this info?

The project is for a metallurgic factory, and they want to find relationships between the data and the production errors, but they are unable to provide labeled data. For that reason, I just figured out that I should design a set of experiments to detect possible sets of outliers, and the compare the different variables between the outliers and non outliers. 

For the record, I'm using the [PyOD](https://pyod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyod.models.html#module-pyod.models.abod) library, so I'm not implementing the outlier detection algorithms myself. 

The thing is, now I have a set of possible anomalies and I don't know how to tell which variables I should compare? I thought of applying Kolmogorov-Smirnov test or T-test for difference of means, then analyze the variables that have a p-value lesser than 0.5. Is this approach correct or am I wrong somewhere in the process? Thanks in advance."

bce637,0,2019-04-12,TIFU First Programming Interview,ai_research_purposes,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/bce637/tifu_first_programming_interview/,"So I have been intermittently learning programming for the past few years. Roughly 2-3 months ago I finally decided I wanted to do a Masters in Machine Learning and Deep Learning and since then I have been studying ML, DL and programming in general religiously, some weeks up to 100 hours between online courses, reading and personal projects (which I begin and haven't been able to finish).

Today, I had my 1st interview for an internship. I personally didn't feel like I met their criteria since they were looking for students from CS and I'm from Mechanical Engineering but I guess they saw something they liked in my resume or just randomly decided to give me a try. It went out pretty well considering my lack of actual ""results"" or fully fledged out projects that show I know ML, asides from the ""homeworks"" done in those Coursera courses.

The funny part was the programming part of the interview. They ask me which languages I'm comfortable with and I reply Python and MATLAB. Then they asked me to implement a function in Python which takes two inputs and calculates the power of the 1st one to the order of the 2nd one. Without hesitating I write:

    def pow(x, y):
          return x^y

And the interviewer tells me: not like that. And I'm like: what's wrong? Oh right, Python uses ** notation for power: `return x**y`. And I excuse myself as used to MATLAB since it's the one I used more often in the past. Then they're like: implement it as if you don't have the power operator and that's when I realized they wanted me to implement the power operator itself and I just begin laughing like crazy. I did something like this:


    def pow(x, y)

         if y == 0:
              x = 1

         if x == 0 and y != 0:
              x = 0

         x0 = x

         for i in range(y - 1):
              x *= x0

    return x

And then they ask me how can I make a program run faster? I tell them I don't know anything about data structures and algorithms if that's what they're expecting me to reply and instead  unconsciously took the ""if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"" approach and replied with the methods they use in DL by saying that we could either change the language to something faster such as C or C++, vectorize the implementation, use parallelization or use GPUs for computation lol. I still dunno if that's what they were expecting me to answer or not but I have been laughing about it for the whole day based on how ridiculous it sounds if what they were expecting was a data structures/algorithms reply. Overall, I would say it was a pretty good experience and learned a lot from it so wanted to share it with you guys."

One thing I have noticed is that NASA uses a ton of Apple, and while I have my certs...I am more familiar with a Windows environment. I can surely repair and fix any laptop that they throw at me....I just don't want to flub up if they solely focus on apple products and focus their interview questions on the best commands to run to fix things....I am currently attempting to learn as much as I can in this week before the next step...but I feel as though it will not be enough.

My Google-Fu is pretty great, but I am not sure if that will cause them to turn me away if I attempt to troubleshoot using google during the interview tests.

I am very confident in hardware repairs and field service stuff, so if I got the job I'd definitely feel at home. Like, as long as I have something to work with in terms of knowledge I can do it ..I just know HR will most likely view my nervous flubs in the interview as something that they do not want.

I'm freaking out a tad bit....I already have a good job paying enough to cover rent...and I can last a year on savings if I don't get the job and get fired from my current one....It's just all this kinda depends on what they do in the interview.

Anyone have any suggestions for something I can try to do to appear more useful and desirable as a candidate? I apologize for my ramblings."

This isn't a case where I think my company is screwing us over but they're questions I need to have legally supported answers to if I'm ever asked to do something I suspect is outside of my employee classification.

1. If non-exempt employee can't be the manager for more than 2 people (I think) are they allowed to hire their replacements or coworkers? 
- and if the department uses unpaid interns, who manages them?

2. Non-exempt employees can't work 7 consecutive days without overtime on the 7th day. But is there anything about how hours/time off should be distributed for the six days in a row? I worked retail and remember we couldn't start a second shift inside of 24 hours of our first shift start without overtime. Maybe I'm thinking of holidays though.

3. At my workplace, we have to work eight hours a day before requesting overtime. Let's say I go to an off-site meeting near the end of the day. Is the time it takes me to get home counted in my hours? Alternatively, is the time it takes me to get back to my car at the office counted? 

4. Are you allowed to move hours around to not get paid overtime? Like, can I go to the dentist on Monday and work 10-5, then work 9-6 on Tuesday to make up the hour.

5. Who is responsible for tracking hours?

6. If the company provides lunch one day at a meeting, does that count as a half hour lunch? 

7. If you were previous ""misclassified"" as exempt, can your responsibilities be reduced to fit you into the non-exempt classification?

And sorry for the potentially rough English. For context, I’m French, living and studying in a city in the North of France.


Basically, my girlfriend of nearly 4 years now is leaving May 3rd for a job she got in Montreal, after doing an internship with that company for three months over the last summer. Her contract is open ended but is basically for minimum of 2 years. She’s over the moon as she fell in love with the city and Canada while there (which I did as well frankly). Her best friend already moved there last October on a work visa to accompany her boyfriend who joined a Doctoral program in Montreal. Another 4 friends are or will be in Montreal starting next September on work visas or for studies. All of these people are also my closest friends, which is not something that happens easily for me, as I have a lot of trouble meeting people for some reason.


The problem is, I applied to get into Psy.D programs in the universities in Montreal to continue and finish my studies to become a Psychologist over there, but I have been refused. My grades in my Psychology degree up until recently are insufficient, in part because I have severe ADHD that went unmedicated until a few months ago. I have added an unnecessarily exhaustive backstory on that in a comment below.


After talking with people (including university staff in Montreal) there seem to be three choices I can make, none of which fill me with joy:


* I can stay in France (or elsewhere in Europe) and spend two years on my Master’s and become a Psychologist in two years, but I have to be okay with not being with basically everyone I care about, the prospect of which has left me severely depressed and anxious the last couple of weeks. Problem is, this year they started a thing called the “numerus clausus”, meaning there are very limited spots for entry in the Masters program in France, to the rate of about 25 spots per 100 students or even worse which means it’s not a guarantee I’ll get in at all.
* I can finish my “Licence” and try and get a work visa (in a lottery, with 500 slots left open for 15000 applicants) to work in the field of Psychology one way or another for a year to boost my chances for a future application in the Psy.Doctorate program, which means I’ll be a Psychologist, in Canada, in 5 years (1 year off + 4 years formation). If I don’t get a visa, I’ll have to work here in France or surrounding countries meaning I won’t be continuing my studies for what I want to do on top of being separated from everyone I care about.
* I can strategically fail my last year of Licence by not presenting one of the exams and apply for a Bachelor’s in Psychology in Montreal, where they’ll give me credit for all the subjects I’ve successfully completed (90% of them basically), allowing me to retake the classes I’ve failed before being on medication for ADHD that are really weighing down my academic record with the objective of applying the year after for the Psy.Doctorate again. Again, that’d mean I would be a psychologist in 5 years, 1 year to finish my bachelor’s and 4 years for the Psy.D. This also means I won’t have a diploma at the end of June which really goes against what I feel I need mentally, after having a very difficult academic career. Also, the prospect of completing my final diploma and starting my career at 31 just fills me with anxiety and reinforces this image of a failure I’ve built of myself. And what if I take this option and still get denied when it comes to the selection for the Psy.D?


Anyway, this is where I’m at right now, I have no idea what to do, I’m stressing out beyond belief there just feels like there is no winning solution. I’ve had a bit of a cry spontaneously a few times over the last couple of weeks, which tells me I’m not doing great.
I desperately need some guidance, what should I do? What is reasonable?


Also, if there is any subreddit any of you guys/gals know that would be relevant to my fuckhuge wall of text, I’d greatly appreciate it.

bcknyk,1,2019-04-12,At a crossroads,stanleysteamers,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bcknyk/at_a_crossroads/,"Hello A2C, sorry if this isn't the best subreddit for this. I recently switched tracks from focusing on just art schools and a future in animation to focusing on general schools and video game design (so instead of just art, I would incorporate computer science into that too). It's not because I particularly love programming or even video game design, it's more so because my mom has constantly pressured me to do computer science my whole life and this is the middle ground we agreed on. Because I've previously been focused on art my whole life, I have a lot of portfolio stuff prepped, art-related extracurriculars, and art-related experiences in general. Haven't taken the SAT yet (I know I'm late, I'm taking it in May), will be taking the ACT in summer probably, and my GPA is not stellar (3.6 right now). I'm in a program which basically lets me be in college while still in high school, and so I have basically all my high school credits done and now have a lot of free space to take classes I can transfer to a 4-year institution when I graduate. 

Basically, my major questions are:

* **Should I seriously consider less ""prestigious"" schools despite what my parents want?** There's a lot of very highly ranked schools (like USC) for video game design, but I also want something that isn't so far away and expensive and hard to get into (again, because of my academics). At the moment, some of my reaches include USC, NYU Tisch, and Northeastern (which is where my sister goes). Obviously, I'll still apply to my reaches, but I'd like to face the reality of things which is that I will most likely not be attending them. My parents have super high standards; I'm sure some of you guys can relate. They're the stereotypical Asian parents. My sister got a near perfect SAT score and they still yelled at her for not doing better. She got into Northeastern and they blamed her for not studying enough and not getting into a better school (for reference, she's pre-med). I know that if I chose something like Lake Washington Institute of Technology or DigiPen (two schools I'm looking at because they're super close by) they would be equally disappointed (though they hold me at a lower standard than my sister).  
* **Should I even go down this path?** I know that's a lot to expect someone on the internet to answer for me, but I realize that there are hundreds of more passionate people who started way before me in the pool of admissions that colleges are going to sift through. I have much more passion for designing and making products (I screenprint, sew, draw, make pins, do graphic design, etc.) but my major influence in choosing my career path thus far has been my mom pushing for me to get a good, stable job that makes good money. But that's not what I want in life; I want to spend my days actually *making* things and working around the difficulties because that's just what I like to do. I recognize we can't all do what we'd like though, which is why I originally was going to do animation (because then at least I could do art). Is there a degree that would be a better fit for me, or should I go back to my original plan?
* **What can I best do to prepare myself (academically) for college apps?** Like I mentioned, most of my prep for college thus far has been art-related. I'm an intern at my local art museum, I took classes with a highly-praised artist, I drew and drew and drew and drew (life drawing, paintings, digital art, etc.), and I volunteered a *lot* at the aforementioned museum too. Now, as my SAT is coming, I realize I'm basically screwed on the academics part. I haven't even prepped much for the SAT, to be honest. How do I ""unscrew"" myself?
* **Should I focus on game art or game design/programming?** One thing I've found while looking at game design schools is that many offer only art-based or programming-based programs, and not programs which include both. My strong suit is definitely art, but the programming side would likely be better paying and easier to find jobs in (and it's what my mom wants me to do :| ). 

Thank you if you have read this far, even if you don't have any answers for me. I'm just trying to figure it out as it goes."

bclbgm,1,2019-04-12,Should I leave my job?,Chickfilacio,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bclbgm/should_i_leave_my_job/,"About a week ago I approached my boss and let him know I felt unsafe around another employee. This certain employee has been negatively viewed in our office as he performs poorly, jokes to much and shows up late almost weekly. The boss had even mentioned at one point he was on the verge of firing him but decided to hold off because his performance kind of improved.

At this point I should note that me and this guy go to school together. I even suggested he apply at my work and that's how he got in. We talked at school and been acquainted but I didnt know too much about him until he started working with me. That's when it all went to hell.

Two weeks ago I went to hang out with said employee after work (trying to give him a chance) and it was going pretty good until we got into a really serious talk. He ended up telling me that he murdered someone and that he was an accomplice in a murder.  Not sure why he told me but he never claimed it was a joke and we were far from joking in our conversation.  He let me know I was the only one who knew about it. He also confessed that he scammed our company out of money through expense reports.

This really bothered me. I feel like he put me at risk of being a liability.  I have a family so it makes it more worrisome for me.

So back to the main point...I feel really uneasy and nervous around this guy.  I talked to my boss about it and told him everything this guy told me but nothing has been done.  I hate going in to work and I keep having to help this guy with his projects and it makes me sick.  My boss knows I feel unsafe and he still directs the guy to come to me with questions.

How long should I give my boss before I start considering other options?

I am an intern and graduate soon. I've accepted a job offer with the company that starts in a month so I'd hate to leave after already accepting but I dont know how this should play out.

Any advice would be great."

I’ve been in the industry about four years (plus about 1 year of college internships). I’m in an awkward spot and could use some advice. 

I was thrust into .NET post college without really applying for it. Started with a major company and that was just where they put me. I like C#. It’s been good to me. 

I was desperate to get out of that job after three years for management reasons. I landed a job as a mid level engineer in C# at a smaller company. 

Today, I was brought in for an interview at another big company for a senior engineering role.  It turns out they wanted more of a Java dev than a C# dev. I really loved the company and they loved me for everything except for my language choice.

THE BIG QUESTION TLDR ETC. They are willing to put me in for a mid level java role so I can diversify my resume. They are willing to pay what I asked for comp for a senior role. This tells me I was low balling myself for senior pay. Anyway, would it be stupid to go to a company for a change in pay, but not title, to learn Java? It seems like a win all around, more money, better company on my resume, and new skills? It’s silly to rush to being a senior when I’ve only professionally worked with one language, right?"

* On a 2 year contract making 23/hour ($41 800 annually). Work for a small nonprofit, approx 4 full time staff with lots of interns and turnover every year.  Seriously performing above my level, which my boss has agreed about, and talked about creating a new job title at a higher level than where I currently am.  I was offered a permanent position at $42 000 at the end of March, with benefits, told her I thought I was worth closer to 45-46 000 
* Then my colleague quit (1 out of 3 current full time staff), her position (same employment/seniority level) has been posted at a range of $35-45 000. It's a huge deal to be 1 staff person short, and this has (fairly) caused a lot of stress for my boss
* Today my boss offered me $44 000. I mentioned the newly posted position and she came up to $45 000. She's pressuring me to make a decision/commitment by Sunday 
* I have applied for and gotten interviewed for 2 jobs in the past two weeks, for both I stated my salary expectations at \~$48-60 000 
* I told her I want to understand what a permanent position looks like given that I'm currently on contract (ie. what's the career progression path/how is it different from the contract position) and wouldn't commit without understanding what that might be, having a path set out detailing how I essentially become a manager
* She told me that she already had my pay increased to $44 000 for the new fiscal year (without me agreeing to anything), and that she would have to recut my paycheque if we didn't reach an agreement today... but gave me the cheque at the end of the day anyway 
* She essentially implied that if I wasn't interested in the permanent position I would just work out the rest of my contract as is (at $23/h, goes until Oct 2020), even though the contract explicitly states salary to be reviewed at end of fiscal year (ie. get 45 if you agree today or no increase at all) 
* Oh, also, I was offered benefits but haven't seen a package stating what they are yet. Today she told me she hasn't even gotten quotes yet. Who knows when the benefits will actually kick in. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions: 

* If I deposit the cheque am I tacitly agreeing to $44 000? What are the risks of depositing it? 
* Any advice on how to hold out until I least know if I get other offers? So far I haven't told her about the other jobs as she values loyalty very highly and I don't want to cause more stress if I don't end up even getting any other offers. But it'll likely be end of next week before I know if I go to the next round of interviews 
* How strongly should I be counting benefits in this scenario (I already have good coverage for dental through the reserves, though I do want to release in the next year or so, my only medical expenses are glasses and the odd prescription, so it doesn't save me much...)

I feel like I have a lot of power here because she definitely doesn't want to lose me, especially now that my colleague is leaving. But I also don't want to damage a fairly good working relationship by being too stubborn or unreasonable, but I also feel like she's really putting undue pressure on me. Also, from negotiating contracts with her, I know that she goes for the absolute lowest she can get away with, and I'm worried the same thing is happening to me. My other colleague negotiated her salary when she started and said that she felt she had earned respect from our boss by being a tough negotiator.  I don't think it's unfair to ask for more time to consider what a permanent position means and get a good idea from her of what a career path looks like within the organization. She really seems to very suddenly be worried about me jumping ship, when I've never given any indication of that in the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Worked my way up from $42 000 to $45 000, but think I might be leaving money on the table. Pay increased to $44 000 without my knowledge - any risk in depositing that money being perceived as agreement of a new contract? What's the value of a permanent vs. contract position?"

I have been absolutely losing my mind  and it has been making me feel guilty. 

Long story short. I am a college student and have been interning at company X since last summer. I performed so well that I was offered to stay for the fall and spring as a part time intern while I go to school. I enjoy working at this company and the environment is great. 

I attended a career fair and I was talking to company Y that was super interested in me. I was invited for a phone interview and I got the job. The new internship sounded like an amazing opportunity that also paid more then my current position so I accepted it.

Now I feel guilty that I am back stabbing company X :( 
I don’t want to burn any bridges with company X so I am not sure how to tell them I don’t want to intern during the summer. I was thinking about making up a story that I’m going to Europe but I’m not sure if that would be the best thing to do especially when I like to live my life with integrity.

From a career perspective I'm not doing terrible I've had a couple internships and I do have job offers from Fortune 500 companies, but I don't want to be an engineer. The whole reason I did it was because of my parents (Asian). To be honest the technical stuff isn't my strong suit. What I seem to be good at is communicating my ideas and speaking well. In fact I suspect the reason I have my job offers is because I interview well, not above average technical aptitude.

As an arts student, I know that my degree is worth less than a plate of hot cheetos, so I've been working part time as a Research Assistant in a neurolinguistics lab, and joined extra-curriculars that would either teach me job-worthy skills and/or surround me with a good network, including:

\- data collection and processing for a neurotech design team (using python, EEGs, and git)

\- editorial lead/marketing for an AI club (writing and editing medium blogs, creating promotional material (social media, sponsorship package), and working within a dynamic team setting)

\- data analysis and report writing for an on-campus counselling service (SPSS, report writing)

\- UX research and design for a start up (mostly literature review, but also designing components of a UI)

... all on top of a full course load. I also teach myself how to code (currently learning Java), and I go to hackathons to practise my skills. I'm exhausted, but I make it through because I tell myself this will all be worth it when I land my first internship.

resume for reference: [https://imgur.com/a/Gw6xIZg](https://imgur.com/a/Gw6xIZg)

I've been applying to internships since October/November 2018, but to no avail. Originally intent on UX Research, I switched gears after realising it was too niche of a field + industry's preference for graduate level interns, and started applying to jobs in public policy, communications, and marketing. Other than one interview, which didn't go great, I didn't receive anything other than generic rejections/the usual ghosting, so I started to ramp up the pace at which I was learning how to programme, and started applying to software developer internships. I had an interview for a software position almost a month ago, but I'm pretty sure I didn't get the position and I haven't heard back from anything else I've applied to since then.

I've seen a career advisor several times, but its a waste of my time - I never get anything beyond the ""sorry, I really don't know what you've been doing wrong. Please don't give up."" I always add a note to my LinkedIn connection requests to recruiters, and while they accept my connection request, I never get responded to. My faculty doesn't have a career fair and apart from tutoring/camp counselling jobs on my uinversity's job posting site, there is nothing. I can't apply for government jobs because I'm not a Canadian citizen. My school doesn't have co-op, and I can't do Fall/Winter internships on a student visa. I don't want to go home for the summer knowing that opportunities there are even harder to come across, and that I'll be living with my parents for four months.

I feel like complete shit. Almost everyone I know has something lined up for the summer. On the other hand, all I've known is rejection, but that's not even the worst thing. The worst part is just getting ghosted after working my ass off, only to know that I'm still not good enough for anyone. I've compromised study hours and my mental health for this crap, but I'm no better than where I was this time last year and hiring season is over.

I \*really\* don't want to spend my summer at the lab again. I'm so tired of ""preparing stimuli"" for 12 months. I don't even know what I'm expecting from this post, but I really needed to vent. Finals start next week and I need to start studying, but I also really need an internship because this is my last summer before graduation. If I can't even land an internship, landing an actual job will be h e l l.

Just a little bit of background, I am a transfer student here at Berkeley who got in with Nuclear Engineering. Thought I would like it out of community college and I was ecstatic when I got in. However, I slowly began to dislike my major, not a slight on the department, but its just not my thing. I did poorly my first semester (1.9 in 3 techs), and am having a fairly decent rebound semester so far (I think I might be able to get an A in all of my techs). I have been taking CS61B and EE16A this semester along with my other nuclear classes, and I just love the material I am learning in those classes. I have never really been confident in anything before, but taking those classes really ignited a real passion in me for this kind of stuff, and I have been trying to participate more in anything EECS. Multiple hackathons, and an internship to get myself started, but I am still in the nuclear department, so it makes it harder for me to take more EECS classes. I would love nothing more than to make an attempt to switch, but they are generally pretty stingy about letting transfers do any sort of switching, and EECS is highly competitive. I know its difficult, but I just need something to work with, and I will try to meet any attempt that lets me switch. I am pretty unhappy generally taking my nucE classes, and I dont really know if I could take 3-4 more semesters of this stuff, which is only worsened by the fact that I could be taking these cool EECS classes. My counselor is obviously (and understandably) very distant about this idea, and I'm feeling a little desperation at this point because I found something for the first time that I really enjoy and like, but I'm not really able to pursue it. So yea, if anyone has any experience similar, and/or could point me in the right direction (with something i should try or maybe someone who i can talk to about this stuff).

I'm 17 now, and going through my exams, so if there's any time to turn back and pick a different route, it has to be now.

It's not that I have no hobby's, it's just that they're FUN but not 'this is what I want to do with the rest of my life, this is what I'm an expert on'-fun.

First I wanted to be an artist. Then I wanted to be a writer. Then I kept switching between those until I wanted to be a musician. Then a teacher told me in my face that I would never be successfull at any of these things. Then I needed to pick something that would be at least 'somewhat realistic', and so, I decided to become a programmer. Had tons of fun at first, but now I'm like 'meh' and not looking forward to doing it. I'm an intern in a computer store kinda thing, and it's meh. It was fun at first but now it started to suck. I'm afraid it'll be that way with everything. Fun at first but when you need to do it in a routine, every day, for the rest of your fucking life... I wanna turn back but don't think I'll find a better road...

Even right now I'm frustrated. I need to study for my exams but since I have no goal I don't have the motivation. Like, why would I even start if I'm never gonna be able to become anything??? And every second I waste is more than I can take

NONE of my hobby's make me think 'yes. that's what i want to do for 8 hours a day for the rest of my life.' I can't commit.

All my friends, everyone around me knows what they want. They're all an expert in one thing. They're all studying and getting jobs in the thing they want to do. I feel so useless, so lifeless, I have no thing, they're all programmers, film makers, chefs, and I am no one. It's like I don't belong in this society because I can't pick. It's upsetting me so much but I've vented about it to everyone to the point where they're annoyed at me."

**Anyways what skills or things would you net/sys admins recommend I study and brush up on for this second go around?** I kinda want to impress him with what I know and have learnt or improved upon.. 


I’ll be doing a paid internship with a semi local/regional company again this summer once I finish HS. Last summer I had the opportunity to apply for it through my school and luckily got it! It was a great experience and that’s where I’m headed back to this year!!


Some background:

• I was there for 8 weeks full-time last summer. Worked on various things like: documentation, zabbix setup, on boarding new employees with their PCs and software, a new office 365 share point site, active directory upgrades, new DNS/DHCP server, and some other stuff like that.


The company has 140-200 employees I believe and then just one network/system admin guy. There is a help desk and engineering team, but they specifically provide support for clients and solutions in that area. The company also owns a small MSP and one of the people over there helps out some occasionally, but the guy I’ll be working under runs the IT show for the company as whole really..


Some background on the infrastructure there:


* Vastly windows server
* o365 share point site
* o365 (azure active directory bridge wasn’t implemented though, not sure if it is now yet or not)
* 2+ Microsoft SQL Servers
* All users are on windows 10
* CentOS 7 Server running a zabbix dashboard
* Most servers are virtualized with VMware, but it’s due for a *major* licensing upgrade if he hasn’t done it already
* Cisco/Meraki APs and routers
* Giant ProCurve core switch
* A few hyper-v servers for internal applications
* There are a bunch of branch offices as well (6-8) and those are setup with a site to site vpn, active directory trusts, etc.."

I had been frustrated for a really long time and had almost lost all hope for finding an Internship. The only offer I has was for a company paying me 20$/hour based out of my college. With student loans and all the pressures that come with it, I was borderline depressed, okay perhaps not depressed, but still very very upset. 

But all of this changed in just a matter of 8 days! From applying to having  3 interviews scheduled last week , I gave it my all, cracked all 3!  (All 40$ upwards)  
I have accepted an offer with a company paying around $58/hr in the east coast.   
Perhaps I got lucky, but the point is guys hang in there!  Don't lose hope, apply like crazy, there is still time to get that internship ! 

Best Of Luck! I hope to hear from you guys when you get that internship!

PS- The only reason I mention the pay is because I want you guys to know there are still some really good companies hiring!"

I'm a PhD Candidate and I am working in my ""dream"" industry. Except that this industry has turned into a nightmare and I am slowly suffocating. I cry from anxiety every weekend because I feel like I screwed up my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

I accepted my dream job in August of last year. I realize that no job is going to be perfect and you are always going to have people that you do not get along with at work, but this has been a slap in the face. I worked for this company as a contractor for 7 months, left due to health reasons. I was only working part time and paying for insurance out of pocket which just got me into overwhelming debt, making matters worse. I took another more flexible position and was able to get health insurance through my studies which helped my situation. I received a text message from my boss around this time last year that they were direct hiring people. After months of waiting, I finally received an official offer and was ready to start.

&amp;#x200B;

Needless to say, the environment has turned really toxic and horrible. Sure, there were problems before, but my day-today job tasking consists of forwarding powerpoint slides or sending emails. Very mundane, intern level tasking. I realize I am still new, but they flew me to an important meeting in Washington D.C. and made me order lunch and coffee, put together binders, and generally tasks you would expect an intern to do. I have tried talking to both of my managers and my higher ups, but nothing has changed. I'm going on 8 months in this role and things are hell.

&amp;#x200B;

I am realizing that I really do not like doing work in defense contracting, but all my experience up to this point has been in defense contracting. All of my internships, formal job experience, academic projects, etc. I don't know what to do now because I hope to graduate in a year with my PhD and I am a mess. I feel worse off than when I started. My real passion is my dissertation, but I'm not sure it's feasible to turn that into a stable job. I honestly feel stuck and trapped and have no idea how to change myself or my life at this point. I wish I could just quit, but I don't have enough saved for that. I live paycheck to paycheck because of debt. I'm working on climbing out of the debt hole, but it's a slow process. How do I change industries when I'm so far in?"
bcuo6r,4,2019-04-13,"First week of internship done, here is what I learnt.",ontheblockz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bcuo6r/first_week_of_internship_done_here_is_what_i/,"Hey, thought this would be useful for any people going into their first internship/first office job. A lot of it is common sense but when you're in such an unfamiliar surrounding you tend to forget basic things like that haha. Please feel free to add any of your tips....

1. Figure out what you want to gain from the internship: obviously experience and money are the two main things, but I'm talking more specifically. Is there a specific software that you'd love to learn that you know your co workers have a good knowledge of and could help you learn? Do you want to know if the industry you're in is good for you? Do you want to work in a more specific area or try a bit of everything? (obviously this is out of your control, but I've found companies are cool with you doing different things if you express an interest in it). 
2. Stay away from office politics/drama: trust me, its very very easy to get roped into. And I'm not just talking about in the office specifically, but also there were times when co workers would talk to a client on the phone, and then badmouth them for whatever reason. Just keep quiet. 
3. Be wary of your interactions with coworkers: Be careful with what you say in person and in email. Better to be safe than sorry. You're in a completely new environment, you're not friends with anyone yet. I was surprised how open people are with each other, and are very brutally honestly as well, but you're new and haven't established those kind of connections yet.
4. Ask a lot of questions (within reason) and take a lot of notes. Some people at the company you're at have been working there for years if not decades. I've found people love talking about themselves and their roles, and they understand you're new and that you are not clear on everything (esp if its your first internship and even if its not, companies that fall into the same type of industry never operate the same).
5. Keep a detailed account of what you did each day and what you learnt: This is SO helpful! When it comes to updating your CV or talking about that internship in future interviews, you'll have such a clear idea of what you did the whole time. It'll be harder to remember when a few months down the road you're applying for new things and you forget the specific things you've worked on. I'm extremely forgetful so this is a must for me. If you're too lazy to do this, at least make a list of the 'highlights'; did you get to work on a cool project etc...
6. Always take on extra opportunities: go to lunches with coworkers, events in the evenings. You never know what may come from them, and even if you don't have the chance to network,  it'll still be a fun opportunity. Take everything offered to you if you can..
7. ALWAYS ask what the deadlines are:  So so so obvious, but I forgot to ask the deadline of a report I was working on and it backfired on me. Obviously most things they want done as soon as possible, but sometimes you're multi-tasking or other things come in the way of that. 
8. Talk to the other interns!! I was the only intern in my department, but there were some others in different departments on the same floor. They are in the same position as you and I realised that the scariest thing was just saying Hi, usually you can get the conversation going for a while. I realised that people around you can make or break a job. Even if you have no trouble with anyone, not having anyone to talk to can be extremely boring and can affect you badly in the long run.

These are from my own personal experience and I realise people might not agree with everything I've said on here."

Am I negotiating too much?,messylou,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bcwidn/canada_how_much_are_benefits_worth_am_i/,"Hi everyone, I saw some really great advice earlier on this sub about someone else's salary negotiation and I hope I might be able to get a bit of advice on my situation as well:

* On a 2 year contract making 23/hour ($41 800 annually, no benefits). Work for a small nonprofit, approx 4 full time staff with lots of interns and turnover every year. Seriously performing above my level, which my boss has agreed about, and talked about creating a new job title at a higher level than where I currently am. I was offered a permanent position at $42 000 at the end of March, with benefits, told her I thought I was worth closer to 45-46 000
* Then my colleague quit (1 out of 3 current full time staff), her position (same employment/seniority level) has been posted at a range of $35-45 000. It's a huge deal to be 1 staff person short, and this has (fairly) caused a lot of stress for my boss
* On Friday my boss offered me $44 000. I mentioned the newly posted position and she came up to $45 000. She's pressuring me to make a decision/commitment by Sunday
* I have applied for and gotten interviewed for 2 jobs in the past two weeks, for both I stated my salary expectations at \~$48-60 000
* I told her I want to understand what a permanent position looks like given that I'm currently on contract (ie. what's the career progression path/how is it different from the contract position) and wouldn't commit without understanding what that might be, having a path set out detailing how I essentially become a manager
* She told me that she already had my pay increased to $44 000 for the new fiscal year (without me agreeing to anything), and that she would have to recut my paycheque if we didn't reach an agreement that day... but gave me the cheque at the end of the day anyway
* She essentially implied that if I wasn't interested in the permanent position I would just work out the rest of my contract as is (at $23/h, goes until Oct 2020), even though the contract explicitly states salary to be reviewed at end of fiscal year (ie. get 45 if you agree today or no increase at all)
* Oh, also, I was offered benefits but haven't seen a package stating what they are yet. Friday she told me she hasn't even gotten quotes yet. Who knows when the benefits will actually kick in.

Questions:

* If I deposit the cheque am I tacitly agreeing to $44 000? What are the risks of depositing it?
* Any advice on how to hold out until I least know if I get other offers? So far I haven't told her about the other jobs as she values loyalty very highly and I don't want to cause more stress if I don't end up even getting any other offers. But it'll likely be end of next week before I know if I go to the next round of interviews
* How strongly should I be counting benefits in this scenario (I already have good coverage for dental through the reserves, though I do want to release in the next year or so, my only medical expenses are glasses and the odd prescription, so it doesn't save me much...)

I feel like I have a lot of power here because she definitely doesn't want to lose me, especially now that my colleague is leaving. But I also don't want to damage a fairly good working relationship by being too stubborn or unreasonable, but I also feel like she's really putting undue pressure on me. Also, from negotiating contracts with her, I know that she goes for the absolute lowest she can get away with, and I'm worried the same thing is happening to me. My other colleague (more senior) negotiated her salary when she started and said that she felt she had earned respect from our boss by being a tough negotiator. I don't think it's unfair to ask for more time to consider what a permanent position means and get a good idea from her of what a career path looks like within the organization. She really seems to very suddenly be worried about me jumping ship, when I've never given any indication of that in the past.

TL;DR: Worked my way up from $42 000 to $45 000, but think I might be leaving money on the table. Pay increased to $44 000 without my knowledge - any risk in depositing that money being perceived as agreement of a new contract? What's the value of benefits and a permanent vs. contract position?"
bcwihl,8,2019-04-13,"Got a complex career problem to solve, my reputation doesn't match up well with my experience. How do I catch up on it?",SameBusiness,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bcwihl/got_a_complex_career_problem_to_solve_my/,"I heard that you guys can solve advanced career problems, having the skills to get hired into the top tech companies and such, so here's an advanced problem for you.

I can't stay long enough in one job to be considered a ""known quantity"" that can be recalled upon to vouch for a better job. To make matters worse, I usually lose/finish my current job before getting an offer for the next so it's like my bargaining position is reset every time. Mostly I get contract jobs, but I never get jobs through recommendations. I don't prefer contract jobs but I take them anyways because It's harder for me to get offers for full-time jobs out here in the Midwest. It's terrible.

It's always been some sort of blind job application, and I'm tired of the rat race.  A lot of the problem would be due to the fact that I've only taken shorter-term contract jobs, all at very small companies.

Here's an summary of my work history as a programmer:

* Worked as SWE over the span of 11 years, but not continuously
* 5 of those are contractor jobs (only 2 of which are 30-40 hrs/week)
* One short full-time job and one part-time job (those two were 8 and 10 years ago respectively)
* Never collected benefits, nor put money towards retirement
* 2 to 15 months unemployed in between jobs

Out of all these jobs, I made the best connections from the 2nd job, and current job. But they usually don't know anyone that is hiring when I contact them, nor do they really contact me first about work.

So here I am at a standstill on how to build up my reputation after so much time spent not building it. I can see myself with two options:

* Return to college and complete a CS degree as a BS or MS. Use the resources in college to network with people. Talk to professors, join career-oriented clubs, go to job fairs, hackathons and take internships, convert to full-time.

* Harder route: Apply to larger companies for full-time roles, and interview prep. I don't know of any good reliable sources for reading your interview approach. I'm talking to local developers through a Slack channel to see if anyone has time to mock interview, but opening up time is hard.

I am open to other options besides these two. Let me know what I should do to build that network effectively, and lay out a game plan for me to get hired at a company in a Medium COL city because I don't need the competition from the West Coast eating me alive. And also to get better leads to jobs without cold applying so I don't have to be in the rat race forever."

I was hired into a part-time position from my internship, and when I was officially hired, they cut me down an hour a day (going from 25 hours a week to 20) but doubled my responsibilities. Essentially, I was doing the work of two full-time employees in 4 hours a day for minimum wage.

I struggled to keep up with all of that, especially because I get thrown clerical tasks and am expected to drop everything to take care of these. I eventually got a hang of things, but last week, my boss came to me and told me that I'm taking on another person's position too.

Hey guys, new person to reddit here. 
Im having a bit of trouble with my boss and not sure how to go about it. So any advice or help would be really appreciated!
I started this new job about a month ago, its my first real job and it's in the gaming industry. I spent 3 years in college to learn the skills needed usually for the bigger companies, but have been hired by a small company (like 10 people) that uses Illustrator and After Effects (programs i had 0 knowledge in prior) Thought it would be ideal since its located in a small town and would be nicer to settle down in rather than the big cities. 

I practised the programs as much as I could before I started but had to move house twice (once because of the people I was living with were moving and then the second move to the town that the work was located in)  all within a 3 week time span. Now my new boss was at first empathetic with me when I first started. But that only lasted the first week. Ive had to learn a new art style and program best I can, I even practised on weekends to help combat the program issue. 

The problem is with inconsistency on my boss side. Like she gave me examples of work that had trees flipped with the shading literally flipped so I thought flipping the trees so the shading was uneven in a scene didnt matter. Apparently it did for me. She literally just give me a word to base a character outfit on, lets say something like a baseball player. But when its not to her standard she just tuts, rolls their eyes at me and sighs. Like Im messing up on purpose. Shes told me off for being too slow and wasting company time to get it right, but told me off also for rushing because it creates more work for her. I dont know which they want at this point. My boss is also foreign so I dont think the slight language barrier helps much.  Ive also had no training prior. She literally just gave me work and basically left me to it, no going through the art guide or anything like that. Most of the stuff I've learnt has been by myself.

I suppose what doesnt help is im too scared to ask her for things because she just snaps at me for asking to repeat herself or ask her for more information. She acts like im dumb for asking these things.

What made me finally snap was that she usually corrects my work slightly when its done. But because I simply misheard her and asked her to rephrase something yesterday, she got annoyed and gave me back all the files I was working on and said ""You can do all the corrections yourself. Im busy with my own work and I cant keep doing it for you"" ( but theyre totally fine with helping the interns out with the same issue though) and then proceeded to give me the most like passive aggressive tone, like saying things like ""dont be lazy and flip this image please."" I didnt just flip the image and there were a lot of sentences with please at the end which they doesnt usually do.

 Shes also accused me of stealing art images when I didnt because she found something similar online to something I had made. I want to confront her, but I'm timid about confrontation and she gets rather snappy when that happens. Im worried I'll say something stupid that'll fuck me over or she'll lose her temper at me. (Any tips on keeping composure when confronting people would also help) she also dont talk to anyone else like this so I cant tell if she's just using me as a punching bag for their stress or its a personal kind of hatred. Maybe both. I feel like I should go to the head of the company but I dont know if that'll make things worse because I didnt go to them first. 

Sorry this is kind of long. Ive left out some other issues Ive had to keep the main points that bug me the most. Any advice would be good! Thank you.

Tldr: My boss is being impatient with me about work when I didnt get proper training and she doesnt treat anyone else like she does me. Want to be confrontational but worried I'll say something I dont mean to them or if I should go to the boss and complain there. Any tips on keeping composure would be great too"

Other than putting away laundry and getting groceries (and eating), that's all that was accomplished. I planned to work out at 4pm and put it off until it was midnight and the gym was closed. I've had a lot of bad days where it seems like I can't get anything done, and it's been even worse since I've worked all day on Friday and Saturday too. I'm really hoping to take some time for myself tomorrow, because my focus is going to get worse and worse if I don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Compounding this is stuff going on in my life as well. I got a dream internship that I never thought I'd get but now I have to worry about rent, finding a job there, and a million other things while staying on top of my classes. And I finally decided to break off ties with a girl I've loved for years, since she never felt the way I felt for her and wasn't going anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

... you know, I was writing this to rant about how useless I feel, but after writing it down, with all the shit going on, is getting three emails sent really that bad? Honestly I feel kinda proud, like damn, it would be hard for a normal person to focus going through all this, and here I am, not curled up in a ball but trying his hardest, staying up until 1am on a Friday night not partying or drinking, but writing an essay. Spending Saturday not hungover or high, but writing important emails for my college newspaper, internship and rent. \*And\* I got, made, and ate food!

&amp;#x200B;

If you think you've been useless, try writing what you've done down. It might not be all you've wanted to get accomplished. It may not be to the level of your neurotypical friends. But you're probably not as useless as you think you are.

I have a bachelor's in a related field as well.

I have heard every possible answer on what to do and those are -

1. Do my job in the startup while doing a college course equivalent to BS from distance education or online
2. Do online courses for a few months and apply to bigger companies
3. Pursue a college course full time

I also feel that the college course that I would be doing is not really that great after looking at the syllabus. It is mostly basics of programming in Java, C, C++ and Python. And I have worked in these languages before in personal projects/internships and I studied them in my Bachelor's as well.

bd44xr,3,2019-04-14,Raise I received for promotion was surprisingly low; how do I bring this back up and negotiate? How do I know what is a reasonable amount to negotiate for?,sailboatsairplanes,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/bd44xr/raise_i_received_for_promotion_was_surprisingly/,"Texas 

I just had my 3-year anniversary at a boutique lifestyle PR agency (~40 employees) in Texas. I started as an account executive (mid-level) and was just promoted to a brand new position, account supervisor (AS). I had another promotion a little under 2 years ago to Senior Account Executive. The account supervisor position was created as another stepping stone to the next position, account director, which fully leads a team on their own.

​

My boss told me I was going to receive a promotion last week during my annual review, and I was excited. HR and our CEO still haven't finalized the job description, but the new role would entail what I am currently doing but taking on more client work and new business meetings. I am the guinea pig for this position as it has not existed before, but I am the best candidate for it as I was one of the most senior account executives, and I lead several accounts completely on my own, which is different from how must other account executives function at our firm. As an AS, I would still be under by boss and on her team. They let me know they are also going to hire my intern to be my account coordinator, which was not originally in the plans.

​

Of course I was excited to hear I received a promotion, but this week my boss called me into her office again to tell me my new salary. I received a 3% pay bump and my salary is now at $60k. I was so thrown off by this low amount, I basically just said OK and left. Now that I've had time to process this, I am planning to speak to her about this again and negotiate my salary. I have never done this before and am looking for guidance on how to go about this and also what a reasonable amount is to ask for? I would look at the market average, however it depends greatly on size of the firm and location, so I don't know what an accurate pay for an AS is. 

​

I have a suspicion as to why my promotion salary is so low. A few months ago, my boss, without me having asked, offered to give me a pay raise because of my work leading accounts on my own without her supervision. At the time my salary was $50k and I received a 10% bump to $55k. In March of this year, our office across the board receives annual Cost of Living raises, which is 3-6%. Minimum amount is 3% for COL, and beyond that up to 6% is based on merit. I received the full 6%, bringing me to 58.3k. My hunch is that since I received 2 raises within the last few months, they intentionally gave me a low promotional raise to balance this out. I have several coworkers that have mentioned this having happened to them too. 

​

I have never asked for a raise or negotiated a salary and I feel I am at the point in my career where it's time I start speaking up and advocating for myself more, so I am hoping to get guidance on how to bring this up on Monday with my boss. A couple of things are making me hesitate on bringing this up; 1. I just received 10% + 6% raise in the last few months, although this promotional raise should be completely separate from the two instances. 2. We are unexpectedly hiring another coordinator to be on our team, which calls for another (though entry-level salary), however my boss told us we would be taking on more work/more clients as a team to offset that we are now a team of 5 people. Most teams at my firm are only 3 people, unless led by the CEO or a VP, which my boss is.

​

It's also a bit of a slap in the face as we have been receiving lots of new business and work, which means plenty of revenue. It's not that I am unhappy with the amount I am making, although who doesn't want to be paid more, but I am unhappy with this practice. If they are factoring my recent COL raise into my promotional raise, I'd like my boss to be upfront with me about this and admit to it. I was always fairly happy with how I was treated, especially when I was offered a raise without having asked, so I was very thrown off about this. I am clearly a value to my firm -- I lead several accounts on my own, all of which are clients I have had since I started at this agency and they all renew their contracts every time it's up, which speaks to our close relationships."

As a result of my issues, I failed two classes and am basically damned when it comes to transferring. Do I give it another semester and hope that the change of enviornment does something? (going from a shitty, mean, vindictive living learning community on Livi I got placed in ON ACCIDENT to Cook) I hate being blunt, but i'm going to do it regardless. People say Rutgers is filled with the most genuine people. I've had about 12 ""acquaintance"" experiences, aka had several conversations with the same person. I hate judging. I really hate being general. It’s so hard not to be. Each one of these people have been a haughty, holier-than-thou, arrogant, ""I came from the best hs in Jersey,” “that class is easy” and ""I had an internship at 18 I did this I did that me me me me me"" type attitude. Maybe it’s just my environment? People RAVE about the friends they met here. No one I've (spoken to) was even slightly funny, caring, or down to earth. Everyone I've spoken (note: “spoken to”, not the whole school) to is either smart but entitled or seem boring and only interested in drinks. There are 50k+ people here, and when I look out amongst my peers in public places I see everyone fits easy into a sort of box. Greeks here, engineers here. we all dress the same. My life here feels colorless. The ethnic diversity would be awesome If I saw one group actually share table space with another. The ethnic enclaving is like nothing I've ever seen. My high school was vast majority non-white and everyone had a blast with each other. Its unbelievable.  I have officially lost the ability to communicate with other people. I've gained 40 lbs and have to convince myself daily why killing myself is not an option. 

Most shockingly, the cliquey-ness is INSANE here. I'm starting to think that's worse at BIG schools, not small ones.

My situation might be a  little weird by itself, but I hope I can read some ""real life"" insight  here that can help me decide what path I can choose.

First  a little backgroud: I graduated in 2016 in the Netherlands as a  pharmacist, but became a high school teacher instead. During my masters,  I did internships in the community pharmacy and the hospital. I still  remember (sometimes a bit vaguely) what work was like, what  responsibilities etc. a pharmacists in those settings have. I went into  teaching because it seemed more fulfilling at the time. Fast forward to  today, I feel pretty much underappreciated, unchallenged, overstressed  and underpaid. I kind of have a talent for teaching and public speaking,  kids love me, but high school is not my thing. Teaching pharmacy at uni  is something that has crossed my mind for the future, but right now I  feel like I should focus on building a better career instead. Bills suck  and one day I'd love to have a house/kids/car, you know!

2  weeks ago, a friend told me I had 2 years left to register myself as a  pharmacist (government forces that here) and work a minimum of 2080  hours in a pharmacy related field, in order to keep my title  ""pharmacist"". This usually is retail, hospital, industry etc. Otherwise,  I'd lose the title and have to take a test from the depths of hell, in  order to prove I still have a suitable skillset. No thanks.

So  it's time I went back to being a pharmacist and save my title. ""Well  okay, do it then"" you may think, but I'm a little lost. The reason that  deciding is tough for me is mainly because I'm scared to screw it up.  Retail pharmacy (not saturated here) has more jobs here, but I have  forgotten so much about pharmacotherapy and vigilance, I'm afraid I will  totally fail my job (make horrible mistakes and kill someone is the  biggest, but being incompetent and slowing up everyone and everything is  a second).. Surely time would make it easier to get used to it and I  have my books/internet to read, but still, this is a serious fear I'm  struggling with atm. I'm looking for an easier ""pharmacy"" related job  that can help me get into the field slowly but surely, and although I'm  not sure of this, industry pharmacy seems like an option...?

I'm  curious about the industrial pharmacy setting. I honestly have no idea  what to expect other than the descriptions I found while searching in  Google for different jobs within this field (""qualified person"" and  ""regulatory affairs""). But I need some insight of what to expect. Who  can help me form a good image of this field?

Might help to add:

\- I'm very organised, good with computers.

\- I want to have future career options for Australia (if I decide to  migrate one day to live with my BF, though I know that market is  saturated AF T\_T)

\- Good public speaker (being a teacher surely helped a lot), but hesitant about managing ph technicians. I can be shy.

\- I'd like a good income for once, of course for reasonable amount of work/stress.

Please tell me what this field really looks like. Thanks!

If you're considering a bootcamp, and it's partnered with a university, check if it's hosted by Trilogy before enrolling. If it is, stay away.

Hi all,

Just wanted to write a quick cautionary post for anyone considering bootcamps as a potential route for getting into the data science field.

I’m a recent graduate with an MS in applied math in December looking for positions as a data analyst / scientist. Unfortunately, I wasn't having much luck getting responses. I didn't have any previous internships, as my original plan was to get a PhD, and only ended up getting the MS due to major problems with the school that cropped up halfway through my third semester (a whole other story, though). I had seen a few recommendations for bootcamps on here as a way to break into the field for people with no experience. I noticed that my undergraduate school ""hosted"" one, and figured that it might be a good way to fill in the gap between me graduating and me finally getting a job, and at the very least learn how to implement all of the theory that I had been learning over my degrees. I had some experience in Python from undergrad and from going through some Kaggle tutorials, but figured there had to be something else I was missing since I wasn't getting any responses.

After enrolling and paying (way too much) money, I got to the class and learned pretty quickly that the bootcamp wasn't hosted by the university, but rather some company called Trilogy Education Services. Already I felt uneasy about continuing, but figured since I already paid I should stick with it. As the class continued, however, I quickly realized that I had essentially been swindled.

Enrollment: When I submitted my email / cell number for an ""I'm interested, tell me more"" link, I started to get daily calls from some employee of Trilogy who I thought was working for the university they were partnered with. Looking back, they were definitely trying to bait me into signing up for the class as soon as possible. There was an entrance exam, meant to screen people out, which was an absolute joke and that I wouldn't be surprised if no one actually does get screened. Some of the golden lines were ""we only have one spot left, and there's a few people I'm talking to that are considering it"" and ""I can't tell you which companies we have at the career days, like if I told you it was &lt;massive company with ties to my city&gt; and they weren't there, you'd be disappointed, but if you knew which companies we were partnered with, you'd be excited"" (these exact lines were also told to my classmates, too!). Red flags were going off at this point for me, but I was scared about having a gap on my resume where I wasn't doing anything, so I ended up taking the bait. Once I finally to the class, after paying, I learned that it was Trilogy hosting the class, and not the university.

Curriculum: All over the place. It's obvious that they come from a webdev bootcamp background. So far it's been: 2 weeks of Excel / VBA, 6 weeks of Python (this should be the meat of the course, but everything we covered was so basic that I had already covered it between the single class I had taken and Kaggle tutorials), some relational database stuff (I hadn't even taken a class on this and I knew 90% of the stuff they taught just from spending a week or two on hackerrank SQL questions...), HTML / CSS website building (boiled down to copy and pasting lines of bootstrap code), a few random other topics like nonrelational databases (explained poorly, I still don't know when you'd use a relational vs nonrelational other than when you really want joins), some statistics / hypothesis testing (explained very incorrectly), and web scraping with beautifulsoup / splinter (surprisingly decent, though I knew BS beforehand). Next week we're going into JS, which… why… It feels like everything we're learning is solely for visualizing data, when I signed up for the bootcamp (and expressed to the recruiter person) that I was seeking to become a data scientist. We were told that it was a project based curriculum to help better our portfolio, but none of the projects we've done I'd feel comfortable pinning on my GitHub or listing on my resume.

Support staff: The instructor... is a nice guy, but god awful at teaching. Incredibly basic concepts that even I could talk about would be explained in the most convoluted way possible that would leave everyone confused. Every single time a student asks a question, he fails to understand the meat of what they're asking and starts going off on some long tangent talking about stuff that isn't relevant to what they asked. He also is horrible at keeping pace with the class, and we will very often fall behind to the point where some assignments simply aren't covered or are explained during extra hours that he tacks on before class. Additionally, I feel sometimes like he just doesn’t know what he’s talking about. I remember a specific time that the person sitting next to me asked him a pretty simple question (which should have been answered in the solutions to the assignment we were doing), and the instructor proceeded to go into a 10 minute tangent trying to figure out what to do, before I finally leaned over and answered her question in a sentence. I remember when we were discussing hypothesis testing that the instructor, in one day, attempted to: accept the null hypothesis, accept the alternative hypothesis, thought that a p-value of 0.5 was the usual threshold of significance (he said this multiple times, even after being corrected), and thought that we had a p-value of ~6.38 on one problem because he didn't understand what the e-05 at the end of the number meant (and seemed to still not get it after another student explained scientific notation to him).

~~The TAs don't do anything. We had one good one who stopped participating after a couple months due to schedule overload, and after he left I don't think a TA has talked to me or asked me how I was doing on the assignments more than one or two times since. Other classmates have the same complaints. Instead, all they do is sit in the back and talk loudly to each other while the instructor is attempting to teach.~~ (see edit: I was being too harsh on them. They're doing their best, and honestly are the best part of the class) 

There's a ""student success manager"" in charge of some behind the scenes of the class that also doesn't seem to do anything. We have weekly reviews that are submitted of how we're feeling about the class, and after I finally submitted 10 or so poor - mediocre reviews she emailed me asking what she can do to help, and after giving a response of my grievances I was met with silence. Career services so far has been useless. All we've done halfway through the class is develop a brand statement (elevator speech) and submitted our resume for review (my comments boiled down to put the bootcamp at the top of the resume and take out any academic achievements I had like my published paper, which... why...) or given information documents with stuff that seems blatantly wrong (We were given a document of skill clusters for different jobs, and I may be wrong here, but I don't think Hadoop is the 3rd most important skill a data scientist should have).

Companies Trilogy is *actually* partnered with: The previous session of the bootcamp that was hosted at the same location had their career day during one of our classes, so I got to see what they had to offer. And... it was maybe 10 or so tiny companies / startups I had seen on linkedin during my job hunt, and nothing from large companies that I'd like to have connections at. &lt;massive company with ties to my city&gt; was definitely *not* there. One of my classmates even talked to one of them and their recruiter told him that they weren't even looking for entry-level people, and were there for senior managers, which is just absolutely hilarious.

Overall, the way I feel can be summed up as: I'm paying money for the company to use me as a partial TA. Half the time I'm in the class I'm helping answer questions of my classmates and explain things to them that I understood but went over their heads. I was told by the recruiter that I'd be a good fit and bring a lot to the class, but I didn't realize it would be in the form of free labor for them.

These grievances aren't just how I'm feeling either. I was thinking that I was the one person feeling this way about the class since I came in with an advanced background and thought ""maybe I was just at a level above what this is targeting,"" but after talking to some of my classmates who came in with no background in these topics (so what this bootcamp is targeting), they all feel the exact same way as me, except instead of feeling like they're wasting their time covering what they already know, they're wasting their time having everything explained to them poorly and then will need to go back and actually learn it on their own. Which, if that's the case for everyone, then why are we paying $10k a seat for an instructor and TAs to not be helpful?

If you're considering a bootcamp that's partnered with a university, and they seem to be partnered with a fair few, please check if the bootcamp is associated or hosted by Trilogy in any way. If it is, I would highly recommend against pursuing it. People in my situation (advanced degree, slight knowledge of what goes on in DS but no experience) would be far better off simply tackling some Kaggle problems and learning this on their own. People with absolutely no knowledge of what happens in DS won't develop proper skills here, unless the only thing you wanted to do was build web dashboards, which you could probably find some online resources covering exactly this for free. After spending a few months applying, I'm finally starting to get some responses for jobs, no thanks to this bootcamp. I'm not even sure if I should be listing it on my resume, to be quite frank, because I feel like the projects I've done on my own and my degree go a lot farther.

Hopefully someone in the same position I was in gets something from this post. Thanks for reading.

__

Edit: Looking back I was too harsh on the TAs. I'm probably fixating on a couple of off days that they had, and during class today I noticed they were going around and answering questions a lot more than I used to notice. We also have a newer one who definitely seems to be doing quite well.

I stand by everything else I wrote though."

Currently I am interning at small scale software company. I joined that internship as per my university course work. I will be getting a grade based on that. Actually the internship is of 6 months and I will complete my course work from university side by the end of 5th month. I currently have a job opportunity from the start of 6th month.

Now the problem is how can I quit my internship at the end of 5th month.

In addition I will get a certificate of completion too at the end of fifth month which is need to be submitted in the university to give presentation on my work.

Any suggestions are appreciated.
Thanks in advance."
bd8602,1,2019-04-14,Couple of questions!,csfinalsoon,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/bd8602/couple_of_questions/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to carve up a resume to start applying to jobs, but there are some things I am not sure how to word or if it is even worth putting on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to university for two years, found it was not for me so I switched to college, where I am studying the same thing, but its more practical. I enjoy it but I am currently taking a break after my first year there. I have learned lots and do enjoy what I am taking. I currently have both Uni and College on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering how I would date my time at college. Currently I have ""MM/YYYY - To Be Determined"". I do plan on going back, but probably not for a year or two.

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing is that if it would be worth it to list off the some of the things I have learned while at school, such as programming languages, OOP, frameworks ect. The only proof I have of use or learning these would be through school work, as I currently have no side projects in development. (although I have ideas...)

&amp;#x200B;

The jobs I am applying to are in the realm of tech support, junior developer, and software internships.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

I interned for 8 months with a wonderful company writing computer code for their software, and during that time I was able to see my disability in action.  I didn't finish my project until long after my fellow interns did, and when my mentor asked me about it I was at a loss for how to explain my inattentiveness.  I cried to my hiring manager (despite promising myself I wouldn't) over how inept I felt, and to this day I wonder if my disability is something I should have brought up.  

I wanted to start a discussion here to get advice on how to manage ADHD in a professional environment.  

Here are a few specific questions I have, but I welcome any advice you guys may have:

* Do I tell my employer about my ADHD? If so, how?
* Do I tell my coworkers about my ADHD? If so, how?
* When do I tell them about my ADHD? Do I bring it up during the interview? Do I tell people on my first day? Or do I wait to tell people when I start messing things up?
* Where I live, employment applications have a place to say that you have a mental disability.  Do you check 'yes' or 'no' on forms like these?
* How do you avoid being discriminated against as someone with a disability? (I know employers can't legally discriminate against applicants, but I find it hard to believe it doesn't happen)

Any other insights are welcome and encouraged.  I look forward to hearing about the experiences of others with ADHD."

I'm currently a 18 year old male that's thinking on wanting to move to the UK after considering how my lifestyle doesn't fit the culture of America (especially how we value work and a lavish life) and how I'm going to be happier in the UK. I don't have any relatives living there.

I'm fresh into community college and I'm planning on doing an Bachelor's degree in IT/Computer Science degree. I plan on studying part-time meaning that I won't be out of college until after when I'm 23 years old. However, this might change. I did some research and there is a shortage of workers in those fields in the UK. Additionally, international internships are a bonus too. I also have a very supportive family that will help me, but they don't plan on moving there with me. I also know some people from the UK and one of them might be my partner someday.

Primarily, I'm asking on how to lead up to getting work into the UK and become a citizen especially since I'm fresh out of high-school. I don't have work experience which is why I'm asking about internships. Plus, I did research regarding visas and the amount of paper work that I have to do does make feel scared since the only thing I really done in my life is signing papers for college and financial aid. However, I'm confident that I'll be taught to deal with this kinda of stuff. I want to build-up and prepare at a young age."

First of all, I am a very open-minded person and I really like to see your suggestions and advice. It is about my career and education. Little about my background. I am a community college student with a big heart on a Computer. I started working as an IT- account analyst intern in a local hospital. After 1 year, I switched my position to Associate IT Field Support. Later after 1 year and a half. I become a Senior IT Field Support. After 6 months, I applied for a few different IT position at Big tech company here in SF Silicone Valley. I get an interview with some of the big companies but not all interviews are like walking down the garden (Metaphor) up and down.  After all, I landed the job at Most respectful Linux company in the market as an Associate IT Engineer. As you see, I was so focused on my skills and busting my ass off to get a good job and very natural in my school. I'm very aware of how hard to get a job without proper experience in any field and degree alone is not enough anymore. My question is, Should I still pursue to get a degree or should I just learn those certificate program such as Database, Networking, Linux engineering? I am very appreciated a school and teacher for teaching me how to think and help others however I found some of the skills tough at school are not very useful for me anymore. I want to use my time wisely and more realistically. Some people say Degree will very important down the road and all told by parents and teachers and some ppl. Therefore, I can't clearly decide what should I pursue between school and certificate. I will really appreciate all your answers and looking forward to seeing all your advice.

The past 3-4 years I have done some internships in Help Desk Support types roles. 

After college my goal was to keep climbing the ladder and get out of Help Desk. Recently a classmate of mine started working at a SaaS company doing support and telling me how awesome it was. I began looking for SaaS companies in the area where I’m moving after college, and there are a ton of established SaaS companies that are awesome. 

Most of these companies have awesome benefits, great office culture (Silicon Valley / tech start up), and just overall have great reviews from what I see online. I looked at these companies and most of them have a “Tech Support” or “Customer Support” type roles open. These are entry level roles and based off my experience, I’m almost over qualified for most of them. I even had a phone interview with one and they mentioned my resume was very impressive for this type of position. The position is doing tech support for the application/software. 

I would love to get in with one of these companies and thrive in the culture, but what’s holding me back is the pay. Most of these positions are very entry level salary. I feel if I looked around enough in the Help Desk or maybe junior system admin or junior Business Analyst roles - the pay would be a bit better. 

I guess my question is would it be worth it to start very entry level and try and work my way up with a cool tech company that’s growing and be in an awesome environment... or keep looking around and try and land a typical entry level IT job at a business or bank or office where the starting pay would be a bit better. I’m in South Florida for reference. 

Here’s my resume to reference my experience:

I'm really torn as to where I want to go and I would appreciate any advice! I've recently visited both campuses for UF Days and Bruin Day respectfully and I was very impressed with both events. I'll give some other thoughts that I gathered too.

&amp;#x200B;

UF:

\++ Almost costless for me (because of in-state, Bright Futures scholarship, and FL Prepaid)

\+ Gainesville is no Silicon Valley but it looks like there are some good internship opportunities from locals and tech giants alike (I'm more interested in internships rather than research if I had to choose at the moment).

\+ Big class size and lots of clubs &amp; orgs

\+ Very close to home

\+ Engineering ""Living Learning Community"" dorm in East Hall. It'd be cool to live with fellow nerds I guess  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

\~ I've heard of some issues with the professors, but I've also heard that the situations have improved over the past couple of years

\~ I'd have some friends from high school, but I also kind of wanted to get away from my high school life at the same time

\- I'm sick of the muggy Florida weather, but at least the dorms at UF all have ac

\- There's a lack of promotion of CS (at least in FL Days) it seems like. There was only one short presentation for engineering in general. Contrast this to when I talk about Bruin Day below.

&amp;#x200B;

UCLA:

\++ Silicon Valley/Beach is obviously a great place for getting internships for CS.

\+ Did a phenomenal job of promoting CS at the Engineering Bruin Day. There was a 2 hr presentation and QA session given by both professors and students just for CS and CE! I even got to have lunch with a 4th-year student and an alum that was a former Vice President of SanDisk, both of them offering exceptional advice.

\+ Prestige of UCLA. I'm honored to be able to go to either of these schools, but I know that UCLA is highly regarded when it comes to CS in the workforce.

\+ Big class size and lots of clubs &amp; orgs

\+ Clean slate from high school as I don't know of anyone in my school that's going there.

\+ Campus is gorgeous. I know it doesn't really matter but wow, it would be hard to get depressed with the views and this weather.

\~ There's no ac in some dorms, but the weather is good enough so that you can open a window and be fine.

\-- The out-of-state costs. I won't go into detail, but I'd probably end up being around $100k total in debt. The six-figure starting salaries could make relatively short work of that, but it's enticing to go to a good uni like UF with no debt instead.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR UF is low-cost but UCLA seems to have the better program

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to anyone who responds! If there's anything else I should explain, let me know! :D

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Ordered pros of both schools by importance to me at this moment"

Maybe I just don't think the same way other people do but I never really saw it as anything more than a means to support me in experiencing life as opposed to an integral part of my life, let alone my identity. I can understand wanting to be secure in job and finance but I can't fathom doing it in sacrifice of my day to day fulfillment; constantly chasing the future rather than enjoying the moment has never been something I understood."

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started an engineering internship at a company. I really enjoyed the position until my manager hired a full-time engineer (younger than me) who has a few issues which I assume stem from aspergers.

The hired man is very abrasive, especially when pointing out mistakes and it conflicts with how I would go about meshing  and cooperating with others. He does appear to have an elitist attitude when dealing with others.

On top of that, my desk is being moved right next to his in an open arrangement. He already likes to walk over to my desk multiple times a day and critique what I am working on. I usually have to close all of my tabs and try to maintain a conversation which is painfully difficult and slow/one-sided.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall this is very exhausting as I have a lot to deal with already in daily life. I do sympathize with him, as I do have a few symptoms of ASD myself which I manage, but I don't enjoy having my work constantly critiqued in a non-professional way. It is very exhausting to have your work picked apart without tact when you already deal with a lot in daily life and at school .

&amp;#x200B;

The only way that I feel like I can deal with this issue is to make a fuss about it to my manager, but then I am the one with the problem. I know that I will not enjoy having my desk next to his in the next months. Should I be looking for another position somewhere else?

&amp;#x200B;

I am very confused because my manager is one of the smartest men that I have known for a long time, but yet this hired person appears to be a completely incorrect fit for the department I work in, and now they appear to want to make us (the new hire and I) work together by putting our desks close together.  I feel like I have been lumped in with him which is a little ....insulting honestly.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated. Maybe I am analyzing the situation wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

thanks."

I'm a senior graduating this fall with my BS of Computer Engineering and currently interning at a local Mill as a developer/analyst intern. I started fall 2018 and have been working through school , doing only &lt;20 hours per week.

Due to the women training me seeming like they simply did not care at all about actually training me, and a combination of the company using incredibly old technologies like mainframe, I decided to start looking for another internship before I graduate.

Luckily , I was able to grab one just this past week as a Developer intern at a newer company (albeit smaller) in a city near me that actually uses newer programming languages and technologies.

My question is how do I need to quit? I am still waiting for the background check to clear (should clear in next few days). Do I need to set a meeting with my boss privately and let him know? Do I need to give a 2 weeks notice? I want to stay on good terms with boss obviously.

I was supposed to intern into the summer at this company, and ironically enough, my boss just asked me this last Thursday if I could work in the Fall (essentially extending my internship) , 1 day before I got my new job offer.

I feel bad because my boss was really cool, but staying at a company that just doesn't seem like the best decision. I am also taking a pay cut for this new job I would like to add.

However, the process doesn’t need to be confusing!

By learning about each step and starting early, you can navigate your applications like a pro. This comprehensive guide will go over the ABC’s of how to apply to college, from each requirement to what you can be doing as early as freshman year to start planning.

While technically your application is made up of a few required materials, it’s actually shaped by what you do and accomplish throughout all four years of high school. That’s why we’ll start off this guide with advice for what you can do early on to build a strong foundation.

If you’re already a senior in the midst of college application season, then you can scroll down for more concrete information on application requirements. (This guide, by the way, is primarily focused on applications to four year colleges.)

Let’s begin by considering what you can do in the first few years of high school to prepare for applying to college.

&amp;#x200B;

Plan Early for College

As your teachers may have told you, admissions officers consider all four years of high school when they evaluate your application. They want to know what classes you’ve chosen, grades you’ve received, and extracurriculars you've been involved in. They’re interested to learn about your progress, whether you’ve chosen progressively harder classes, for example, or advanced into a leadership position in a club. By the way, all of students must be able to write an essay or just use [essay writing service](https://expertwriter.net) to get a high mark.

Ultimately, factors like your grade point average (GPA), test scores, and academic and extracurricular achievements determine where you apply. You may apply to a few schools that let in students whose GPA and scores are a little higher than yours, a few that match, and a few that are lower. You’ll research, visit, and apply to schools that you like and where you think you have a good chance of getting in.

Rather than figuring all this out senior year, you can go into high school with a proactive mindset. Be conscious about choosing your course schedule, extracurriculars, and standardized tests. All of these components will help determine what schools make it onto your list and how to apply for college.

Let’s consider each of these pieces individually, in terms of what you’ll acutally submit to schools, why colleges care, and how you can put yourself in the best possible position to apply.

&amp;#x200B;

Choosing Classes

Your colleges are interested in both your grades and which classes you decided to take. This is one of the most important parts of how to apply to college. First, what will you show the admissions committee?

&amp;#x200B;

What Will You Send?

When you apply to college, you’ll have your high school send along your official transcript. Your transcript will show the classes you took and the grades you received. All your grades together make up your GPA, which is an important measure that admissions officers use to compare students’ records.

Colleges also get a report on each high school so they have context for your individual record. They should know what level of classes are on your course list - college prep, honors, AP, for example, along with the general expectations and rigor. They should know if your school adds an extra six points for honors classes, or if its GPA scale is out of 5.0 rather than the usual 4.0.

Colleges will also see your courses, grades, and any AP results from senior year. An acceptance halfway through the year is still contingent on successful completion of all your classes.

&amp;#x200B;

Why Do Colleges Care?

So what are colleges looking for in your high school transcript? First, they want to see evidence of academic achievement and college readiness. They want to make sure you can succeed in your college classes. Especially selective schools are looking for students with outstanding academic records.

Beyond this, admissions officers often appreciate evidence of progress. They want to see that you’re improving over the years and taking on challenges. If you have some choice in electives, they may also be able to learn more about your interests from what you’ve chosen.

Colleges seek academically oriented students with a love of learning who are willing to challenge themselves. Evidence of these qualities in high school bodes well for building a class of students who will succeed in class and ultimately use their education to contribute in positive ways to society.

Considering the importance of your academic record in your college applications, what can you do as a freshman and after to prepare?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What Does This Mean For You?

A lot of your classes in high school, like four years of English and math, may be chosen for you by high school requirements. However, you may have choice in the level of classes, as well as in areas with more options like foreign language and electives.

If you’re someone driven to take all the honors and AP classes you can, then your challenge will be to find ways to balance all your work and find time to honor your interests. Colleges appreciate demonstrated interest in a specific field as much as, if not more, than general well-roundedness.

If you’re starting out in mostly college prep classes, consider adding an honors class or two to your schedule. If you especially like English, then consider taking on the challenge there. If math makes sense to you, see if you can transition into a higher level.

Even if you had a rocky freshman year, you can show admissions officers that you’re making progress over all four years. Treat all classes as important, as they’re all part of your GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, a 3.7 (A-) in honors classes versus a 3.7 in all college prep classes will be more competitive. Rather than playing it safe for an easy A, seek out a challenge in the subject(s) that call to you.

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from your performance in the classroom, admissions officers are also looking to see what you do outside the classroom.

&amp;#x200B;

Extracurricular Involvement

Just like with your classes, grades, and GPA, you’ll send a record of your extracurricular activities. As above, let’s take a look at what you’ll send, why colleges care, and what you can do to prepare.

&amp;#x200B;

What Will You Send?

On your college application, you’ll list out your activities, including clubs, sports, summer camps or classes, and work experience. You’ll typically give a brief description of your role, along with the time commitment and how long you’ve been involved.

Some students also send a resume with their application, which similarly lists and describes your activities and/or work. You’ll tell admissions officers about your extracurriculars throughout all four years of high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Why Do Colleges Care?

Admissions officers are looking to gain a full sense of who you are as a student. If they only relied on grades and test scores, most colleges would have more qualified students than they had spots to offer. Secondly, they could accidentally end up with an entire class of engineers, or writers, or history majors (unlikely, but still a possibility if they don’t get to know each student’s interests and goals beyond her grades).

Not only do they want to find students with diverse experiences and interests, they want to find students who will be active and create a lively, interactive community. If you’re involved in high school, then you’re likely to get involved in college too.

Just as colleges want to find students who are open to taking on academic challenges, they want students who pursue their interests and take action toward their goals. Again, colleges are seeking to educate students who will go on to create value in the world.

Not only does your academic record indicate how you approach your education, but your extracurriculars show how you get involved in your community and the world around you.

&amp;#x200B;

What Does This Mean For You?

Explore! Get involved! But do so in a way that’s authentic to you.

You definitely don’t have to go sign up for every club and team that your school offers. In fact, doing so might just confuse admissions officers. They want to know what you’re interested in, rather than see you participating for the sake of resume building.

Deep involvement is looked at more favorably than occasional participation. If you join a club freshman or sophomore year, then you could benefit both personally and on your college apps from sustaining that involvement and even advancing into a leadership position (or developing greater skill in a more solitary pursuit like painting or writing poetry).

Freshman year and summer is a great time to explore activities. Not only will you be able to explore your interests and discover new ones, but you might meet like-minded peers and gain skills that can help in class and eventually professional environments.

Consider clubs, sports, art, music, community service, volunteer work, travel, internships, part time jobs…and reflect on what led you there and what you’d like to gain from the experience. Ideally, you’ll take time to explore in the beginning of high school and get more deeply involved in later years. Along with your classes and GPA, your extracurricular involvement indicates your interests, commitments, and how you might contribute at college.

The final part of your application that requires months to years of planning is your standardized tests, like the SAT and ACT.

&amp;#x200B;

Plan and Prep for Standardized Tests

Most colleges require the SAT or ACT (and [TOEFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_English_as_a_Foreign_Language) if English isn’t your native language). For the majority of students, doing well on these tests requires a lot of prep and planning. Most take it more than once, even up to three times or more. Let’s consider what colleges want to see, why, and how it affects your college planning.

&amp;#x200B;

What Will You Send?

Most colleges, unless they’re test optional or test flexible, require that you send the SAT or ACT. Some also require one or two SAT Subject Tests. You’ll take the tests, leave at least three weeks to get your scores back, and request official score reports sent from College Board or ACT, Inc.

&amp;#x200B;

Why Do Colleges Care?

The SAT and ACT are standardized tests, meaning that the test and testing conditions are the same for all students who take it (or at least, they’re supposed to be). While these tests can be controversial, their underlying purpose is to compare students’ academic abilities and achievement on an equal footing.

As I mentioned above, colleges have some sense of the differences among high schools and can thereby put your GPA and course selection in context. The SAT and ACT allow them to automatically compare scores on a more level playing field.

You can figure out what score you need by searching the name of your college and average SAT or ACT scores of accepted students. If you already have a dream school in mind, then you can shape your test prep around achieving the target scores you need to be a competitive applicant. What else do these testing requirements mean for you as you go through high school?

&amp;#x200B;

What Does This Mean For You?

Because these are important tests, especially if you’re making up for a low GPA, you should prep early and give yourself enough opportunities to retest and improve your scores. You may start researching colleges early, so you can have a sense of how high a score you need to achieve.

One common schedule is to take the SAT or ACT for the first time in the fall of junior year, again in the spring, and for a final time in the fall of senior year. This means you’ll start prepping in sophomore year or the summer after. Just as you should be thoughtful about your class schedule and extracurricular involvement, you should start planning and studying early for this important part of your college application.

You’ll learn a lot from your classes and experiences during high school and will grow a lot in terms of your interests and beliefs. As you explore and reflect, you should start thinking about where you’d like to go to college and where you have a good shot at admission. By the end of junior year, you should be drafting your college list.

&amp;#x200B;

Making Your College List

Apart from the preparation and planning discussed above, one of your first direct steps toward applying to college will be making your college list. There are thousands of colleges to choose from in the U.S. While this may sound overwhelming, you can narrow the number down quickly with a few considerations.

Some of these considerations include location, size, majors, financial aid, and overall academic and social culture. The selectiveness of the school will be a determining factor too, i.e., whether or not you have the grades to get in.

Ultimately, you should aim to have about two reach schools (tough, but possible for you to get in), three on-target schools (reasonable chance), and two safety schools (very strong likelihood that you’ll get accepted). You may apply to more, but it's not advisable to send out applications to 20+ schools to see which ones stick. It's more important to figure out the question of institutional fit up front, rather than stressing out in April about which college to choose.

You can set your preferences on search tools, like College Board and Naviance, to find schools and learn more about them. Apart from learning about the schools on their websites, you should, if possible, visit and take a campus tour.

&amp;#x200B;

Touring Campus

If you can, you should definitely visit your colleges of interest in person. Just walking around the grounds, checking out the buildings, and feeling the general vibe of a school can help you figure out if it’s somewhere you’d like to spend four years of your life.

Most high schools allow their students three or four excused absences to take campus visits. You can take tours over the summer too, but you’ll get a more realistic sense of the school if you go when students are there, and classes are in session.

You can usually sign up for campus tours on the school websites, and sometimes you can arrange to stay overnight in a dorm or meet with school officials. Some admissions officers keep track of your “demonstrated interest,” so having your name on campus visit records could ultimately be helpful for your application too.

Now that you have a sense of the planning and preliminary steps that go into applying to college, let’s review the actual requirements of most college applications. This application contains all the information, like test scores and extracurriculars, that summarizes your high school work. We’ll go over each part, as well as some strategies for keeping track of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

College Application Requirements

Before getting into each component in more detail, let’s go over a general overview of what you’ll need to send to colleges to apply for admission:

Application

Personal Essay

Supplemental Essays

Recommendations

High School Transcript

SAT or ACT score reports

Some students send additional supplemental information if their program calls for it, like a portfolio for art school. Others may also set up interviews. More selective schools, like the Ivy League and MIT, often require interviews, while others simply encourage them. Usually, the school will have an alum close by that can meet you in a library or coffee shop and talk about your experiences and interest in the school.

Let’s take a look at each of the main components in greater detail. I’ll give a brief description here, but check out the links for more extensive guides on each application requirement.

&amp;#x200B;

The Application

Many schools use the Common Application, an online app that you can fill out once and then submit to several schools at once. The Universal Application is another option for some schools, though not as common. Some schools, like those in [the University of Texas](https://www.utexas.edu/) and University of California system, use their own applications.

Whether you use one kind of app or a combination, you’ll set up an online account with a username and password. You’ll fill out basic personal data, like your name, address, and contact information. The first four ""pages"" of the Common App, for instance, ask for this type of information on yourself and your family, plus your educational and testing records. The final two pages ask you to write about your extracurricular activities and paste your personal essay.

While filling out your application may only require a few weeks of information gathering and proofreading, other components, like your essay and recommendations, merit a few months of preparation.

&amp;#x200B;

The Personal Essay (and Any Supplemental Essays)

Your personal essay is a very significant part of your application. It’s your chance to share your voice with the admissions committee and describe something meaningful to you. Plus, you demonstrate your ability to consider and communicate ideas through writing.

The Common App asks you to choose from one of five essay prompts, all of which ask you to share something insightful about your identity. Schools with their own applications will have different essay questions.

Admissions officers want to get to know you, and are looking at depth of thought and quality of writing along with insight into your character and personality. Your personal essay is a challenging piece of writing, and it's a good idea to start at least two to three months before your deadlines to give yourself time to brainstorm, draft, elicit feedback, and revise.

Some schools also ask additional essay questions. These essays are usually shorter and may ask why you want to go to the school. Some questions are pretty unusual and call for you to get creative.

Just as your personal essay and supplemental essays take a few months of planning, your recommendation letters also require early preparation.

&amp;#x200B;

Letters of Recommendation

Most colleges require a recommendation, often referred to as the ""secondary school report"" from your counselor, along with one or two recommendations from teachers. Commonly, you'll ask a teacher you had in junior year. If you're applying to a specific program or major, you should ask a teacher in that field.

The best letters come from teachers who know you well and are enthusiastic about recommending you. Just as admissions committees read your personal essay to get to know you better, they also place a good deal of weight on recommendations and what they have to say about your academic and personal strengths.You want to ask your recommenders at least three to four weeks before your deadlines, plus you should spend some time filling out a detailed ""brag sheet"" that they can refer to as they write your letter.

While all of the requirements discussed above will be part of your application, you'll also have to step outside of your online application account to send official documents, like your transcript and test scores.

&amp;#x200B;

High School Transcript

While you may self-report some of your classes and your GPA on your application, you also have to send along your official high school transcript. This documents shows your GPA, courses, and course grades, plus it proves that you're on track to graduating.

Most high schools will have you fill out a form and pay a small fee to your guidance office, which will send your transcript to the colleges indicated. Make sure to make your transcript request at least three weeks before your college deadlines.

While you may submit a request to your guidance office, you'll send your SAT or ACT scores through your online account.

&amp;#x200B;

Official SAT or ACT Score Reports

Just like with your GPA, you might provide your scores on your application, but you still have to send official documentation. You'll request these score reports through your College Board or ACT account.

If you take the SAT or ACT more than once, you might use Score Choice to decide which score reports to send (if your college allows it). You may also consider here your colleges' policy towards superscoring, or recombining your scores from various test dates to give you the highest possible composite score.

As with all the other parts of applying, sending your test scores requires some strategy and planning on your part. Now that you have a sense of what you'll be sending to colleges, what about the question of when to send these materials? When are college deadlines?

&amp;#x200B;

When Are College Deadlines?

Most students apply to college in the fall or winter of senior year. Schools offer a few options for deadlines, usually one or more of early decision, early action, regular decision, or rolling admissions. Early deadlines are typically in November, and regular deadlines are commonly in January. You'll get notified of your admissions decision around December or April, respectively.

Schools with rolling admissions allow you to submit your application within a period of time ranging from the fall to the spring. While these schools don't have a set deadline, they still tend to favor candidates who get their applications in sooner rather than later.

As you saw above, your college application process starts a lot sooner than the fall of senior year. Given that the college planning process is one that continues throughout high school, how can you keep track of everything?

&amp;#x200B;

Keep Track of Your College Planning

There's a lot to juggle when it comes to applying to college, but if you start early, you can space out the process and find ways to balance it with all your other commitments. Since the process is largely online, your applications and software like Naviance help you keep track of what you've completed and what you still have left to finish. On top of this, it'd be a good idea to write up a checklist, set personal deadlines for each requirement, and keep track of everything according to your own goals and schedule. While you may not feel like you have to do anything for college until junior or senior year, the choices you make in 9th and 10th grade actually set the foundation for where you'll apply and what will go into your college applications.

Colleges want to learn about you from your application - your strengths, interests, and goals - but don't feel you should join a club or take a class based on your idea of what would impress an admissions committee. They're interested in learning about your authentic interests and unique voice.

Exploring your academic and extracurricular interests will not only help you develop and improve your skills, but it will also help you gain self-awareness. By thinking about what you like and setting goals, you'll be able to find and apply to the colleges that would ultimately be the best fit for you.

bdfhk9,2,2019-04-15,"I have depression, am lazy, always tired, and about to graduate in less than a month. How do I deal with working full-time?",AndroidGuru7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bdfhk9/i_have_depression_am_lazy_always_tired_and_about/,"Fortunately, I have a job offer that I really like a lot, but I'm afraid I'm not gonna be ready for full-time work for the rest of my life, even though I'm looking forward to graduation. 

I don't know how I'm going to feel good about coming to work every day with depression/anxiety. I've always felt depressed for years now, and therapy helps a little, but right now, I'm not on therapy. Also, I don't know how to bring up my schedule by telling my manager or whoever that I will probably end up meeting with a counselor every week (or every other week). Maybe it's just me not knowing how to schedule appointments when I'm a working adult but I don't know if people will like that if I show up late every now and then due to therapy.

I also am hella lazy and just want to spend every day doing nothing at home, and probably enjoy it too. I don't have much work left to do before I graduate, but even when I have work to do (as in homework or previous internship work), I always find ways to distract myself because I get so fucking bored. The second internship, it cost me a return offer. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fairly diligent person, have good grades, and don't miss deadlines, but I always hate doing work. I can't wait to have no responsibilities for a few months after graduation tbh.

I'm also always tired, and it might be a result of depression. Now, I take a daily 3-hour nap in the afternoon but obviously that's gonna need to change. I noticed after every meal, I always feel groggy, and I can't tell if everyone else feels this way and deals with it better, or if my body just reacts worse. For my first internship, I drank an energy drink in the afternoon every day and I felt great but I stopped because I figured this will cause some sort of damage to my body. And for my second internship, I cut the energy drinks, but I played 15-30 minutes of video games every day on my phone whenever I was feeling tired to stimulate my mind. Also, I hate coffee, so that's probably not gonna work with me.

I know I'm not the only person who's like this or had to deal with this before. Is there any advice for people like me out there about to work full-time?"
bdg1f6,14,2019-04-15,28 and experiencing full blown quarter life crisis!!!,adkgreneoftesn4566,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/bdg1f6/28_and_experiencing_full_blown_quarter_life_crisis/,"Warning, this gets ranty. 28/f I am a late bloomer and I'm about to graduate college with a degree I hate and for which jobs are hard to find unless you work seasonally for years and move across the country for $12/hr. When I started this degree, that was what I wanted. Now I'm married with student loans and different priorities. I am so stressed I've been experiencing a flare up in IBS which makes me feel incapable of ever holding down a job, especially in my field (its a field based degree in the natural sciences and for those of you who know, an IBS sufferers nightmare). This has spiraled into a full blown anxious/depressive episode.  I worked hard to get good grades and quit a good job with good pay and benefits to pursue internships (most unpaid) to get experience in my field. Problem is, I haven't found my niche like I thought I would. Additionally, environmental/natural resource jobs are hard to come by where I live. My husband supports us (another source of shame) and we can't afford to move for a seasonal job that pays minimum wage so I can get my required experience. A Masters degree is almost necessary if full time employment is ever in the cards and was my original plan, but I barely made it (or am making it) through undergrad with my health. Plus, I'm not sure it's the right field for me. 

While I've been focused on school these past 6 years (I worked and did part time for a few years), my peers have all been working up the ladder in their careers in nursing and government and tech. Then, there is me. I feel totally lost. I can't even think of something I'm good at. I tried working with kids when I was younger and I loved it but it was so draining. I worked as an admin assistant for a government agency and could have moved up but chose school. I have always been a high achiever, but I lack true direction and my mental illness makes me feel petrified to take on greater responsibilities. I just don't feel like I have any skills, even after 6 years of college. I understand how the National Park system works and can spew some cool facts about plants and animals. While everyone was out gaining marketable skills, I was learning about birds (which was awesome, no doubt, but doesn't translate well to anything outside of the field). Even friends in the service industry are moving up in management, starting their own businesses, etc. Most of the people who graduated before me in my degree program went back to work at their service jobs because they couldn't find employment and because they can make more money bartending or serving. I don't even have serving experience (I worked as a barista a long time ago but it's been years). 

I thought about going to get a Masters in teaching because I love kids and could nerd out on science all day. My medical and mental health problems make me feel like I won't be able to do it. I have had a hard time with this last flare up just making it through my undergrad classes. I am also now petrified of wasting more money/time just to come out and fail (i.e. not find a job or not be able to pay back loans). I have a good amount of background in biology courses in school and thought about getting into medical admin and/or doing phlebotomy school just to get my foot in the door and see if I like the field. Problem is, I'm petrified to start over and accrue more debt and worried employers won't find me hireable because I've been all over the place while others have been dedicated to their field and deserve it more. I love animals and considered vet tech, but heard the pay is not great and the burnout is high. I have considered virtual assisting, dog walking, teaching English online, and tutoring, as these would allow me to work on my own schedule and manage my stress and health.

I feel totally lost. I want to make my mark on the world and I've got nothing. I can't even remember who I am in this fog so trying to sort through my likes and dislikes and skills to redirect comes up empty. My husband has been my saving grace but even he can only help so much. I wish I had been more cautious and directed in my education and not just thought ""I'll figure it out"" because I'm at the end and it is not figured out. I never cared about money or success but now that I'm a real adult, my priorities have changed. I also feel a lot of shame for not sticking to one thing and getting good at it and feel like I'm wasting any potential I once had. My parents didn't go to college so I feel a ton of pressure to rise above and make a better life for my family. Problem is, it's like I just woke up to reality and finally get it but it's too late.  I'm so ashamed of myself and I feel for my husband, who is very responsible and has supported me no matter what. I don't want to let him down. I am terrified of fielding the question ""so what do you do?"" because I feel like that is all people see others as, their job.

As an FYI I am working with doctors and a therapist to address the health stuff, but obviously it's not going to get better over night so looking for some idea of how to move forward despite these issues.

If you're still here, thank you for making it through the vent. It got a bit rough in there but we made it. I'm just hoping an outside perspective might help me see something I haven't yet? Also looking for encouragement I guess. I need to make a move but feel petrified with fear about where to? 

TLDR: 28 about to graduate undergrad in something impractical, chronic job shifter, health/mental health issues, afraid I'll never find something/don't have skills, and in desperate need of advice!"

&amp;#x200B;

My Background, I  started cracking video games for high score and fun initially. Simple games like hill climb, Temple run, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Its sorta easy actually, all you have to do is find the location where the game stores the data modify it offline and then get online, link it to a social account and voila!  you have all the goodies!

&amp;#x200B;

The downside is that you would get bored of the game real soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on, having wifi restrictions at home forced me to guess the neighbor's wifi password.  It was easy, the reception was shitty tho!

&amp;#x200B;

Still had no aim on what to do in life or which path to take. Was interested in hacking and stuff just didn't have the drive inside me cause well not in it for the fame.

&amp;#x200B;

Was interested in the way how this world works,  was struggling with depression, addictions and the usual teenage shit at this time as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Music was my outlet, had religious parents who sincerely believed I am sent from hell and I am destined to reach there as well later. The only good thing out of that was when we had a youth meeting and they had a person show us about the hidden messages in songs, how apparently Illuminati controls everything and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Sounded interesting, hence went down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theory and put on my Tin Foil Hat for a good many years.

&amp;#x200B;

You know where this is leading, everybody the anonymous bandwagon has arrived.  Jumps onboard.

Felt I was doing something useful by being a hacktivist.

&amp;#x200B;

Still aimless with what would make me happy in the real world. Didn't feel bothered by it very much.

&amp;#x200B;

Took commerce with computers in school. Computers were the only subject where I excelled.  Went onwards to do bachelors in networking and security.

&amp;#x200B;

Was a shitty place, had no internet or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up my bachelors, I did networking security in a college without a fucking LAN Network. If hell does exist the fucktards from my college management have a place down there.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, the only reason I took this course was so that I can save the world in my own way, stick it to the man. lol wtf, who am I kidding now when I think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, for my final year project, I was interested in botnet hijacking I was pretty close down that line of being the savior for the world in my own way smh.

&amp;#x200B;

It all came to a grinding halt when I got served a warning from my ISP stating that I am using their network service for malicious activities, proceeding to do so will force them to use legal action against me.

&amp;#x200B;

\~ Glowing bulb above my head!

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah right, how the fuck am I going to explain that I am reverse engineering malware and browsing shady forums to learn cyber security, aw hell no.  I would have my ass locked up and thrown away.

&amp;#x200B;

My region has zero tolerance policy for VPN, TOR, and every other technology to bypass their official blocking filters,  in short, you are fucked if you do get into any legal trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

It was the moment of realization, I knew that moving on in the future, the choices I have made would get me into trouble.

Ater this incident, I changed my project from hijacking botnets to IDS systems for Linux environments.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time I  had done internships and had work experience at a few places. All as an IT Field support, network admin, tech support, product dispatch in charge, E-Mail tech support, ethical hacking instructor.

&amp;#x200B;

To sum the above part up, I had switched 9 jobs, absconded in fact from all without serving any notice period, hardly worked at any place for more than 6 months, it just wasn't my thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Was not into networking as a career option, I do know the concepts well, coding was really not my thing, but I can read the code to figure out what it does.

&amp;#x200B;

I was more into cybersecurity just never was able to get crack at it.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, after waiting and searching for so long I was finally able to get into this place as a SOC analyst

&amp;#x200B;

It's somewhere close to what I am interested in. I do know SOC is the lowest area to learn about technical methods used in attacks and stuff in cybersecurity these days, cause it's getting more and more automated, and the human aspect is required only if it flags something out of the already fine-tuned filters.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet after searching for so long, this is a good break for me.

&amp;#x200B;

My region has a pathetic employment option for freshers, all they hire is someone with a minimum of 10 years experience with a lot of certs and stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I am grateful for this opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

PM for help and advice, I am in no way a pro,  but I am glad to assist with stuff.

I'm starting soon but I am very worried I will really mess it up.

In my current internship position, I have become almost totally useless. Every day I go to work, I tell myself that today will be the day I will be super productive. But very often I spend hours basically accomplishing nothing. I jump from task to task, finishing nothing. I am not usually given any deadlines for my work, I'm just meant to get it done in a ""reasonable amount of time"". No one really explicitly tells me that they need me to get things done, or I am taking too long. So often I never really get projects done. And I feel that the less and less I done, the less work they give me, but no one ever calls me out on my behaviour. 

I am also getting more addicted to my phone at work, which looks suuuper unprofessional but I can't seem to stop myself from grabbing it when I get frustrated and anxious about my work. Clearly, when anyone walks by my desk they can see me on my phone.

I didn't end up getting the permeant job at my internship, since, of course, I have been increasingly terrible at it. 
I'm so afraid I will carry these habits over to my new job, and I will get fired or ruin my professional reputation.

What do I do? How do I stop this? Anyone else ever engaged in this level of self-sabotage? 

tl;dr: I am increasingly doing less and less work at my job, and I am scared I will carry these habits over to my new job and get fired."

My first opportunity is a big tech company. They offered good pay and it would be full-time. I would see first hand the agile development process in a big company setting. However, I would have a good hour+ commute and I wouldn't have much hands on technical experience. I would be doing more basic intern work to make sure PI events go well and everybody is happy. I know it would be a good experience, but the commute and the non-technical experience doesn't excite me.

The second opportunity is a small start-up. When I say start-up, I mean from the ground up. The brains behind this idea is a guy with good business knowledge and experience in the industry. He is looking to assemble a team of 2 interns and the pay is similar to the big tech company and full-time. I would have full hands on experience in everything about the development process. The idea behind the start-up is good and it is located in my city. I would also have an experienced engineer that I would be able to go to for questions but he will be hands-off.

I have to make a decision this week and not sure where to go. Both opportunities are promising with their ups and downs. Like I said I am only a junior in computer science so I have no experience in either situation. I do want to go down that career path of a software developer. Do I take the risk with the start-up or go big company? I understand no one can make the decision for me but any advice would be great! Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT for clarity: The hands-on engineering for the start-up consists of around two interns. There is an experienced engineer that leads the team and has the vision for the architecture but is hands-off as far as coding and implementing goes. He's there as a mentor but has a full-time job so his time is limited."

During these 4 months my manager kept telling me how she's saving my spot so I can go back after my semester is over. A couple of days ago I texted back that I will be available again in June (after my semester ends). She said great I can't wait for you to come back. But thinking back I was really miserable at that job and the pay was horrible. The management was even worse but I worked there coz I'm a student and didn't have other choices. I applied to a couple more place and today I had an interview with a new place and it went well. The reason I applied is because it pays more but also because it's on commission (so yeah it pays more). The HR asked if he can contact my manager from the old place I stupidly said yes and gave him her name. It's a big chain store so I can't lie much about it. Should I call my old manager and tell her that they headhunted me and offered me more money? Or should I call the hr and tell him not to call...he knows they're expecting me back if I want to so hopefully he won't call. What's my best course of action here?

I chose the degree I'm studying now because I thought it could land me a good job. Already in the first few weeks I knew I fucking hate it, but I kept telling myself stories about how it could get me a job I would like (even though I had no idea what the job entailed). For the past few months I've been doing an internship at a digital marketing agency, and it's boring me to death. I'm a very introverted person, so I don't mind working with a computer, but the job itself is so boring. In addition to that I feel like there's not point to it. It's a made up job which ads no real value to the world, and it only contributes to the soul sucking and growing consumerism and materialism.

I should also mention that I've always been a very anxious person. Even though I've always had friends, I've caved in to so many of my fears. At one point this made me realise that I had pretty bad social anxiety. I've been seeing a therapist for a few months now, and she says I have symptoms of depression. I have also been suppressing my emotions for so many years now, that I'm not in touch with them at all. I feel like I don't know who I am. I don't know how to act around most people, and I get anxious in social situations. I can't connect with people anymore. I am working on reconnecting with my emotions again, finding out what my interest are and who I truly am.

Of course all of these personal issues don't really help when I now need to find out what I want to do with my life. I have the option of working full time at my current internship, but I don't feel like doing that at all. I just want to get done with this degree and do something else, as I'm so sick of it.

I've been thinking of applying for an apprenticeship in graphic design, as I've always been curious about it. But I'm scared to commit to something again, only to realise again after a while that I've made yet another wrong decision.

I feel like I'm trapped and I don't know what the fuck to do with my life. I'm almost 29 years old and I feel like I should have my shit together by now. Even though I'm feeling depressed about my whole situation, I do feel a will and a drive to get my shit together. But I feel like I'm lacking direction. Any advice is more than welcome."

$1,000 - $1,400 USD

 * **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 

Battery life may be important because I will have lots of group meetings and may have to meet outside of the internship to code together.

I do not like touching my screen.

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** 

The most important thing haha. My laptop atm is a tank. I love the feel and look of Mac's but don't like the software. Was looking at the Zenbooks but I worried about the coding capabilities. Then I looked at Thinkpads but the ""gaming"" look and bulkiness threw me off.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**

Windows. Definitely no Mac.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

 I like thin bezels, but definitely not a priority.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

 My internship is for Java Development so I'll be coding a lot. I doubt I'd play any games on it besides **MAYBE** league of legends, but I prefer it to be a full professional laptop. 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

 Not important so N/A

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

 Need a good keyboard because I will be typing a lot. I will also need at least 2 USB ports for my mouse and maybe a flashdrive.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** 

I would love to just have a thin and light coding laptop. Prefer an SSD for quick boot up. I'm sure I'm looking at the Thinkpads territory, I just didn't care for the look and it looks like it would be thick. It may be thinner than photos. I love the look of the Zenbooks but I worry about the battery.

I really doubt I'd game on it because I have a Gaming PC I can use. So the most may be league if at that but there is 0 priority on gaming.

Sorry if I sound super picky. If there is nothing that meets my requirements then I will definitely settle. Thin and Light are just a huge like for me.

Edit: Adjusted price just a little"

 &amp;nbsp;

I'm looking for some advice on ways I could steer my ""meh"" career experience 1 year out of college.

 &amp;nbsp;

I graduated in May 2018 from a top 20 US engineering school with a 3.5 GPA in chemical engineering with an engineering management minor, decent internships, and research experience. I took a job as a manufacturing engineer at a large aerospace company in Colorado after graduating, and while the overall industry is interesting, I find my day to day work boring. Most of my days are spent doing paperwork and dealing with minor production hiccups. Things move slowly, and on the rare occasion SHTF in a way that needs serious problem solving, it's usually done via email chains of people speculating back and forth until the issue lands on on a silo'd work group that takes care of it.

 &amp;nbsp;

In short, I miss the analytical problem solving / critical thinking I enjoyed in undergrad, and want to transition / develop to something with more satisfying problem solving. Additionally, my salary is not great for the COL in my area which further makes me want to look at things I can do to improve my career.

 &amp;nbsp;

I've thought of the following possibilities and would love feedback on anyone who has been in a similar position or made similar career moves.

 &amp;nbsp;
___
 &amp;nbsp;

##1. Get a MS in Mechanical Engineering
I think that I don't have an involved role at the company partly because I have limited experience, particularly in mechanical design. My company reimburses grad school tuition, I have very good GRE scores, and there are part-time professional MS courses at a nearby college, so this option is attractive.

&amp;nbsp;

##2. Get a MS in Engineering Management or an MBA
I am fine with transitioning to management and not doing hands-on technical work (often cited as reasons engineers shouldn't get these degrees) -- I think the problems posed to management are interesting and varied, and I could see this path being satisfying. I also find the flexibility to other industries appealing since I don't know if I want to be in engineering forever. However, I have heard mixed opinions about how much these degrees actually help someone enter management, especially if done part-time or early in career.

&amp;nbsp;

##3. Look for a new job
Are my complaints a red flag of a bad fit between my personality/company/background and I would be more satisfied elsewhere? I generally like the company and people/culture here and I'd rather not job hop after just a year, it's just that the work I am doing is dry/slow.

&amp;nbsp;

##4. Something else
I've considered getting a degree in something else (e.g. Computer Science) to break into a different industry, but that would likely involve another Bachelor's (or at least several courses from one and a masters) and abandoning a decent amount of relevant work experience."

As summer is coming and I am technically a junior, it is the right time to start applying for internships and get some hands-on experience.  I had been applying to a lot of them and in 70% of them, I did not even get a courtesy rejection email. Finally, I got a callback, it was this very good opportunity with this very big transnational company and I got passed two phone interviews. During the second phone interview the language with the hiring manager was very positive she was very enthusiastic about having me on board and though I didn't even need a third interview. I killed it.  I was very relieved and thought that I had gotten it. Given the fact that I recently immigrated to the US, I have always felt that I am one step behind my classmates in terms of what to do and how to do it. I have adapted to the country, the language, the style of living, the school system and I have tried to keep up the pace with everyone else. So this internship was proof that my hard work had paid off and that despite the fact that I ran away from my home country and started from 0 I was going to be able to have a normal life.  2-weeks pass and I heard no confirmation from the company, later on, I heard that some other girl from my same group of classmates had gotten the internship. I am excited for her, she is very smart an capable and we work together in basically every project. Nevertheless, I can help but think that This happened because I don't know how to do things in the correct way and I won't be able to have a regular life as someone else who has lived their whole life in the US. I also feel the fact that I am an immigrant that English is not my first language and I have an accent, that I  don't quite understand how things work here will follow me for the rest of my life and will always be a constraint for me and will slow me down. Most of my classmates had gotten callbacks and were choosing where to take internships I wasn't able to get even one real opportunity. My self-esteem is completely broken and I don't know how to continue after this.

I've been very lucky to receive two offers from two great places and was looking for input as to what offer to take up on. To preface this I'm a first-year at a mid UC who wants to get into a big N (specifically Google) next year. 

At AutoDesk, I'd be working in the RPA (Robotics Process Automation) group. The company and group seem to be really cool. I'm a little curious in regards to how much code I will write though. I think RPA is more of a software that I use to automate things, so I'm a little worried that I won't have much to code in the internship. The pay is around ~$35/hr. 

For NASA, I'd be working on a Ship-based sunphotometer prototype development. Essentially, I'd be coding in C, C++, and Python and working with an engineer and a scientist to integrate instrument systems with software. The pay is ~ $18.25. 

Thankfully, I don't have to worry about housing or money because, I will be living with my parents. What internship would you suggest that I take?"

I got really lucky and got an internship in my first year despite being average in all aspects. The position was titled ""software developer"", but it actually ended up being qa automation. 

This wasn't the direction I wanted to go with my career, I wanted to actually do development. Anyway, I found that they needed someone to work on their devops stuff and kind of just forced myself into that position, thinking that devops would atleast be closer to swe than qa would.

This time I again applied to a whole bunch of companies and positions. I ended up getting only one offer with a very generic job title ""systems analyst"", but the job description seemed to imply that there would be opportunities for development, so I was hopeful. Today I found out the team I was put on was devops.

This is my only job offer and beggars can't be choosers, so there's not much I can do, I'm sure I'll still learn a lot.

The Knight's Watch is a safety mobile application that will allow students to create a watch list of family and friends that will always know their location when the watch is activated. This Watch List will also be notified of all emergencies that will come through the Watch at any given moment. Watchers will not only be notified of the emergency but the last known location of the user.

1. Walking from bars to dorm or simply commuting around campus  

2. Dates on campus  or moments of discomfort  

3. Emergency, such as potential active shooters  

4. Robberies or attacks

At my school, if you drop your classes before attending the final, you don't get a failing grade but have a ""DISC"" ( discontinued) on your transcript next to that class . You get to take that class at a latter semester! 

People tend to answer these two questions as follows : 

1) doesn't really have great importance if you're involved in associations, do projects on your free time and get internships 

2) doesn't really matter if you're not planning to attend graduate school. 


My question to all of this : 
 
So as engineers that are probably working or as employers : 

1) how do you really judge a potential employee? 
2) Do you really base your judgement on his transcript? 
3) Is a low GPA an obstacle to get an engineering position? 
4) If someone dropped classes during his degree ( lets say 7 total during his degree) is it that bad? 
 5) if later during my carreer I decide to get an MBA will my previous transcript have that much of an impact?

Any other advice would be appreciated! Thank you"

I'm currently an undergraduate interning at a MNC as a tech consultant intern and this is the current scenario:

1. Basically onboarded and took over all of my tasks within the first two weeks of starting
2. Proposed and scripted a python script to automate key process, cutting time down from 7min per task to 2 seconds
3. Completes all my daily tasks within the first few hours of the internship 

It sounds like I'm boasting, I'm really not and want to find out if being free in an internship is an actual expectation of undergraduates. Does this already count as outperforming an intern's expectations? What do I need to do more to excel in my role?


I come to work everyday just to stare at an empty computer screen because there's simply nothing extra for me to do here. I talked to my boss and asked for more challenges and he's brought me to trade shows, client meetings etc which is definitely out of my scope. So what do I do now? Do I continue pushing questions to my superior to give me more work? Or do I just accept this status quo and learn a new skil while I'm free? (Learnt Django already building a webapp on the side)"

However, if you are a high school student, for example, and have a chance to work with a professor who is doing innovative research in a certain aspect of computer science research, it could be a very valuable thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are doing work which teaches you something, and you don't know anything about programming (high school student), you can basically learn from the experience. I did an unpaid internship early in high school; all I knew was basically for loops, but I learned many things (basic debugging, variable name conventions, proper code indenting, working with a team, etc). now, if you are working an unpaid internship at McDonald's, yeah that's probably not good."

bdvgh7,2,2019-04-16,Environment and Technology,scherzo3,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/bdvgh7/environment_and_technology/,"Hi Redditors,

After years of wavering, constantly depressed (and I don't mean that lightly), not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, I finally sat down and made an extensive list of things I love, things I'm good at, and things the world needs. I'm so tired of working shitty jobs which require a lot of mental energy. They pay well, but frankly it's easier to do a repetitive, mindless job than it is to do a high-stress job with constant learning when your core beliefs don't align with the job. I can't learn this material because I won't learn this material, and it shows. I'm currently working at a Civil Engineering firm in a medium-sized rural town where everyone has their heads shoved up their asses and they refuse to see the refuse, poverty, and the quickly-burning planet.

It all boils down to this: I need to change careers, I'm interested in renewable energy and environmental clean-up, and I am most skilled at technology development (software/hardware engineering), with the ability to learn anything in those areas.

What are the job titles available in those fields? Especially for entry level positions. I need to be able to search through the postings on company websites more efficiently, and I need to be able to find companies doing these things in the capacity for which I am searching. For example, I looked at NREL's job postings, but couldn't find anything entry-level which wasn't an internship reserved only for recent grads. I just need job titles. Something like ""Solar Panel Fabrication Engineer"", except that doesn't sound quite right.

Once I know the job titles, I can research what they do and what online courses I can take or books I can buy.

I am even willing to go back and get a graduate degree, though at the current financial debt that implies, I'd prefer to avoid that route. I have an undergraduate B.S. in electrical engineering and a B.M. instrument performance degree, so I should be qualified for some engineering fields, and I am definitely qualified to learn.

I'm nearing my wit's end in this god-loving town, and I'm looking for a god-forsaken town with some intelligent beings and a hard, rewarding job.

My plea: what job titles can you suggest? We're spitballing here, so anything remotely close will work. I need as many as I can get, and I'm trying to get this ball rolling soon.

If you can help, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!"

My masters is in data science, and I just started a PhD in computer science in France about six weeks ago. I was a little annoyed at certain processes, like being told exactly what technology to use and what methods to do, which was not at all like my masters thesis which was more ""this is the problem now you go figure it out"", but it's early and I decided to sit and wait before making any kind of fuss.


The French university sent me back to a sister lab of sorts here in the US. And it's been... incredibly demoralising. Their tech is so much better, it's not even comparable. The students are doing actual research as opposed to being told what to do. And most importantly, I keep getting told that the methods I've been told to use are a ""dead end"", which I agree with. I've been told that if I want to compete for jobs at all, I need to do something in deep learning, which makes sense. I'm left with this feeling that this PhD is a total waste of time, even a setback, in my overall career. 


My thoughts are these:


* I go to my supervisors and try to design my own PhD so to speak which will include aspects of deep learning to give myself a leg up. This may require switching supervisors, which may or may not be an option.
* I continue with the work they want me to do, and instead look for opportunities outside the PhD to build my resume (things like side projects, internships, etc.)
* I ask them to allow me to do a dual PhD, which is where I'd spend two years here in France and then two years at an American institution which would hopefully give me the skills I need to compete in the American market. This would be tough as I'd have to find some advisor willing to do that ASAP and my supervisor here in France would have to be willing to work with them. 


Personally, option 1 is what I'd want to go with - but even if I'm successful in convincing them to let me change the work, is a foreign PhD a kind of black mark on my resume anyway? 


Just as a side note, before accepting this PhD, the project was described to me as AI. During my interview when they asked me about what I'd done previously, I mentioned neural nets and genetic algorithms, and they didn't say anything that indicated I wouldn't be using those or similar in the project. Since starting, I have been told that they do not want me to use any kind of learning algorithms. They are also making me use a language which one of my supervisors designed (ie, three people in the entire world use at all, which seems incredibly impractical for job searching and gaining any kind of transferable skills)."

I applied for a job which I thought was out of my league, but I got the job (even I screw in interviews by going without any prep).

Done a class on Data Science and on quantitative finance, along with an internship at a small quant fund building infrastructures (data collection to trade execution) that handles their entire AUM (yes that tiny) and enjoyed them all.

**Scenario/Current Understanding:** I want to switch out to a CS-based career in the Cambridge/Boston area. However, DS job postings mostly require several years of work experience, ML jobs require PhD in CS/ML/AI and relevant fields. SWE jobs test heavily on Data Structures and Algorithms (esp. FANGM) which I have not done a class in, hence the Leetcode grinding and MOOC/Udemy. Quant roles have higher bars that FANG in their tech interviews (Leetcode hard+?) along with extreme proficiency in Math.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

1. Am I unable to leverage my Physics Phd and can only choose entry level CS jobs?
2. How much Leetcoding do I need to do? How fast should I aim to solve Leetcode Mediums?
3. Does Physics Phd fall under ""Phd in CS/ML/AI or relevant fields""?
4. Having only college level stats and math (inc. PDE), should I even bother with junior quant roles?

bdyjl7,1,2019-04-16,Am I on the right track or do I need to grow up?,horridmistake,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bdyjl7/am_i_on_the_right_track_or_do_i_need_to_grow_up/,"TL;DR: I am working part-time during a CS post-bac but may receive a full-time offer. Is it naive to leave immediate money on the table to focus on this degree (while I am already in debt) in order to compete for a top internship/job? 

&amp;#x200B;

I finished a Chemical Engineering degree about a year ago, a subject I had 0 interest in. I knew I liked to code but by the time I discovered that I was too close to a ""lucrative"" engineering career to change majors. I graduated and only heard back from jobs in unattractive rural locations. So while working an awful job in a factory in a place I hated, I researched as much as I could about the day-to-day (highs and lows) of the software experience and decided it was for me. I left the place/job that made me unhappy and will be starting an online post-bac next month while living in my college town. I took a part time lab tech job instead of a full time position under the pretense I would need the extra time to grind projects and self study to secure a good internship by Summer/Fall 2020 after Data Structures and Algorithms. I'd also like to have a life.

&amp;#x200B;

I got an interview for a full time position yesterday at a local company I applied to awhile ago. The job would likely pay 45k until I can hopefully get an internship compared to the 15k at this part time gig. I told a friend I planned on interviewing but likely wouldn't accept the job if offered. They proceeded to give me a ""tough love"" speech saying I needed to ""grow up"" and take a full time job to avoid incurring more debt. They likened landing a job with google to getting into harvard and claimed it was more important to focus on my immediate debt rather than put so much time into this new track. I will add around 15k debt up to when I qualify for internships/co-ops then I hope to pay the rest out of pocket. My previous debt is about 50k. 

&amp;#x200B;

My total GPA is 3.45 and my CS prerequs including Physics, Calc, DiffEQ, and LinAlgebra is about a 4.0 and I interview well. Am I being naive and irresponsible betting on myself to earn a competitive position? Do I need that extra time to put in the work to secure a higher paying internship? Is this amount of money worth risking not landing a competitive salary upon graduation?"

Company X is basically a game studio mostly focused on developing casual games for mobile. Y has several mobile apps on the market which are doing pretty good. I have an on-site interview next week at company Z. However, there is a problem. Company Y's offer expires this Friday and they won't extend the deadline whereas X is pretty flexible and basically told me to take my time as much as I want to decide before summer. I want to continue as a part-time developer after the internship and it's almost guaranteed that I will with company X but it's not guaranteed (they said it's based on mutual satisfaction) with Y. However, Y's TC is almost triple of company X for the internship, I don't know about the part-time but I know that difference won't be this much for a part-time role. I both enjoy game and mobile development but if company Z also makes an offer I believe that I can learn much more there because they're a well-known company in the industry (better and more experienced engineers) and I think it'll better serve my purposes of working abroad since it's well-known in the industry (I live in a country where engineers are underpaid.). My brother advised that I should accept the Y's offer then if company Z makes an offer next week switch to them or if they don't and I change my mind about Y I switch to X. It sounded a little bit unethical to me however, company Y had no valid excuse for not giving me extension on the deadline. This will be my second internship so I have nearly 0 experience with this stuff and I'd like to hear your opinion on this, thank you!"

I'm about to graduate at the end of the month with a bachelors degree in CS, and I wanted some advice towards starting my career. 

I've been working as a data analyst intern for the past two years (part-time during school, full-time outside of school), building up my skills in SQL and Python, getting into visualization software like Power BI, and learning SQL Server and SSRS. I'd say I'm pretty confident in my skills in both Python and SQL at this point.

Unfortunately I was recently informed I wouldn't be getting a position at my current company like I'd hoped due to budget issues. This leaves me in the job market. 

Luckily I have the privilege of time as I'm in no big rush to get the first job available to me, so I'm not panicking just quite yet but I have been applying to anything and everything with the title of Business Intelligence/Data Analyst or Data Engineer over the past couple of months. 

So far out of maybe a hundred or so applications I've gotten 4 actual interviews in companies both in my hometown and on the west coast, and they all looked promising. I got through multiple rounds of phone screens and interviews and they always seemed impressed with my background and knowledge. However, what they all had in common was that they would next send me a take-home SQL ""test"", and every time after I submit this test I have gotten rejected. 

At this point I am a little bit disheartened, as I'd usually put in 6+ hours into each to make sure they were as good and concise as I could make them, and even throw in some extra stuff to try and ""wow"" them. I am starting to wonder if I'm presenting myself wrong in these tests. 

Does anyone have experience with these kinds of take home tests and maybe some tips on how I can stand out in terms of SQL? Also, do you guys have any potential position types I should be looking out for as a new grad in the data field?

Many thanks in advance!"

As the title says, I'm wondering how likely it is for me to move to a large city like New York, Seattle or Vancouver. I feel like the UK right now is not the place to be for the field I want to go into and with the uncertainty of Brexit, I'd like keep my options as open as possible. Basically, I'm not 100% and need some validation/guidance into whether I'm taking the right first steps.

My position right now is that I'm currently a Data Science Masters student with a Bachelors in Maths.  By the time I graduate I will also have completed an internship with a company based in London related to Data Science and I worked as a Data Analyst prior to my Masters so I have some experience. 

So, I'm thinking of sending a load of CVs out to companies that I would like to work for in the cities I'd like to try. If I get some responses for interviews, will they help me through the Visa process if I was successful? Is there a good reason why an company in America/Canada would employ an immigrant over an American/Canadian? And, I know it sounds like a stupid question but is this a sound strategy to get started?  I'd also love to hear from people who have made the same journey moving over there, if there's any advice?

I don't have any prior experience with computer science but have become really interested in it. I really want to major in CS (or applied math for a back up) in college but want to get started and prove that I am serious about this. Additionally, there is a FB internship that you can apply for in the fall as long as you know one coding language. I know I am behind but want to work towards this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for an online course to do over the summer to learn. I found Cs50 on [edx.org](https://edx.org) which is free but also comes with a certificate for (90). There are other classes with similar fees for a certificate. I will not be applying to a job soon but do you think the certificate would help my application to a CS internship or demonstrate passion when I apply to change majors? Or should I do it for free?

&amp;#x200B;

I saw some boot camps but it is too far from where I live and a lot more expensive so online resources would be best. I guess my question is, whats the best way to learn coding languages and programming this summer that is free or cost efficient. Should I seek certification? If not, how should i proceed is showing that i self-taught myself?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I was thinking of learning Python first and prioritizing it since it seems like the most common? What is the best language to put first to help my chances for the FB internship and further down the line when I learn other languages and immerse myself in the CS world?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 22 year old who will be graduating this year from a high-tier (but not Ivy) private college in the US. My majors are Economics and Philosophy. Unfortunately, I had bad grades because personal issues in college derailed me. I had stellar SAT scores and high school grades, so I know that I have some intelligence. However, without my parents' support, it was difficult for me to manage my time and support myself financially, which ultimately led to depression and withdrawal. I was diagnosed with ADD halfway in. I tried medications, but elected not to continue due to the side effects. I'll have to manage the condition on my own, and find a career path that's compatible with it.

I've had internships in finance, at a non-profit, and in journalism. Right now I'm looking at jobs in journalism domestically. However, my goal is to move to the EU and get permanent residency by age 30. I'm willing to go back to school, but I don't know if I could get in anywhere with my GPA. I'd like to have a job as a writer, but I'm not sure if that's realistic, so I'm willing to change career paths (which of course would require more degrees.) I don't think medicine, law, or finance could work given my ADD. If I can get someone to accept my grades, tech seems like an option. I've considered doing an accelerated Bachelor's + 1 year Master's in Computer Science. However, I'm not sure if I'd be barking up the wrong tree.

Part of me believes I should do whatever will maximize my chance of being imported. This would be the demand-side strategy. Another part of me believes that I should hone my talents in order to differentiate myself and become irreplaceable. This would be akin to becoming the best supplier in a niche market. I have several published articles, and I've gotten very positive feedback on them. My internship in journalism was also competitive (less than 5 people got it, all Ivy.) The problem of course is that the industry is dying and the EU probably won't import people with soft skills. I know that I'll have to work on myself for 3 years or so to have a shot at any sort of foreign exit plan. I need time (and maybe even money) to clean things up. I don't want to do any silly bullshit (au pair programs, fake internships, etc.) but instead work towards something real, stable, and sustainable. Thus, my goal is not to line up an opportunity in Europe now, but by the time I'm 25. Once there, perform well and use the opportunity to get a longer-term visa. What should I be doing? Should I continue writing and apply for foreign media jobs, or begin preparing to change my line of work? If so, what line of work would make sense, given my bad performance in college?"

So back in the fall of last year I got an early head start on looking for summer 2019 internships and did several interviews with a startup for a data science internship. In February I got an offer with this company and I was super excited to have things squared away with a company with a great culture and good people. However, the role wasn’t quite what I was really hoping for. Nonetheless I accepted as it was the first offer I got and I wasn’t really deep in the interview process with any other companies.


Flash forward to March of this year and Amazon hits me up for a role as an intern there. The role is sorta vague but I take the interview just for fun not expecting to hear back. Ends up that Amazon offers me the internship, and from what it sounds like, the role at Amazon would be really exciting and pretty close to what my career goals are (the description is still pretty vague so it might not be all that but it has the upside to be perfect for me). 


Clearly now I have a huge dilemma. I took the offer for this startup months ago and really connected with the team etc. Reneging on them now would seem like a dick move... and at the same time I think I would be foolish to turn down a position at a company like Amazon, particularly because it could jumpstart my career in just the right direction. 

Any advice? If I were to renege, how would I even go about that (tactically)?

TLDR: Accepted a startup offer in Feb, got an offer from Amazon in April, what do I do?"

This is not suitable for someone working a full time job. It is much more appropriate for someone that is just coming out of college.  

My question is, how do I go about finding such an individual? Is the compensation appropriate? Too high? Too low? Any ideas?"
be84om,0,2019-04-17,Dropping an accepted new grad offer for a different position with a higher salary,gradrenegethrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/be84om/dropping_an_accepted_new_grad_offer_for_a/,"tl;dr: Accepted an application developer role from Company A for a kind of low salary. Now, Company B is offering a spot in their technical rotation program for a considerably higher salary. It is unlikely that Company A will match the salary. Is it worth bailing on Company A for Company B?

A bit of background about myself. I am going to graduate from a state school's CS program this May. I have two major work experiences - a summer internship with Company A, and a year as a part-time intern with Company B. I am interested in software engineering and hope to take my career down that path.

I interned with Company A over the summer, and about two weeks after I returned to school back in August, they gave me a full-time offer for after I graduate this May. The job is for an application developer role, and the salary is about 60k plus some stock bonuses - less than what I was hoping for. However, I did not have any other leads on my plate at the time, so I accepted anyway.

Company A is a colossal Fortune 50 company, and I worked in an office located in a low CoL city with a metro population of about 1 million. I will be working in the same office if I stick with this job offer. Some teams working in this office are developing new applications that use up-to-date tech stacks, but there are many other teams that are stuck maintaining older applications with dated tech stacks. I know I will be working on a team using a newer tech stack. The job is secure, and despite the low salary, the benefits are nice.

During the school year, I worked as a part-time software engineering intern at Company B. In March, I was told that Company B had one spot open in their software engineering technical rotation program. In this rotation program, I will be spending two years in three different departments - eight months per department - and each department will be using a different tech stack. The salary for this role is 74k, and I will be given a signing bonus of 5k, which is considerably higher than the offer I have already accepted.

I called the HR manager for Company A, told her the general details of the offer, and asked her to at least bring my salary up to 71k. When she asked what I would do if they were not able to bring it up, I told her that I would likely work for Company B. She said that she is highly doubtful that they can bring it that high, but they will try.

Company B is smaller than Company A, but it is still relatively large. It is also in a low CoL city, yet the city has a metro population of about 500k. Like Company A, it uses both new and dated tech stacks, and I will likely be exposed to both throughout the rotation. Company B has some nice benefits as well. What worries me is that the future of Company B is volatile. They have recently been bought out by overseas investors, and they have had three huge waves of layoffs in the last two years. Because of this, I am concerned about job security, and I don't know if my kind of role would be the kind of role that gets swept up in a layoff wave.

In my view, the pros of staying with Company A are that my experience will be focused, it is in a more desirable city, and it is a secure job with name recognition. However, the cons are the low salary and the conservative work culture. The pros of going with Company B are that I will gain a wide breath of experience, and the salary is high relative to many of the other jobs for new grads in the region. However, the cons of going with Company B are the uncertain job security, the less desirable city, and the probability of burning bridges with Company A due to reneging on their offer. In either scenario, I only plan on staying for two or three years to gain some experience - I have lived in this region of the US for my entire life, and I want to get out while I am still young.

Should I stay with Company A's offer to get more depth of experience and higher job security at a lower salary? Alternatively, should I take Company B's offer to get a higher salary and a wider breadth of experience at the risk of company volatility and burning bridges with Company A? I can provide more context if necessary."

be879c,0,2019-04-17,Which internship to choose among college and industry?,wittyoak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/be879c/which_internship_to_choose_among_college_and/,"I had applied for a lot of internships for the coming summer. A boatload of rejections later, I got acceptance from an MNC, a rather new company. The internship was for Digital Health. My job was regarding data analysis and warehousing. I negotiated all the contract details as I had no other option available. This was about a week ago and I have to join next month. 

Now yesterday, another application got accepted as I had cleared the programming round and I got selected in the interview as well. This internship is from a university which is known for its research, and has a stellar faculty. And I'm assigned a great professor as well as a great Deep Learning project. I have to join at around the same time

Now I'm stuck on which one to choose. There's this thing in my mind that the industry internship is paying more than twice what the college is offering, but I don't have to worry about the accomodation at any of the places as both of the places are in the about the same location and I have my own apartment there. Even the lesser amount will be more than enough to cover my daily commute. BUT I don't think I should make a choice based on money at this stage in my career (first internship: college undergrad student).

Here are my concerns:
First, that I'm more inclined towards doing research than get a job immediately after my degree, so I think that working in a research lab would do me more good. Also an LOR from a professor would be worth more.

Second, I've been told that the you get to learn more at the industry than through college internship programmes, which I'm not sure about as I'm new to both. And both the fields are what I'm working towards, Data Science and Deep Learning. Although my internship at the industry is mot strictly of Data Science.
 
How do I choose AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, How do I reject the offer from the other one?

TL:DR : Two internship offers: one from an MNC for data analysis and warehousing and the other from a college lab for Deep Learning. Which one to choose and how to reject the other one?"

I attend meetups and apply for anything remotely 'junior' level I see. Ive gotten rejected or no call/communication back. At this point I'm working a low paying construction job and trying to code/practice on my off time, but I feel like I'm getting further and further away from 'code every day' mindset. I'm not giving up, but maybe I need to change up my strategy?

I don't know whether to delve into new projects, take another bootcamp, etc. Something is not working.  Simply an internship would be a home run at this point, but I'm competing against 4 year degree CS students and it isn't happening. Being in the Salt Lake area, jobs are a plenty but I feel like I'm on the outside looking in. Since I've never worked for a 'real company' I feel its extra difficult. 

Any advice for someone in this position? I feel like I am passionate about code, smart and just need to be given the chance somewhere."
be89xe,2,2019-04-17,How much of a dick move is to abandon my research institute after they invested resources in me?,Ioanie,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/be89xe/how_much_of_a_dick_move_is_to_abandon_my_research/,"I'm about to finish my Masters Degree in Computational and Theoretical Physics. After during my last year of my bachelor's degree in physics I got in contact with a research institute that guided me with my thesis. I did a good job and wanted to work there. They said I should apply for this Masters and try to learn FPGA design if I want a job there and I said yes. I spent one year in training, took an expensive VHDL course at CERN (payed by my institute) and got better at it, but did not enjoy it that much. My supervisor wants to make me a VHDL expert and get to the point where I can use machine learning for FPGAs, so he used his networking resources to find me an internship on machine learning in France. While studying here I realized that I really enjoy doing machine learning much more than FPGA design. The people in France really liked me and proposed that I do my PhD here on machine learning.

&amp;#x200B;

I have three options:

1. Do my PhD in my home country.
2. Do a co-tutelle (6 moths in France and 6 months home each year).
3. Do my PhD in France.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1 means that I lose the opportunity to do what I enjoy most, for a while, but will tangentially use machine learning in my work. Most of my focus will remain on FPGA development as my boss initially wanted and I get to keep my girlfriend and friends from home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2 is still endorsed by my boss, but my girlfriend will probably dump me since half of the time I won't be home. I have to split between two projects that I do not know how well will get together in the end, but I get a lot of career flexibility given that I will be moderately specialized in two fields.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3 would feel like a stab in the back to the people that helped me get here. I burn the bridges with my home country and start a new life here, but get to do what I enjoy the most. It feels morally wrong, but empowering at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

I can not decide between the last two options. In either cases I will probably lose my girlfriend and I am not sure how close will I remain to my remaining friends. My father disowned me, so my family is not a concern for me, but I do feel bad about abandoning the people that helped me get here. At the same time I really don't like that much doing FPGA development and splitting between two projects that may converge at some point does not appeal to me. How much of a dick move would it be to chose the last option? It feels like the most important decision in my entire life and I don't know how much should I prioritize loyalty versus my own pleasure."

Im graduating this year and have an interest in Big data, but lets say an internship I land focuses on Security. Lets also say that I get luckly and get offered a job, but it has nothing to do with what I was interested in focusing on. Well, its my first IT job so I'd take it and it could have nothing to do with big data. I'm not going to get a better offer after all...That was just one possible example, what If your boss asked you to step into a role that you aren't interested in, but pays better. hypothetically....

Maybe later on you have more control over what job you want, but early on it seems you need to just take what you can get. Could you start your career wanting to be Big Data, but end up doing Security, because you don't have much choice of the job opportunities that come your way?

I'm sure some may not care as much about what career they end up in as long as they are making money, and thats ok.Others may see themselves in a specific field in IT and would not be happy doing something else.

How you do navigate IT to get to where you want to go? Im probably very informed on this, just wonder how plausible it is to get into the exact field you want to be in and how to do it. Im sure it's a little different for every IT focus."

tl;dr: business major working in healthcare now has masters in CS working as a developer. Took me 7 years.


**Background**


I came to /r/learnprogramming in 2012, some time after I got out of college with my BA in business. After months of unsuccessful job searching, I found my degree didn't actually teach me any hard skills. It definitely didn't bring recruiters banging on my door offering $100,000/yr jobs like I had been led to believe my whole life. It *did* make me feel like I not only wasted 4 years of my life but also took on $40k worth of pointless debt. I just felt that there was something wrong when I was jumping all over the chance to make $15/hr in a HCOL city at 22.


I was/am an avid redditor and at the time I kept reading about programmers making gobs of money. Seeing posts about people learning how to program in only a few months gave me hope that I too could learn just as fast and cash in on the sweet, sweet dev money.


I was wrong. So, so wrong. People suggested Codecademy so I tried that. The javascript course at the time seemed so basic that I was able to get through it but I didn't even feel like I learned anything. People on here were saying python was one of the easier languages so I tried that. As soon as I saw weird things like ""\_\_init__"" and people describing it as a ""blueprint"" (I still hate this description) I was lost. That was when I decided I wasn't good at teaching myself (yet) and needed more structure. I enrolled in an Intro to Java course at a local community college near the end of 2012 or beginner of 2013.


I graduated a couple of weeks ago with my MS in Computer Science and am currently a Software Engineer at a great company, earning a solid salary just like I'd been dreaming of so many years ago.


I always enjoy reading career change posts and so I wanted to share some of my experiences/thoughts in case it helps anyone else going through the same thing.


**On Getting Jobs Quick**


I see quite a few posts on here and other subreddits talking about how he or she learned to program in a few months and were just hired as a full-time dev. Initially, those stories discouraged me and made me feel dumb. I was learning but there was no way I felt ready for job after only a semester or two of intro to programming courses. Now days, I read them and understand that they're extreme outliers.


I wholeheartedly believe there is no way to become an expert developer in three months unless you're some kind of genius. There's just so much to learn and a lot of it comes from experience, even if you are genius, I still would be hard pressed to believe you'd be making meaningful, solid code contributions right away. 


If those types of posts discourage you, I would say to not worry about it. People learn differently and at different speeds. It took me 7 years before I became a full-time dev but you know what? I'm able to go into work every day and feel confident in my decisions because of all that time and work I put into educating myself. It doesn't hurt my ego to say that I do need some structure when learning new concepts or that I take a bit more time to learn things than others. Eventually, I'll get there if I put in the work and so will you if you do the same.


**Education**


This took the most time for me. Coming from a business degree, there were a lot of prerequisites I needed to complete before I'd be considered for most computer science programs. Courses such as multiple semesters of programming, data structures, algorithms, calculus and also the GRE were all needed. I was taking anywhere between 8-12 units a semester but it still took me a couple of years since I was also working a full time job. By the time I decided to apply, I still didn't have all the prereqs needed for a lot of programs, it was sad.


When it came to Second Bachelor's vs Master's, I decided on the Master's. This was mainly due to the fact that Second Bachelor programs are rare in my area (I wasn't able to find any credible, online ones), financial aid is severely limited (which I needed), and the one program I did find had extremely strict prerequisite requirements that would take 3 years for me to complete before I could get into their 2 year second bachelors programs.  With the Master's programs I found, there were a lot of credible ones that had online and in person available (Colorado State, Georgia Tech, DePaul, and more), financial aid was easily available, and I had read that bachelor's + master's looks better than two bachelor's on a resume.


The program I chose was 100% online but also allowed you to go to class in person. This was perfect since I was working full-time and the quality of the courses were good for the most part. My degree is the exact same as the ones that ""normal"" students get so definitely consider online if you haven't.


**Advice before applying to colleges if you do**: Look at their actual requirements before you take any prereqs. Some programs may not require any prereqs so you may not need to spend time on knocking out prereqs. 


The program I chose didn't require a lot of the prereqs I took because they make students take foundation courses before you start the actual program. If I had done research before had, I probably could have gotten in earlier than I did. However, a lot of my prereqs did end up transferring so I was at least able to save some money. 

Education was by far one of the most difficult parts about my journey. There were quite a few all nighters and I was constantly studying not just course material but other sources for different self imposed projects.


**Experience**


Experience is king now days. As soon as I was accepted into the Master's program, I immediately started looking into internships. At this time I had made multiple job hops and making almost $70k in an unrelated industry so I'd likely be taking a dock in pay.  After reading multiple threads on MSCS new grads unable to find a job since they had an advanced degree but no experience, I figured less pay would be worth it. 


I had a hard time finding internships, although I only applied to maybe 10-15. I got one callback and I felt like I completely bombed the phone interview. I remember tripping up the difference between an object and a class...ugh. After giving up, I got a call three weeks later saying they were impressed and wanted to me to come onboard for the summer! 


The internship experience was amazing. Not only was I able to get a taste of developer life but the team was incredibly smart and helpful. I learned so much more than I did learning on my own and even in school (version control, frameworks, etc).

Another benefit was being able to secure temporary status after the internship was over. They told me they'd be unable to offer full time employment until my degree was finished but they could just keep me on as a temp until then. If you find yourself in a similar situation where you need to work, I highly suggest asking for this type of arrangement.

Eventually they brought me on full time as they said and now I also have a couple years of developer experience on top of my Master's degree (this also helped a lot when it came to negotiating)

Bottom line is the world won't end if you don't get an internship before you graduate but you really should try your best to get one.

**Doing it For the Money**

People are always parroting that you won't go anywhere if you only do this for the money. I sort of disagree with this statement.

The money was, and still is, my primary reason to work as a developer. However, it did eventually turn into a hobby and something I truly enjoy doing. If programming makes you miserable then you should consider that it may not be the job for you. There are a lot of different computer related jobs that don't require coding experience which may be of interest but you shouldn't be dreading going into work everyday.

The problem with my business degree was that it gave me a lot of broad knowledge and soft skills. When I got out of school, I didn't even know what jobs to look for (let's face it, there are no high paying ""business man"" jobs that only require ""general business knowledge"" or ""talking to people"" skills on job boards). While sort skills are incredibly important in and outside of workplace, my advice is to pick up a hard, in demand skill (programming, nursing, plumbing, car fixing, etc) and pursue it relentlessly. These not only will make you way more marketable but even if you don't like it, it's something to fallback on while you pursue other passions.


**Final Thoughts**

I feel like it took me a lot longer than most people to make this career change. So don't look at my 7 years as if it's the norm but don't think that going from zero to developer in 3 months is either.

If I could go back to when I first started college, I would have done more research on which careers would be in demand/pay the most and decided on major accordingly.

Try to get an internship, seriously.

Thanks for reading. If you have any other questions about my experience feel free to ask!"

A lot of these mistakes have been do to personal stress which I might just tell my boss just so I have it as a factor for him to consider.I have leads from my school and a temp agency that can help get me a different IT job, but my question is should I stick it out and be extra careful and risk getting fired for a minor slip-up, or just quit and put in my 2 weeks when I find another job?

So I have recently applied to a risk analyst internship at funding circle. The position entails some programming/data analysis skills in Python or R. I had finished my first phone interview with the recruiter and the experience was generally positive. I had briefly went over what my coursework at my university was like, what my previous experiences were at my fraternity (I held a finance position and a marketing director position), and I myself asked the recruiter questions about how he felt working there, and how he thinks about the companies culture.

The recruiter has scheduled me for a 30-minute phone interview with a member of the risk team tomorrow. He told me that it was going to be a bit more technical to see if I am knowledgeable enough to take on this internship. If I pass through this phone interview, they will send out an online coding challenge to work on. If i pass that, then an in-person interview with 3-4 employees.

My question is, what kind of questions should I expect to answer in a technical phone interview? Will they ask more detailed questions about my past projects? Will they throw very basic programming questions? How can I best prepare so that I can nail this phone call, based on your experiences?

This guy is fairly old so he doesn't understand the difference between IT support/SysAdmin/Software Developer - to him it's all computers. He said that I could start right after graduation and would pay me the starting salary for new graduates from my major from my school (65k, EE/CE). He also said that I would be salaried, have extremely flexible working hours, and that a trip abroad once a year would be no issue (this was especially important to me). This all seemed great so I obviously took the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated and started ""working"". As I said earlier, this is a new business so there was a lot of stuff that was not ready. The first month of ""work"" consisted of me driving 40 minutes to a temporary office location for a 2 hour meeting before getting to go back home. Meetings consisted of me, my boss, his secretary. My only responsibilities at this point were to create a website so after our 2 hour meeting my boss said that I could just go home and work on it whenever. I was paid in full for this month, approximately $5400 before taxes (65k/12).

&amp;#x200B;

After the first month of ""work"", my boss calls my parents and says that he cannot afford to pay me in full until the business actually starts. My boss said that he could pay me 1/2 my salary and that we would only need to meet once a week until the business officially starts. My parents and my boss come from a different country and my parents explained that the reason my boss called them first instead was a cultural thing. Anyways, like I said, this was a new business idea and everything at this point was on paper. There were a bunch of issues that needed to be dealt with internally and I was later informed on these issues so I know they're not just an excuse.

&amp;#x200B;

My boss's original estimate for the ""half salary limbo period"" was 3 months. Long story short, due to issues spawning issues that spawn more issues, I have been on ""half salary limbo"" for the past 9 months. My boss's most current estimate for the business ""officially starting"" is another 4 months, which triggered this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the advice...

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't see myself doing EE/CE for a living but I don't think my current situation is sustainable in the long term. The main reason I took this job and disliked an EE/CE career was due to flexibility and vacation time. I've taken biannual trips to Asia (visit family/relax) all my life every 1 or 2 years and wanted to keep this up as much as possible after getting a job. This whole situation has been weighing on my mind really heavily recently and I've been getting increasingly worried.

&amp;#x200B;

\* If I find a ""real"" EE/CE job I will be paid ""what I'm worth"" but will lose my flexibility and be restricted to a week (or two if I'm lucky) of vacation time per year.

\* If I stick with my current ""job"", I could potentially end up with a near ideal job (good pay, flexibility, vacation time).

\* If my current ""job"" doesn't pan out, the longer I wait to find a ""real"" EE/CE job the harder it will be.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to stick with my current ""job"" at least until the rest of this year, would it be a good idea to bring up:

&amp;#x200B;

\* pay - the 65k starting salary was mentioned to be ""pre probation"". I think it's safe to say that after a year I've passed probation.

\* flexibility - exactly what he meant by flexibility and how it would affect things when we actually start

\* vacation time - his secretary explained that was no ""real"" vacation policy and only said that a yearly trip abroad would be absolutely fine. Should I ask them to come up with a real vacation policy and get it in writing?

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know which decision to make so any advice/thoughts would be greatly appreciated!"
bebg06,2,2019-04-17,First Offer and Approaching Compensation Discussion,ItchyCephalosaurus,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bebg06/first_offer_and_approaching_compensation/,"Little background about me: I have a Bachelors in Physics and will be graduating in May with a Master’s in Software Engineering from a small-medium Midwest state school. During my undergrad I had 2 research internships, 1 at a large university and 1 at a national lab. During the entirety of my Masters I’ve been interning at a large but not big-N software company on a DevOps team doing mostly full stack internal tool development.

My situation: 

I just got a call from my recruiter for a small-medium sized company in Boston (~150 employees, 13 engineers and growing) this morning telling me they would like to move forward with an offer for a full stack python position and I setup a call with the CEO for tomorrow. I also have an on-site interview for a firmware engineer position at a large hardware company in the Minneapolis area tomorrow. 

Thus far I’ve deferred stating a salary range in hopes of them stating one. I am anticipating my call with the CEO will be centered around compensation and am trying to prepare more, perhaps I’m incorrect. Obviously at this time I don’t have a second offer from the hardware company so I can’t use it to negotiate, plus it’s a very different position in a different job market.

I’ve got a few general questions: 

Glassdoor says average pay for a software engineer at this company is $75k. Is that a reasonable salary for Boston? It seems a little low to me based off my research but I know they’re not a huge company and won’t have top end compensation. 

Is there anything I can do or not do to set myself up for the best compensation package? If I understand correctly the best thing I can do is not state a desired salary. I’ve  thought that in the event I fail due to social heat of the moment or whatever I would say a desired base salary of 80k and a relocation package. Is this reasonable?

Lastly, I’m unsure exactly how I should expect to be treated since I’m a new grad but I have a Masters, a non-CS Bachelors and a decent chunk of internship time.

Thank you for any and all advice/answers"

bec8yy,7,2019-04-17,Writing a Resume for College Applications...Some Tips,koodoos,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/bec8yy/writing_a_resume_for_college_applicationssome_tips/," While grades, test scores, and extracurricular involvement form the basis for most admissions decisions, a stellar resume can be the deciding factor for an admissions officer when it comes to choosing between a group of similar candidates. This means, for colleges that use a resume to determine admissions, it can be a critical part of the admissions file. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why a Resume?**

Ideally, your resume should be a consolidated snapshot of your academic and extracurricular profile. It should also reflect what is important to you and help admissions officers determine if you’ll be a good fit for the school. By requiring students to submit a resume (especially at the graduate level), universities can purposefully admit a student body that is not only academically prepared but also involved in community service, athletics, leadership, and learning outside of school. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How to Get Started with Your Resume**

Think about the things you’ve accomplished over your four years of high school. Make a list that includes everything of note like special projects, awards, honors, leadership positions, volunteer roles, (un)paid work and publications. Next to each accomplishment on your list, write out any quantifiable or noteworthy details that help illustrate your achievements. Here’s a list of examples you might use: 

* Selected as captain for 20-person Knowledge Bowl Team; Earned 2nd place at State Tournament
* Co-authored a research study on educational justice which was published in a journal with a monthly readership of 15,000 
* President of Associated Student Body; Represented interests of 3,500 students when advising school and district leadership 
* Communications and Outreach Intern, LogicBound Labs, April-September 2018
* Dean’s List for 8 semesters; Ranked in the top 25% of high school class 
* Lead actor in six community theater productions which averaged 400 attendees per show 
* Earned the rank of Eagle Scout; Built a 600sq ft habitat for small endangered reptiles as part of service project 
* Managed scheduling and assigning tasks for 15 volunteers working a local nonprofit organization’s booth at the county fair.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should you include on your college application resume?**

For most high school students applying for college, a resume should include:

* Contact information including your name, a professional email address, your phone number, and link to your LinkedIn profile
* An objective or summary that concisely states your most relevant skills and accomplishments
* An education section detailing your GPA, relevant coursework, and test scores
* A work section listing relevant paid and unpaid work including internships 
* The list of additional accomplishments, awards, and achievements from your earlier brainstorming
* A list of 2-3 references (name, email, and phone number) who can confirm your skills and accomplishments 

&amp;#x200B;

**Other General Tips for Writing Your Resume**

**Any resume format is fine as long as it’s readable and professional looking.** There’s also nothing wrong with starting from a template which can be easily found by searching online or using the ones built into programs like Google Docs and Microsoft Word. Generally, you should keep your resume 1-2 pages long. Use a standard font such as Times New Roman or Arial and leave enough white space so it’s easier for the reader to find keywords. 

**Have a trusted friend, mentor, teacher, or guardian read over your resume once you’re done to check for errors and typos.** Be sure to proofread your resume once last time before submitting it with your application to find any lingering mistakes. 

**Write your resume with your objective in mind.** If your goal is to get into a top STEM program at an elite university, then you should highlight your achievements, experiences, and awards that specifically relate to the STEM field.  

**Be as detailed as possible.** Don’t make those reading your resume do the guesswork because you were too vague or used jargon specific to your field of interest. While your resume will only be 1-2 pages, it’s still possible to add enough detail to each section to both quantify and highlight the most important aspects of your past work. Instead of simplifying your experience by stating that you were “selected as the leader of your football team”, add that bit of extra detail and instead write that you were “chosen by 78 teammates to serve as the varsity football captain for the 2018-19 season. 

**You can and should list group awards in the honors and awards section of your resume.** The name of the award and activity should provide an indication that it is a group award. For example, ""soccer state champions"" and ""Member of 1st Place Team at Science Olympiad Nationals"" will be read as team awards and not individual ones. 

**Don’t be afraid to repeat some of the information that’s already in other parts of your application.** Unlike a long and complex application, the resume provides a one-page snapshot that concisely illustrates the skills and experiences that make you an ideal candidate."

I'm currently a data analyst at my current job and mainly use Excel, SAP, and Python to format and automate reports. I've been going at it ""casually"" because outside of the pay range being lower than I'd want, I can use the time I do have now to pick up some skills like SQL, Tableau, and so on to bolster my resume. Good idea, I'm sure most of us has hit that juncture and have done the same thing. My plan was to spend more time on SQL so that I can add it to my resume and try to find analyst jobs in that field to move up in my career. 

&amp;#x200B;

Welp.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got a call about a new business analyst opportunity in a salary range I'm looking for, and they asked to interview me after seeing my linkedin profile. They wanted to know how skilled I was in SQL, and I was honest: I've used it for a bit for basic things at an internship, but am confident that I can pick it and Tableau up on the job or on my own considering my experience with python and packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and so on. They offered to send an assessment to work on by *friday*, which would take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, on SQL since that's their main focus. 

Do you think that, with my experience in python, I'll be able to pick it up enough to do a decent job in an SQL interview assessment? Should I just reject the test and keep studying so I'm more than ready for the next opportunity?

I'm not nervous per se, as I'm honest with myself to at least be happy that this sort of offer is in my league even with a month or two more of study in SQL. If I fail, I fail and this is definitely going to motivate me to study more. But if you know I'm just not going to be able to learn enough in the next few days I'd rather know now and just say no so I can gear up to be in a better spot for this sort of thing."

* **2nd Drive:** 2000GB 7200RPM Hard Disk - 6Gbps

I'm not looking for anything crazy, just something to get that crisp user-experience back even aside from getting more than enough fps in most any game (it's been a while with newer games). I don't game too much any more and so am really looking for an upgrade more geared towards a workstation for programming/video editing/game development etc.

Budget-wise, again, nothing extravagant, but luckily enough I've gotten an Internship for \~4 months lined up @ 350€ p/ week. So think ""college-student spending upgrade budget"" :D

Not sure where to start and what should be priority. Thinking of GPU / RAM first but again, not sure what would work best with what etc etc so any recommendations would be welcome!

This is my first post on Reddit. I didn’t know what to really do at this point so here I’m. So, I’m a senior and I have 11 courses left to graduate as a Computer Science major. I will be my most honest self right now. Tbh, after graduating high-school, I never got serious at studies. 

The first two years in college was pretty easy but when I entered my major, things started getting complicated and I panicked when failed my first CS class. Eventually I had to repeat a lot of CS classes to barely pass. Fear of being kicked out from the major, I cheated from one of my friend in classes to pass and that eventually became a habit. I know this wasn’t the best decision to take and hence my struggle right now but I had so much going on in my personal life that I couldn’t concentrate on my studies for even a minute. I kept passing classes mostly cheating off my from my friend’s exam. Also, CS wasn’t something that never really interested me but I was studying it because it has a lot of opportunities and I wanted a safer way out tbh. 

Last year, I somehow hustled to get an internship and there I finally started liking it when I got involved in projects. I started getting interested as I learned more ways to apply CS knowledge in applications and thinking like a CS engineer. I finished the internship strong and came back to attend my last 3 semesters at school. 

I realized when I started studying that I had really bad foundational knowledge of CS (because I never really studied them before) and I was really struggling to write code and work on projects. But my motivation was really strong and I wanted to do good and pass. I still failed one of the important classes in the semester that eventually lead to another extended semester for graduation. 

Right now, I’m trying my best to just really pass the classes because the pressure itself is causing me to not do good. I don’t know what to really do at this point. It’s almost been 5 years I’m in college and I have (hopefully) one more year to go. My parents are always asking me when will I graduate. All these things get me really depressed at times and it affects my studies. I try to maintain good habits and study regularly but sometimes, I burn out and end up procrastinating for days, like in those times the the urgency of studying does not even occur to me and I just ignore responsibilities subconsciously without thinking about the consequences. 

At this point, I had a few questions:

- What to do when you feel burnt out but want to get back that motivation to study, learn and do good in classes?

- How to procrastinate less? 

- How to do good in classes? 

- and most importantly, pathway to develop my CS skills? 

Thanks in advance and I would really appreciate any help."

I’ve taken 61A and 61B, so I only need 70 to declare. 
I would like to be able to do a SWE internship this summer instead, so I’m currently still applying and waiting to hear back from companies. But I know it’s too late to expect any positive results. 

I have 3 semesters left until I graduate (planning on graduating Fall 2020), so I’d still at least have next summer to do an internship. If I were to take CS 70 (and maybe CS 61C) this summer, I’d be able to take 170 and other UD’s next Fall. Would doing this make me more prepared for interviews and increase my likelihood of getting an internship next summer? Or am I setting myself up for failure by not having any software engineering internship experience by that point?"

bego09,0,2019-04-17,Course of Study AFTER a coding bootcamp w/o computer degree?,PrudentDamage1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bego09/course_of_study_after_a_coding_bootcamp_wo/,"Hey - first post on Reddit - ever. Mostly a lurker - however despite searching I can't seem to find a good answer to a specific question I have ... ( drumroll ). Forgive me, I think it's likely long ... 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do AFTER I finish a 2-month bootcamp?

&amp;#x200B;

I have browsed a lot before finally deciding the hell with it and going for it. I ended up going to one called Le Wagon - it's a 9 week full-stack Ruby on Rails course. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I feel alot less qualified than I feel like they are telling me I am, and I think on two counts 

  1. This is how they make money

  2. The T.A's (teaching assistants) are not necessarily much better maybe?

&amp;#x200B;

So more or less upon graduating my team and I (of 3) sort of barely scraped together a single, buggy, web application with 3 people over the course of 3 weeks. I could sort of put together an application in Rails, by sheer force of will, given enough time. I am working through a react post-course that they offer. However, I just got my first pre-interview screening - they quizzed on solving recursive functions, SQL join tables, and implementation of searching and sorting algorithms. I really feel like I was given a lot of high level tools, but know none of the basics - and don't know enough to be able to keep pace, even if I could convince someone to hire me.

&amp;#x200B;

So now my plan is to pray and try and get an internship. I have a few months living expenses, though hopefully it would transition into a job before it came to that. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in conclusion, are my suspicions correct?  I likely don't have the skills I need for a job, and what can I do about that? Right now I am coding anywhere from 5 - 8 hours each day, and my teammates kindly gave me a part-time paid gig to work on while I find something. Should I be looking for an internship rather than a job? What else should I/could I study?"

I work part time as a year round intern at a major tech company known for processors. My role is an undergrad software engineer intern, and after being there about a year I’ve come to realize that software engineering isn’t really my passion. I’ve had a infoSec / cyber security internship and liked it much more then my current situation (besides the pay). I really want to get into penetration testing but have been told by a few people that 1) getting a pentesting job right out of college is very hard. And 2) that pentesting pays far below software engineers. I understand money isn’t everything, with that being said it’s always a plus if something you seem to have a passion for also pays the bills and gives you a decent lifestyle. So I guess my question is, what are some things I can actively do before I graduate to stand out and be considered to such a job? And also, not to be that guy.. but how’s the pay?"

I would like to start off by saying thanks for taking a look at this post and help or any revision would be grateful. I got a full-time offer from the company from where I was an intern during college and have been working their for about 2 years so far. Small family company of about 7-8 people. In a bit of a rut here with the position and wondering if you guys had some insight.

My goals are met always and have been extremely hard working at this job but that doesn't seem to be enough always. Our CEO(remember like I said small company) demands more and always wanting deliverables from us developers. After a large sprint is done, not exactly expecting a cookie but the only question we get is when are we gonna get back to work. There is lacking employee satisfaction and many times I have been asked to work over weekends due to it being short staffed and bigger projects every time.

Unfortunately  the sales staff aren't making any sales and pockets aren't dry but at this rate won't sustain. This trend has continued for roughly 3 years or so being a SAAS company. Not even beginning to mention I am paid roughly 25% less then my peers for my experience while also not getting benefits due to it being the small company in the Chicago land area where jobs are plentiful. With the company struggling, it doesn't leave me with much room to mention my lack of raise but at the same time I have to put my career first. 


Anybody been in this situation or possibly have any wisdom they could enlighten me with?"

My company is well-respected in industry (I did a FAANG internship and turned down the full time SWE role for it) but may not have the same ring as a FAANG company to a tech outsider.

behegd,4,2019-04-18,8 years as a site generalist / IT analyst oh god.....,eightzerosinarow,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/behegd/8_years_as_a_site_generalist_it_analyst_oh_god/,"I'm in crisis about what to do. I need to preface a few points first, so you can see how I got here. I'm more than a little antisocial. I did not thrive in public education. I ended up with an associates degree from a diploma factory. I rode the coattails of my best friend as he got his CS major; he got a sweet internship with a local manufacturersand managed to get me hired on later as hourly IT support. The company was fairly small and our systems were not very complex.  My boss was a chucklehead but was also 3 timezones away and pretty much let me work autonomously. 

about 2 years in, a fortune 50 steps in and buys our company. My 3 time zones away boss pretty much lies about my qualification and manages to get me from hourly to salary when we're acquired. six years have passed and Im in the same position, which has been absolutely where I want to be. I don't want to manage anyone else and I make plenty of money to take care of myself and put some away in the retirement fund. 

But the functionality of the IT department is in the shitter. Management appears to just buy whatever security product they heard about most recently, but then fail to hire anyone to implement it, and just add it to the growing list of things happening in the taskbar. and thats just security. Everything is being outsourced to managed service companies, and it seems all the service they can manage is to call me and ask if the power went out whenever something goes dark. Its up to me to actually contact the manufacturer/provider and deal with getting it going again. Our helpdesk and support is offshored and pathetic. the knowledge base isn't being maintained and is now spread across 3 applications. the knowledge therein is usally wrong in some detail if not completely off the mark and useless. my production facilities are suffering for it and I look like a jackwagon because I can't get anything done in a timely manner any more. I feel like my end users, some of whom who have been there longer than I have, are actually getting more computer illiterate as time goes on, and new highers are hopelessly computer illiterate as its not something we check for, but theres no part of production where someone isnt entering something into a PC. I feel comfortable saying that 4/5 can't tell you if they're using a website or launching software.

It's driving me insane now. I've struggled with intractable depression my entire life (yes before I was an adult too). I feel like a rabbit caught in a snare. I dread having to 'help' someone whos too lazy or out of fucks to read an email. I frequently get asked ""what does this mean?"" 

the only good (great actually) news is I got a quarter mil in stocks and 75k in my 401k now. 

But I'm 34, essentially no education, no certifications, and no other work experience that wasn't cash register related. going back for a BS isn't on the table. I dont want to burn through half or more of my nestegg on classes. Short courses and certs are viable though. I feel like the 8 years in my only real job paired with $120,000 bachelors degrees is going to force me to stay near tech.

TL;DR My department is dysfunctional and end users make me want to jump off a bridge. Is there some other facet of IT that I could work toward that doesn't involve so much support? Im so tired of just taking care of lazy or dumb users."

This is my first post and I'm also new to Python.  I'm doing a youtube course (plus a book) but I also want to use it to Web Scrape as I also want to use this to help me understand.  I found some forums that have what I need, however, they have advanced scripting which won't work in my even if I update or it's beyond my understanding.

I put this together from a few different posts, however, I understand about 98% of the code.  Others I found were more advanced and although I could use them for what I want, they won't help me learn/understand.

I'm using this (originally) to look for desktop support jobs in Craigslist then then (since there were way to many) changed it to look for free BBQ grills (mine broke and I was laid off so I can't buy a new one for now :(  ).

&amp;#x200B;

So I searched many forums for the 2 issues below

1. I want to look for keywords (multiple and single) but I can't as I keep getting errors.
   1. I found that the code  will allow me to search for keywords, however, outside of the ""for"" loop, it finds only 1
   2. Inside of the ""for"" loop, it get every single line with the word none in the title and the ones I'm looking for.
   3. On #2 above, it only words if I search the title using my code but if I add the rest of the items I'm looking for it makes the script hang

&amp;#8203;

    soup.find(lambda tag:tag.name==""a"" and ""grill"" in tag.text)

&amp;#x200B;

1. With the description, I also get the text ""**QR Code Link to This Post"".**  I would like to remove the text.
   1. Here is where I found it.

&amp;#8203;

    &lt;section id=""postingbody""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""print-information print-qrcode-container""&gt;
    &lt;p class=""print-qrcode-label""&gt;QR Code Link to This Post&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Below is the code, so what would help me is

1. Using multiple keyword(s) find titles that have the word, BBQ and/or Grill
   1. I don't want to see the other lines
2. Remove the from ""**QR Code Link to This Post""**  the results

I can't just push thru and waste even more time and money for failed attempts.   


I have so much credit card debt, haven't been able to work for nearly two years, been supported financially by all my younger siblings, and just...am not doing anything that I could have been doing before my fibro manifested. I used to be be able to handle a full class load, an internship AND a job, if not two jobs. I saved enough money for a car, to send back to my siblings, to be a supportive presence to so many people and now I'm just a waste of resources.

At my internship, I’m given some grunt work to do in excel each week- determining which parts we need for each unit we build, converting the original file into something we can use for production, as well as generating labels for the production floor.

In order to make my job easier, I’m using VBA alongside some really handy excel functions.
At first it was easy, but as my boss kept changing parameters and adding conditions, I quickly realized that I needed something more robust. I now have assembled a fairly well oiled, easily usable machine with about 650 lines of code and elegant UI.

I know VBA isn’t a typical programming language, but I’ve also spent some time with arduino and learned some of the associated python. And ultimately, I’ve read that it has less to do with the language and more with the logic.

I really love working on the file I work on at work- the whole thing is like a puzzle to me. If I’m clever, I can come up with artistic, elegant solutions. Not to mention- I went into my ME degree because I think it would be cool to build robots and devices from scratch- but now I know that without Data acquisition,  interpretation, and implementation,  you won’t be able to build anything that’s useful without a skilled operator.

My questions are:
1-what would be the most effective way to incorporate CS into my degree if I want the option to enter that field in the future?  Should I minor in it or start developing a portfolio of personal projects? Would it be worth spending time with mechatronics? We have a class in it but my understanding is that it’s pretty niche compared to the ME / CS resources we have and our uni.

2- Im set up to enter industry after I graduate, but after revaluation if my career, might be going into research.  What fields should I consider if CS is in the realm of my interests? I think computational fluid dynamics and additive manufacturing are both promising fields, especially because they have funding at my university. I know there’s a lot of money in development. Is that something that overlaps these fields or is it kind of a standalone focus that sucks people in because of the pay?

3- is there any literature you would recommend? I’ve heard of style guides for coding, although I don’t think they’ll be much use for me until I get a better handle on the logic of CS. My 650 lines do the job and is a hell of a lot more robust than when I started, but it would probably give you /REAL/ programmers nightmares. I don’t know enough about programming to understand most things on
 r/programminghorror, but I know enough to know that I definitely belong there.

1. Debating: I am fortunate to go to a school with a very strong debate team. After many years of trying out, I made it to the A team, and in the last three years I have won many national tournaments, either as part of a team or individually (I'm from India btw). Last year I went to a really big international debate tournament in Europe, and my team came 3rd out of over 30 teams (some of which were national teams). I also have the responsibility of training the debate society, along with the other 3 members of the A team.
2. Coding: I started programming when I was in middle school, and I completely fell in love with it. The strong CS is kind of why I wanted to go to Stanford. I have a GitHub page full of random projects, mostly mathematical visualisations and stuff like that. Lots of games too. Not much useful stuff, sadly. In terms of actual work, I made an information portal for my school where announcements are posted. I did an internship in Chennai with a big data science company, and am currently writing a research paper on neural networks with them. My dream is to one day become an AI researcher, and machine learning is probably my favourite area of computer science right now.
3. Mathematics: This is the thing I love more than anything else. My math grades have always been perfect (sometimes at the expense of all others). I read lots of books about math, and I spend a lot of time solving problems and learning stuff outside the classroom. My main concern is that I don't really have a way of quantifying my knowledge in mathematics. In my school, there's basically no competition math, and to be honest I didn't even know math contests existed until last year. My math teacher, who I have a really good relationship with, sent me for a fairly big national contest, along with a senior of mine. I won a bronze medal out of 100 people, but the competition wasn't that prestigious, nowhere near the level of the IMO. However, I do know a fair bit about math, and I bet I could write some nice essays on it.
4. Music: This is the other thing I'm obsessed with. I've played the piano since I was a child, and I've reached a high level of certification in it. I've performed with the school band and been for a few competitions, but mostly I just play for fun. I have a few original compositions, and I'm planning on uploading them to YouTube just to see what happens. I've been playing the guitar for the last 2 or 3 years, and I'm writing songs on it as well. Music isn't really an extracurricular tbh, it's more of a coping mechanism for stress.
5. My non-profit organisation: I started a cool thing with a friend of mine from school. It's a website that allows people who can't afford/don't have access to digital marketing to upload information about their small businesses. The platform is modelled after social media, with sorting by category (furniture, art etc). I coded the website, and I guess I'm co-CEO? Our aim is to have 100 businesses on the site by July.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an Indian male, my parents aren't poor, and my life has mostly been pretty tragedy free, which I'm very happy about. I have no hooks, is what I'm trying to say.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I wrote this post is to get some perspective. I want to know if I'm going in the right direction, and if I stand a chance. Please give me as much feedback as you can, any advice is greatly appreciated."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a Software Engineer from South-America, and I have +9 years of experience working on different companies, mainly in the Internet sector (like a Full-Stack dev). Last year I started a Master Degree in a well-known University in Europe, with the aim on finding a job in what I like the most: robotics (not industrial robotics, but service robotics, logistics and that kind of stuff). Now, I am in the search of an internship in these sectors in order to gain experience and find a more interesting job.

&amp;#x200B;

I reorganised my Resume, and sent a lot of internship applications, but almost nobody answered me.. The last company that answered, said ""your experience doesn't sufficiently match what we are looking for"".

bemdz5,21,2019-04-18,How do I encourage team member to debug before asking for help?,Fox_and_Ravens,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bemdz5/how_do_i_encourage_team_member_to_debug_before/,"I've mentored a few (~10) people in the last couple years and they've all been of varying skills from people who perform amazingly well to others who need ridiculous handholding. Most of these people are interns or brand new college hires. They haven't quite gotten the grasp of debugging and trying to figure things out themselves before asking for help. One thing I started to try to do was ask what they've already done to figure out their problems but I feel it always comes across snarky when I ask that, no matter the tone I use. For the most severe case, I implemented a ""try for 2 hours before asking for help"" policy so I wasn't interrupted every 10 minutes with questions and so they'd actually get practice trying to self-debug. I truly want them to succeed and want to help but they also need to understand how to debug themselves. Seeing a stack trace and immediately asking why they're seeing it isn't acceptable to me, even if I can provide any immediate answer. 

Are there any good methods to encourage these folks to really dog in before asking questions without sounding like an asshole and without making it appear that I don't want to help?"

I'm looking to change careers. One of the things I am looking at is data science. I applied for an internship (though I've been out of school for a few years now). For the record, previously I taught HS physics, math and (occasionally) CS at some international schools.   How I ended up there is a story for another time, but I'm tired of that and want out of it.  Occasionally, I'd be asked to run some stats or something at my last job, and I took that opportunity to force myself to learn Python and R.  

Anyways, to my IPAT experience: I easily completed some of the questions in under 30 seconds. Unfortunately, you don't get that time back as you do with a a more traditional assessment.

Towards the end, it seemed that 2 minutes, 15 seconds was just barely enough. Had it not been for the time limit, I feel I might have done better. I wasn't sure about some of the numerical pattern questions. And there's always the off chance that I misread or misunderstood what a question was asking for.

Did anyone who eventually got the job find this difficult, or at least feel rushed?

And how soon will I know if I passed?  In the case that I'm rejected, will they let me know that it was because my score was too low?"

I'm currently finishing up my Junior year of my mechanical engineering degree. I have three semesters left though because I decided to take a bit less credits than needed. Last summer I was a project management intern at a construction business, and I formed a really great relationship with my bosses there. The job was ok, although I was tasked with doing a lot of menial stuff that other managers didn't have time for, so a lot of busy work was laid on me. The pay was also a bit lower than desired. However, my boss there called me back today and asked what my summer plans were and said I was welcome to come back and intern again. He also mentioned being flexible on pay since it would be my second internship there. The problem is I really want to graduate as soon as possible and was planning on taking classes this summer so I could get out by next Spring and start working full time. What do you think I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, I want to maintain good relations with this company and the bosses there because they were all great people. It's also a great starting place for me to get management experience, and I know they pay project managers well. I think if I did a second internship there I would be a lock to get a full time job after I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand it's not like I'm going to be making a ton of money as an intern and the job itself is really tedious, plus I'd be delaying my graduation and I already have the one term of internship on my resume amongst other things. I'm just stuck in this dilemma. Do you think that if I turn down this second internship with the company they will think less of me and I will be hurting my chances of getting a job there in the future?"

I decided to post in this sub since the topic I will be addressing is not going to be fully location specific.

I am about to finish my 2nd year in London studying Computer Science and currently interviewing some startups for intern &amp; junior positions on AI performance, data science and machine learning. I like studying, research and particularly the university environment and thinking to extend my studies by doing a Master's degree. My grades are good and I would be eligible to apply for top universities such as Oxbridge etc. On a side note; BSc degree here in the UK is 3 years and MSc is 1 year.

However, I don't want to study MSc Advanced Computer Science and besides Cambridge doesn't even have the programme itself as far as I am aware. My primary reason for studying on this occasion would be learning different things related to my degree, boosting my career opportunities and broaden my horizons. I am good with numbers, interested in fintech and machine learning just like I said, so a degree in finance area might help me for example. Additionally, a lot of data people here tend to study MSc Psychology and I have no clear picture of why.

In summary, what would be the areas &amp; courses that help me to achieve my interests in this matter? Or what are the popular areas that compsci students prefer to study after their degree? Should I go with Data Science instead?

Responses are deeply appreciated. Thanks a lot.

My conflict:

I'm interested, long-term, in working in industry (but I'm relatively undecided). The web dev internship seems like it might be much better for building the right kind of resume. Am I overthinking this? Will either position be a perfectly good learning experience, or should I make a decision based on the field I want to work in.

Furthermore -if its best to take the Web Dev role, how harmful to my reputation with my professor/the CS department at the University could it be to reject this offer that already has wheels in motion?

I'm currently attending at well-regarded private university getting a double major in both CS and Stats. I have a good internship lined up and am on course to graduate April 2020. Today an internal recruiter from a FANG contacted me about internships for Fall, Winter and summer 2020.

If I am accepted for that internship either F/W I'd only be able to graduate with my CS degree and a stats minor simply by how some required capstone classes are scheduled. (unless I stick around another year which I don't want to do.)

Between various scholarships I have nearly a full ride so an extra semester wouldn't mean debt. My first internship was with a FANG-esque company known for their creative software and my upcoming summer one is with a mature fintech startup, both working with data engineering work. Long term I'd like to end up in data science so some more statistics could help but I don't know if 3 internships could start me off on a better trajectory.

Given the option, doing the internship after I graduate would be nice but I suspect they'd just want to start full-time hiring then.

beqywm,38,2019-04-18,"Had a very rude job interview with an HR person, should I complain about it to her superiors?[Europe]",[deleted],AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/beqywm/had_a_very_rude_job_interview_with_an_hr_person/,"Hi everyone, I had a really bad job interview experience today and wanted to ask what(if anything) should I do about it.

Some backstory - I(let's call me Tom) live in a small-medium European country, in our capital city. I am currently studying in a university. For the past few months, I had an interest in Human Resources and even did a voluntary internship in one of the larger corporations here(employing 1,5k people) at an HR department. Anyway, after that, I started searching for starting, permanent HR positions and found one company that was looking for an HR assistant, didn't require almost any experience and even noted that it is possible to balance work and studies there. The company hiring isn't so big - less than 100 employees.

So I went to the interview today. I came early while the hiring HR person came a few minutes late, visibly not happy and tells me ""I didn't expect you would come here, you didn't reply to my email on Monday that you will arrive"". I informed her that I did, in fact, reply. She just said no and I said well, maybe the email didn't send or some other problem occurred and continued.(I checked my email after the interview, I did sent a reply that I will be coming on the time she suggested and replied 20 mins after she wrote me, well withing working hours - in the morning)

Then the whole interview she kept either a smirk on her face, was visibly disinterested in what I'm saying(looking out the window or into the lobby) or just looked at me stone faced like I'm the stupidest person in the world. She continued to add sarcastic comments or silly questions to everything I answer as if I said something very idiotic. A few examples:

1. She asked me ""what are some of your hobbies or interests?"". I said ""Well, since I am currently studying political science, of course politics is an interest of mine. Other than that, I am interested in history very much"". Then she asked me a question, which dumbfounded me quite a bit, in her sarcastic tone : ""How does an interest in history manifest itself?"". Seemed such a silly question, I just replied I like to read history books.
2. She asked me ""what do you think are the biggest challenges HR face nowadays?"". I said ""Well, as you said, HR covers many topics. But if I were to talk about recruitment, which interests me the most, I would say probably finding the right candidate."" She then asked ""How would you, as an assistant or HR overall would tackle this problem?"". And I said ""Well, I think that if a company wants to get the right candidate, it needs more people to apply for their positions. So I would probably suggest increasing the companies notability in job market sites, advertise itself more on that topic. Even the company I did an internship at(a big and well known corporation, that is very important in my country) had problems finding IT specialists"". Then she says, sarcastically, ""So (company I worked for) didn't find any employees, because people didn't know it exists?"". I answered her that no, that's not at all what I said. The company is well known, I just meant that if a company wants more candidates to apply and find better employees, it needs to make her job ads more seen and known.
3. End of interview, she tells me ""Well, Tom, you see. In this company, we hire the smartest and best people in our country to do consultations. They are very intelligent and always ask a lot of questions and we need someone who is friendly and pleasant. I don't think you would fit for this position and also find you kind of shy. What do you think about it?"". I just said ""Well, it's your opinion and you're the one making the choice.""

Other things happened, like laughing a bit when I said I wanted an office job and saying all jobs are office jobs; explained the duties she has as an HR while noting, that the company I had an internship at doesn't do anything like that, because it's a large, rigid corporation(all the duties she said and more were done by my HR department there); laughed and looked at me like an idiot for asking, when I asked if this position I'm applying to new or are you looking for a replacement? She just said ""I'm the only HR here"", then a bit later stated that it is indeed a replacement.
And many more moments.

The interview was, according to the letter she sent me, supposed to last 2 hours. It lasted around 25mins and is the worst and most mean experience I've had so far in job interviews, including all the ones I observed during my internship. 

A few of my friends and family are suggesting I should write a complaint to her superiors about the whole situation. I am seriously considering it, but at the same time, I'm trying to look how it would seem from other people's perspective. Someone, who had a bad interview writes a letter complaining about the person who was hiring them and can't really provide any proof(apart from the emails) about it all. I don't care about the well-being of their company or anything like that, neither do I really care what happens to that HR person afterwards. I just feel insulted and wouldn't want anyone else to have this sort of experience. So I just want to ask: is it worth it to write a complaint and should I do it? Or maybe I am just overreacting?

The atmosphere is great, my co-workers are great, I've been able to take on some bigger projects with the mentorship of my superiors. My issues are the following:

* My day-to-day tasks are exactly what I was doing during my internship
* I've been passed over for one “job opening” / promotion opportunity here. I put my name in for another one but I know they've been actively interviewing others... so chances are kind of low.
* I feel like the bigger projects I've taken on and succeeded in haven't really been recognized? I'm trying to show I'm capable of doing more and I could grow in a role that would allow me the room to do so... but I've gotten no signals about role advancement from my superiors.
* My hours are 2-10 p.m.—I've gotten used to it now but boy, would I love to have normal hours!
* I'm certain I'm being underpaid. My union rep approached me and was asking about my income (he wasn't aware I was being paid hourly and was shocked when I told him what my post-tax income is)
* I've been approached by another company about a new position they're creating and they wanted to gauge my interest in it. I'm kind of cold on the offer but, I think it's kind of telling if another company is trying to poach me at this point?

I just need some kind of advice on where to go next. Do I...

* Wait until my one-year mark and apply to other jobs?
* Try and talk to my superiors about a raise / role advancement?
* Drop the promotion hopes and just ask for more money / a normal time schedule?

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

Computer Engineering Major,DinahHamza07,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/betd3o/high_school_senior_here_pros_v_cons_of_ucf/,"Hello everyone! I’m a high school senior and I have less than two weeks to decide a college (May 1st). I have 3 options right now:

- Boston University

- University of Florida (Summer B) 

- University of Central Florida 


I know the most prestige school is BU, but it is very expensive. I got a part scholarship from them, but it is still 3x the amount  of UF/UCF. I may transfer out tho, I don’t know.  


UF is considered the best college in Florida. I know it has a great engineering program and I got a full ride. However, I’ve been hearing UCF’s engineering programs are doing extremely well now. The EXCEL program and specifically their Computer Engineering department is great. I got a full ride too and they are paying me to go.

I did hear that internship opportunities are 100x better in UCF than UF considering its Orlando vs Gainesville.

I also do want a full college experience by joining a fraternity, the party scene, and tailgates. I expect both colleges have that, but can you guys go into more detail about it.

What do you guys think I should do?"

I luckily had parents and friends to stop me from going with them. 

So, in that time I have filled hundreds of applications to companies across the US from LinkedIn, indeed, dice, and Glassdoor. The most I've gotten were hackerrank questions in which I passed the questions 100% but didn't get a call back. 

In this time of 4 months, I found out that ""entry level"" is a BS term that has no requirements on ANY site and Revature is polluting the pool with 100's of outright spam opening with the same body and filled in for all major cities in the US making **jr. or entry level** impossible to sort out recently. I avoid the monolithic names w/ 1000's of applications and focus on the small companies.

So, is there any hope for me to find a job since regular graduation is coming up and there is usually more jobs to apply for, or is the market in a downward spire and the only hope is to go to Revature or equivalent, get experience or a job, then get to the wide open mid-level market that can't fill positions fast enough? 

Should i also look into big tech-adjacent companies like banks, insurers, etc., or the sub 500 employee businesses?"

beuu0f,1,2019-04-18,Am I making a mistake accepting a job too good for me?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/beuu0f/am_i_making_a_mistake_accepting_a_job_too_good/,"Background: After undergraduate graduation, I decided to follow the sage advice of my professors and get an MBA from my mid-tier college. I had done my B.A  international business, and although it was a great major to study, it did not come with a lot of practicality. I was pretty far behind in financial knowledge and decided that the MBA would not only help my career prospects but also help me get started in the field I want to chase, financial analytics/forecasting. I think my MBA has done this, but there were likely many cheaper ways to do this, and I was an idiot following the advice of other blindly and backing myself into a corner with debt and having entered the workplace later then I should have. I cannot say enough how much I understand the mistakes that I have made, how I should not have done the MBA and the fact that I will likely have t start were an entry-level worker would. I have taken on a LOT of anxiety and stress behind, considering I already have issues on that front, it is gotten to the point that If I dwell on it any longer, I am probably going to jump off a bridge.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have given me a golden opportunity to live at home with no expenses, not even food, so I am ultra-focused on putting as much of my salary as much possible towards these loans. I have about 61k, yes I know I am an idiot and yes they a lot of investments which I did not have to take on, but if I don't take this on as a challenge and dwell on it, I again am probably going to jump off a bridge.  That being said I have been interviewing for a job, one of the few that has been calling back and I don't know if it is a bit too over my head.   It is a start-up that is relying on selling proprietary software to finance consumers, I won't say more than that, but what they have is very special, and I think it has a high chance of success. I was called in for a marketing associate position, since I had decided I wanted to try marketing and took an internship which was the first job/internship, that I ever Loved , so I figured to go into what I liked, regardless when I got called in I thought this was just making presentations and what not. It turns out the job thought that my MBA was more valuable then even I thought it was, to the point in there viewer that I was their premier candidate and that they would compensate me accordingly to my degree, again I expected no value out of the degree but figured if someone was going to give it, who am I to pass up money, its essential for me to emphasize they haven't given an official Offer, so maybe reality doesn't match my perception.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first interview the panel reiterated that they loved my resume, education, and talent and we're confident it was a great fit, I thought ok good. Then we started talking about marketing plans, business plans and how to price their software. They liked the knowledge I had, even though I reiterated that the experience I had was at an educational level, they did not protest against this and said that they completely understood.  Then before my second interview, they asked for what I hypothetically thought a year marketing plan should be, which I killed since I had been doing this in my classes and needless to say they loved it and started asking me questions, a bit of grilling on the details, but needless to say they liked it. They then talked about updating their business plan, how I thought they should advertise to clients, examples of my marketing pieces. For instance, they wanted me to estimate the time for a website to ""go live,"" and what marketing metrics they should be measured by, I learned a lot during my internship and a lot during my MBA, but am I the person to trust this for a whole company? I sort had to guess and put down my answers to these questions, which again I tried to emphasize where from my blog and studies but they did not seem fazed by it. They had been wondering about my financial knowledge because they had mentioned me being the liaison for the company to their accountants and financial planners.  This is sort of where the problem lies. I think in the process of talking myself up I don't know if I have raised expectations to the point where I cannot reach them. I again reiterated that most of what they are asking me to do, I had done but at an academic level, but not necessarily at a workplace, that I was confident in my ability to do the work but that they also had to decide whether I would be capable. I had thought about telling them that it's going to be a learning process and that I don't know everything, but I thought if I was back for a 2nd interview and they want me in for a third, this is something they should know right? They had mentioned growing very quickly, and I don't want to stumble out of the gate when starting. I am confident in doing what they asked but are they thinking too highly me? I have a severe amount of imposter syndrome which is eating me up. So a few questions:

1. Should I emphasize that my knowledge is at an academic level? Would it be a mistake for me to take this job offer even though it seems like phenomenal experience, would it be worth the risk of being let go for being too overwhelmed with what I was trusted with. I don't know how to bring this up again without looking like I am paranoid to which they would probably not offer a job at that point
2. Is a start a good or bad idea for a new worker? I think its a great opportunity, but it is in the suburbs, and maybe it is better for me to work an established financial institution and to be in the hub, new york city, is this right?
3. It seems like I would be able to work on a lot of things and a lot of essential aspects of their business as well, is the experience worth the stress or risk that I am taking on?
4. Is there any truth to the ""fake it until you make it? Can I learn and learn to do any information gaps or gaps n what I do not know while I am working for this company? Is this company trusting me with too much? I have had several internships in finance/marketing along with my seemingly useless MBA, but it that enough to trust me with this? I feel like I am not good enough and feel a bit out of place.
5. What do I do now? I have another interview next week, along with some writing examples to send this week, but the process is starting to wrap up, so I play this situation out, obviously if I am not offered the job the decision has been made for me, but what if they offer the job?
6. Am I overthinking this? Am I overstressing this, I think it is probably a possibility that they don't expect me to be able to do this, but are testing the limitations of my knowledge, especially considering they really liked my MBA, even though as I have said I did not think it had much value, no before you ask this isn't a top 20 school. I feel as though the startup will give a lot of room to grow and think that maybe in this environment I will find my role and place as the process moves along, am I right or wrong about this?

I am freaking out about this, not considering stressing about student loans, being able to find a job at all before graduation, disappointing parents, my demons, but this is at least beginning to attempt to solve these problems, I will take care of everything in good time, but for now those who can help me out, you can be a lifesaver and guidance for me, I am thinking about saying screw it and thinking about calling my finance recruiter to see what he can help with, since the days until graduation is getting down to a few weeks, so I really need it I promise."

I’m currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science and have been looking for an internship for awhile now. With how late it is, I decided to fall back on my last option which was a Summer IT position at the School Corporation in my home town. Even though IT isn’t what I want to go into, I figured this would look better than working a typical summer job. Also, this is not glamorous in any way and would really just be re-imaging laptops; I would obviously spin that to sound better on a resume. At the same time, I got a call from my employer last summer who offered me a raise to come back and help him this year. He offered me $17/hr at 40 hrs a week while the IT position is $9.00/hr and 30 hrs a week. This is obviously quite a big difference and if anyone understands what it’s like to be a broke college kid, going into debt by the minute, an extra $8.00 an hour (and more hours) adds up huge and could make a big difference in my financial situation. But an internship after my Sophomore year could look very good even though it was really just re-imaging student laptops all summer. Any advice from people working in the industry would be awesome! Do you think 2 “internships” would look that much better than 1 when looking for a job? Or would it be THAT much easier to find one as a junior if I had done the IT position?"

I never am able to make the small connections that allow one to build the solution with less work than brute force. Like for mergesort, I would have never thought of the fact that it is easy to merge 2 sorted arrays or that a single element array is, by default, considered sorted. 

I understand that things like Strassen are inherently confusing, my textbook says that it's unclear how Strassen himself came up with it. I don't expect to be doing brilliant things like that, but I'd like to be able to understand my homework assignments.

I'm running into problems doing really basic Divide and Conquer things like ""Median of 2 sorted arrays in O(log n)"". I give my best effort, attend every class and study afterwards. But I never seem to see the light before we move on to something even harder, or really ever.

I'm doing really well in other ""weird"" CS classes like Automata, but Algorithms is REALLY sticking it to me. I'm worried I'm going to fail this class and we are only 3 weeks in.

I feel like it would be a huge waste to quit after having studied 2 years of CS and done well, but at the same time I'm well aware that these are the skills crucial for internships and interviews, and it feels like something that other people just GET. I also really enjoy programming in general.

I've developed data structures consisting of dynamic arrays, circular arrays, stacks, and queues. I've developed some algorithms the one I'm most proud of was developing a red black tree. I'm pretty confident with handling memory and treating structures as a way of (sort of) treating C as object oriented.

I have an interview for an internship next week that is unpaid however they mentioned there was potential for money if I could work in .NET and C#. I've looked into the differences of C++ and C# and the only thing I could really find was..

C++:
     Becomes more object oriented with classes
     Uses namespace (I think I understand this but not quite sure)
     ... Couldn't really find much else

C#:
     Much more object oriented?
     Still uses namespace
     Constructors, private and public variables
     In the .NET case uses .NET as a large library?
     ... Couldn't really find much else

I feel like there has to be much more to these languages that differ from C but I couldnt find very much. I'd like to go into this interview saying I could definitely make the transition but I have doubts I've missed something. So that's my question. What have I most certainly missed? Is it reasonable to be able to convince this company I can use C# without any actual experience with C# with confident C capabilites?

Apologies for format I'm on my phone"

Until yesterday, a company sent me a rejection email and say that despite I have a good CS background and I was able to solve coding questions in a short amount of time, it was hard for interviewers to understand what I expressed.  That really hit me because now I realized in the past interviews, I also had hard times expressing my ideas... I felt like the only thing that stops me from getting an offer is because of my explaining skills... cuz I can easily solve any coding questions (hard lc is not a problem for me, since I have been doing competitive programming for 4 years). Did anyone have problems like me and how you got better?

Edit: Thank you guys for the replies... Yeah I guess communication skill is a problem and I think the best way to improve it is practicing more by talking to myself or explaining to my friends."

Except I keep hearing from people that “CS majors have no free time”, “super competitive and cutthroat”, “spending all their time studying and doing nothing else”. 

I’m coming into UIUC with ~45-50 credits from AP and dual enrollment. I talked to my academic advisor as to only take one reaaaally hard course (like CS374) per semester. I’ll be starting at Linear Algebra. 

Now, since May 1 is so close I’m basically just getting anxiety about how difficult CS at UIUC is. Can someone please please provide me their insight on the following: 
1. Each year (since the later yrs get harder), how many hours per day do you study? How much time do you spend in class? 
2. How many hours of free time per week or day on average? 
3. To land good internships or jobs how much better than your peers do you have to be? 
4. I want to have a really enriching college experience and there are a few hobbies I have that my parents didn’t let me pursue in high school. So how many RSOs on average is an outgoing and high achieving CS kid involved in?
5. How is social life? 

I understand that these are subjective, but I’d really appreciate any responses and maybe some reasoning. So many people say “it’s what you make” and I get it that it’s true, but I also would really like to hear your own experience. Deciding college is so so stressful and this would be a huge help.

bf0vq6,1,2019-04-19,NEED HELP to decide my university,Manan-Abbott,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bf0vq6/need_help_to_decide_my_university/,"I am an international student from India.

And I have narrowed my choices to UW Madison and UMass Amherst for Computer Science. I got into college of letters and science at UW Madison (Madison doesn't do direct to major it gives general to everyone) and got into college of Information and Computer Science at UMass Amherst (basically didn't got into CS).

I got a 14K per year scholarship at UMass Amherst which brings the cost of attendance for UMass to 38K per year.

And cost of attendance for UW Madison is 54K a year.

So is it worth to go to Madison and pay 16,000 dollars every year?

Although my parents could afford paying for UW Madison but if it is not worth the extra 16 grand then I don't wanna spend their hard earned money for just a slight advantage.

Please while making your decision give an emphasis to these factors as well ranking, social life, job and internship opportunities, climate, etc.

thank you in advance"
bf0wuc,148,2019-04-19,How to stop being nervous about volunteering and internships?,HiMyNameisJohnD,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bf0wuc/how_to_stop_being_nervous_about_volunteering_and/,Hi! I’ve been out of college for about 2 years. I’ve been working retail for a while and I’m starting to volunteer and intern at the local mental health hospital  and local medical library to get my foot in the door and to gain some experience. I start volunteering next monday and I am super nervous. I’ve always heard the best way to become a medical  librarian is gaining volunteer experience. I already met with the manager of the department I would be working in and he said I would be a good fit with staff and patients as a volunteer but I am still super nervous. I am fine doing menial tasks to help staff but dealing with patients I am nervous about. How do I approach them? I always feel super awkward going up to people and start talking to them and I know that’s what I’m going to do when volunteering but I am so awkward and I’m worried I will say the wrong thing or offending someone. Since these are mental patients I really don’t want to say the wrong thing and make them upset. Any tips on volunteering or how to not be nervous?? Like I’m very excited for this opportunity but I also feel like I’m going to be sick and I just want to hide in bed all day. Any advice would be amazing thank you.

bf162o,5,2019-04-19,How to land Programming job,FlexKami,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bf162o/how_to_land_programming_job/,"Greetings all, I'm a desperate college grad dying to land that first coding job. I wasn't able to get any internships in college so I don't have any hands on experience. Each passing year that goes by I forget less of what I learned in class. I really can't afford to mess around on these websites that offer programming solutions without any compensation. I feel like all of my other peers were able to integrate into their first job with no difficulty. I make it to the in person interviews and then never hear back from the applied company. 

Anytime I apply for any other type of computer/IT based job I always get offers yet for some reason no avail regarding the field I went to school for. Whenever I reach out to other minorities in the field they offer no help or solutions. I thought tech fields were trying to diversify?

At this point I feel like I'm never going to get into the field and should just pursue something else.

I apologize for the long whiny post but part of this is me ranting and venting my frustrations as a black programmer."
bf2hpp,4,2019-04-19,What would you say are the weakest parts of my application? What should I be concerned about?,thegreatman212,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bf2hpp/what_would_you_say_are_the_weakest_parts_of_my/,"Hey everyone. I'm a Junior right now at a middle- to high-end public school in Connecticut. I will most likely be applying as a physics major, math major, or a math/physics double major, though an engineering major is still in the running.

I am a white upper-middle class male, so I have essentially a 0% chance of getting any need based money. However, I don't exactly have a large college savings built up, so right now I am more concerned with achieving a merit scholarship at a decent school than just barely getting in at a T20. UConn has the Nutmeg/Stamps Scholarships and BU has the Trustee Scholarship as particular interests of mine, for example. Of course, I would absolutely love to get into a T20 too, though!

Stats:

SAT - 1490 (690/800)

* I have a pending score for the SAT School Day in early April, but I'm 99% sure my score decreased. I somehow got 4 math questions wrong on the real thing despite getting none wrong on the practice test I took the night before, and I have no reason to think I did better on EBRW. If it wasn't for score choice I would have cancelled the score.

* I've only taken the SAT twice, so with studying I could probably pump this up a little bit more, but there is a nearing cap.

* Might as well mention that I missed National Merit Semifinalist, though it seems I will get commemorated at least (no idea if that means anything).

GPA - 4.00 (on traditional 4.00 scale) / 4.223 (on 4.33 scale my school uses)

* No APs Fresh/Soph year, 4 APs Junior year, 4 (planned) APs Senior year. Junior year: APUSH, AP Lang, AP Calc BC, AP Chem. Senior Year: AP Gov, AP Econ, AP CSA, AP Physics C.

Subject Tests - 800 Physics / 800 Math 2. I could take the Chem and World History subject tests and most likely score very high, though I haven't registered yet, and have no idea if they'd help in any real way.

ECs:

* No employment / internship (RIP)

* Science Bowl for Sophomore year on. My team scored 3rd out of 32 in regionals. I was the math and physics specialty.

* (Presumably) joining school's math team Senior year, though we are complete trash, I hear. Wish I could answer as to why I didn't join earlier.

* (Highly informal) math tutoring I could talk about. Never a night goes by I don't help someone, or usually several people, with math homework. Unfortunately, there is no concrete record of this, as it is just informal Discord/SMS texts. Also no hours to estimate.

* 20 hours volunteering at school store Freshman year (lol)

* Made it past locals in Chem Olympiad; I'm likely to get raped in nationals, though.

* The Biggie: mathematics. As I rising Junior I studied Pre-Calc over the summer on my own initiative. After that I took Calc BC as a Junior, where I currently have a 100. Alongside BC I self-studied Linear Algebra from a real textbook and know it well, though I have no definitive way of proving it (common theme). Over this summer I have the opportunity to take a credit-bearing UConn online class for multivariable calculus. I'm currently looking for other credit-bearing classes in ordinary differential and partial differential equations too, and, if I find them, my goal is to complete both before heading off to college.

Particular concerns:

* While my stats and EC's are fairly decent for a typical graduating class from my HS, this year I have several friends in my grade who also have 4.00s and they all have 1550+ SATs that I don't. If schools are only going to accept one or two students from my HS, then I don't really see why it would be me instead of them.

* As seen above, I have no concrete hours for volunteering or working or interning that I could point too. It's a little wishy washy, though I have been industrious as a HS student by-and-large.

* SAT is of course a significant concern.

Sorry for this absolute monster wall of text. I'm currently dreading doing an APUSH project right now so I made sure to go into as much depth as possible.

I have approximately 6 months to improve this portfolio, so it would mean quite a bit to me to know what the strengths and weaknesses are, or, more generally, just receive advice on it. I honestly have no idea whether it is strong or weak relative to the goals I have set."

So my boss wants to make it to where a teacher goes on the distract website, clicks a link and be taken to a screen that asks what site and what class room they're in. Once they confirm their information it takes them to a list of all the items in their classroom, and all they have to do is checkbox what items they have and have a confirm screen pop up listing all the items they checked asking if they are sure this is it. Then have the form be saved as a .pdf and have it stored on a server.

See, the name is quirky and fun, and we're quirky and fun, and this whole school is qUirKy and fUn!!!)

Alright, get into this disorganized line, please, so we can hand you some free stuff! Here's a pop-socket, a t-shirt, a water bottle (if we're feeling generous), and a ~~folder to carry your papers around~~ just kidding, you don't get a folder - you can just carry all the papers you accumulate today and feel super embarrassed when they inevitably slip out of your grasp. Oh look! we even gave you some coupons for our store - spend $1000 on Universal School merch, get 69 cents off. Happy shopping!!!

Now that you've got your #swag, collect some papers please (sorry, still not giving you a folder): here's a packet detailing the many events we've got going on, here's a general info sheet about this school, here's a confusing map you won't use, and here's a ticket for lunch. Oh, what's that? You want a ticket for dinner too?? Sorry, we here at Universal School abide by a strict policy of giving admitted students some free stuff but not THAT much. It's okay, you can just have some of our delightful dining hall food for dinner anyway, for the low, low price of $14.99.

**Okay! Onto your first event.** This morning, we've got a selection of classes you can sit in on, including Advanced Calculus XVII, Spanish Level 420, A Detailed History of April 7 1689, and How To: Survive the Zombie Apocalypse 101, taught by our Nobel-Prize winning professor. Whoops, actually that last one is full - have fun learning about multivariate calculus symmetry integration for the next hour :)

**Wonderful**, now that you've learned something, take a moment to stretch your legs and join us on a tour of our wonderful campus. As we walk around, we'll be careful to avoid the 95% of campus that's awful and focus on the one beautiful steeple/clock tower/other tall building our school is known for. Look at that! Isn't it gorgeous? Whoops, be careful not to look to your right at the decaying freshman dorms or to your left at the underfunded arts building - just keep looking straight at our beautiful clock tower. Fun fact: one night in 1987, our rival school came in the middle of the night and \*spray painted\* our clock tower in their colors!!! The next night, our students went and dumped lead paint in their water - that still happens every year because we've got such a cute friendly rivalry :)

**Next event: Q and A panel.** Here, we've gathered some of our top-notch students and faculty to give you a very skewed perception of what life at the Universal School would look like. Please, take a seat in this cramped and humid and crowded auditorium; we've turned the heat up as high as we could, so have fun nearly suffocating (it'll give you a realistic feel for the lecture halls here). So, if we could just have our panelists introduce themselves (we've got 1 AO, 2 students, 2 professors, and 1 moderator person who keeps jumping in whenever they get the chance) and we'll get right into questions!

\- Q: \[nervous parent sending first child off to college\] So, how easy is it to travel from Universal School? A: it's really, quite easy. Yes, we are located in a town with a population of 18 (including the cows), and yes the nearest airport is 1600 miles away, and yes if our college literally disappeared off the face of the earth no one would know... but yeah, it's really easy, don't worry :)

\- Q: \[uber-competitive parent from California\] Could you tell me what the internships and fellowships and job prospects are like for my child? They should make at least 150K right out of college, yes? A: Mhm, for sure, 150K minus the 0, absolutely, yes.

\- Q: \*some random smart-aleck cracks a jokey question about doing laundry or the shower situation\*

\- Q: So, what's the weather like here? I know Google \*says\* you get 983 inches of snow a year, but that's not \*really\* true, is it? Should my kid bother packing a jacket?

\*note: each and every one of these questions was on the front page of the website, but did anyone bother looking there?uh, no, I think not!\*

Okay! Let's all clap for these wonderful panelists! Thank you for giving us so much new in formation about the Universal School!

**Let's all move now to our major fair!** Here we did this really cool thing where we're holding the event in our smallest room, and we're going to pack all 700 of you in there to explore our majors! Have fun! It's going to be loud and crowded, and you probably won't be able to hear yourself think. Also, there will be like 30 students at each station, so you'll be lucky to even see the person representing the major you're interested in. You will learn literally nothing about any of our majors, but you will walk out clutching about 16 papers from each of them. Nice!

**And, up next we've got our alumni panel!!!** These six alumni were hand-selected from our living alumni base of \[anywhere between 15,000 and 500,000\] as the only six that were successful and would come back and say something positive about our school. They're going to introduce themselves (5 STEM/business students and 1 inevitable art history major give brief introductions) and tell you a bit about how it is only through this, specific university that they got to where they are today! Literally, they would all be dying in a ditch, if Universal School hadn't picked them up, dusted them off, and turned them into the people they are today! Yup - it was all thanks to our wonderful programs, athletic facilities, and career services department, each of which gets \~$6 of funding per semester. Perfect, let's give a huge thank you to our wonderful alumni for coming back to this miserable town!!!

**Alright,** and for our last event, this evening we've got a really fun and unique thing planned - it's our annual dance and a cappella showcase that happened to fall RIGHT on the day when all our admitted students are here (total coincidence). This event is hosted by two students, who are reading a very pre-prepared and corny script from their phones and trying to show you how TALENTED our students are. So yeah! come look at all the talent we've got at our school; special appearances by each of our 982 different a cappella groups, including all-female, all-male, all-apache helicopter, and this one that's called Mediocrity - they're super cute and quirky because they're, like, not THAT good at singing, but they like to try and that's what matters :) See, here at the Universal School, all the matters is that you try - we're all here to support you (unless you're in engineering or CS because then 98% of you *will fail* at least half your classes in your first semester).

Okay, what a fun night! Let's give one more round of applause for Mediocrity!!! Whoo!!!

**Whelp, we're almost done.** But, quick show of hands! How many of you are committed to the Universal School? \*some hands go up, while uncommitted people look sheepishly around\* And, how many of you are going to commit after coming to VisitUS??? \*some more hands go up, while undecided people continue to look sheepishly around\* Wonderful, we can't wait to see all of you next fall!

**Well, that about wraps it up for tonight.** If you're staying overnight with a host, you can go meet them and have fun sleeping on the concrete floor while people blare music at ungodly volumes in the room next door :)"

I'm confident in my interviewing abilities, it's just difficult to get interviews in the first place at banks. The offer expires in a week and if I accepted it, I'd continue interviewing at IBs. If I were to get a good IB offer I would want to accept it and renege the S&amp;T. Is it better to do that or just deny the offer and keep recruiting in IB? I am weighing the upside of getting an IB job which will open up avenues or the downside of reneging.

I’m a young IT Professional (23) and have been in the field now for about a year and a little over half in the Seattle area. I learned computer repair and even took a Digital Forensics class at my high school and managed to get credits for a local college of mine, transferring to there I had gone through the entirety of Cisco Net Academy and from that point forward I went into the intro Cyber Security classes. This college of mine is well known for its cyber security courses teaching both Digital Forensics and Ethical hacking, so I was super interested in leading into these classes. I took the Digital Forensics track which was great! I didn’t lead into the actual EC council exam because I was younger and didn’t have the confidence in myself.

Going into my Intro to network security classes I found myself completely outclassed by all my peers having at least a year of experience out in the field. At the end of that course, I was determined to get out into the field, get an IT job and then come back when I felt more experienced.

Queue the cert grind, I took about 4 months to study to the A+ and eventually by the end of the first half of 2017 I had obtained my A+ certification. Moving forward I started applying for jobs. Luckily I was able to land an internship in a help desk at a fairly large SaaS company for a year. During my time there I was lucky enough to get into the CCNA Cyber Ops Scholarship and taking full advantage of the opportunity I managed to obtain CCNA Cyberops by the end of summer in 2018. During my internship I learned programs/platforms/best practices such as Jira, Confluence,Office 365, Brivo on Air, CUCM, Okta Administration, Malware triaging, asset management (asset Panda) and making really great networking connections on linked in. During this time I helped my Girlfriend achieve her GED and now she is in school for IT too!

With my internship ending and them notifying me they were not going to promote me to a System Admin position in the company that had opened up, I started looking for jobs in the area. I then managed to get a full time position at a specialty retail company’s headquarters where I would be doing IT work for their stores in house IT and luckily it was a 15 minute drive away from my school!

I’ve been in this job for about 7 months now as a T1 tech for them on a 34k per year salary. A guy above me in a T2 position has less experience and certifications than me and is making about 40k+. In my time here I have earned my Network+ and have gone back to school to finish out my info sec classes and get closer to finishing out 2 Associates in Technical Arts I qualify for

So we’re getting to the root of my questions. I am currently in a class to complete my Certified Ethical Hacker Certification, I will finish out both of my Associates in infosec/Networking Technology probably around spring quarter of next year. My work has my back with school and works with me a bit to attend night classes.

I feel stagnated in this job. A majority of what I do is just reboot the register computer and check various connections etc. Projects I’ve done here have been essentially building an in office help desk, guiding interns that get hired on towards certifications and interests/people they should talk to within our company. My boss told me right now my Network+ doesn’t apply to what I am doing now, and anything connectivity related is then given to the tiers above me. I had my performance review and he told me there is talks of promoting me but that doesn’t mean I will be, no raise, and overall my performance is great.

What do you guys think/suggest for me? Should I finish out school, get my CEH CCNA route/switch and move on? Should I stick it out at this company and see if I do get promoted and see where I go? We’re in a reorg and it may trickle down to me getting promoted but it’s unknown what will happen. My team lead is fairly transparent with me and tells me I’m talked about highly and should be patient as we’re a little bit of a smaller company so more unique opportunities may arise for me. The Seattle area I feel lacks the kind of mid level jr sys admin jobs that I’m looking for or maybe I should be looking other places than Indeed and Dice.

My interests and my end goal is to do tons with Networks, and cyber security. Next Generation Fire Walls, SIEM’s IDS’s IPS’s hell even a Stateless firewall fascinate me as well as generally how DNS, OSPF, BGP, EIGRP work and how to make networks better. I know I’m not going to land a job like that anytime soon but I just want to establish my interests.

I’d appreciate any guidance I can get from anyone who has been in this field for a long time. I think part of something I have to learn is to be patient but I hate feeling stagnant.

Thank you for anyone who reads this, I know it’s a long one.I've lacked a real mentor in my career to help guide me in my pursuit to become what I am aiming to be.

Tl;dr 1 1/2 year exp CCNA Cyber Ops A+ and network + certified making 34k a year in school right now will finish with Cybersecurity associates and Networking associates in spring of next year. What do to land a more network focused security/networking based jobs other than obtaining a CCNA route switch/or general advice for the level I’m at at the moment"

1. Complete the FCC JavaScript course

2. Attempt building basic web apps to slap on my resume

3. Learn basic DS + Algos for technical interviews

Does my plan seem realistic in this time frame, and is there anything I'm missing? Any advice / critique on my mindset or approach are appreciated."

I'm a current senior from a T10 uni majoring in CS and Bio. My grades and projects have been strong through undergrad (3.9+, publications in review), and I've turned down internships throughout UG to focus on my research. I'm currently planning to take 1-2 years after graduation for research before applying to MD-PhD programs with the intent of doing a PhD in CS.

My ideal career would be one where I get to bridge medicine and tech - either in academia as a lead investigator/researcher or in industry. I look at some of the work that Google AI's Healthcare group does and can see myself working on similar problems for the rest of my life.

My question is - do y'all think that the MD-PhD makes sense given my career interests? And if not, what would be a better path to get to where I want to be?

Thanks!!"

So I have a dilemma. I signed on with company A, a Fortune 10 company, last year for full time after my masters in CS that should start in September. After a few months, I found out that I wouldnt be doing exactly what I interviewed for but there is a *promise that I will at some point. I recently found out that I also received an internship offer with company B doing exactly what I want that lasts from May to August. 

The thing is, when I signed on with Company A, I thought I would graduate in August but it turns out I am finishing in May. 

Is it alright if I do this internship and then go full time with Company A after? Would this be perceived as lying to company A on the basis on when I actually finished school? 

Should I contact company A and tell them I am graduating early but would like to keep our deal of starting in September?"

Option B would be to take CS70 over summer (need an A-) and full on declare CS. Over summer, I would also work part-time at my previous internship (DS related, but not SE) or potentially find a part-time SWE position. Keep in mind I am a rising senior who has done well in Stat140 and CS188, so hopefully a decent amount of the material will be familiar. Not sure what the best course of action is, both short-term (FAANG  / Quant Full-Time Offers) but also long-term.

bf54di,402,2019-04-19,Let go from first Junior developer role after 2 months,brovrt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bf54di/let_go_from_first_junior_developer_role_after_2/,"TLDR: Got a job as a junior dev,  after 2 months, got told  I was not a good fit for the company and they should have hired a senior dev instead

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna try to keep this short while encapsulating all the relevant details, but basically what has happened is that I applied to an ""intermediate developer"" role, passed the two interviews and the take-home project and joined the Start-Up as their first ""Junior"" developer.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 1 of 2 of the developers working on the Web App, ( we have an iOS and an Android team, though they don't know anything web dev related). The senior developer works remotely, comes in once a week for the weekly dev meetings and spends an hour with me regarding any questions I had about the code base.

&amp;#x200B;

In my second week there, I was tasked replicating one of the features from the iOS platform. Which is basically reading and writing from the database. This took me roughly 2-3 weeks just to get the reading/displaying/filtering done. I don't think they were expecting me to take this long, there was already another feature in the pipeline that I had to build.  Things weren't looking good, I was super stressed, not sleeping well because of the stress, not getting the guidance I had hoped, and all-around shit show for my mental state and my growth as a developer.  We ended up parking the feature I was working on, and released what I had into production ( which was just the reading and displaying) and moved onto the next feature I was tasked with.

&amp;#x200B;

On Thursday we had our weekly dev meeting, which was also the end of the sprint, I guess they were expecting me to finish that feature, which I haven't, they asked me how long I would be, I said maybe a few days, not sure...I'll work on it on the weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day the CEO pulled me into a separate room and asked how I was etc. I gave him the full rundown, stressed, frustrated, not getting much guidance from the senior dev etc. He agreed with all my points and said it's unfortunate that that's how things turned out, goes on to say that they tried to get the senior dev to be more helpful but he wasn't really willing to give the help I needed. He went on to say that they don't really have the resources to provide the guidance I need and that they should have hired a senior dev instead of a junior, because they're a startup with limited resources things need to be moving a lot faster etc He said he would provide a positive reference and will help wherever he can (regarding my job applications).

&amp;#x200B;

In a way, I'm kinda relieved that I get to look for another job, I was super stressed, before and after work..not getting much sleep, and not learning as much as I thought I would. I'm not really sure where to go from here though...Do I list this as experience on my CV? What do I say about why I was only there for 2 months? Do I still work during the weekend like I said I would?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Really appreciate all the kind words and advice, also knowing that other developers have faced similar circumstances also gives me solace that I'm not the only one to experience this..I'm gonna have a word with the CEO, and see if we can maybe come to an agreement to maybe framing my time there as an internship."
bf57l3,8,2019-04-19,A Southern Exorcism,JeSuisleSerpent,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bf57l3/a_southern_exorcism/,"
There is an area in the southern United States you may have heard of recently. A frontline in a battle between politics and culture. The Rio Grande Valley has been the forefront of many news stories over the last few years as the culmination of the immigration crisis. Politicians pool in from every corner of the country to make their case for one party or another. An entire nation, divided over an area they’ve never visited, and over a culture of people they will never truly 

understand. That’s the thing though… There are things about the Rio Grande Valley that no one will ever truly understand. Mysteries that span the thresholds of the supernatural. Ancient lore that for a long time, in my childhood along the border, I believed to be simple ghost stories. We were all wear aware of “La Llorona” that haunted the banks of the Rio Grande River. The Chupacabra that stalks the countryside along the border and the malevolent “lechusa” with wings spanning wide, preying on innocent children as the animal form that witches take to hide themselves in the shadows. These are the legends that we dare mention, because they provide a front that is a little easier to stomach than the dark realities of the Valley.
 
I began uncovering the true nature of the valley’s mysteries when I started an internship with the Diocese of Brownsville. Mexico, being a catholic country, is heavily influenced by catholic traditions… but where there is good, evil will always follow. This leads us to the cartel violence that has been Mexico’s plight for decades. Gangs that make their money smuggling drugs across the world. Of course, these gang leaders like to consider themselves Catholic as well, and wouldn’t dare break that tradition—but smuggling drugs and violently murdering their enemies are not exactly tenants of catholic Doctrine, so they turn to darker entities. False saints that are willing to answer their prayers… usually for a price. Many have called them angels of death, allowing the violence to spread as it grants them more souls to carry over into the afterlife. Many consider them demons in disguise, luring the sinners of the region into lives of crime by granting them money and success. I was never quite sure, myself, until the Diocese began receiving reports of Demonic Obsession along the border.
 
Every Dioceses, you see, has a designated exorcist. One priest who is trained in the ancient rite and is given the tools necessary by the Vatican to proceed with the rite, should the need arise. For the Diocese of Brownsville, this was Father Gregory Zapata. He was an older man, who was rarely seen in his clerical clothing. When I first met him he was wearing khaki cargo shorts and a white button-up shirt. He was a bit frantic because his pet dog had been missing for a few hours and he cared for that dog dearly. I still remember driving into the old parish on the outskirts of Brownsville, Texas. It was considered one of the poorest areas in the region, if not the state. 

Parishioners waited in lines, sifting through donated boxes of old cucumbers; a view that reminded me of old historical pictures of revolutionary Cuba. This was, for many of them, their only source of food. We were called there that evening because Father Greg had been leading a fundraising program for the area, and we were to present his parish with a check, and congratulate them on their capacity to raise so much, considering they had so little. I was truly proud of these people who lived devoutly by their faith. Father Greg met us at the church steps and walked us into his office alongside his deacon. “We’re so happy to have you both here,” he said- almost nonchalantly. He was a man of few words, who seemed perpetually tired. Almost as if he had been through war, and the light of life had left his eyes. “The parish is so excited to meet you both. We rarely get visitors from the Dioceses and they worked hard to raise this money. It is going to me a ngreat deal to them.”
 
“It’s our pleasure,” I said, awkwardly, being escorted down the narrow corridor into his study. I had been at this job for a while, and these meetings had grown more and more mundane, but there was something exciting about meeting Father Greg considering his reputation. The meeting continued on, discussing the success of his fundraiser and what other parishes could do to parallel that success. It couldn’t have been more than half an hour into the discussion when a knock was heard at the door. An elderly nun opened the door and peeked her head in, her hands trembling as they reached in to fetch Father Greg’s attention. “Father… I am afraid you are needed in the parish courtyard. It is… urgent.” She said. Father Greg stared at us with concerned eyes and then gestured to the sister that he would attend to her in a moment. “I apologize gentlemen. I’m afraid this cannot wait. Is there any way that we can reschedule?”
 
“Father”- I muttered, as quickly as I could. “The trip out here to the outskirts of the Diocese was very long, and making it again, with our schedule, will be unlikely…” “Very well,” he said, reluctantly. “I trust you have both been confirmed? Been to confession regularly, and made your penances?” My colleague and I both nodded and he gestured that we should follow him.
 
There was a chill in the air outside his study. A stillness that I hadn’t noticed on my way in. When we reached the courtyard entrance I noticed that the brightness of the south Texas sun wasn’t piercing through the stained glass windows. A cool overcast had consumed the outside world. In the far end of the courtyard, a group of nuns huddled praying the rosary around a figure on the ground, the details of which I could not quite make out at the time. “Neither of you suffer from weak stomachs?” Father asked. “I don’t.” I said, although admittedly I knew I was quick to get queasy.
 
As we reached the huddle of nuns, they cleared a path for father. On the ground was a young boy, around six or seven, who had fainted on the ground. His skin was pale, and had it not been for his rapid breathing I might have thought him dead. I noticed Father perform the sign of the cross through the corner of my eye and pull out a small coin from his pocket. In silence, the sisters turned the boy onto his side and pulled the collar of his shirt down to reveal what seemed to be a burn or a deep bruise on his left shoulder… the skin on the darkened patch of skin pulled up around its edges. “You may want to avert your eyes,” Father said. I didn’t. As I looked closer I recognized the wound as an inverted pentagram. A five pointed star burned deep into the boy’s skin, almost as if he had been branded. “Dear God…” I whispered under my breath. “We are still on hallowed ground. It isn’t too late.” Father said with an odd calmness. “Alright. Tell me everything you know.” He demanded from the nun who had come to retrieve him. “His name is Federico Mora, Father. He is a new altar boy, and was likely exploring the parish. He was only on the parish grounds for about an hour or so.” “Poor child.” Father said, words that seemed all too familiar to him. “Father- there is one more thing… His mother claims that the boy has been suffering night terrors as of late. Visions in his sleep. She claims the boy was frightened recently by a figure he found along the riverbank.” “A figure?” Father asked… “A figure of what?”
 
“La Santisima Muerte.”
 
My heart began to pound at the very mention of the deity. La Santisima Muerte was a dark being. A demonic force in disguise as the angel of death. A saint that criminals could pray to ensure their shipments and heists would go according to plan. She was a Goddess to the cartels, but to the faithful, a vengeful demon, plaguing the area, taking lives just like the people who worshiped her.
 
“Then we don’t have a lot of time.” Father urged. “Take the boy to the parish shelter, lay him on the bed. Bring me the holy rite, a bowl of water and my stole- as for you two,” he said, looking directly at my colleague and me, I’m afraid I’ll need your help.
 
Speechless, we rushed to the parish shelter where the boy was laying in violent convulsions, a cold sweat running down his face. “The demon knows what is coming” Father said, kissing his stole and placing it over his neck. “I am going to begin the rite- As I recite it, repeat to me only those lines from the Lord’s Prayer. Do you understand?” I stayed in silent shock, watching the boy shake ever more violently. “I SAID DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!” “YES” I screamed. “Very well. Let’s get started.” He anointed the boys head with oils. Placed a coin marked with the emblem of St. Benedict on his head… and began to pray. “PAX” he said, as the coin touched the boy’s forehead.
 
The room seemed to go silent at his utterance and suddenly, the boys eyes opened wide. Dark and dilated, they were not the kind eyes of a seven year old boy. “Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti- Crux Sacra Sit Mihi Lux!” Father continued to read… the boy growing more and more violent. Six sisters restraining him to the bed he laid in. Father continued:”Non Draco Sit Mihi Dux! VADE RETRO SATANA!” The room suddenly grew so cold that I could see my breath leave my mouth. There was an unnatural silence in the air that after a moment was broken by whispered laughter. A laughter that sounded inhuman and continued to grow louder and louder. Then, as if by an unseen force, all six of the sisters that were restraining the boy were forced into the air and across the room, each slamming into a wall, left unconscious. A drop of blood began to form on the boy’s forehead, the source of which I didn’t understand, then, as if being sliced by a knife that wasn’t there, an upside down cross was etched into the boy’s skin, dripping blood down his face.
 
The boy opened his mouth unnaturally wide, and without moving his lips, produced a voice so deep and hoarse I couldn’t imagine it coming from a smoker of fifty years. “Oh, priest… we have been watching you. Playing your little game. Entertaining your theatre of a so called rite. YOU ARE A COWARD. IT WAS US WHO CHOSE YOU.” Father stared at the boy for a moment and held his coin up high once more, continuing his prayer “Nunquam Suade Mihi Vana! Sunt Mala Quae Libas…” As he prayed these lines the boy began to convulse as if he suffered from a deep pain in his core. A guttural grunt began to leave his mouth, and a pool of blood began to form on the bed behind him, from where I stood I could see that it was coming from the brand on his hind shoulder. “Demon, Muerte Diabla, Baal, Asmodi, Leviathan and all the princes of hell. In the name of Christ and the glory of the kingdom of heaven, I demand that you leave this child of God, this place of worship, and return to the pit from whence you came. Leave this place of the living, and return to your depth as the swine of hell!” The boy began to scream in total agony, clenching onto the sheets- a dark, viscous sludge bleeding out of his mouth, his eyes rolled back into his head. Father screamed one last chant: “IPSE VENENA BIBAS!” The demon screamed in terrible agony. A voice so unnatural and loud that I could not have imagined it not being heard by the entire city. The bed and the furniture in the room began to rattle and quake and as we chanted away the Lord’s Prayer. With one last touch of the coin to the boy’s blood-soaked forehead… it stopped.


The boy fell back onto the bed, breathing normally. Father took his stole and began to cleanse the boy’s wounds with holy water. He ordered us to fetch gauze from a drawer across the room, and wrapped the boys shoulder and forehead. My colleague and I left that day assured in our faith, and shocked at the realities of the demonic forces that plagued the Rio Grande Valley. “I wish you hadn’t had to have seen that…” Father said, with a sincere sadness in his voice. “Will the boy be alright?” I asked… “Yes. These wounds are not natural. They will be healed through attention in faith.” “God bless you, Father,” I said, as I loaded my bags into my Volvo and opened the door for my colleague. “What are we going to do?” I asked my coworker and friend, as we drove out of the small barrio. “I’m not sure, he said, “I couldn’t describe what we just saw if I tried.” I stared out onto the street, lost in thought over what we had just experienced, when I noticed something strange about my colleague. A crimson red stain on his left shoulder, pooling through his jacket"
bf5dye,2,2019-04-19,Attending career fair while at a co-op?,Quinn___,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bf5dye/attending_career_fair_while_at_a_coop/,"Hey all,

I'm currently finishing up my Junior year as a CS major at a small state school.

I have an internship lined up this summer, as well as a co-op for the fall semester.

My problem is that I want to attend the career fair again this fall, mostly to talk to one of the only ""big"" companies there -- Geico, as well as a couple fortune 500 companies that have booths. I was too nervous to talk to them last time, but I think given my experience and grades and whatnot, I'll have a good shot at an interview.

My problem is, not only will my summer internship have a booth, so will my co-op. The one that I will *still be working at* on the day that this career fair happens.

I feel like it might be insulting to both companies, especially the co-op, to actively be talking to recruiters at the same career fair (and the same aisle of the career fair, at that). It would also be super weird to ask for time off of work to attend this career fair from the co-op.

What should I do here? I don't really want to skip the fair, but I don't want to burn bridges or make things awkward either."

A few months ago, I got lucky and got hired for an internship position that was described online as “software engineering”. When I got to the interview phase, I was told the job entailed testing automation and QA. Since I hadn’t had any luck with other internships, I went ahead and accepted the job.

Now that I’m here, I’m starting to realise I might enjoy QA as a full time position instead of development since I never really liked coding and building my own projects from scratch. Plus, I reason that with my QA internship experience, it’ll be much easier to get a job that’s related. 

Unfortunately, while the company I’m at right now does hire interns to full time positions, it’s very rare of them to do so. I’d have to be really good as an intern to be hired full time and I’m just mediocre. 

The internship remains until I’m no longer a student, in which case they require that you leave the company. That means I basically have this internship until the end of December, which is when I graduate.

I’m so confused! What should be my plan now? Should I apply for QA positions right around the fall? Apply for a different internship? Apply for QA positions but only when I graduate? Don’t do QA altogether?"
bf5u6g,82,2019-04-19,Passed Sec+ today!,krazymunkyman,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/bf5u6g/passed_sec_today/,"I got a 790 on the Sec+ today after a very anxious morning, where I must have walked three miles an hour before the test!  I was so nervous, that I was shaking when I sat down for the exam, especially from reading how hard the test was!

Truth is, it really wasn't that much different than the kinds of questions in Gibsons book and I was stressing over nothing!  I finished the exam with 40 minutes to go and reviewed it three times, but still had 20 minutes left.  At this point, I hit finish exam and then the damn survey began.  I think Comptia loves to make us sweat as that survey said ""Lastly...."" at least three times before I got my score.  One fist pump later, and I raised my hand for the proctor to come and let me out.

Preparation:

Darrell Gibson book is a necessity. The material covered here was the bulk of my prep and his questions really prepared me for the exam.  I read it cover to cover at least twice.
Professor Messer videos and course notes.  I probably didnt need to buy his course notes but I watched everyone of his videos and wanted to give him some support, so I bought the physical notes.  The videos really solidified the concepts learned from the GCGA book.
Dion and Meyers practice tests on Udemy.  I felt like I needed to practice the exam a ton and these helped.  The Dion tests where probably more helpful than Meyers, but I felt I needed more.
My ace in the hole.  I'm an intern for an IT security team and one of the IRT guys kind of made it his mission to help me pass.  If you have access to someone like this, take advantage of it and then buy them some good beer once you pass!  

If I can do it, with my insanely busy schedule and in roughly 6 weeks, anyone can.  You have to put in the work though!"

bf7abd,2,2019-04-19,Need help deciding between CC+transfer and SJSU,ArkBirdFTW,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bf7abd/need_help_deciding_between_cctransfer_and_sjsu/,"Hey all, I'm in a predicament right now trying to decide between attending SJSU as a Software Engineering major or attending my local CC (Diablo Valley College) and applying as a TAG transfer to Davis and retrying at selective schools like Berkeley, LA, SD etc. 

**PROS FOR SJSU**  
SJSU has a great SE program with great job placement and getting internships is not a problem either with the location. Pretty much if I want to go to college get a degree and start working at a respected company it seems like a great option.

**CONS FOR SJSU**  
SJSU as good as the job placement is just doesn't seem right. I've heard a boatload on how it's a commuter school and how social life is limited compared to traditional college where the vast majority of students live on campus. Why this bothers me is I've never had much of a social life in high school and changing that is a monumental task only made harder if those anecdotes I've read about SJSU are true. Also graduating in 4 years for an SE student appears to be a difficult task which is something I don't want to deal with. Another concern is that the school might be a job factory. I want to do research in college but not going to a UC puts a damper over those plans. SJSU has a partnership with NASA for some summer research internships but that's it. The school itself apparently doesn't do much research. Price is also a concern to me. $30k a year (including boarding) sounds insane especially when compared to some other schools. 

**PROS FOR CC**  
CC gives me a fresh start at mending the mistakes I made in HS. I can retry at some of the reaches I'd wanted to attend since middle school and the prospect of that is very intriguing. Also the TAG program seems like a gift from above honestly. It seems to good to be true. The fact that I have to get a 3.3 in some courses and I get guaranteed CS at UC Davis sounds amazing. Also pricing is significantly better.

**CONS FOR CC**  
Earlier I mentioned social life was something important to me and at CC there is basically none. Also I really fear if I end up attending CC it will just be a repeat of HS where I enter each semester in high spirits and brimming with optimism but eventually have that crushed after each test that passes slightly lowers my grade until it's something I don't want regardless of all the time I've put into it. Also I said I wanted to graduate in 4 years and if try to meet all the course requirements I may end up staying there 3 years just to meet them because of the lack of overlap in a handful of courses between some of the UCs. Also acceptance rates at schools like UCSB, SD, and LA seem even lower than the undergraduate acceptance rates so it seems the competition will not be any different in CC and I quite frankly don't know how I'll fare when looking at how I did in HS.

**TLDR**: SJSU doesn't seem appealing because of course impaction and lack of social life but it has good job placement. CC gives me fresh start and the TAG transfer is an absurdly amazing deal however I fear it might be a repeat of HS where I underperform when compared to how many hours I'm putting into the coursework.

I really want to be a doctor and my goal is to get into a top pre-med program undergrad- probably to study biology.  I feel I have a better chance at Hopkins because of the higher ED rate (30% vs 18% Penn) and I have legacy (if grad school counts lol). My top choice is probably Penn, but I like both and don't want to ""throw away"" my ED on Penn if it's too unlikely. Please let me know what I should do, if I have a good shot at either. And although we're not upper class, my parents saved a lot for college so financial aid is not a major issue. Thank you!!!

White female from #1 state public school , middle class, 11th grade, no rank but probably top 10%.

UW GPA: currently 3.83, but due to very unusual circumstances it will probably be a 3.9+ when applying to colleges (long story lol)

W GPA: 4.63, but again, it will likely increase to 4.7+

SAT: 1550 (790 math, 760 rw), 7/6/8 essay

Subject tests: 800 math II, taking bio in June

APs: by the time I finish senior year, I'll have 11 (APUSH, AP Physics I, AP Gov, AP Bio, AP lang, AP BC calc, AP compsci, AP Physics C, AP Psych, AP Lit, AP stat)

ECs:

* I co-founded a nonprofit with 30+ members that partnered with a homeless shelter and works at a local elementary school. When applying to colleges, we will most likely have raised about $10,000 for the homeless shelter kids for educational opportunities and will have held many week-long STEM and leadership courses at the elementary school.
* Interned for 2 summers &amp; throughout the school year at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (computer science- neural networks. JHU APL rarely offers a biology internship).
* Interned one summer at another nonprofit
* Varsity girls volleyball for 4 years (captain junior year and prob senior year). Also on varsity coed volleyball (captain as well). On a competitive travel team for 6 years, competed at a national level twice.
* Started violin when I was 5, founded a quartet that plays at weddings, parties, at theaters, nursing homes, and other events. Was in school's top orchestra 1st violin all 4 years (our orchestra is actually really competitive lol). I also was understudy violinist for a professional theater musical and did a production performed at Strathmore
* I have been in the Chinese immersion since Kindergarten so I can speak and write in Chinese.
* Vice President of a large county-wide nonprofit that my friend started
* Volunteered at a hospital for a year, prob 150 hours or so
* In a couple of honor societies but I don't think those help too much

Recs: Idk yet probably my anatomy and AP bio teacher, I am pretty close with them and my counselor knows me pretty well

Essays: Haven't written them yet but the PLAN is to work on them over the summer, but procrastination is likely :)

Back then , I wasn't familiar with the importance of CGPA (Indian colleges have a 10 point scale) for getting into a Masters Program. To be honest I never even thought much about Masters Program. 

I didn't put in effort in college and was pretty emotionally distressed due to various factors.  My CGPA was roughly 6/10 \[ around C- average\]. 

But during my last year , I found something I was actually interested in : Machine Learning 

I did projects by myself and got myself a really amazing 6 month internship during my industry practice semester. After it finished, I found another job pretty easily (Not in India). It is well paid and I am doing interesting things.

But now that I want to further my knowledge and do some research in this field, it is incredibly demoralizing to find that regardless of my GRE/SOPs/LORs/Research , I would be rejected OUTRIGHT by almost all colleges in USA/Canada/UK/Germany on the basis of my undergrad scores.

I'm a first year, going to second year Math and Compsci student.
I was chosen for this scholarship that basically gives you a paid 3 month long internship at any (computer science) research facility of my choice (located at my uni, of course)

There are some interesting facilities at my university, but the two that appealed to me the most were: one research center about Natural Language Processing and one about Quantum Computing.

The one about NLP seems like an 'easier' internship because I already have a bit of a base in Python and know some concepts that are related to data science.

The one about quantum computing, however, is more appealing. But it also seems like the kind of thing that would be so hard to understand that I would feel lost throughout the whole internship. My knowledge in quantum phenomenon is very limited to Grade 12 physics classes, and I am super scared to just be way too lost. HOWEVER I don't know when I'd get a chance to be in this research center again (this scholarship is making it easy for me to get in but they normally as super picky about their candidates), not to mention the head of research there is a super known guy, one of the ""founding fathers"" in quantum computing - Wolfe Prize winner Gilles Brassard. 

I was wondering if any of you had some advice about experiences like this, or books to recommend for a noob like me to maybe make me a bit less scared about the area of Quantum Computing. Perhaps let me know if it's really that hard that I shouldn't have a go at it?"

I'm a 21M. I'm french and i did 3 years of college on chemistry (a common thing in france)

I now work in a reasearch laboratory as a technician.

This is my first job and to be honest this is what I wanted to do so evrything's fine.

The thing is... I'm bored as fuck and i don't have much to do.
In our lab , the majority of the reasearch are done by reasearch student. My goal is to train them to use the apparatus, through the month i took responsability of 10 differents apparatus approximately. I also do the gas supply of my part of the lab.
When reasearcher are in need of experiment i do them for them.
But i still have large portion of my time where i don't know what to do.

I had a talk with my boss and clearly he is not satisfied with the way i let big chunk of my day going without doing anything productive and guess what , me neither !
This is killing me and makes me wants to quit on more than one occasion. I'm not happy not having stuff to do at work.

He tells me i need to search for new things to do.

So i try to ask people for sample to run experiment on them and better my understanding of techniques but the thing is , i have hard time finding them and also i feel something is not right.

The thing is ... i value the fact of being usefull to my work community and i hate being a burden.
Evry time i asked colleagues if i could help them they either had nothing for me or let me help them but i think we all knew i was useless : they had planned to do this thing alone so when i step in i'm just here to watch , listen and pass the tools. Evrytime i do something more usefull than that i because i go out to do the thing they were suppose to do so they are the one watching.

So i stopped that,  i hated being a burden like that and i know that if i had something to do i would prefer to do it by myself and not having an extra that is here because he has nothing to do. I feel like an intern that need to be entertain and I HATE that.

This is not right, maybe i don't understand how job is supposed to work , but I feel that if I really were needed , i wouldn't have to ask people to help them , they would ask me !

I just want clear instruction and a list of thing i have to complete , not some vague quest to find the job i need to do !

So my questions are : is this a normal job situation ? What can i do to improve it ? Am i the asshole ?

Tldr: it's my first work and i don't have enough stuff to do , my boss asked me to go on my way to find stuff to do, i feel that in a normal work situation i would be asked to do stuff not the other way around. I want advice to help me understand this situation."

\- I was very humble in my interview, (acknowledged that there is a lot i don't know, and when I didn't know what technology they were referring to, I mentioned it). I suppose companies get a lot of yes-men, and want someone to acknowledge they're here to learn. 

\- Stressed the importance of documentation. (a lot of senior developers, especially in my region, don't do their documentation duty). Companies look to interns to stress this process.

So I've got an internship coming up this Summer. The company told me that upon completion of my internship they are going to on-board me for a full time job (assuming I don't screw up something major). 

I was wondering if it would be beneficial for me to graduate with my Math BA sooner so I can start working their asap or if I should wait and graduate with my BA in biz econ and BA in math then start working for them. Assume cost doesn't matter. 

I was also considering switching my biz econ major for a stats minor which would also let me graduate relatively fast as I've already got most of the reqs for that minor done besides one class. May do a CS minor since it complements math pretty well. :3"

Some  background on Columbia-Sciences Po.  It's a Dual Bachelor's program  where I spend the first two years of  undergrad at Sciences Po Paris (the  best poli sci school in France) and  the last two years of undergrad at  Columbia University. When I  graduate, I can get two degrees from the two  institutions.

Major:  Political  Sciences and Economics at Berkeley (maybe Haas if I can get  in). At  Columbia-Sciences Po, I would be majoring in Political Science  at  Sciences Po and then Financial Economics at Columbia.

Cost: Berkeley is cheaper for me (in-state) by $60,000 in overall cost

**Pros and Cons**

*Berkeley*

**Pros  of Berkeley:** Much cheaper which is good considering I will need to go to law  school, Amazing faculty and departments for both Poli Sci and Econ, lots of friends going there who are telling me to go, my law mentor and my professor whom I've been interning with have been telling me to come here

**Cons  of Berkeley:** Reputation for being unsafe, way too competitive, very  depressing all the time, charged political atmosphere, food's not too good

*Columbia-Sciences Po*

**Pros  of C-SP:** Get two degrees from two prestigious universities, an unusual   and rare undergrad experience, learn French (from what past students   have told me, I'll at least have conversational French down), become  more independent because Sciences Po doesn't provide dining halls or residences, alumni networks of two prestigious schools, might be easier to find internships in NYC (especially since I want to do Investment Banking or Consulting after graduation)

**Cons  of C-SP:** More expensive which means less money for law school, in Economics and Poli Sci Columbia isn't as good as Berkeley, I'll be attending the School of General Studies at Columbia University instead of Columbia College which some people have said has a worse reputation than CC (Though my diploma and my resume will just say Columbia University), my law mentor and professor have been telling me to not go here and instead go to Berkeley

TBH,  I don't really want to go to Berkeley and the only holding me back  from  Columbia-Sciences Po are the cons of the program. But what do you  guys  think?"

I am sure that each university has its pros and cons, however for me the biggest thing that stands out is historical significance. GWU is a very significant university speaking from a historical point of view. It’s also in a the country’s capital, a booming city — possibly a chance for more internships?

As for Pepperdine, i’m sure it is a great university however in its major, it is not AS strong as GWU. With that being said, living in Malibu would be great, especially since LA is approximately 30 minutes away where most of my friends stay. I would also have a higher chance of playing soccer in Pepperdine as the school is fairly small, approximately 6,000 students.

I want to get back on the grind, and my experiences so far (loved my IB internship) and conversations with alumni have convinced me that a PE career is what I’d like to pursue. However, since the recruiting cycle for PE won’t start until (the earliest) 1.5 years from now when I’m a couple weeks into an analyst program, I’m not totally sure where to put my efforts to boost my chances at PE in a few years.

Some obvious things I can work on are maintaining a high GPA and getting good experience this summer. But some other ideas I had were:
1) studying for the GMAT and take senior year
2) off-cycle, during-school-year PE internship (how would I go about nabbing this opportunity?)
3) starting some club/student venture that would show my investor mindset (any ideas on what I should be aiming for)?

I have been trying to break into the data analysis field and I feel like I am getting close. I graduated nearly a year ago with a degree in physics from a good university. I have strong skills in python and excel along with basic knowledge of SQL. I made a few projects in python, the most notable one is a machine learning model I trained that predicts sports games which is on my GitHub. 

For the last year I have been working for a small company where I started a project entering our client data to excel and doing some analysis. Other than that I have no relevant internships and I think that is a big hurdle for me. 

I have been getting some interviews lately and I think I am close to getting my first real data analysis job but I feel I am falling just a little short and I need to add another project or technology to put me over the top. 

Some options I was considering: Learning Tableau basics, Improve my SQL skills by doing some sort of project with it or doing another python project using some machine learning algorithms. 

If anyone has any advice on what I can learn or do to break into the field, I would really appreciate the insight."
bfguql,6,2019-04-20,Turing Preparation + CS questions,MrZmann,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/bfguql/turing_preparation_cs_questions/,"Hi,

I'm an incoming Turing freshman. I have some questions for Turing kids.

Is there like a little refresher at the beginning of the year for Java basics? I learned AP CS last year and since then I have forgotten a lot of syntax and Java-specific rules. 

Do you have any laptop suggestions? I won't be gaming. Price is a factor. 

Lots of people who do Turing seem to have taken data structures already or done big coding competitions. I haven't done either of those. Will that make data structures super hard for me compared to everyone else? I'm pretty good at math, I just don't have as much CS experience as a lot of the other kids. 

Also, I want to be competitive for internships next summer (don't the big tech companies have freshman-specific internships?) Should I try to do a CS project now with my limited knowledge or should I be ok if I wait till school starts? 

Any other tips for Turing/internships?

Thanks for the help"

I've only just started to learn C++ (required in beginner uni courses), although I have some programming experience in Visual Basic, and have done some stuff in HTML and CSS etc. So I'm basically a beginner.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the things I should be teaching myself? 

What book do you recommend for learning C++?

What about hobby projects, internships, going to competitions and hackathons etc? Will any of that really help me in getting hired when I get my degree?

While my goal at the moment is to learn the basics well, I obviously want to get a good job after these four years too, so I want to streamline my approach.

Currently my parents have been pushing for me to look for any internships but I personally don’t feel like I am qualified for any right now. 

I started learning a little bit of C# last summer, but only for about a month or so since I was still having trouble conceptualizing all the beginner concepts. I took my first programming class last fall and Im taking the second level this semester (we learn C++). Im finally starting to learn how to read code, and know what to look up for help but Im still super hopeless beyond doing homework. 

Mom says that I shouldn’t sell myself short because companies are willing to teach interns and stuff, but I don’t know if shes underestimating how much an intern should know before applying, or if I actually am selling myself short. I don’t have any personal projects and I don’t really know how to practice programming outside of school work. Though this summer I plan on getting back to learning C#, and maybe Unity, now that I understand some concepts.

I’ve already applied to about 7 companies. 5 haven’t said anything yet, 1 said they’ve found other people to hire, and another one I failed a logic/math test that I need to pass in order for them to even begin looking at my resume, but said I can retake it later. 

My parents are unconvinced that I’m most likely unprepared for an internship at the moment, even though most are looking for juniors and seniors anyways. Any advice?"

Up until this month, I was working as an MIT at a restaurant and an Assistant Teacher at a childcare facility. I quit my teaching job due to it being a bullshit place and took on a full time nanny job instead with better pay. I’m looking to quit my second job at the restaurant as well because after nearly 10 months of dicking me around about it and procrastinating on my training, I still haven’t received my official promotion and raise (but I’m still expected to do the managers workload without the pay increase.. yeah fuck that).

The only problem is that while my nanny job is wonderful, I can’t pay my bills on that income alone and it’s only a six month gig (with possible time after, but no certainty and I need that certainty).

I’m 19, not in school and only have my High School Diploma as education under my belt. I have an impressive resume with tons of experience, volunteer work, internships and 6 letters of recommendation but I don’t have a degree and I’m not actively pursuing one (yet, at least. I plan to wait until next year). And it seems that all of the places hiring in my area are either fast food (which I do not want - if that’s the case, I’ll stay at my current job) or they require a degree.

Ideally, I’d love to be a freelance writer. I’ve been writing for forever and have a blog, a book in the works and some writing internships and such as experience. But I don’t even know where to start when it comes to that.

I also don’t know how to get a job that pays above minimum wage. I’m trying to be smart about this, but I feel so stuck and no one seems to be able to tell me more other than “it’ll be okay eventually, good luck!” As if that helps anything right now. I’m so stressed and just trying to support me and my family as I’m the only second income in a two income household.

Advice on what to do and where to go from here would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

&amp;#x200B;

so I'm currently finishing up my junior year and I cannot seem to get an internship and I'm really bummed out and frustrated to be honest... I've been applying since September of last year and I've received some (around 4 in total) interviews with big companies (completely bombed most of them since I underprepared), however, some I did extremely well in and still got rejected and after october/november I barely received any responses (I've applied to 300+ heard from 6 total). It seems like everyone around me seems to be getting internships pretty easily except me, I can't even hear back from anyone...

Anyway, my question is can someone tell me where I might be going wrong, what I can do for the summer to get a better chance at it next year (I don't even know if I can intern for my senior year it's probably a full time position right)?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an international student and I go to a top 20 school, top 11 in AI, located in MA;  here is a simple breakdown of what my resume looks like:

Triple Major: Compsci, Math and Economics. GPA:3.95

2 study abroads: one at Oxford and one at Hong Kong University of Science and Tech (Both top school, had 4.00 at Oxford)

Technical Experience: 3 Projects:

Python ML project (image classification)

iOS Whatsapp replica App (Swift)

Some Sudoku Solver app (Scala)

Is this a weak resume? I have never interned so I can't really put that in... can someone advise me or give me an idea of what I'm doing wrong?

I'm an early career electrical engineer (1.5 yr professional / 2 yr combined internships) currently working an okay job in the Midwest for a big company. I really want to get into a research and development position in the RF field. I currently have a BS in electrical engineering and I know for this to be a possibility I need to pursue a graduate degree, a master's degree at least. Luckily, I'm actually really excited about the prospect of going back to school. I had a great experience in undergrad. I really enjoyed being in classes, busting my ass on projects, writing papers and reports, all of it. I'm very technically minded and spend a lot of personal time doing research and personal projects. After graduation I took an internship with a government research agency and had a great experience working a research project. Got a short paper published with first author credit and everything. That experience really convinced me to go down this path in the first place. I really want to get back to school. I want to do it full time and in person, and participate in a research project if possible. Its so much more about my personal and academic growth than about getting the degree to check the box.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to 4 master's programs and two scholarships,  DoD SMART and NSF GRFP. I got accepted into 3 of the 4 schools:

* University of Colorado Boulder - Electromagnetics/RF program
* University of Southern California - Electrical Engineering
* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute - Electrical Engineering

I got rejected for both scholarships. I had several interviews with facilities for SMART, one facility outright said I was recommended for the scholarship, but It didn't pan out. I knew the GRFP was a stretch with my credentials. My first mistake was not casting a wide enough for funding, I really see that now.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm stuck in a bit of a bind.  I'm very interested in the USC and CU Boulder programs. USC's RF program and research going on at their MiXIL lab fit very well with my interests. However I would hate living in LA and it's so expensive. Funding seems to cut that one out. CU Boulder has a great program too and I'm interested in the stuff coming out of the Microwave and RF Research Group. I love the idea of living in CO and it's much cheaper, so this might be more viable with limited funding. I need to submit letters of intent to one of these schools by the end of the month. So far I've been getting in touch with the heads of both of the aforementioned labs about research or teaching assistanceship positions, that's still on-going. Also, to throw another wrench in this thing, I have a good lead on a RF engineering job where I would be a civil servant for the Department of Defense. This would be a great opportunity, would be much closer to my career goals, and may offer more robust education assistance than my current job.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my options as I see them now.

&amp;#x200B;

I could accept and enroll in the CU Boulder, continue to apply to smaller scholarships and reapply to SMART and GRFP next year, see if I can get work through my department. This would be financially difficult and require more loans. I have so much in loans from undergrad. \*groan\*.

I could defer enrollment to USC or CU Boulder and try my hand again at getting funded. CU Boulder will allow me to defer a year if approved by the department. USC will change the application date where my application as is now will be re-evaluated at a future date. This seems risky and may just land me in the same position next year.

I could decline both and reapply next year to schools and scholarships, or try to work something out through my work. This seems like it would have a low-probability of success. I don't mind redoing all the work, but I'm really stressing about asking for recommendation letters again. I don't know how its viewed to ask for letters for a reapplication and at that point I won't have worked or been in classes with these people for \~3 years. I hesitate to ask anyone from my current job, I'm worried I'd be looked at unfavorably for trying to leave the company when there is so much turn over now anyway. Besides, I don't see my odds of being accepted to schools or to scholarships improving if I stay another year (or more) in industry.

My GPA is around a 3.5? Weighted is 3.980, currently, but after dropping some middle school grades and adding in my last semester, it’ll be around 4.115 WGPA. I have a nearly exponential looking GPA, both as a result of far more rigorous classes, and actually caring about my grades. Unfortunately, I started caring too late, but I’m hoping I can recover.

I took the August and December 2018 SATs, both of which I got 750/800, 1550 total, as well as an 18 on the August Essay. I got a 1500 on the PSAT, so I’m a national merit scholar. I recently took the ACT in early April, but have not yet received a score, though I expect a ~34. I will also be taking the United States History and Mathematics 2 Subject tests in May.

In terms of course work:

Freshman Year:
Honors Biology, Honors Algebra II, AP World History, Honors English 9, Health, Intro to Computer Science, Band, German II

Sophomore Year:
Honors Chemistry, Honors Precalculus, AP European History, AP Literature and Composition, AP Computer Science A, Band, German III

Junior Year: 
AP Chemistry, AP Calculus AB, AP United States History, AP Capstone Seminar, AP Physics I, Advanced Human Anatomy and Physiology, Band

Senior Year: (Senior Transition to College Program)
AP Biology, AP Statistics, AP Capstone Research, AP Government, AP Macroeconomics, Band

Up until now, my AP exams haven’t been awesome:

2018:
AP World: 4; AP Lit: 3; AP ComSciA: 3; AP Euro: 3.

Extracurriculars:

4 years of marching band. We’re an extremely competitive and sucessful band. If you know about marching band, you know my band. I was leadership team Junior year 2018 season and will be for the 2019 season as well.

4 years orchestra. Freshman year, principal trombone in the secondary full orchestra, and sophomore and junior year, second chair trombone in top orchestra, again, nationally recognized. Will be principal next year, and will compete at the Midwest festival.

4 years Jazz Band. Nothing special here, except that I won a scholarship a month ago at our last concert this year, and will be attending Butler Jazz Camp in June.

3 years Academic Super Bowl. I started as a sophomore, and will have been captain of the fine arts team since when I joined. Nothing else about this that’s particularly exciting

1 year of Choir band. Probably not even going to mention this. 

2 years (Junior, Senior) of this Upperclassmen mentoring group at my school. Basically, they choose like 250 juniors and seniors to give a tour to the freshmen in the summer and hang out with them and have a day of activities. Then we meet with our assigned homeroom of freshmen once a month. It’s a whole thing. This year, I applied for and got accepted for council which is essentially 20 leadership positions who mentor the mentors.

NHS. I’m also applying for President, so we’ll see how that goes.

Hoosier Boys State is a nationally recognized program in the summer which is basically a mock legislative body. Basically a great leadership opportunity.

I unfortunately don’t have work experience, but I will be applying to an internship at various law offices around my town, and if that fails, I will get a job over the summer.

Some extra notes: My major will be a double major in History and Biology, and eventually law school. My school also, is huge, about 5300 kids, and my class around 1400? I’m definitely top 10% but definitely not standout in terms of GPA. And my letters of rec: my current APUSH teacher, who is an angel sent by god, will be writing a letter for me. We have a really good relationship which is good, and she’s well-known for writing good letters. 6/7 of the kids who made stanford in the last two years got a letter from her. Second, I’ll get one from my Anatomy teacher, who I also have a great relationship with. Splits humanities and stem.

bflb9i,2,2019-04-21,Reverse chance me,lucidmath,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/bflb9i/reverse_chance_me/,"Hi, I'd love some advice on where to apply, I need to narrow down my schools.

&amp;#x200B;

ACT: 35C, 36M 36E 36S 30R (I suck at reading)

Grades: 41/42 IB 11th grade final score, class rank 1 for the year (we don't have GPA), pretty good before that too but this year was my best

Classes: (I'm doing the IB diploma) Math Physics Chemistry HL, Literature Economics French B SL

Extracurriculars:

1. Debating: I am fortunate to go to a school with a very strong debate team. After many years of trying out, I made it to the A team, and in the last three years I have won many national tournaments, either as part of a team or individually (I'm from India btw). Last year I went to a really big international debate tournament in Europe, and my team came 3rd out of over 30 teams (some of which were national teams). I also have the responsibility of training the debate society, along with the other 3 members of the A team.
2. Coding: I started programming when I was in middle school, and I completely fell in love with it. I have a GitHub page full of random projects, mostly mathematical visualisations and stuff like that. Lots of games too. Not much useful stuff, sadly. In terms of actual work, I made an information portal for my school where announcements are posted. I did an internship in Chennai with a big data science company, and am currently writing a research paper on neural networks with them. My dream is to one day become an AI researcher, and machine learning is probably my favourite area of computer science right now.
3. Mathematics: This is the thing I love more than anything else. My math grades have always been perfect (sometimes at the expense of all others). I read lots of books about math, and I spend a lot of time solving problems and learning stuff outside the classroom. My main concern is that I don't really have a way of quantifying my knowledge in mathematics. In my school, there's basically no competition math, and to be honest I didn't even know math contests existed until last year. My math teacher, who I have a really good relationship with, sent me for a fairly big national contest, along with a senior of mine. I won a bronze medal out of 100 people, but the competition wasn't that prestigious, nowhere near the level of the IMO. However, I do know a fair bit about math, and I bet I could write some nice essays on it.
4. Music: This is the other thing I'm obsessed with. I've played the piano since I was a child, and I've reached a high level of certification in it. I've performed with the school band and been for a few competitions, but mostly I just play for fun. I have a few original compositions, and I'm planning on uploading them to YouTube just to see what happens. I've been playing the guitar for the last 2 or 3 years, and I'm writing songs on it as well. Music isn't really an extracurricular tbh, it's more of a coping mechanism for stress.
5. My non-profit organisation: I started a cool thing with a friend of mine from school. It's a website that allows people who can't afford/don't have access to digital marketing to upload information about their small businesses. The platform is modelled after social media, with sorting by category (furniture, art etc). I coded the website, and I guess I'm co-CEO? Our aim is to have 100 businesses on the site by July.

I'm an Indian male, my parents aren't poor, and my life has mostly been pretty tragedy free, which I'm very happy about. I have no hooks, is what I'm trying to say. I'm looking for somewhere with very strong math and CS, and also maybe somewhere with strong connections to Silicon Valley.

Thanks in advance for your advice!"

&amp;#x200B;

From my understanding, SUTD is more project oriented and the curriculum is more tailored to the industry, while NUS goes more in depth.

Would really appreciate any input on both unis based on:

1. Uni Life
2. Curriculum
3. Job Prospects and Reputation from employers
4. Workload
5. Internships and Exchange programmes
6. Mid term scholarship options
7. Ability to take double major/minors"
bflxg0,1,2019-04-21,Moving to a new country and I don't know if I should contact a girl that was very dear to me.,bersonator6,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bflxg0/moving_to_a_new_country_and_i_dont_know_if_i/,"**Tl;DR at the bottom.**

About a year ago, I was going to go on a vacation to a certain country, so I decided to start looking for people in said country that I could hang out with for my trip. I joined OKC and started my search. I didn't get very lucky...except for one absolutely beautiful girl who matched with me. Let's call her C from now on.

C and I started talking in a very friendly and casual manner, we didn't flirt or anything. We talked every day and really got along well. We started becoming a bit closer and she admitted to me that she was starting to feel attracted to me, and then I realized that I kind of felt the same way. We both thought it was ridiculous that we were feeling this for someone who we had never met, but there we were. Our conversations started becoming more romantic and even sexual at times. And we also started confiding in each other deep, personal secrets.

Eventually, we started planning the things we'd do in my trip. C suggested a bunch of activities that we could do together and locations we could go to.

FF about 1 or 2 months before the trip, and she tells me she has had a change of heart and she doesn't think it's a good idea for us to meet. I'm devastated and ask her why and she doesn't have a reason, she just says that maybe we were not meant to meet and that she thinks we were going too fast. I suggest her to take a time off and she agrees, so I didn't talk to her for several weeks. Eventually C writes back and says she's very confused but she still think it was the right choice, but, since I was such a good person with her, she will help me in my trip if I need to, so I should write to her if I need something.

So FF to the fated day and I'm in her country. I write to her to tell her this and we start talking casually and she eventually pops the question...if I'd like to go out with her, and that she doesn't promise anything but she'd really like to meet me. Of course I said yes.

The day of our meetup arrives and...C stood me up, she didn't answer my messages and didn't answer until much later saying she was really sick and we couldn't meet. After that she became much colder. Last day of the trip, I wrote her a goodbye message on the airport and she left it on seen. We didn't speak again.

FF to New Year's eve and I'm thinking about everything's that happened this year and I think about her. I wrote a message to her where I explained that I was reflecting on the year, and that I thought about her. I told her that I apologized if I ever placed wrong expectations on her that made her uncomfortable and also told her that I forgave her for what had happened, and I asked her if there was a way for us to start over. She wrote back a few days later with a very heartfelt message where she also apologized for everything and explained to me that she got scared because she realized that it was pointless to meet me or to become anything serious with me because I would be gone in just a few weeks and she couldn't deal with long distance stuff. I think this was a very valid reason, even if I disapproved of her way of acting on her concerns. C told me she did not think it would be a good idea for us to keep talking because of this reason. I told her that I understood and that I would respect her choice, but also that I had decided to try to move in to her country (not for her) so I asked her if we could still keep our contact info and our social networks, because we might actually run onto each other some day, then I said goodbye. She didn't reply to this message but she didn't delete me from any social network or from whatsapp (something she had previously done once, so I know she acts like this when she feels like its the proper thing to do) so I take it she agreed with that.

Recently I got news from a yearlong internship in her country, and I've been hired. I have my visa and I'm actually moving there in a few weeks. It's not that close to her city, but the distance is still not so bad.

I'm seriously wondering if I should write to her again. I don't want to be the pushy guy who keeps insisting and I know that her actions in the past may paint her in a really bad light, but I also think that with all the details, there might be a chance for me and I'll never know if I don't take it. I have honestly never felt this way about a woman before, it's just really hard to explain but this is the only woman that really made me feel like I mattered. I don't know how to proceed here.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR Met an amazing woman from a foreign country on a dating site about a year ago, we got close, she stood me up once I went to her country because she couldn't do long distance, we had an adult conversation about what had happened and kind of agreed to at least stay on sight of each other and now I'm moving to her country and I'm considering whether I should contact her once I'm there or not.**"

I'm double majoring in Statistics and Cognitive Science but am wondering if I should drop it down to a Stats minor.  I'm slightly interested in Stats because it's applicable to mostly everything and because I'm good at math, but I'm not very passionate about it. I love my cog sci classes so I definitely want to continue majoring in that. I'm also doing the specialization in computing for cognitive science. What I want to do in the future has to do with marketing and management. Stats is useful for that but I'm wondering just how useful/worth it is to have it as a double major. 

I'm also on track to graduate on time with the double major, I would just have a realllllly packed senior year and will also be swamped with extracurriculars.  I'm wondering if it's worth it enough to have a double major on my resume to put myself through this.  Also, if I don't do the double major, I would have more time for leadership positions like director of my organization and assistant manager at my job, in addition to possibly adding on an internship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Main questions:

1. Is a double major thaaat useful / look that much better than a minor (to prospective employers)?
2. Would internships and leadership positions in clubs and work be better than a double major on my resume / in life?"

3) Majoring in Finance, Math, Computer Science, Statistics, or related field.
4) Minimum GPA of 3.8

I secured an interview with Microsoft for their HS internship program, but my de-prioritization of APCS recently due to family issues has led to a weakening of my skills. Time is of the essence, interviews are in about three weeks and I need to prep as best as I can.

Should I be learning how to utilize hash tables? Or just relying on being able to create brute force methods consistently? It’s a HS interview, but it is competitive, what would be the best way to prep in this limited amount of time?

Although my parents could afford paying for UW Madison but if it is not worth the extra 16 grand then I don't wanna spend their hard earned money for just a slight advantage.

My girlfriend and I have been planning a trip in May for a while now and a month or two ago I finally bought plane tickets to go see her. We'll be spending two weeks together.

The problem is that I just got a new job a month ago. It pays decently but isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. Despite this, I've worked there two separate times before and the boss seems to like me. I plan on giving my two week notice next week. I want to keep them on my resume and if I want to keep the doors open so to speak if I ever need employment again.

To make matters more complicated, after May, I may or may not be getting an internship through a program that helps people with disabilities get jobs. I have ADHD and Aspergers and I really need to move up. I want a career in software development since it's my passion. If I get the internship, then I'll be working full time at that. If not, I might be able to keep working at my current job.

I've actually taken a vacation last time I worked at this company and my boss seemed cool about it, but it was only for a week and this will be two weeks.

So I'm asking here for your advice. What are my options? If I quit, what should I say? I really would prefer to tell the truth, but omitting information as necessary. If I just take a vacation, it'll be more complicated because I may need to quit shortly after the vacation is over because of the internship.

&amp;#x200B;

A quick summary: I dropped out of a pretty decent university, studying law, in December 2017 due to depression and financial worries - my dad was made redundant and I was terrified of remaining in university and losing money every month. I got involved with youth projects, started a social enterprise and got more work experience and internships in marketing during 2018. I secured a paid role in marketing in September 2018 and have now moved to a higher paid role, as of March 2019, working in digital marketing for a tech company.

&amp;#x200B;

But my ultimate ambition is to get into technology. In the UK we have degree apprenticeships at quite a few large tech companies - think IBM, Capgemini, BT, etc.  As you can understand, they're very competitive. I'm determined to get one, and have done some part time coding courses, as well as teaching myself coding.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem: I'm not naturally gifted at maths. I prefer coding in Python, hard as it is for me as a beginner, because I understand the purpose of the functions, and I struggle to understand the purpose of maths sometimes - pointless questions about train journey fares etc fail to peak my interest. I think my lack of maths ability is also due to various environmental and situational challenges - always being told I was crap, etc. To get into these companies, it's required to pass online numerical, verbal and situational judgement tests. This is the case for a lot of graduate roles.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to apply for degree apprenticeships starting this year but am thinking of waiting until applications reopen next year to give myself enough time to revise - maybe even get a maths tutor, as well as to work on my tech skills and finish building my Python project.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some problems. I still live with my parents and don't get on with them at all. I wish I could move out, and there's a chance I could, but rent is highly expensive in London and I want to save and invest my money. I dislike my parents - they're lazy, unambitious and bad with money, and I'm also afraid of being blackmailed by them and having to donate money to the house. Family does tend to take things for granted.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working in a challenging role which I like, but it's not where my heart is. It's okay for now, but as I said, I think I'm talented enough to get into tech despite not being from a STEM background. I care about how technology will impact all industries, about automation, tech for good, cybersecurity and changes to health and social care through technological innovation - probably more than those who have studied STEM degrees without any idea of what they wanted to do. I also go to loads of tech meetups.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm here for support. I'm great at networking and also kind of want to be back in the uni I was at, as I am now, with skills, work experience and a large network of ambitious and talented friends. The one thing holding me back is my financial background, and the high COL in London. Living in the town I grew up is depressing, and makes me feel unsuccessful when I know I'm not.

&amp;#x200B;

Any responses - encouragement, links to maths tuition sites, and tips on living with family and saving money would be greatly appreciated!"

So to start, I'm working (interning actually) at a place. And this internship is graded, so I can't afford to fail.. and I cannot surpass more than 3 absents in order to pass.

What should I do? I want to go back to my psychiatrist but they can only do Mondays (which mean I'll fail my internship.. probably leading to a worse mental state). 

I also cant go to other psychiatrists (due to reasons)

What should I do? Should I just hope this is just a passing cloud (I've been feeling down for the past 2-3 weeks though)? Or just take my leaves and explain to my school that I have depression (I honestly hope I dont have to do this because 1. I've already deferred my internship once, causing me to delay graduation. 2.

UCSB pros:
- I visited the campus, and I saw it more as a vacation spot than a school
- It is consider one of the schools with the best student Life
- two hours away from family
- The weather is usually warmer than UCSC
- seems like a more fun campus
- the school keeps improving every year as it keeps rising through the ranks
- it has a top CS program and they keep the program small, so more personal interaction with the professors
- has a campus town

UCSB cons:
- did not get into CS
- I feel I'm more limited to internships because it's isolated
- it's hard to transfer to CS because it is hard to enroll into the require CS courses you need to be able to transfer to CS, and CS students have priority for the courses, but I read if you meet the minimum requirements then you can get in.

UCSC pros
- got into UCSC
- I heard the campus is nice, but have not visited since it's so far from home
- near silicon valley, so easier access to internships
- since it's in a forest, there is more exploration
(Really don't know that much pros because I see a lot of students complaining about UCSC on their subreddit)

UCSC cons
- CS program is impacted, so it is going to be hard to get the classes I need and to graduate on time (really important to graduate on time because my financial aid only lasts for 4 years)
- the program is not as good as UCSB's program
- I think the weather over there is always cold because it's in NorCal (I get super lazy during the cold)
- I'll be so far away from home, so I'll be missing that family support
- housing problem
- I see a lot of students complain about the faculty.
- It gets clown on by the other UCs ( not really a big thing but this is a ego hitter)

I am facing risks at each school. If I attend UCSB, I risk not majoring in CS; however, I have no experience with CS, so I don't know if I would actually enjoy CS. I decided to major in CS because I love technology, I really want to work in the tech field, and of course I want to make a good yearly salary. If I attend UCSC, I risk not graduating on time, being homeless, and my chances of dropping out are higher because of homesickness ( I am the only male in my household and a first generation student, and I adore my sisters and my mother).

 Will a Statistical Science degree still give me the same career options as a CS degree?"

Stanford 
- Pros: Got internship in a comp bio lab (waiting on Stanford Compression Forum Internship as well) and internship for the Stanford Daily, I’m definitely more of a research type person, can enter science fairs next year, and I’m super excited about the research my lab is doing 
- Cons: I don’t live in the Bay Area, will have to live pretty much alone in relative’s apartment ,don’t want to fall in love with Stanford and get rejected in the future lmao

I would say I’m definitely interested in computer science and sort of it’s intersection with entrepreneurship, but I think I would rather focus on the computer science aspect this summer. I’m just confused about the benefits of a formal summer program vs an internship and what will look better"
bfq0qi,0,2019-04-21,Swarthmore vs. GTech (Computer Science),gargar070402,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/bfq0qi/swarthmore_vs_gtech_computer_science/,"(tl;dr below)

I'm sure you've all seen a crap ton of these posts, but please hear me out, because this situation might be a little different. I'm trying to choose between **Swarthmore College**, a liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, and Georgia Tech. I will be majoring in **computer science** (no significant cost difference). __I don’t plan on going directly to grad school from undergrad.__

I'm not here to ask ""how strong is X department at GTech compared to Y,"" because I know the answer to that. GTech is, without a question, the absolute best choice I have in my hands in terms of CS strength. If the strength of my major's department is the deciding factor, my dilemma would be over.

A few reasons I’m pulled towards Swarthmore:

1. **Small student body**. I visited both schools, loved both, but I was absolutely fascinated by the size of the student body and the class sizes at Swarthmore. Classes had 20-35 students max, and a good half of the class consisted of actually talking to the professors and discussing problems. This applies to introductory courses as well.(I know I'll end up fine giving this up as GTech still has labs, recitations, and smaller class sizes as my classes become more specialized, but it seems like there will still be a difference in terms of connections with professors and all that.)
2. **Connections to professors**. Yes, GTech has researches and VIPs available, but at Swarthmore, professors know you just by you being in their class thanks to the small class sizes.
3. **General well-roundedness of education**. GTech is obviously much more STEM-oriented, and I’m afraid that’s going to pull me too far away from humanities-related disciplines. I don’t intend on majoring in humanities obviously, but I don’t want that to mean that I will be taking little to no humanities classes. Furthermore, Swarthmore will also have more people interested in humanities disciplines, and I would love to be able to make friends outside of my major.

I don’t think I need to elaborate on GTech’s pros (insanely strong CS program, specialized threads, co-ops, internships, VIPs, connections to large companies), but I’m still not sure if all of these are worth enough for me to give up what I could get at Swarthmore.

Any input is welcome. Thanks a lot in advance.

**tl;dr**
Majoring in computer science. Can’t choose between GTech and Swarthmore, a liberal arts college, because Swarthmore has 1) small student body size, 2) close connections to professors, and 3) a more well-rounded curriculum and population. GTech has obvious and very strong pros as compared to its con,  I’m not sure if I’m willing to give Swarthmore’s pros up for GTech."

I applied to an internship at a T30 college this summer so hopefully that’ll work out, otherwise I don’t have much else. However I’m not looking for a research opportunity for college (while it helps) but I want to do some research on my own into a certain topic to better understand it for myself. I understand that I’ll probably be doing pretty menial work in a lab if accepted, but I hope that I’ll be able to meet people and gain an experience that could answer some of my questions on my topic. 

Now as to getting that opportunity, I’ve read all the email templates on here (which r useful af) but I’m not sure how to fill in the part where I speak about my experience with research. I’ve read books and done lots of “book research” but no “lab research” on my topic of interest. I’m not sure if this is worth including in an email and how I would do so. Also, my dad says that pretty much the only way I can get my name on a published paper is through knowing coding and doing the “grunt work” on computers that the professors assigns you to; is this true, as they wouldn’t let you do any real research in the lab?

- entrepreneurship opportunities look much better

- ""better"" CS program

- much better location IMO in terms of climate, internships (probably?), and culture

Berkeley Cons:

- have to declare CS (admitted L&amp;S), doesn't seem too hard if I put in enough work, but I will have to worry about it

- way bigger, so harder to get ECs, research, and professor relationships (in case I want to go to grad school)

- more grade deflation than Penn I think

---

Penn Pros:

- better business school (but would I even have more flexibility to take business courses than at cal? doesn't look like it)

- better brand name, and I hear overall brand matters more than CS prowess (apparently Harvard CS grads fare better than Berkeley ones)

- smaller private school: might be able to get better relationships with professors, research, even ECs are probably less competitive

- guaranteed into CS major

Penn Cons:

- preppy atmosphere AFAICT

- don't really like the east coast"

So now that it is time to pick a college, I'm really torn between all my choices. While I would like to attend Northeastern (I got in), my parents are not letting me go so that school is completely out of the picture, which in the end is probably for the best. 

&amp;#x200B;

I (kinda) like my three choices -- Fordham, Penn State Schreyer Honors College, and Drexel -- but they are honestly the *last* universities I thought I would be choosing from. I would like to pursue a major in accounting with a possible double major or minor in finance. I made a pro/ cons list for every school, but any advice you guys have is GREATLY appreciated because I don't know where I see myself this fall!!

&amp;#x200B;

Fordham: (pros) = location b/c NY is the best place for accounting and finance, I could possibly land a few internships. 

(cons) = Expensive - a little over $50,000 per year even with my scholarship. The Bronx kinda scares me LOL. Academic rigor (high school was honestly a breeze, and I'm not sure how I'd perform in college). Something just felt off when I visited the campus, idk how to explain.

&amp;#x200B;

Penn State: (pros) = I am in their honors college. Big networks and connections could MAYBE help me land an internship in the summer (preferably Philly since that's where I live). Cheaper - $25,000 per year. 

(cons) = I'm just not sure how well I'd be able to secure an internship over the summer. Bigger school, so idk how I would distinguish myself to my professors among thousands of peers. Pretty much in the middle of nowhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Drexel: (pros) = Co-op would give me 1.5 years of work experience. Affordable.

(cons) = 5 years with 3 co-ops would mean *no summers off*. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the long term, my goal is to hopefully work with the big 4 or in an investment bank, which is something I could accomplish with co-op opportunities. I really want to secure a job right outside of college in a major city. 

Which school could help me do this? Could Penn State's networking help with internships and jobs? Or would Drexel's co-op do the same for me?"

bftu5s,15,2019-04-21,Choosing between Cornell and a full ride at a local state school,Redderact42,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bftu5s/choosing_between_cornell_and_a_full_ride_at_a/,"TL;DR: Should I go to Cornell and personally pay $60-80K or go to UT Dallas for free?

Back in March, when I got a likely letter from Cornell's College of Engineering, I was cautiously optimistic. I hadn't researched it very much yet, and the likely letter caught me by surprise, but I was still happy to be accepted. I was mostly concerned about the financial aid, which I knew wouldn't be as generous as some other high-tier schools I had applied to.

By the time all of my decisions had been released, I had only been accepted to two schools: Cornell and the University of Texas at Dallas, which is a state school about half an hour away from my home. Since I'm a National Merit Scholar, they offered to give me full tuition, room and board, and a $6,000 stipend for study abroad (which I really would like to do). I'd also get to live in Honors housing with other National Merit Scholars and get personal attention from the top computer science professors at UTD, who would teach classes and provide research opportunities.

A week ago, I visited Cornell for their one of their admitted students programs, and I pretty much fell in love with the school. In just a couple of days, I talked to several people who I could easily imagine being friends with, and the students seemed really diverse, intelligent, and interesting. My host told me Cornell had really challenged him and helped him grow in the two years that he's attended, and that's pretty much exactly what I want in a college. By the time I left, I was almost certain I wanted to attend Cornell. 

Still, I've been having second thoughts about finances. My parents want me to pay for at least half of my college expenses. According to our calculations, this would put my expected financial responsibility at $60-80K by the end of four years. Hopefully, I'll be able to pay for some of that with scholarships and internships, and the median starting income for a CS graduate at Cornell is currently $103K, so that could help pay off whatever student loans I have after college. Of course, none of that is guaranteed.

I toured UTD for a day with their National Merit Scholar program, and the people I met were honestly pretty okay. I think I could get a solid CS education there, have good research and internship opportunities, and be able to study abroad a lot more easily. Still, UTD doesn't seem like an exciting place where I'll mature as a person - it feels more like an office park than a real college campus. Compare that to Cornell, with beautiful architecture and gorgeous gorges that you walk across to get to class.

I really want to go to Cornell, but I know it's only four years of my life, and I don't want to end up regretting it later. I'd like to hear your thoughts, especially if you're in or have been in a situation like this. Which would you choose, and how reasonable is $60-80K of potential debt?"

Since I was 13 I’ve have a fairly bad anxiety condition so this job was already very difficult for me. 

Over one long weekend, I decided to go to my cottage to get a little bit of time to relax as I was extremely stressed. My girlfriend and I decided to get on a bus downtown Toronto and head to my grandmothers place (my cottage). It was a 4 hour bus ride so half way through, the bus stops so you can stretch your legs and go to the washroom. When the break comes, I walked my girlfriend to the washroom then proceeded to go outside and stretch my legs to get some fresh air.

As I was stretching my legs, I was on my phone with a group of other people from the bus getting some air. During this, a random guy from the bus I’ve never seen before /spoke to before, comes up to me and says “yoo were you talking shit”. As I look up from my phone to see who’s talking to me, I get sucker punched extremely hard on concrete and was knocked unconscious for about 5 seconds. As I came back into consciousness, unsure what just happened, I look up to see this guy still throwing punches at me. I try and get away from him, but due to my equilibrium being thrown off and a pretty bad concussion, I kept falling as I couldn’t run and kept cutting my arms open on the ground. During this time, no1 helped me or called the police and he kept chasing me telling me he was going to kill me. Terrified, I had to run across the street to a different group of people to get help. I couldn’t see straight so I had no idea if I was going to get hit by a car. When I got to them I collapsed and they proceeded to call an ambulance for me and the police. 

The bus handed my girlfriend all my things and proceeded to leave without seeing how I was doing/what happened. The company also said they would refund my $100 ticket but failed to do so.

The man got arrested, and the cops told me “he’s a regular from the area” and that “I was the first ‘normal’ person he’s assaulted as he usually has problems with other crazies. 

I ended up leaving my internship due to issues I was having with my anxiety but also due to concussion symptoms I was having and the inability to work long days and therefore, my boss lost any interest in me. He didn’t even ask me how I was when I got back to work the first day. 

I assumed all the financial concerns would be figured out in court but I have emailed the court and have been lacking any answers lately and now unsure if I need to take further action / what type of financial remedy I would be entitled to? I have no idea about the law for this sort of thing and have no idea what process I should be going through. 

Recently I got a call asking me for payments for the trip to the hospital for the ambulance which seems insane because I was assaulted.

What are the steps I should take in order to help solve some of these issues? What are the pros / cons of even seeking legal advice at this point? And what type of remedy would I be able to get from seeking legal aid right now if this happened in August of 2018?

Over one long weekend, I decided to go to my cottage to relax as I was extremely stressed. It was a 4 hour bus ride so half way through, the bus stop so you can stretch your legs and go to the washroom. When the break comes, I went to stretch my legs to get some fresh air.

As I was stretching my legs, I was on my phone and a random guy from the bus I’ve never seen before /spoke to before, comes up to me and says “yoo were you talking shit”. As I look up from my phone to see who’s talking to me, I get sucker punched extremely hard on concrete and was knocked unconscious for about 5 seconds. As I came back into consciousness, I look up to see this guy still throwing punches at me. I try and get away from him, but due to my equilibrium being thrown off and a pretty bad concussion, I kept falling as I couldn’t walk. Terrified, I had to try to cross the street to a different group of people to get help. I couldn’t see straight so I had no idea if I was going to get hit by a car. When I got to them I collapsed and they proceeded to call an ambulance for me and the police. 

The bus handed my girlfriend all my things and proceeded to leave without seeing how I was doing/what happened and left me stranded half way between my destination. The company also said they would refund my $100 ticket but failed to do so.

The man got arrested, and the cops told me “he’s a regular from the area”.

I have becoming slightly more paranoid around strangers now and can get anxiety attacks from this at times (already have an anxiety condition) .

Should I be seeking legal council to try and sue the guy ? Is it too late? What type of remedy would I even be able to get off of this guy? 

Essentially curious if this is worth seeking legal council over or if I should just pay the fees and leave this?"
bfx2vv,7,2019-04-21,Questions about UMD as a potential transfer student for Spring 2020,painauchocolat94,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/bfx2vv/questions_about_umd_as_a_potential_transfer/,"Background: I am a 25 year old woman who is looking to transfer to a Maryland public university for Spring 2020. I am currently enrolled at a Maryland Community College and I am going to finish 60 credits after this upcoming fall semester. I originally started out as a liberal arts major and the majority of my credits are in humanities. I am now extremely interested in majoring in computer science. I have been taking computer science classes this semester and I will be continuing them this summer and fall as well. When I transfer, I would be a full time commuter student. I’m focusing on transferring to either University of Maryland College Park or UMBC, but I haven’t completed ruled out Towson. I am currently not looking at any Maryland private schools due to price and my goal of focusing on a computer science related degrees. I am not completing an associates degree because the requirements would put me over 60 credits, and I can only transfer up to 60. Anything over that would be a waste of money. 

I have a few questions about the culture of UMD for older students: 

1. What age are the majority of students? Would it be hard to find other people in their mid-twenties on campus who are also in undergraduate programs? If the majority of students are in the 18-22 range, are they generally friendly towards the older students or is there a lot of judgement? I’ve heard UMBC is generally more down to earth when compared to UMD, but I’m not sure how true this is? 

2. What is the general attitude of professors &amp; staff towards older students who may have other responsibilities outside of school because they aren’t being supported by their parents? I’ve come across judgement professors at my community college who assume anyone who can’t take an exam during a particular time is just an irresponsible teenager who wants to go party instead of attend class, instead of a full grown adult with a job. I rarely need to miss classes or exams, but I would appreciate some understanding and compassion when it comes to life getting in the way of school. 

3. I mentioned that my transcript weighs heavily in humanities because this may cause me to be “off track” or behind in a computer science program. Even though I would technically be a junior when I transferred, I may still need to take some sophomore/200 level classes to catch up. Will this be a problem? I’ve heard that UMD will drop you from a major if you’re not completing classes at the “correct” pace, so I’m worried that I wouldn’t be able to stay in the major. I understand that it may take me an extra semester or two to complete my bachelor’s, but this is fine as long as I can stay in the major. (I also understand that the computer science major is considered a Limited Enrollment Program, so there is a chance I may not be able to get into the major right away.)

4. For graduates of UMD’s computer science program: How easy was it for you to find a job? Do you feel like UMD properly prepared you for a career? Does UMD have a lot of connections or networking opportunities? Were you able to apply and participate in many internships and/or co-ops? 

5. Also for graduates: Do you feel like UMD was the better choice over UMBC? UMD has an amazing reputation in the country and UMBC has a great representation as a STEM school *in Maryland*. I’m not sure if UMBC’s reputation reaches out beyond Maryland. Do you feel like having UMD on your resume has given you an advantage over job applicants that went to UMBC? Do you feel like UMD is recognized as a great school outside of Maryland? 

6. For computer science majors: How do you like the program at UMD? Do you like the professors? Are the other students in the major friendly? Do you feel like you would have been better off choosing a different, but technology relate major? I am not worried about it being a difficult program. I am ready to put in the hard work and dedication needed to complete this degree, but did you feel like this program was too intense or not intense enough? Do you feel like the campus had enough resources (I.e. computer labs, tutoring, study groups, etc) for you to successfully complete classes? Were the teachers good at teaching the material? 

I plan on touring both UMBC and UMD so I can talk to an admissions officer, but I find the advice/opinions of current and former students to be extremely helpful! Apologies in advance for any typos!"
bfx4b4,1,2019-04-21,College student here - my parents reversed their decision to let me do a co-op and summer classes. They think they are helping me in the long run. Did they really make a smart decision?,moralTortilla,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bfx4b4/college_student_here_my_parents_reversed_their/,"First of all, bless you if you take the time to read this whole thing.

Let me reinforce my aneurysm real quick before I write this........alright we're good now.

Sophomore in industrial engineering here. According to my academic adviser, industrial engineering is a major where it is especially important to have an internship or co-op if you want a decent shot at getting employed where you want after graduating. Therefore, I applied for various co-ops at the beginning of this semester.

Fast forward to a month ago, where I was in the final stages of securing a co-op that will begin in the fall.  So that I can stay on schedule with the courses in the way the employer wants me to, I wanted to take some summer classes at the university. I talked this over with my parents, and they agreed with my plan of living on campus during the summer and taking four classes. 

So with their permission, I register for classes, get my housing arranged, and also register for fall classes just in case the co-op does not go through.

Then last week, my parents decide to tell me that it would be better that I come home for the summer and take a break so I don't get ""burnt out"". Also that I had to ""prove"" to them why I should take summer classes if I really wanted to do that.

So, I went home this past weekend for my father's birthday celebration. Both of my brothers (both older than me and through college already), my brother's girlfriend, my favorite aunt, and two family friends were there to celebrate with us. Of course, when you're a college student, everybody asks you about your summer plans, how the semester is going, asks if you're gonna fail any classes, etc. When asked about my summer plans, I told each of those people my summer plans of taking summer classes and then starting the co-op, and then EACH one of those people expressed concern that I would get ""burnt out"", using that exact same phrase. It was as if my mother had spoken to all of them at some point and told all of them to tell me that!

I tried to have my parents sit down at some point during the weekend so I could ""prove"" to them why I should take summer classes like they wanted me to. I had a decent amount of pros and cons prepared to show them how much thought I had put into this...but I was not able to successfully get both of them at the same time so we could talk. Therefore nothing was accomplished.

My understanding of the situation is that people don't want me to get burnt out and they want me to get some work experience this summer and earn some money. 

My feelings about it are that going to summer classes means that I will actually be on schedule to take the classes that I will need to take to put myself on track to take the classes that will allow me to be useful to my co-op employer and that I will not get burnt out since I will be taking time off of school due to the co-op.

My parents let me get super close to securing a co-op, allowed me to register for summer classes and housing and then all of a sudden pulled the plug on all of that. Because they think I might get burned out and need work experience. Well thanks, because I now have to take the classes that I was planning to take in the summer in the fall instead, and class registration was 3 weeks ago, most of the class spots are now taken. RIP my beautiful schedule.

So I thought about how to make a compromise. At my uni, summer courses are in 2 sessions, first half or second half of summer. I think I might just take the courses in the first half session, then go home for the last half. 

My parents think I'm not going home for the summer to get out of yard work. Absolutely not true. 

***side story here, if you don't want to read it, skip to the next three asterisks. 
My parents own 2 acres of land and for the past 3 years, we have been doing ridiculously time-consuming and labor-intensive projects at my mother's will. For example, one half of the land is woods, and my mother had us go in and pick up every last fallen branch, stick, and piece of fallen tree and stack it all in a pile. Another project was mulching. We moved 240 cubic feet of bark nuggets (120 2cu. ft bags) and 20 cubic yards of pine mulch to transform swaths of the land into flower beds. BY HAND - wheel barrow or dragging on a tarp, or using this old half-broken cart that a boy scout troop didn't want anymore. Each of the piles of mulch was taller than me, and there were multiple loads. I did most of the mulch work since my mother is slightly disabled by her arthritis and both of my brothers were gone in different states and my dad was at work ""so he really shouldn't have to do any of this kind of work"", in my mom's words. Another project was moving 3 cubic yards of rip-rap rock by hand. Why the heck do we need ROCKS, mom??? It was to make a DRAINAGE ditch from the bottom to the top of the property, she said. But she had the rocks delivered at the BOTTOM of the property. We're talking about all-day work in southern North Carolina. I recall two instances of heat exhaustion, 2 yellow jacket stings, at least 10 fire ant bites, a few flare-ups of poison ivy rash, many very close encounters with venomous snakes, swarms of mosquitoes, constantly sore muscles, and more last summer. But still, I could never imagine using college as an excuse to get out of yard work!

***

So, my questions are, 

1. Do you think it is a good decision for me to take just the first session of classes and the come home for the second half of the summer?
2. Are there any other things that I am not seeing or considering about the situation that I should be considering? For example, have I just been blind about the whole ""burning out"" thing?
3. Any other wisdom or advice? Anybody's perspective would be appreciated. 

TL;DR: parents changed their minds at the last minute about letting me do a co-op and summer school because they think I'd be better off. Ticked me off, but I'm wondering if there are positives to this situation that I'm not seeing."

(Computer science),lgemmr,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bfx9vd/help_me_decide_between_two_schools_computer/,"Two great schools and I’m blessed to have the opportunity to go to either one. Any help or advice in deciding is welcome!

Duke vs UCSD
Intended major: computer science 

Duke Pros:

- Gorgeous campus.
- Four season weather.
- Prestige/reputation as a whole.
- Lots of school spirit, especially during basketball season.
- Gives me a chance to go away from home, and have independence.
- Good social and extracurricular life.
- Located in Research Triangle.
- Smaller, more intimate computer science program.
- Decent internship opportunities.
- Private school.
- Good food.
- Well-maintained and high quality facilities and buildings.
- Is incredibly easy to try different classes and switch majors if I realize that I dislike computer science.
- Hard to pass up the opportunity to go to such a well-respected and prestigious school. 

Duke Cons:

- Expensive.
- Largish influence of Greek life on social scene (I’m not planning to join a frat).
- Could have decent numbers of elitist/snobbish people due to lots of wealthy kids going there.
- Smaller CS program has less classes, and thus a lower variety of classes compared to UCSD.
- Certain software industry areas such as game development or cybersecurity could be lacking classes due to smaller program, thus hurting my chances of entering those industries.
- Long travel time (I live in California) makes it harder to visit family, also adds cost.
- Difficult classes, which could leave me less time to work on my own projects (to build portfolio/resume) and extracurricular activities.

UCSD Pros:

- One of the best computer science programs in the nation.
- Huge variety of classes in all sorts of different industries.
- I’m already accepted to computer science major, in school of engineering.
- Reputation is growing to top tier level.
- Better connections to gaming industry, cyber security, etc than Duke due to being larger program + location.
- Large numbers of student clubs and organizations.
- Tons of students so easy to find social niche.
- Close to LA and Orange County tech companies, along with being far closer to Silicon Valley than Duke.
- In state tuition cost.
- Easy to visit family.
- Great internship opportunities.

UCSD Cons:

- Don’t get chance to live somewhere else for college.
- Public school, lots of bureaucracy, they don’t care about you as a person as much.
- Mediocre food.
- Has warm weather which is nice, but I would really like to experience four seasons. 
- Poor social life from what I’ve heard.
- Can lack school spirit, no good big sports teams to unify student body.
- Facilities/buildings as a whole are not as nice as Duke’s are (although computer science buildings are comparable).
- Area (La Jolla) is nice, but not a college town.
- Decent campus but not as nice as Duke’s.

Thanks in advance for any advice, both are great options but it would be great to hear someone else’s thoughts."

One thing I've been wondering about is how doable it is to balance a minor (or maybe another major) in something like Math, Linguistics, or a foreign language while majoring in CS?

I'm also really interested in study abroad, internships, and research.

Does the CS major give room for these other options, or is it hard enough to finish within 4 years on its own? (This is assuming I'm coming in with some AP creds--English, Calc BC, Physics, Bio)? Thanks!"

One thing that really excites me about Berkeley is the fact that much of the research being done in the EECS department is truly top-of-the line, and that many of the professors leading that research are at the forefront of their fields. However, the obvious caveat is that they're probably all in very high demand.

I'm wondering if its feasible to get EECS research as an undergrad, and if so, how difficult it really is (I'm particularly interested in NLP, computer vision, smart grid technology, or really anything else within the broad fields of ML/AI, and robotics). Is there anyone willing to share their experience of getting undergrad research, or ways they know of doing it? Thanks!

I'm also interested in the accessibility of internships nearby (LBL, Silicon Valley, or really anything else). If anyone knows about ways Berkeley undergrads have gotten them, I'd be super happy to hear!"

I'm a resident in CA attending a CC and I'm transferring this fall as a junior. I found out where I got into/rejected from and  I'm having trouble deciding on the program/school.

Mainly, I keep hearing that UC's are more research and grad focused and the undergrad education is kind of meh for engineering as opposed to say, cal poly (where I also got in at).

The problem is the UCs (berkeley &amp; davis) offered me a TON of aid and i'd be going with little to no debt where as cal poly would cost me a ton each year and it'd take me longer to graduate.

So i'm more than likely going to a UC (applied at berkeley for industrial, davis for civil -- no idea what direction I want to go). I'm a bit scared of their rigor though.

&amp;#x200B;

Main question: Are UCs really that bad for the undergrad who doesn't plan on going to grad school (at least not for a while)? I just want internships and a job fam.

I’m just so lost and I don’t know what choice to make. I have wanted to study abroad for so long, but I seriously screwed up. I didn’t choose the right program, and now i’m stuck with a program that i’m really not excited about. Like I am genuinely not excited.

I know this may sound entitled or brattly, but i really just wanted this experience to be close to perfect and i fear that it’s not going to be that. Mainly, i feel this way because of the structure of the program. It’s very intensive and so much time is eaten up by class. Of course, i know i should expect to STUDY while being abroad, but I still wanted that balance of free time and class time and I don’t think I’m going to get it. Also, I’m going to be stuck with other Americans. I’ll have realy limited ability to interact with locals, which just defeats the purpose. The entire program isn’t even set at a university, it’s at an American institute, which completely minimizes the student experience. I could enroll in one class at a local university, but if i do, i would lose out on a $4000 scholarship. The scholarship is only disbursed if i complete an internship (which i really don’t want to do because of the big time commitment), and i can’t do both the internship and the university course. Lastly, it’s just a very expensive program. I still haven’t heard back from some scholarships, so, it may not be a big issue. But if I don’t hear back from scholarships, I’m going to have to scramble to afford it. 

I knew these things, but I ignored them for whatever stupid reason. I seriously messed up. Now, I’m not even sure if I should go. I know I mainly listed the negatives above, but there are some positives. I think that any experience abroad would truly be amazing (there are obviously just some better than others). I may regret it if I turn this down. This location (London) is one that i’ve wanted to go to for so long. I’d feel dumb turning down the chance to live in London for a couple months (and maybe get scholarships to fund it).  Also, like I said, I’ve already tried to plan this multiple times. I feel like with my tendency to overthink and never go with the flow, I’ll alway find issues with going and then I’ll just never go. 
On the flip side, I could just not go. I could save my money, and plan ahead for a better, more preferable experience in the future. I feel like this would probably be the logical thing to do, I just don’t know if I want to put it off again. But, the point is, I can still delay it (of course this may mean delaying my graduation but i’m on track to graduate early anyways). I’m not sure if I should delay it or if I should just take the chance and go abroad and maybe end up loving it. I would appreciate any advice.

TL;DR: I’ve tried to study abroad in london for three consecutive semesters now. The first two times never worked, and now i’m on my third attempt. I messed up and chose the wrong program because i acted on impulse. The program I’m stuck with isn’t at an actual university (which i want) and has really crappy scheduling and class selection. The location is unbeatable though and if i get scholarships, it may even be affordable. If i don’t, finances will definitely be an issue. I’m not sure if I should delay it for a third time and try again in the future or if I should just go because i’ll probably always find issues no matter what and this isn’t something I should give up."

I'm a third year international undergrad CS student in Greater China area. I've developed a solid career plan on robotics software and AI, with data science and little bit of front end web development.

Recently I got an offer for a well established robotics startup with wide market exposure. I also just finished a final round interview for an investment bank in data science. But judging from the interview, the implication is that there is a high chance they will also hand in the offer.

I am pretty much dead set on building up a robotics career and hopefully set up a robotics company after I got my feet established in the career world.

I'll just list the pros and cons for each offer : 

**Robotics Startup :** 

Pros

* Cutting edge robotics software, I can learn tons of raw programming skills
* I can do what I love in the software field.
* I get to work in a rapidly growing place for startups and robotics development.
* More open opportunities for summer robotics research exchanges, since I'm planning to do a masters in robotics.
* Cheap living costs with free food and facilities.

Cons

* Since the place is really far from my campus, I will be mostly alone there, while my friends will be interning near campus.
* Just enough salary to cover the living costs.
* I cannot speak the local language near the internship place.

&amp;#x200B;

**Investment Bank :**

Pros

* Higher salary per month.
* I can plan to do Summer research and thesis in my campus
* I can meet my friends during the Summer and hang out with them.
* More exposure to financial industry. Also my first time interning at a big firm.
* I can improve my people skills / communication since it's more business oriented. May be useful in the long term when setting up my own company.
* It's a well known investment bank, I can put the company brand in my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons

* I will learn less technical skill
* The internship projects may not be as challenging as the robotics startup.
* feels weird when I interned at a bank while I'm pursuing a robotics career.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am a bit torn on whether I should go the safe route (investment bank) or the risky one (startup). It makes sense that at first glance, it is more logical to take up the startup offer. But I am also thinking in the long term where I can also use the intern experience at a big firm to leverage myself getting into more established companies before setting my own startup.

I'd love to hear your advice. Much appreciated!"

bg2ynp,4,2019-04-22,[Help-Feedback] How would you have designed it ?,frz7,softwarearchitecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/softwarearchitecture/comments/bg2ynp/helpfeedback_how_would_you_have_designed_it/,"Hello everyone,

I am doing this post in order to get your opinion on an OOP design problem.

I've been thinking a lot, but I can't find a solution that satisfies me.

I have to model **system components** it's a business object, a system component has public and private parameters.

A parameter of a system component has attributes to indicate whether it is a private or public parameter, the minimum and maximum number of occurrences and the type of expected values.

The difficulty I have is that the types of my parameters can be a complex type and the parameter have some constraints

First from the business specifications, i create a xml file to describe the system component. The idea is to deserialize the xml, the advantage of this approach is that if the business specifications evolve I just have to modify my xml file.  
I am an intern and these are the constraints imposed by the other developers of the team.

&amp;#x200B;

    &lt;SystemComponent type=""XYZ""&gt;
    
    &lt;Description&gt;""Lorem ipsum""&lt;/Description&gt;
    
    &lt;Parameters&gt;
        &lt;Parameter name=""Name"" type=""string"" min=""1"" max=""1"" defaultvalue="""" access=""public""/&gt;
        
        &lt;Parameter name=""Table"" type=""ComplexObject"" min=""0"" max="""" access=""public""&gt;
            &lt;Constraints&gt;
                &lt;constraint slave=""Table"" master=""Mode"" operator=""equal"" value=""1""/&gt;
            &lt;/Constraints&gt;
        &lt;/Parameter&gt;
    
        &lt;Parameter name=""EnumValue"" type=""EnumType"" min=""0"" max=""1"" defaultvalue=""0""     
     access=""public""/&gt;
    
        &lt;Parameter name=""Mode"" type=""Byte"" min=""1"" max=""1"" defaultvalue=""1"" access=""private""&gt;
            &lt;Constraints&gt;
                &lt;constraint slave=""Mode"" master=""Mode"" operator=""superior"" value=""-1""/&gt;
                &lt;constraint slave=""Mode"" master=""Mode"" operator=""inferior"" value=""5""/&gt;
            &lt;/Constraints&gt;
        &lt;/Parameter&gt;
    
    &lt;/Parameters&gt;
     
    
    &lt;CustomTypes&gt;
        &lt;CustomType name=""ComplexObject""&gt;
            &lt;attribute name=""identifier"" type=""string"" &gt;
            &lt;attribute name=""id"" type=""string"" length=""13"" &gt;
        &lt;/ComplexType&gt;
    &lt;/CustomTypes&gt;
    
     
    
    &lt;CustomEnums&gt;
        &lt;CustomEnum name=""EnumType""&gt;
            &lt;enum label=""Low"" value=""0"" /&gt;
            &lt;enum label=""Medium"" value=""1"" /&gt;
            &lt;enum label=""High"" value=""2"" /&gt;
        &lt;/CustomEnum&gt;
    &lt;/CustomEnums&gt;
    &lt;/SystemComponent&gt;
    

&amp;#x200B;

In this case,  the SystemComponent is type of XYZ (business type) has a string attribute ""Description"" and he has a list of parameters.

* **Name** parameter is a string and is required
* **Table** parameter is a list of complexObject and is required when value of  ""mode"" parameter is 1.
* **EnumValue** parameter is an enumeration, where default value is 0 (""Low"")
* **Mode** parameter is a integer between 0 and 3

&amp;#x200B;

**ComplexObject** type has two attributes :

* identifier
* id a string of size 13

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to solve constraints on attributes as well as custom type attributes.  I think strategy pattern can help me to manage the constraints.

&amp;#x200B;

[UML](https://imgur.com/WfYkh2p) of my design.  


If it was up to me, I would have an XYZComponent class that inherits a Sytemcomponent class and I would code the business logic in the methods and the constructor.

[other UML](https://imgur.com/Kt3NuX5)

The argument against this modeling is in the case where the business specifications evolve, we should modify the classes as well as all the places where this class is used.

bg3p82,7,2019-04-22,HELP!! Relocating to NYC to do an Internship!,jgl9636,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/bg3p82/help_relocating_to_nyc_to_do_an_internship/,"Hey all!

I felt the need to post here as I feel just a little bit lost and overwhelmed. Wondering if anyone can offer any advice.

Im a recent 22yo Business and Accounting graduate from a University in Ireland with a 2:1 Degree. 

I’ve been working part time throughout my degree in a supermarket, before I got a job as an accounts admin for my third year internship, where I then moved into a data analysis role with a different company. I was offered a permanent role upon graduation.

I decided I wanted change, Im not working in a position I like and its not in my field. Its more IT focused. 

I wanted to do something incredible to change my life.

In Ireland, there is a company that sets you up to intern anywhere in the states for a year, VISA and Sponsorship included. But you have to source your own internship (in your degree field) and accommodation.

I decided that I wanted to do this in January, and since then Ive built my resume to US standards, networked a little bit, put money away for savings and my VISA was approved at the end of March, I fly out at the end of May. 

The overwhelming part is I have applied to c. 50-70 different companies offering Accounting/Finance Intern roles and I haven’t gotten as much as a rejection email. This is really concerning because when I arrive in the US I have 90 days to find a job, or else I have to go back to Ireland. 

I’ve worked so hard to get to where I am today and I want to take it to that next level, throughout my education and work life I put my absolute everything in to succeed, you get out what you put in! 

I dont know where I’m going wrong in my applications. Any recruiter Ive got in touch with weren’t willing to help with Intern roles, I assume this is due to low commission potential, which I guess I can understand. 

Then there’s the issue of renting which will be a struggle on its own, as I wont have an income when I get to NYC, just savings, but I think I was figure that one out.

Is there anyone out there that could provide some form of assistance with a resume/cover letter? I always tailor my resume to that of the job descriptions at hand and Im conscious of including keywords, but still nothing. Am I at a disadvantage applying for internships since I’ve already graduated? Or because Im not from the states?

I am stumped.

I’ve got such an incredible opportunity in front of me, to work in the US for a year, but Im struggling to cope with the pressure, and Im beginning to question if Ive made the right decision to leave my full time job, in search of an opportunity in the US!!"

I have been applying for Shopify's backend engineer position for the past two years now and every time I fail to make second round of interviews. I fail to understand why. Is it just I am not Shopify material or I am just a bad coder in general ... But I really want to get an internship this fall (Shopify Toronto). Fall applications will be up in a week or two so I was wondering what I can do for my application to stand out?

Also I never used Ruby for their coding challenges. Does it give an upper edge if I use it over Node or Spring?"

But I'll be honest, I need you guys to help me out. There are many problems in my life and I don't know how to get started towards fixing them. I'm currently a 21-year-old guy who is a junior in college. I've given it much thought and here are the things that I want to improve in my life.

- I want to start going to class every day, studying and complete all my work on time or ideally get it done early.
- I need to start going to the gym and eating healthy. In the last 2.5 years, I've gained over 50 lbs and I'm disgusted at myself when I look in the mirror. I want to change that
- I need to figure out my life. Currently, I'm a junior majoring in Political Science, but I have no internship experience and no idea what I want to do after college. I've thought a lot about applying to law school but lately, I've been feeling burnt out and don't know if its something I truly want. I'm scared that if I don't go to law school, I can't find a decent salaried job with my major and lack of internships (I have work experience but nothing white collar/professional)

- I want to look better, feel better, and be more social. There isn't much to say about this. I'm very fat and hate how I look, I never feel good in public or at home, and I try to avoid talking to people whenever I can. 
- I want to build up a solid wardrobe. I've had money problems throughout my life so I tend to buy clothes that are from Costco or Walmart and dress pretty sloppy. I don't even own a suit or a button down shirt that fits me. 

- I want to be more mature. I think its time that I grow the fuck up. All around me are nothing but immature college students who want to party and drink (I go to Penn State). It's even more saddening to me because I still envy them for being skinny, more social, and they are at least enjoying life, which is more than I can say for myself.

- I want to stop procrastinating. I don't know how but I've somehow managed to get this far in college with a decent GPA (3.85 atm). I have no clue how I did this because I procrastinate on everything. 

- I want to cut back on drinking and smoking pot. It's pretty clear to me that I use these, as well as food as a way to cope with my feelings and I need help stopping.

- I want to increase my will power and discipline. I feel that if I can get a grip on this, then I will be able to accomplish a lot more goals.

Lastly, I'd like to say that I have no idea how to change my life. My family has no clue about this and we don't have a great relationship so I don't open up about this to them. I feel that I literally need to be told on how to fix these step by step and need serious guidance from you guys. Thank you for reading and any help/advice you guys can give me would be lifesaving.

P.S - I'm very open about my self so feel free to ask any questions you have."

The deadline to submit the SIR is coming up soon and I’d love it if I could get some help in figuring this out. I’m undeclared in both schools but I’m planning on pursuing a career in business tech. If I go to UCSB I will most likely major in Communications and if I go to UCI I will most likely major in Business Admin. One other thing I’m considering is the school experience. Two things in that: I play water polo and I want to continue playing (club/intramural) in college. I also want to be able to have fun and feel like part of a community for the four years through clubs, extra-curriculars, etc. Below I’ll list the pros and cons of each school.

UCI

pros:

- great academics, more specific for business
- good research opportunities 
- located in a more urban area with some surrounding tech companies (good possibilities for internships)
- newer campus

cons:

- no intramural water polo
- commuter campus (I don’t want to bring my car but it’s almost a necessity)
- less of a community feeling
- more loans = more debt

UCSB

pros:

- feeling of community
- gorgeous campus that’s easy to get around on bikes (right by the beach too)
- good study abroad program
- lots of options for water polo 
- fewer loans
- better options for dorms

cons:
- fewer internship opportunities (kinda located in the middle of nowhere)
- doesn’t have a direct business major
- less academic options
- worried that the people there might be like the people at my current high school which I am trying to get away from (not confirmed or anything tho so it might not be)

That’s pretty much everything I could think of for now, but I’m really stuck on trying to decide between the two. Any advice is welcome and if y’all need more information or have any questions just lmk!! Thank you in advance!!"

I don't have any work experience in the financial industry, like most students. Typically business students will try to get internships during the summer of their junior year in order to gain experience and kickstart them into an entry-level position at a larger financial services or investment firm, but since I'm graduating this summer (AP classes/heavy courseloads all three years allowed me to graduate a year early) I'm not elegible for many internships at financial institutions, since they require you to still be in school. Not to mention the fact that most are already filled up and the larger firms have started seeking interns for their summer of 2020 positions.
I've been applying for dozens of jobs in the past few weeks, sending out resumes and applications to banks, investment firms, etc. in the hopes that they will accept me for an entry-level position, but they seem to not even consider me for those basic positions that don't seem to require much, if any, experience. I've been told not to worry too much, and that I need to keep applying and I'll eventually find something, but I can't help feeling like my credentials aren't good enough for even basic, entry-level positions. I would appreciate any advice from past job-seekers, especially in finance!"

Looking for strong computer to use for the next six years (Double Degree + internship) sufficient for taking notes in lectures, building software systems, and is portable.

&amp;#x200B;

Total budget and country of purchase:

$3000 CAD or lower, Canada

&amp;#x200B;

Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.

2 in 1/convertible laptop with stylus  (so I can take notes)   &amp;   best specifications for the money (battery at least 8 hours)

**How important is weight and thinness to you?**

Not that much, but would prefer portability so under 4 pounds

&amp;#x200B;

**Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.**

Windows

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

13 to 15 inches (should be portable; can easily carry from and to school). I have a monitor at home to hook up laptop to for bigger display

&amp;#x200B;

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run**.Since going into engineering, I would need to run AutoCAD/SolidWorks and IDEs like Android Studio, Terminal, Eclipse, etc. and data science modeling software like Excel, Tableau, etc.

**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

Not for gaming; primarily for productivity

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

Touch screen (so I can take notes), would like (but not necessary) usb 3 fast charging/thuderbolt ports

&amp;#x200B;

**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

Would like more RAM with high clock speed: 2.0+ GHz (can always add more myself, so PC with enough slots for 32 GB RAM). Don't need much storage (256 - 512 GB SSD). Would like stronger processor with quad or six cores and hyperthreading (so I can run multiple high- end/performance programs; at least 4.0 GHz top clock speed) No need for graphics card (no intention of gaming)

Took me 4 years with 2 summers of classes. Thought I was going to need another Fall semester to finish up classes which would've allowed me to do a summer internship while still enrolled but ended up adding a few classes between Spring and Summer and finished up in August. So I don't have any relevant industry experience whatsoever. But I've been working on projects, some iOS apps and web apps, and even got on the App Store.

I've been using all job boards and shotgunning my resume out. I've used dozens of connections that I knew or my parents got me in contact with. I've sent out between 250-300 applications which have resulted in probably 20 coding challenges, 10 phone interviews (after coding challenge or as a coding challenge), and 2 on-sites. The one on-site that mattered gave the position to someone who had one year of experience. Without that *one year* of experience, it's been quite a struggle. I just had a phone screen at a company where 1.) I knew the hiring manager as a connection, 2.) she stressed that the people hiring are willing to take on new-grads and teach them, and 3.) the interview went smoothly and the guy even remarked that I was great..........but they want someone with one year of experience. 

I don't want to be that guy that needs his hand held at a new position and have to take up others' time to be taught stuff, but I feel as though I'm a quick learner and able to get up to speed quick enough with only minimal hand-holding. Is there no way to prove this? What else can I do to get a job?

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago I decided to switch careers and try to get into coding professionally.  I graduated from a Full-Stack Bootcamp last March and I've held down a part-time job with an ""Open Data"" team for my city's local government since then.  I started that job as an intern and was promoted to a permanent part-time position.  There was some talk of me being promoted to a new UX Developer position that was up for approval, but that position got killed by the city manager.  I've been applying to other jobs for about 6 months now and apparently made it pretty high up in the running for some, but I keep losing out to more experienced candidates.

&amp;#x200B;

At my job I code mostly in Python writing scripts to automate ETL data transfers for our website, mostly using API's to pull the data, transform it to the desired format, then automate the upload to our server.  In addition to that I have created several web applications for the city's library as well as written scripts to do the data uploads for a pretty important project.  It's all been great experience, but I'm worried that I'm not getting the right kind of experience that other employers want to see.  I'm pretty familiar some of the popular web techs like: React, jQuery, Ajax, MySQL, Django, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, etc.  I study for about 1-2 hours as often as I can and I'm just starting to get into leetcode and trying to make Open Source contributions.  However I don't have any kind of bachelor's degree, just a high school diploma (money's been an issue for me for a long time).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently trying to get Junior Web Developer roles because that's what I feel that I'm most qualified for.  I'm not even looking for a great salary &amp; benefits package, I'm just trying to get my foot in the door somewhere.  Does anyone have some suggestions on what I can do to make myself a competitive candidate in the hiring process?  Also, am I hopelessly trying to break into a job sector that I'm not cut out for?"

A lot of the high quality CV research being done seems to be pretty centralized to some of the more well known institutions.

bgab42,0,2019-04-22,A couple of questions regarding internships,ParadoxSociety,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bgab42/a_couple_of_questions_regarding_internships/,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Context: I have a B.S. in Journalism; Public Relations and am currently in my first year of Computer Science. I have just under a year's worth of experience with Python and the ""general concepts"" of programming, and followed a tutorial to build a simple video game with JavaScript (so I'd say roughly 15-20 hours of experience -- next to nothing). I'm obviously very new to programming still, but I've done a fair amount of research and passive learning outside of class (I would estimate about 70-80% of the content I consume daily is programming based: YouTube videos, both vlogs and tutorials/editorials; twitch streams, doing programming challenges in Python, etc). I only have retail work experience. I work weekends and study Monday-Friday. I plan on building a portfolio website as my first personal project, and can house my Public Relations portfolio there in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is it possible to get an internship this early in my CS career? I've watched numerous videos that mention passion and personality (which I have, imo) as big determining factors for potential interns / jr developers, but the technicality and emphasis on problem-solving in these jobs makes me skeptical of that.  

2. Aside from having an extra degree on my resume, will employers care at all about strategic communications experience?  

3. Following the above question: Should I display my PR portfolio pieces (writing samples, infographics, strategy documents, research, digital editing, etc) on the same site as my programming pieces? Should I bother having the PR portfolio online at all? (I don't plan on entering the industry, so unless it's advantageous to my CS career I have no interest in publishing it online).

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"
bgadl1,1,2019-04-22,Worth reneging offer?,throwaway231251224,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bgadl1/worth_reneging_offer/,"Hi,

I'm a student (freshman, CS, target school, USA) who's been lucky enough to get some different offers for internships this upcoming summer. I accepted Company 1's offer a few weeks ago, but I just received an offer from Company 2 and think it's better in every way; however, I""m debating if it's so much better that it's worth reneging. Both are for SWE and for the same timeframe, so here are the other details:

Company 1: Big fortune 200 financial services, located in my small/medium sized college town, pay is 22/hour. I'd have to sublease an apartment which would be an added cost, but not a huge one. I would be working on the Robotic Process Automation team.

Company 2: Former unicorn tech company that IPO'd about a year ago, located in a major US city (not SF, but one of NYC/Seattle/Chicago/Boston), pay is 38/hour. I would be able to commute from home which would save some money. I'd be working on one of their engineering teams, don't know which one yet.

Company 2 obviously wins in terms of pay and location and I'm assuming it has a better brand name since it's a successful tech company, but are these factors enough to make it worth reneging? The money and the location are obviously really nice benefits, but they're not my primary concern; I want to go with the one that will set me up for success the best in the future and help me the most in getting interviews next year for my sophomore internship.

Thanks!"

So I'm an Australian cs undergrad from Sydney and I had my snapshot interview with Google about 2 weeks ago. So a week after that I was given a survey to fill out regarding my experience/studies etc as I'm sure a bunch of other candidates were given too.

I'm seeing a few candidates being scheduled for the phone interviews now and I'm starting to get antsy as I've had no response since last week. I feel like my experience and performance in the coding challenge are good enough to warrant a phone interview but I have some concerns.

1. Am I less likely to be considered for an internship because I'm not from North America? I understand Google pays for flights and accommodation and I'm not surprised if I'd be passed over in favour for someone local and less costly.

2. At my uni and most other unis here we don't use GPAs in favour for a weighted mark out of 100. While my weighted mark is generally above average here (in the 70s where the average is in the 60s) when translated to GPA it looks really bad.

I had an offer last year which I passed on because it was for a non profit, and as far as I know they were short on workers(a ton of red flags). This startup seems to have a product developed and is looking for students to assist with app development. My university does offer internship hours for credit completion, so that would help me finish my required electives.  Should I move forward with this internship? I only have one more summer after this one so I'm afraid that I would have no professional experience in the industry after graduating. If I move forward with this internship, then I plan on staying at my current retail job and work at the startup at the same time. Any advice would be appreciated!

Edit: I have one personal project completed(A keylogger written in C++), and I do plan on working on a couple projects so I can learn Python, regardless of if I get the internship or not.

I'm not. I'm honestly just weak willed. 

I hope this doesn't come off as dismissive toward anyone with actual mental illnesses. In no way am I saying that people who are actually depressed are weak willed, I'm just saying I am. 

I don't feel sad. I do feel anxious all the time, but it's over the silliest of reasons. Said something stupid at work? Better get ready for a 3 week cringe induced anxiety extravaganza. 

Logically I realize that what's in the past is over and done with and that there's no merit in me pining over it, but the most frustrating part is that I can't make myself not feel anxious despite knowing I don't need to feel upset about something so small for such a long period of time. 

A year ago I genuinely liked who I was, but I was sort of just drifting through life not really accomplishing anything. I just went to college and that was it. I wasn't in any student associations, I had no work experience, no research experience, nada. All I had was a good GPA. I decided to do better and forced myself out of my comfort zone.

A year later I have two internships, I have amazing friends that I love dearly, I'm part of a research project, I have an even better GPA, I have extracurriculars, and I met an amazing person that I speak to every day and have a crush on. But I honestly feel worse. I thought I'd be happy but I'm not. I'm not sad, but I just feel upset. 

I tried ignoring it thinking I was having a bad day but it's just gotten more persistent but I think and I worry I somehow enabled these feelings because I'd sometimes indulge them by not doing anything to fix them. However I don't know how to fix something when I don't know what's wrong. 

I honestly have no reason to feel the way I do. In reality I'm just not a strong person. I don't have the knowledge within me to deal with things constructively. 

These feelings are also perpetuating and enabling themselves. For example, since my mind  is pretty much blank all the time, I've become a boring person. I can't hold a conversation to save my life, I have nothing of value to add to a conversation and I have no interest in initiating and much less maintaining conversations. So you can imagine the disaster that occurs when I try to talk and spend time to the guy I like.

I obviously couldn't blame him for losing interest, but the anticipation he will is what drives me insane. If he stopped talking to me, while it would hurt, I'd be able to handle it. A very large part of me is convinced he no longer wants to talk to me because things have changed. Then I obviously feel even more anxious. I can't bring this up because it honestly sounds insecure and borderline psychotic, but it's a symptom of being weak willed. I'm the poster child for Nietzsche's slave morality, completely reactionary. 

Exercising helps tremendously, I can feel like I accomplished something and while I'm exercising my mind is completely blank and it feels quite cathartic. But I struggle to fit it in my schedule. 

This summer I'll try to change my diet and exercise more in attempts to feel better. I'll also be trying to impose on myself a new perspective, a happier one. I'll be in a new place for 10 weeks so hopefully I can use that as a fresh start. 

While it is taxing to have to convince myself constantly how important and valuable it is to keep trying, and how the the destination will justify the journey, it has to be done because it's my own responsibility to take care of myself."

I'm currently a junior in college (technically one semester behind since I took off last semester for personal reasons) so my ETA for graduation would be about December 2020. My major is CIS, and at the moment I have no idea which direction I should go in terms of what I should be doing to make sure I am able to be marketable to companies after graduating. After getting a couple of rejection e-mails from internships I applied to for summertime, I'm coming to terms with the fact that I probably won't have an internship with anyone this summer. I'm pretty much confused about a lot in terms of what skills I should be trying to acquire or in general the best route I can take at this point in undergrad. So this leads to my questions for advice!:

1. Should I be looking into getting certs this summer or just go the self taught route?
2. I'm sure there are a lot of threads already on the many different career pathways you can take with a CIS major, and if anyone knows on would they be able to link it down below in the comments? (Or if you're willing to give a little synopsis of the many different routes than can be taken)

Any interview tips related to what i'm Interviewing for, and any related material I can read to brush up on for this interview would be appreciated. I really am just looking to prep my self as much as I can, because this internship would be EXACTLY what I need right now. The timing of everything in my life has been down right comical, but if this were to fall in line; I could honestly die tomorrow a happy man. Thanks for any help."
bgd3y7,19,2019-04-23,"Midnight Midterm Week Mood Double Feature: How do I make the most of the two years I have left at UCLA? + A stupid, ranting precautionary tale about being a shitty student.",Jean-Hong,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/bgd3y7/midnight_midterm_week_mood_double_feature_how_do/,"Hiya. Second-year CS major here who just wanted some advice about what I should be doing to be able to get the most I can get out of my college experience. I haven't really gotten much done in the past two and my grades are in the damned toilet (at least they're improving), but I wanna try and stay optimistic to see if there's something I should be trying to do.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I wrote this up at first because I wanted to provide some background info in hopes that it'd be useful for anyone who could suggest things I should be trying to do. But, then I realized I started ranting about how my experiences here have been nothing but struggling and pain. Thought about deleting, but then I figured it'd be good warning for incoming freshman to not turn out how I did and make better use of their time here.

In the past two years of undergraduate CS education I've had here at UCLA, I've felt like I've achieved and learned absolutely nothing. If I really had to be pessimistic about it, I'd flat out say that being here has made me feel worse as a human being than I thought would've been going to junior college and staying at home with parents who once referred to me as a ""failed investment."" 

Most of my classes haven't really engaged me at all in my field and I just feel like most of the concepts are too over my head for me to try and understand as well as the rest of the folks in my year.  At the same time, all the stress I put on myself to try and do well in the classes despite my own stupid inability to pay attention and practice good study habits hasn't been good for me mentally or physiologically speaking. I've spent a decent portion of winter quarter without showering, eating, or brushing my teeth because I tell myself I shouldn't be wasting time when I should be studying, but then, like a complete moron, I just end up sitting at my desk reading the same lines out of a textbook over and over again without being able to remember any of it at all. I only stopped because I told my therapist (or counselor, idk what the designation for the folks at CAPs is) about what I was doing and they reminded me that they were a mandated reporter or something and that if I was self-harming myself or something  unhealthy like that they'd need to contact appropriate services about that. So I lied and said I was doing nothing of the sort.

All around me, most of more classmates are getting internships and research positions and getting involved in club activities and I just feel like I'm wasting my time and the school's time by existing and doing nothing. Hell, I even have a few freshman friends who already have their own cool shit planned for the summer in the years to come with the extracurriculars and all that. All the power to them, that's awesome. Makes me feel like shit by comparison when I realized that those are the sort of stuff that I'm going to be compared against when I start applying for full-time positions in a few years with my resume full of whitespace.

I don't think my lack of participation is for a lack of trying, frankly. I've applied a bunch of times to on-campus stuff, gone to career fairs, and checked out research topics on campus. It's all boiled down to me getting rejected several times from DailyBruin and DevX and ACM intern positions, getting a nasty look from a recruiter when my resume is pretty bare bones, and just not being interested in any of the research material available. I've tried to go to more ""available"" workshops for Stats Club, ACM and Creative Labs, and networking/career events from SWE and whoever else hosts companies, but at the end none of that is going to teach me how to work in a group or demonstrate that I have any practical skills whatsoever.

I can't really think of a single time I've been happy to be a student here either. Like, beyond just all that stuff in regards to me being a loser in academics and finding career opportunities, I haven't really felt comfortable in any of my social circles either. I know I should feel glad having people to talk with and to hang out with, but I just feel really unhappy and uncomfortable around them and I just don't know why I feel that way. If I had to be honest, some of the extremely racist, sexist shit about other friends I have and the guys I'm living with really bothers me but I've just learned to just put up with and ignore it it. I've tried looking for new groups of friends to try and get away with them thinking that maybe it's a problem with them that I'm overlooking, but the only thing I've learned from that experience is that regardless of who I hang out with, I still just feel really uncomfortable and out of place. And beyond that, my new friends don't try to include me in the stuff they do as opposed to my older friends so that's been really problematic for me as a fake introvert who gets nervous around new people and then complains about not getting invited to do stuff because I need other people to do that for me.

I've checked in with my academic counselors (several times) and saw a therapist (like once or twice) in order to try and fix whatever issues I have. (I mean, reading the above, there's no way any mature person with their shit together would feel bad for me or be able to sympathize with me since there's no trace of good prospects in me to think of an in optimistic light. After all, I know myself well enough to know that I was just some lucky punk in the CS program taking the place of someone who would've been happier here and better qualified enough to take advantage of the school's resources in ways that I couldn't think of.) My academic counselors have been really helpful in that regard and helped me to better organize my study time better and try to practice better habits. I go to office hours (even if I'm too stupid to have any smart questions to ask) and meet new people to try to work in study groups to stay focused. My therapist, on the other hand, was expensive and less than helpful.

I think the absolute worst thing about my experience here so far and the thing I really want to change the most is the sort of person I'm becoming while I'm here. I really wanted to do something in regards to writing or librarian work when I got here. Like, I spent a decent amount of my high school years just doing creative writing and library work. That was stuff I loved doing and stuff that I felt happy about enough that I would want to try and pursue them from a more professional-like capacity if I could.  Like, I'm in CS because I wanted money, career opportunities, and because I thought I could be good with computers (Spoiler alert: I am not). I really don't give a shit about how much money or what jobs I can get by pursuing this program anymore because I really don't want to keep living if I have to spend the rest of my life being unable to be happy with any achievements I can scrounge up. Unfortunately, I'm several thousands of dollars in debt already, so there's no use in fetishizing the idea that I can just switch majors and ""pursue something I love"" because the reality doesn't work out like that for people who didn't put the work in and who don't have the natural talent, like myself.

After the almost two years I've spent here, I realized that I don't give a shit about any of that anymore. Like, I want to do stuff like write and draw and play games and all of that just feels outright meaningless to me. I can't find any fun in the things I try to do anymore. The funny thing about all that is, is that when I talk with my friends or get asked some personality-focused questions on an interview nowadays, I have to mentally rehearse and look up material to talk about because I genuinely have nothing that I enjoy doing anymore. I just say I enjoy doing crap like drinking or playing cards or playing pool because I want to feel like and be treated like a normal human being with interests who's worth talking to and acknowledging.

Thing is that I seriously do want to try and enjoy my experience here and get more involved with everything and do well in school and try to come out of this prepared for the real world. But for whatever reason, I can't put my mind into being interested with my schoolwork because I just find it boring and uninteresting. I really hate myself for having to put effort into pretending to be interested in stuff so that I can actually learn material, get some sort of professional experience, and make friends with other people. 

If anyone has any advice for how I can fix myself or any input on what I should try doing, I'd really appreciate it.

tl;dr on the advice: Whatever you're studying, try to hit the ground running and stay interested in it and pursue the stuff on your own as soon as you can. Midterms and finals and projects might be hard, just stick it out and stay optimistic and your grades won't be as bad as you think they'd be. If you're not interested in the stuff you study, you better have some strong as fuck willpower or support network to keep you going. If you have anything that you love doing, keep doing it as for as long as it makes you happy. If you ever stop, you might find that you just won't care about it anymore and that's going to grate on you as a person. Try all the new experiences you can get your hand on and get involved in anything you can. Meet new people, stay healthy, and go to lecture even if you're too tired to. In other words, try and be the best student you can be so you can say you at least did that much."

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently a college sophomore at a top cs school double majoring in cs and finance with an internship this summer at an IB as a swe. I've always wanted to be a quant/swe at a cool kid quant fund like Jane Street and 2 Sigma, which is why I double majored in finance. But looking through this sub, it seems like the general consensus is that finance degrees are useless for these roles and even looked down up on.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a couple questions that I hope you guys can give some valuable insights on

&amp;#x200B;

1. In my case, if I want to land an internship at one of these firms next year, what would you suggest?
2. Is a quantitative fundamentals certificate/computational finance minor useful? I would end up taking courses relating to comp fin specific math, probability, and stats.
3. Should I hide the fact that I'm studying finance if I'm applying to firms like JS and 2S?
4. I can attach a data science option track to my cs degree, is that useful?
5. If I need to do a masters to land a job in this industry, what field should it be in?

Thanks for taking the time to answer!"

However, recently I started an internship and found out that I don’t enjoy working on excel, SQL or other softwares all day. I can’t see myself doing this for the next 40 years. I know I can half ass my degree but I don’t want to in the real world. 

What I do like is working and interacting with people, helping people physically, and I like to talk. I don’t plan to have a family to support in the future and my lifestyle is very cheap as I tend to stay away from materialism. I only want to look after both of my parents and support them. So I need enough money for the three of us to live comfortably (their COL is low as well). I would also appreciate if you guys can advice me a career of my interest in the business world first before careers outside of the business world. 

My interests: I like travelling (maybe with my parents), boxing, watching anime, video games, helping people physically, charities, and working with kids (up until the 5th grade) and old people, volunteering, like making an impact and help those in need.

What I don’t like (at least right now): working on a computer 8 hrs a day and doing something that does not add much value to life of others and myself.  

I feel like a desk job will bore me out and depress me. I don’t see the point of a high paying corporate job if I won’t be happy since I believe my COL is low."

  My main question is what kind of Master's programmes I can apply to with my bachelor.

I'm interested in both subjects, so that's not an issue for me. The engineering degree costs more too. But I'll likely be a semester or two behind if I transfer.

I honestly have no idea what I want to do with my career and my future, but I feel that if I transfer, the more well known school will open me up to more opportunities and I feel that math/stats is more versatile as well.

Teachers only can tell you so much before overwhelming you with ""college is hard"" rants. I'm only a sophomore in high school and apparently they expect me to know all of the ins and outs of college. Heck, I haven't even found my college yet. There's too much pressure. 

Anywho, I'll list out a series of questions down below. 

1. Should I apply to a part-time job on the college campus as soon as I get there or after I've been accepted? I'm gonna need one as soon as possible.

2. I've read online that summer internships are best for college. But how would an internship work with the part-time job that I'll have? Could I request a ""pause"" at my job?


3. When exactly do you start studying your major in college? I heard some people say the end of Sophomore year but some other people have said they started Freshman year. 


4. How exactly do you sign up for degrees? Is there a form you fill out in college? I plan on getting my Associates and Bachelor's degrees. But some people have said you don't need an AS to get a BS. I'm confused. Don't you need an AS to get a BS? I know that employers like the BS more than the AS but it only takes 2 years to get an AS while 4 to get a BS (to my understanding). Can't you get both? I'm going to major in Computer Science. 

5. Do people get a job as soon as their 4 years up? Shouldn't I apply a few months before school is out? Do people apply for the jobs that they majored in while in college?"

Basically I want to know what I have to do to get an internship at a proprietary trading firm.

&amp;#x200B;

**How I got into trading/about me**

I'm currently a junior in college. I go to a smaller university (because I wanted to continue my track career) so it's not a targeted one. I had chances to go to bigger schools as my ACTs were decent (Definitely not Ivy league so please don't think that), but track just drew me in. I discovered the markets as a junior in high school and thought it'd be something I'd like to do. Well my parents wouldn't really fund me so I had to take the money I had, a whopping $500, to invest/trade with. At first I thought I would just invest in something like $TSLA at the time and let it set for a year. Then I looked and noticed that if somehow I got lucky and $TSLA would go up 10% I'D MAKE.....$50. Wait then I had my buy and sell fees from etrade, $10 each way, and I'd be left with $30...and thats if the stock did well. I quickly figured out my tiny money couldn't do anything investing wise (at least when it came to short term return). Then I found the solution...PENNY STOCKS. Looking back to that time I remember being nervous as hell. I told my parents what I was going to do, they hated it instantly but I didn't care. I studied every night for at least 2 hours per night. I did this for eight months before I made a trade (this is what helped me not blow my account up at first). Once I started I got a little lucky on my first few trades, but managed to get my account to $2,000. Okay now I'm hooked. Some time passes and I do okay but eventually become undisciplined and blow up my entire account (A right of passage it seems like for day traders but I was crushed at the time). Then came the summer before my freshman year of college with another $1,500 and this time I traded with no emotions. I got that account up to $16,000 by July by doing what I know. Around my sophomore year I started into options because I always want to expand my knowledge. To this day options trading has been okay to me. I still trade pennies better but I do like the change to trading options. (I could go way more into detail but this thing will be 25 pages long).

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I want to intern at a prop. firm**

Basically I love pure trading. I love the way the markets work and all of the discipline it takes to trade in them. A prop firm seems to be the best way to get that pure market experience. Not to say I wouldn't enjoy a career in something else relating to the markets, but this is just my ideal. I've spent the last four years obsessing over the markets and it just seems fitting to make this a career. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I don't think I have a shot**

1. School - Like I said I'm not at a big name school so I know this hurts
2. GPA - My GPA is not great by any means. This isn't really because of my intelligence or work ethic, more because I got incredibly sick my freshman year. I had very harsh thyroid problems and would sleep for over 20 hours a day (worst time of my life). During that time the university treated my like a lazy freshman (Even though I had thousands and thousands in medical bills to prove I wasn't). Most professors were willing to work with me to help me pass and get the highest grade I could get under the circumstances (which I'm thankful for), however some were not. I made the decision by myself to take a 0 in my art class because in my mind I should care more about the classes that my major related to and try to pass those. I still stand by this decision but it did hurt my GPA a lot. If I get an interview I feel I can tell this story and hopefully people will understand, but I can't tell this story on a resume. 
3. Programming - I know this isn't required for all trading, and I'm not trying to do quant trading, however it does seem necessary for a lot of trading positions. I am currently starting online python lessons to help me in this area, but I'm still very new, but I learn fairly quick. 
4. The interview - This one I'm basically 50/50 on. I'm not scared of the mental math as I've always been good at it, however I am nervous that they could stump me on a brain teaser or something. I like to think I'm a good at interviews but that part could get me. 

Basically I'm just looking for advice on how to land an internship at one of these firms. It seems like an uphill battle, but worth it to me. Also if you guys have any other advice on possibly other internships/careers I should look at I'd be all ears.

Also, I have not applied to any of these firms, and now I realize that it's most likely to late unfortunately for this summer, which would have been ideal considering I'll be a senior next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway if you guys actually read all of this I appreciate it, and like I said any advice would be wonderful. Thanks."

So I do intend to go back to college, but not in 2019 instead I want to go back to college staring in Spring 2020. At the moment I want to get myself a Full-Time job, start earning money and saving up. I have the blessing of my parents and they have allowed me to stay with them during this process so a lot of the fees like shelter, food, travel aren't a burden on my head for the time being.

During this time period I want to do another thing as well, along with my job on the side I want start my own gaming blog and YouTube channel. The reason I want to do this is because the career I want to pursue is Video Game Journalism, in fact when I do go back to college that's the Major I want to pursue. I've been told that practice is very key to getting into the video game journalism industry and I think this will be a way for me to improve my writing skills to work in that industry. After I start my gaming blog and YouTube channel I do intend to after some months start to freelance and pitch feature article ideas to publications to gain more practice and experience. This is a way to start gaining experience and grow my portfolio for this career choice.

So its now nearing the end of 2019, I am interested in going back to college, but I don't want to go back to my 4yr college just yet. I intend to go to a local community college of mine to pursue an associates of arts in general studies with a suggested transfer pathway for English majors. This will allow me to attain many of the remaining core classes I need and also includes courses that the Journalism course plan has at the 4yr university I want to go to. I did some calculating and if do a spring, summer, and fall semester throughout 2020 at this community college I will be able to get the associates degree and be ready to transfer to the four year college.

So now from 2021 - 2022 I intend to go to a 4yr college and pursue a BA in Journalism, and the concentration I will be going into is ""Digital and Print Journalism."" I feel like this concentration will be the right fit for the career I want to go into. I did my calculations and I should be able to finish this program by the end of 2022 and if not then by the end of Spring Semester 2023.

During this time when I go to both the colleges I intend to continue to have my job but instead of it being full time, I make it part time, and I also intend to continue my gaming blog and YouTube channel. My intended 4yr college also has internship opportunities for my major and I intend to take advantage of this that way I have more experience for my resume.

After I graduate I intend to start working in the video game journalism industry, and start to finally be in a place in life I will be happy about.

So what are your thoughts? Anything you would change about this? Please give me the feedback, that way I can go through this process in the most efficient manner possible.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it! :D"

I'm about to graduate in a few months with an Econ degree. I have some internship experience but it's with an industry/company that I consider to be highly immoral and I'm looking to switch out of it. I've always been interested in technology/programming, but I decided to switch to Econ after nearly failing a computer science math class my first year at university.   


I realize that I'm going to have to find a job soon after I graduate, and I'm willing to take whatever I can get initially after I graduate. Probably doing something in phone customer service/helpdesk to start out. I'm looking to relocate near Seattle, WA or Arlington, VA after I graduate as I have family members that live in those areas that I would like to live with.   


I would like to eventually transition into IT work as it would be work where I can do (mostly) honest work and where I can work in an office setting. Just curious what the best way would be to break into the IT field? I understand that I've done myself a disservice by getting an econ degree, but I'm willing to start from the bottom and work my way up. I'm also willing to work on getting certifications and all that other good stuff."

I'm in my 3rd year w/ no internships lined up for the summer (half of it was bad app timing on my part, other half was extreme competition at all my on-campus recruiting events). I'm currently planning on taking summer courses, and if I do well this spring and summer I can raise my GPA to a cumulative 3.7 (currently sitting at a 3.4). Now, I don't want to just be taking classes this summer, so I'll also be doing labwork for my research group. My post-grad goals are currently all over the place. I'm leaning towards getting a PhD, but in my case I think I'll need to get a masters first to makeup for an array of reasons I'm not as qualified as other applicants. However, I may want to get an MBA if I decide I like business more than research, and hopefully if I get an internship this fall or next summer (I will be taking a 5th year of undergrad so I can double major in Stats) I can make a better decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, with all that context given, here are my questions:

1. Should I scramble for an internship this summer, or does summer research align better/just as well with my goals?
2. Will employers view me as a black sheep for not getting a junior year internship? Would a senior fall or summer internship fix my situation?
3. Would contributions to open-source projects be an effective way to compensate for no internships this summer? By compensate, I mean improve my chances for a good or even top internship next year."

Siberia of programming? writing obituaries for newspaper? should i move to devops? if i am younger or in no haste for a job i would not, but if i dont start working that, than i will have to return to factory/seasonal work.. but if devops is terrible and theres no chance that i will get back on trwck for software development than maybe its better for me to enjoy some freedom through manual labor i am interest for opinion from seasoned developers or some person who does something thats within a scope of devops or similar to it thanks"

This seems to be the most appropriate thread as i'm interested in a tech company but a non tech role.

Any advice on how to obtain a non tech position at a top 10 tech company without driving myself insane? Do they have a system that scans your resume and simply looks for key words?

Most of my peers here are target school grads who scored at top 10 companies but with a wealth of intern experience, so I was surprised to discover on LinkedIn that a significant amt. of non tech roles there have been filled by non target school grads - not at ALL implying these people are unintelligent/under qualified.

I don't think I have a chance otherwise, but my parents are adamantly against a gap year. They think that I won't get an internship during the gap year and thus the whole point of my gap year will be wasted, or they think that I'll be enamored by something else during my gap year and won't go to school, despite me saying plenty of times that neither of these things will happen. Instead of UChicago Econ, they want me to go to CMU CS instead. 

I don't know how to convince them that I think that UChicago Econ will help me get to Wharton much easier, which is my eventual goal. I don't have any problems with going to CMU, but I love UChicago so much more and I don't want to miss out on the school just because of a gap year."

Well, there was one more puff around October or September, and I don't know whether it was weed or vapor. It was like a long pen; my friend handed me, and I took really long breath, which caused to hurt my neck for a while, lol. After then, I have never touched weed or anything like that. I just don't like those stuff...

The problem lays with my housemates. They could do it outside, and this is a better option. I don't know why they risk themselves for smoking in college apartment, but here it comes. They do twice a week (sometimes once). When they do that, it's strong enough to penetrate to my room (they are doing in their living room). I can clearly smell it, but no inhale nor feeling it. I went through the living room a couple of times to get to refrig or my room. I told them to stop since I am doing a drug test before. It didn't work obviously, since they are irresponsible brats...I don't sit with them. I just stayed inside my room with a roommate.

Today, I woke up at 6 am, and I took a bus to lab to take the test. No water or whatsoever (it was urine test). The urine was pretty thickkkk....

If the test comes out positive, I will explain to my internship company, which seems kinda not so successful option...

I’ve come to realize that....I’m sleeping too much and I’m lacking motivation, and when I do have that motivation it drains as soon as my brain starts thinking “ugh, it’s too much work.”   I do not WANT to be that way. I want to be more responsible...hell I know I can be responsible, but as soon as I arrive from college, my body disconnects from everything and falls asleep immediately my body touches a sofa. 

I’ll explain. 

I suffer from insomnia, a really bad case of insomnia and ADHD which, unfortunately is untreated. My mother doesn’t believe in ADHD nor psychologist so it’s kind of difficult right now. Regarding my insomnia issue I’ve told my mom and dad, but they don’t want to take me to a doctor because..well...they say it’s because I am not sleeping. Well duh, I cannot sleep. It’s not because I stay up all night on the phone and computer but because I’m struggling with sleep. I don’t feel “sleep” I lock my electronics away in a drawer and go to bed.  I stay there waiting desperately for sleep to claim me, but it doesn’t. It does like....an hour after I need to go to college. 

College starts at 7 o’clock...in the morning. I have to wake up at 6 am, and I end up sleeping at 4:55 am... 

I even started taking sleeping pills but it ain’t working. For me....sleeping at night is a privilege cuz it’s something that I rarely have. 

I reckon it’s the damn ADHD.

But that shouldn’t be an excuse, for I should be able to perform like a normal human being...wake up, go to college, work....etc...


But you know what pains me? What makes me feel so undeserved? 


In Mid January an acquaintance of mine, who is a fashion designer, was looking for interns. I told her I was interested but I had no experience in the fashion world and that I wanted to learn (I wanna be a fashion designer) she told me that there was no issue and even offered herself to become my fashion design teacher, she is teaching me ALL.  

I am wasting it...I’m wasting that opportunity. I go there two days every week, but due with my damn sleeping issues I always end up falling asleep after college and when it’s time to go....it’s late cuz not even the damn alarm can wake me. 

Yes, I do go to the internship. But like...one week and then the second week I end up asleep, the next week I go... and so on. 

The designer told me that I needed to be more responsible and I sure as hell agree with her. We spoke on the phone today. Asked me if Inas really interested in this internship because it doesn’t look like I’m taking it seriously....I am. Hell, the internship is the only thing keeping me sane from that hellhole of a college that I am in!  I hate it....It’s also been giving me issues with my self esteem...I will transfer to another college....but I am afraid that my credits won’t transfer. That’s my fear cuz I don’t want to be in the air and be like “I haven’t graduated yet”. I feel stuck, I am stuck.

I promised the designer that I’ll change because I really like going there but I have been having issues with myself that I’m battling daily, but I will change. I told her I’ll go this Friday and from now on... I won’t skip. She told me she was going to give me an opportunity. I was relieved. 

But I feel like I don’t deserve it. I mean, this....this is huge....getting an internship (where I live) it’s difficult. There are people that would die to get one and here I am wastin it.... 

I can’t waste it but I do FEEL SAD and I want to cry. This is my first time in an internship....I’m 20 years old...I need to keep up my game, dammit.

I am scared that I’ll screw up this Friday...I need help...I don’t know what to do! 

I apologize for any grammar mistakes...."

About 4 years ago I moved to NYC for an internship and stayed for 2 years working between jobs. It wasn’t perfect, but I felt completely self-reliant and had a lot of freedom to grow.

Unfortunately, I was feeling a little lonely and rashly moved home(Denver.) 18 months later, I still feel like I made the wrong move.

Both places have their pluses but i’ve very much half-assed everything here because i’m unsure if I want to settle down. 

Benefits of Denver.
Cheaper rent. 
Best friends live with me. 
Access to hiking.

Negatives of Denver.
My really challenging relationship with my mom.
1 hour commute on bus with bike.
Lack of arts(it’s okay if you disagree with that.)
Unsure I can find a job to grow at.

Currently i’ve been at the same marketing agency for 18 months and i’m kind of tapped out on growth. My job search hasn’t been going great...

Benefits of NYC.
Ample job opportunities.
Fun friend group.
I feel inspired to be around architecture.
Public transportation.

Negatives of NYC.
Away from best friends. 
Higher rent + less room for my dog. 
Guilt of moving away from Mom who is having a difficult time.

My timeline to make a decision is within the next month. My lease is up August 8, but i’d need to let my roommates know by July. 

I need to find a new job regardless in which city, and obviously finding a job out of state is a lot more challenging. 

I just feel so stuck, one week I am swaying towards one way and the next the other. I hate being indecisive.

Any guidance from fellow lovers of two places would be helpful."

This Summer I am going to take linear algebra and I plan on doing paid research with one of my professors, if I'm lucky I might be able to get my name published in a research paper. I applied to internships this past year , recently I had an interview with this company a couple weeks ago. I did great in my interview and then later I had to do an assessment with them online. It was an 8 minute timed assessment but during it my computer crashed and when I went back to restart it I wasn't able to . I sent an email to let them know and I got no reply back so I figured my chance with that company is over. Now I am applying to more internships to see if I can get something last second. If I don't get anything and just end up doing research and taking this class this summer will I still be in a good position to get a job when I graduate? I currently am getting contacted by recruiters for full time positions but I can't take anything yet because my degree is important to me and I want to finish that first. My concern is that if I don't get a decent internship this Summer too much time will have passed before I have actual software-related work experience and I won't be able to get anything when I graduate. Thanks for reading , I am happy to receive feedback.

TLDR: is research with a professor a good substitute for an internship in terms of getting a job upon graduation?

edit: if you downvote me could you please give me some feedback on what I'm doing wrong? thank you!"
bgq6t4,3,2019-04-24,Background checks,jobs4lifey,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bgq6t4/background_checks/,"To whom is reading this, long story short in 2017 I gave birth to my daughter at 18. I was in my senior year of high school and was in complete denial of the reality of my situation. I was a mom, I wasn’t ready, I didn’t want to be a mom, I wanted to be able to live my life as if it never happened. At this period of time I had extreme post-partum depression and was not dealing with it, and to be honest I was not even aware of it. My parents tried to help me and I refused. I ended up being charged with a domestic assault  as a misdemeanor and am currently working to complete probation. I am and have been compliant and law abiding. I am going to college and am double majoring in community psychology and criminal justice and am doing much better. I am going to therapy, raising my daughter and pursing the goals I need to in order to ensure that my child and I have a secure and safe future. I have been applying and currently am more than likely to get an offer from Capitol One as a Customer Solutions Specialist, and I am excited to have this opportunity so close. It is a call center type job. I am fearing that this charge may exclude me from the job even despite me having written a letter on the situation, and getting documentation to legitimize the mental health aspect. I realize completely what happened was in no way shape or form okay and it kills me everyday. It kills me when I am looking for internships, looking for jobs, when I look at my daughter, my parents, and my own self in the mirror to realize the effects that have resulted. I am wondering if anyone has had a similar situation. Has getting jobs with a misdemeanor domestic assault been super difficult in call center or not one on one physical contact type of jobs? What advice do you have? I personally always disclose everything upfront as to be honest because they will find out anyway but this shows your character and some integrity. If you are a HR person or a hiring person for a company what would you say?"
bgqcxi,1,2019-04-24,How can I decide between two different job offers as a recent graduate?,Capable_Indication,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bgqcxi/how_can_i_decide_between_two_different_job_offers/,"Hello redditors,

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really appreciate your input/perspective! As the title says, I'm having trouble trying to decide between job offers as the positions are very different from one another.

A brief background - I graduated with a degree in business admin with a concentration in finance from a top 30 school and my internships have been focused on financial services/financial analysis. I've been concentrating on getting a job that's analytical in nature with good opportunities for growth, and now have two different paths I could take ....

&amp;#x200B;

Job A: 

A position as a financial analyst at a well known defense contractor, doing work that I'd be pretty familiar with but that allows me to learn substantial technical skills . In addition, I'd be able to deepen my accounting knowledge that I can use in a variety of roles further down the road (thinking about long term skill building). This culture seems laid back/easygoing, and I could see myself being friends with my coworkers. The potential negatives are that it ends up pigeonholing me into this industry, along with lower starting pay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Job B:   
A position facilitating sales at a public tech/software company. This position is broad in nature, meaning it incorporates strategy, analysis, and sales enablement. Further, it's a newly created position at the company, and I would be wearing multiple hats with the ability to work with many departments. The pros to this job are that I would work with very intelligent, accomplished individuals that have come from other top tech companies and I could learn from them. On the flip side, I'm having trouble envisioning what I could do down the road with skills gained here, as the responsibilities are more broad (as it's newly created), as well as not necessarily focused on developing technical skills as much as Job A. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other factors: Job B pays \~$10k more annually, but I'd also have more of a commute. Job A is closer to where I want to live, and the culture/people are very laid back which is nice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Do I take Job A with a well defined path developing my finance/accounting technical skills while being in a relaxed environment that pays a bit lower, or do I take Job B with broader responsibilities, higher expectations (potentially more stress too), but also pays higher than Job A?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading. I have to let both know this week."

bgqgxs,0,2019-04-24,No Summer Internship Yet,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bgqgxs/no_summer_internship_yet/,"Sorry for another one of these posts, but I’ve seen very useful advice specific to people so I figured posting was a good idea. I’m a junior majoring in CS and Physics and I don’t have a summer internship yet. I applied to about 20 companies.  I applied to a fair range of companies in terms of size / name recognition / positions. I know this is not as many as other people apply to, but I’ve found that applications seem particularly straining on top of my classes (not really sure how other people grind out hundreds of applications).  A portion of the positions I applied to are quantum computing positions since that is my main field of interest, but I also applied to various software engineering and data science positions. 

From those applications, I got 4 interviews. Three of them resulted in rejections. I still have not heard back from the fourth, despite the interview being 10 weeks ago. I’ve assumed rejection at this point, but the companies interview portal still says they are reviewing my application. I’ve tried contacting both my recruiter and recruitment at the company in general with no luck. A lot of companies never responded to me which I found very discouraging. 

I put a good deal of time into my applications, tailor my resume, and write cover letters. I feel like my biggest weaknesses are my GPA and my lack of experience. I’ve tried to resolve that by separating my physics and CS GPA’s and adding relevant coursework to my resume. My overall GPA is a 3.57. The physics major at my school is curved to a B, so my GPA is brought down by my physics GPA. Separated, the physics GPA is 3.27, and the CS GPA is above a 3.7, which I feel like is good enough for CS employers.

My last job was before my sophomore year, where I filled a minor technical roll for a small consulting firm. I haven’t worked projects outside of my coursework, so I have resorted to listing relevant coursework on my resume. I’ll be taking a ninth semester in fall 2020, so this isn’t my last summer to get an internship, but in general I feel very discouraged and jaded about the process after so many no-replies. I’d still like to find a job for this summer if it’s possible; any advice is appreciated."
bgqhqx,124,2019-04-24,An Introduction to Greek Llife,wellshit2322,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bgqhqx/an_introduction_to_greek_llife/,"So this was originally going to just be a reply to a comment but I think theres a general lack of knowledge of Greek Life is on this sub so hopefully this can be a helpful resource for people leaving for college. Maybe this could be added to the wiki or something idk. 

**What is Greek Life?**

Greek life is another word for fraternities and sororities. In general, fraternities are for guys and sororities are for girls. This isn't always the case though, theres LGBT frats/sororities, co-ed frats centered around engineering, business, the environment, certain ethnicities etc. In general terms, a fraternity/sorority is a group of people committed to a certain organization that brings them together in some way. 

Typically, frats/sororities have their own houses for members to live in, hang out in. Oftentimes they have a chef to make meals for the members.

It should be noted that Greek life is different at every school. It may be more chill, intense, expensive, cheap, etc. It all depends on the school and its culture.

A few terms:

- Rush: the recruitment process for frats/sororities. Typically a bunch of events that serve to let potential new members get to know the houses at

- Pledging: the process of which a new member joins a fraternity

- Initiation: The act of a ""pledge"" becoming a full new member of a fraternity

- Active: Someone who's gone through the pledging process and is now a full member of a house

- Dues: The money you have to pay to be in a house

- Mixer: Sort of a mini-party between usually one fraternity and one sorority. Can or cannot involve alcohol, may or may not be at a separate venue

**My Experience with Greek Life and the Rush Process** 

I transferred to my current school (USC). I had always said I never wanted to join a frat (I'm a dude) but I figured I would at least go out to rush and check it out as I wanted to meet new people. 

Rush is basically another word for recruitment. It works different for every school, but for me it was spread out over around a week. For the first couple days, you go up and down and visit all the different houses. At each house, you get a tour and try to talk to as many of the guys there as possible. Every house attracts a different type of person so it's really trying to find a group of people you think you could see yourself fitting in with. At my school theres the really fratty dude-bros but theres also houses full of guys super dedicated to what they do, houses full of guys super down-to-earth and friendly, etc. 

After the first couple of days, each house holds their own events (like a BBQ, golfing, etc) that you can attend to get to know the house better. At that point, if they're interested in you they'll invite you to another event and potentially give you a bid (invitation to join the house).


**Pledging**

At this point, if you decide to accept your offer, you are a ""pledge"" for the first semester. This is typically when all the ""hazing"" you hear about would occur. I'm not going to lie to you and say that hazing doesn't happen anywhere anymore, but I can say with 100% confidence that if you're rushing a decent, worthwhile house, you won't ever be forced to do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe.

The point of pledging is to get you closer together with your pledge class (group of guys pledging that semester). Activities are designed to bring you close together. They may seem stupid at the time, but looking back you'll see them as hilarious memories that helped you really bond with your fellow class. For example, you may have a weekend camping trip with a challenge list that you and your pledge class ""have to"" complete. You might also have to periodically set up for events, clean up, etc. Typically you pledge for a semester or quarter or whatever.  Overall, the process helps foster a sense of belonging and commitment to the house that you have put some much work into. 


**What Do You Do in Greek Life?**

Now that you're active in a house, you have a lot more freedom. You don't ""have"" to go to any event except for maybe a chapter meeting once a week or so where you discuss house logistics, etc. Greek life is probably more ""intense"" at USC than most schools. Every week, we have mixers and events with sororities, with parties probably twice a month or so, with events with just the house members every so often as well, such as beach trips, etc. In your free time, you have a great place to hang out with your friends, study, chill, etc. 

It can be easy to get too caught up in Greek life and do nothing but hang at the house all day, but I've found it can be a very valuable tool to balance your life in a world of hard classes. As an engineering major, it's good to just have things to go to if I have time, It forces me to be social and leave the library which is good for your mental and physical well being. It helps you forget all your stresses, clear your mind, etc. 


**Why Join Greek Life?**

Overall, it really serves as a great support network and helps give you a sense of belonging in the daunting and new experience that is college. In a big school like USC, you can sometimes feel like just a face in a crowd, but with my fraternity, it's great to have a lot of familiar faces. Imagine having a super tight group of friends, just like you did in middle school. But now you have a sick house to hang out at organized events, a chef, etc. There are members in my house that help run startups, do research, and all in all do incredible things. One of the founding members of a Goldman Sachs office son is in my house. It's great to be surrounded with so many people with diverse interests that I have a close bond with. If you live in the house, it's like living with 20 or 30 of your best friends in a sick space that belongs to you. 

Almost everyone in Greek life at my school is involved with events all throughout campus; people in my house and sororities are involved with engineering teams, consulting clubs, student government, etc. I probably would never have met these people had I not joined Greek life. 

Houses will also have connections nationwide. For example, one of the head recruiters for a major engineering company is an alumni of my house and has helped out members in the past get internships, etc. If you're in an engineering/business/professional fraternity this is especially true.

All in all, Greek life has gave me a very tight group friends all within my first semester at a new school. It's given me some very found memories and friendships that I wouldn't give up for the world.

Greek life can do wonders to someone. I was always a socially awkward kid growing up, but joining a frat has really helped me become a more sociable, outgoing person. I'm now much more comfortable around the opposite sex (you get the idea) and its really helped me become a better communicator and I have no doubt it will contribute to my success in the future. 

**How Much Does it Cost?**

Again, depends a lot on the school in the house. It can range anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand a term/semester. I'm not going to pretend it isn't geared towards the privileged, but many houses and schools offer scholarships. I personally pay my dues through work.  In general I believe sororities are more expensive than fraternities.


**FAQs/Myths**
(will update if necessary)

&gt; Greek life is just for superficial people that drink beer and do nothing all day

There will be houses that do this. Some people like this. That's okay. A lot of people don't. That's okay. Find a house that isn't like that and that you see yourself fitting in with

&gt; I'm interested in joining a house but I don't want to be hazed.

If a house ever forces you to do something that you truly are uncomfortable doing, then don't join that house. Plenty will not.

&gt; What's the difference between a club and a frat/soro?

In general, Greek life is much bigger and there is overall a greater sense of community and commitment to a house. You might make a lot of friends through clubs/organizations but IMO you'll be much closer (much faster) with people in a Greek organization. 

&gt; Does Greek life instigate or cover up sexual assault?

Part of the pledging process for us is seeing how people act around in social situations. If someone gives the slightest hint of being creepy they are instantly dropped from the fraternity.

My fraternity is pro-consent and pro-reporting. No one in my house would hesitate to report someone else in the house for anything along the lines of sexual assault and were proud of it. Fraternities that instigate and allow such behavior should be shut down and punished.





Greek life has a bad reputation for sure, but don't let that make you think everyone involved is bad.


I hope this helps inform people about what Greek life really is. It's not for everyone, but I definitely encourage everyone to go check out rush at a minimum to see what it's all about. If you don't see anything you like, at least you've gotten some free food. 

Feel free to ask and questions or pm me or whatever. I'll do my best to address everything in a timely manner."

It's really come down to me vs. my parents on the school I like vs. the school that they think is higher ranked and will give me a better career outlook. I've toured both campuses and I need help deciding which one will be better in the long run.

&amp;#x200B;

For Northeastern:

* Good co-op program that gets me a paid job as early as soph year, I really liked hearing about people's experiences with it
* I really like the campus and surrounding city environment
* I enjoyed talking to students and sitting in a lecture, could see myself making a lot of use of my time here
* Want to study in the East Coast
* I feel like private schools (most of them) give more personal guidance, smaller classes, and are less cutthroat
* Few general ed requirements with my AP credit (I don't even have to take science) so I can focus more on CS

&amp;#x200B;

For UCSD:

* Better recruiting outlook in CA/Silicon Valley and the starting salary is higher
* There aren't students from 30+ other schools in your area competing for internships
* Much higher ranked in CS by authoritative sources
* Even with Northeastern's Dean scholarship, the in-state tuition is hard to beat
   * Money is not an issue for us, but it's nice to save anyways
* I also vibed with the students there and even made friends with a Big 4 recruiter
* Parents are really for it, but I'm not

&amp;#x200B;

In CS, I'm looking for a curriculum that prioritizes CS courses over other engineering/science courses. Would prefer project-based practical learning over theory. Would prefer to deal with software more and less hardware. Getting the time to do my own side-projects and live my own life is important. I would like to get involved with the startup scene and maybe specialize in data science while in college."

bgvmdp,59597,2019-04-24,TIFU by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.,Donthitsubmit3,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bgvmdp/tifu_by_submitting_hardcore_furry_erotica_instead/,"So, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. One of the classes I was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. While the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. For our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. I did my paper on helium-3 power generation. I worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. The papers were due last night at midnight and I held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. This is where I fucked up big time.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I don't work a normal job. I tried it in my first year of school and I really didn't like it. I've worked internships when they came up but outside of that I really didn't “work”. This and being a student really doesn't mix well though. So, I had to make money some way. For the past 3 years I've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. Specifically, for furries. I would write anything. Any fetish, any premise, anything. In some parts of that community I became really popular. At one point I was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts I charged  to my customers. Am I proud of this? No. I have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. I told myself the minute I got a “real” job I was cutting and running from this work.

Well, this brings us to last night. I had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. I had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. I was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. I was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. I ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. However, instead of submitting my final paper, I somehow submitted one of the commissions I was working on. This commission is not light either. It is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

So, I went to bed. Submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. When I woke up this morning I checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

I want to fucking die right now. I don't know how I'm going to explain why instead of my final I submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. But yeah, I fucked up big time.

Tl:Dr: In my final semester at college. Instead of submitting my final research paper, I submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. Professor “want's to talk” and I want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

obligatory update:

Well, I just left his office and I still want to die. Not as much though. I took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  I won't lie, When I sat down with him I was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. I guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

I ran down pretty much everything I said here. While he didn't agree with the avenue I was taking to make money he understood why I was doing it.

He had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""Customer\_Commission\_2nd draft.doc""). I've taken a class from him before and was an A student so he guessed I had submitted the wrong file on accident. He told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

I gave him the copy I brought and he accepted it. He told me to email him the file and he would replace the one I had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" He seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what I had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

Like I said. I still want to fucking die right now. At least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . Thanks I guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown."

What is the best way for me to break into the field?",Bernak_Obanders,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/bgvxt9/working_towards_an_it_bachelors_degree_am_a/,"Title

Right now my classes are wrapping up and I am giving it my all to find an Internship this summer, paid or un-paid. Current plan is to look up basically every single IT related internship position through Google, My schools career services, and I will make a Glassdoor and LinkedIn profile this weekend to start. Most of these positions are requesting a 3.0 gpa, and my current GPA is 2.94, and my grades this semester should bump it up to at least a 3.05. I'm considering widening my search to part time jobs as well, but since I do not have prior work experience I don't know if I should. Chances are I will accept the first offer I get since I sent around 20-25 applications so I will try to take what I can get, and it would probably be a support desk position. No certifications, but my final semester will have a Cisco class, which is essentially just preparing me for a Cisco certification test, not sure which one exactly though.

That's my plans, are there any other things I can do to maximize my chance at breaking into the field?

Edit: Also throwing this in, I am the first generation of my family in America to receive higher education, so networking through family is not an option for me, although I am trying to network through my school."

Given that I have a good chance of being admitted into at least one of Cambridge, Imperial College London, Edinburgh and UCL for CS (all top 25 global for CS), would it even be worth applying to any US universities?

I started with a Udacity ""intro to programming class"" about 3 months ago, which covered html, css, python, javascript. I'm currently shadowing/interning with some enterprise C# developers, which is an amazing opportunity for me to get a foot in the door since I don't have the time or money for school. I'm learning a ton, but so much of it is flying over my head and it's discouraging.  


I started doing some C# pluralsight courses and was pretty committed to learning this language. For one reason, because its used the job I'm interning / shadowing with and I'll need to know it if I ever want to apply. I also just enjoy it, even though it's extremely challenging trying to learn it alone.    


Today I brought a stupid WPF app I've been working hard on upstairs to my internship, and the devs all told me that I'm wasting my time learning wpf and should learn angular.   Angular uses typescript which is a completely different direction than the one I'm heading, but I know they are probably right, its way more relevant.  I really want to learn how to use angular, but I also know C# should probably be a priority since its relevant to the internship. At the same time I learn better by creating and wanted to make this application to learn and because I enjoy doing it, wont be able to make it without knowing angular.  


I'm just lost, I have no idea what to focus on, how to learn alone and with what resources, which language I should prioritize, and if learning a framework while learning c# is a bad idea.  For those who learned alone, what advice can you give me?  I'm dealing with so much stress in my life right now that this is really discouraging me.  I DO feel like I'm learning, but like I said, when I go upstairs to shadow I'm literally lost with half the things they are saying. Am I too stupid for this? I feel like I'm being pulled all over the place by 50 different potential languages and frameworks etc..."

I honestly thought my career was over (along with the paycheck, medical insurance and retirement benefits that my wife and son also depend on) and I would soon have to choose between selling drugs, selling my butthole, or selling drugs that I keep in my butthole.  
  
  
So, for the backstory.... I am employed by a state government agency that I dont want to share on reddit (it's nothing involving badass law enforcement or something cool, I just dont want to dox myself). I make a pretty good living now, but I have been employed there from the ""coffee boy"" days and had risen to be the dude that gets to drink that delicious coffee brought in by the intern. Basically, I wouldnt ever find a similar position elsewhere without taking a pretty significant hit in pay, title and responsibility. I wasn't planning on going anywhere until they made me or I could retire.  
  
A few months ago I hired a very nice, younger woman for an entry level position. She was coming into the field straight out of college but learned quickly and had become one of my ""go-to"" people.  
  
Our office is small, so we all get to know each other fairly well. Through day-to-day conversation I found out that my newbie (we'll call her Mabel) had immigrated to the US from Cuba as a very young girl with her mother. They are directly descended from the Yoruba people of western Africa (tbh I had never heard this word until she explained it), and, while they made a conscious effort to assimilate into their new American culture, still maintained strict adherence to certain cultural practices (from what I gathered this was mostly religious practices). It was all really interesting things that I had never even read about, let alone spoken to someone with first hand knowledge. I have to say, I actually became pretty damn learned when it came to the Yorubas and their beliefs/practices.  
  
Every so often the daily tasks start to creep into the time I should have allocated for managerial stuff (reviews, vacation requests, shit like that) so about once a month I would push all my people out early to enjoy their lives so I could work on my responsibilities uninterrupted (I would generally be in the office until around 8 pm on those nights. I never minded these catchup days. I would head down to the corner store and grab a 6 pack of whatever beer caught my eye and usually order a pizza when I got hungry. It was actually a really relaxing time (I have a 3 year old. I'm sure anyone else with kids can understand what I'm saying).  
My boss was well aware of the fact that this was how I preferred to operate and, since I am salaried and very rarely miss any deadlines, had no issue with my monthly cram sessions (you can probably guess that this is no longer the case).  
  
Anyways, fast forward (or rewind?) to three fridays ago. It was about 6:30 and I was doing my thing, blasting my old man music from my youth known as grunge. I was on my 2nd beer, and honestly I was starting to get that ""fuck yeah, I'm all caught up on my workload"" feeling of satisfaction. The song Territorial Pissings by some one hit wonder band you've probably never heard of named Nirvana started up and, deciding that I deserved some fun before the commute home, grabbed a pen in each hand and started beating the fuck out of my desktop calendar. My drumming synced up perfectly. The crowd was going crazy. My receding hairline suddenly sprouted and morphed into shoulder length black hair. I was Dave fuckin' Grohl!  
  
So there I sat in my office chair, a 40 year old office manager who drives a Volvo drumming on my desk like autism was going out of style. Anyways, the song started winding down and, remembering that I wasn't the drummer of the biggest band in the world and it sure as shit wasnt 1993 I thought to myself ""alright self, fun time is over. Knock the rest if this work out so you can get home before the kid goes down for the night"" and started turning my attention back to the excel spreadsheet on the screen in front of me. Then, it happened... the music... that twangy, well-known riff... could it be?...There's no way....  
  
A smile crossed my face and I knew exactly what was about to happen. I was going to have to rock out to this song too. I mean, shit, who doesn't get pumped when they hear some Sublime? See, told you.  
  
So yeah, there I was again. This time though I couldn't be Dave Grohl of Nirvana, nope, now I was Bradley Nowell from Sublime. The intro guitar riff hit that perfect note to let me know that was my cue. I was going to sing the undies off every woman this side of the Mississippi.  
  
My note met Brad's fucking perfectly. In that super distinct voice I belted out the first line: ""I dont practice Santeria! I ain't got no crystal ball...""  
  
You all arent stupid and I'm sure you have figured out what was going on. Yep, Mabel had left her phone in her desk drawer and had made it almost all the way home before realizing that she would have to wait until Monday morning to retrieve it if she couldn't make it back before I took off. So she sped back to the office and currently found herself looking at an obvious case of Traumatic Brain Injury.  
  
I still hadn't realized I had said anything offensive (if you dont already know, another name for the Yoruba religion is yep, you guessed it, Santeria) and thought I was only going to have to deal with embarrassment. I hurriedly hit mute on my computer and turned toward her with a sheepish grin, hoping that she would be cool enough to not rip on me too hard in front of everyone on Monday. Instead of a shit-eating grin on her face like I anticipated, though, her bottom lip trembled, a tear rolled down her cheek, and she screamed ""my mother dealt with this shit her whole life, and prayed every day after my birth before her igbadu that I would never have to deal with the same! I guess that would have been asking too much!"" and stormed out as I stammered like a stroke survivor in front of her. She turned and sprinted out the door, jumped in her car and peeled out of the parking lot, obviously still crying and VERY upset.  
  
Finally, my dumbass brain actually did its job and deduced everything that had just happened. ""Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck"" was about all I could mumble as I tried desperately to find my phone. I had to clear this misunderstanding up immediately. I was able to calm myself slightly by remembering that I had always been nothing but courteous and respectful to her. She would understand, right? I could even play the song for her to prove it, and explain that I had no clue as to the meaning of ""Santeria"". I finally found her name on my phone and, taking a deep breath, I hit the send button... only to hear that annoying fucking ringtone she had emanating from deep inside her desk drawer.  
  
I went home and spent the most uncomfortable, agonizing two days of anyone in the history of weekends. My wife did her best to reassure me but the doubt wouldnt quit lingering. Finally Monday rolled around and I drove to work, hoping and praying that Mabel would at least allow me to explain myself before the HR complaint had been filed.  
  
No dice. HR lady greeted me at the office door and beckoned for me to follow her to her glade scented execution chamber. The complaint was career ending, especially for a managerial position. The story had been long and detailed, but the summary of it was as follows: I was in the office well past any of my employees, and appeared to be preparing to spend the night there. A newly hired employee (Mabel) had returned to retrieve her property from her desk when she came upon me sitting at my desk, drinking alcohol and listening to music very loudly. As she was about to speak to me I stared straight ahead screamed at her for her religion, telling her I would never practice it, then turned to look at her and smiled.  
  
As you can imagine at this point I gave up hope. I was told to exit the building through the back door and stay home for the day, and I would be contacted that evening with a decision regarding the future of my employment.  
  
After all of this shit, you know what the kicker was? HR lady had another conversation with Mabel, and even played the song for her and asked her if it was possible that my account was true. She adamantly retracted her violation referral, and, since Mabel is perhaps the coolest fucking person ever, made sure that everything was quickly returned back to normal by signing all the necessary HR shit required to retract her complaint. My job was saved. Mabel and I had a long talk the following morning and we couldn't have a more respectful boss-employee relationship.  
  
I know what you're thinking... if this dude didn't lose his job then what the fuck is this story doing on r/tifu. Well, here it is. Here is what I lost for my fuck up:  
  
  
""Effective immediately, all employees (to include managment) must exit and secure the building by 6pm daily unless approved to stay later through the Director"". Now I cant rock the fuck out \*and\* i have to get all my work done in a timely manner.

  


Oh yeah and if anyone is wondering why I included so many details about this situation... IRL Mabel has consented to the posting of it and is currently reading it while laughing.

  


TL;DR Forgot that I was a middle aged office bitch instead of a rock God and in the process managed to fuck up the only way a procrastinator like me can complete work on time."

He gave me his contact and I reached out to him, and got a reply the next day. That person emailed me back saying that they are running an unpaid internship over the summer, which allows the interns to have access to all their products and tools, and work on a project that ultimately won't be used in their product, but will have the luxury of being mentored by the engineers at the company. They said they'll identify any gaps and put me on an educational program to fill in any gaps of my skills. They mentioned this program is purely for an educational experience, and they are also interested in seeing where this goes. I would have to go through a regular engineering interview to see if I am a good fit. I am planning to interview no matter what, just so that I can get that experience interviewing. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the first time I've ever received an email back from a company. This company is a small startup so it's not anywhere near the big companies. My question is:

1. Is there any red flags here? I am new to identifying anything important in internships/jobs in software engineering
2. If given the opportunity, should i take the unpaid internship because a summer internship is better than no internship? 
3. Is there an issue with having the project we're working on 100% for sure not going to be used by the company? How will that effect me talking about my experience in this startup for future interviews?
4. Since I don't drive, the commute will be about $50 round trip if I Uber. Public transport will take me 4 hours round trip. Is it wrong to ask if they can cover my commute cost?

----

--October 29th--

“Are you _sure_ this is a good idea?” Mike hissed. He glanced over his shoulder, certain that Morgue Security would come along any second. Jemma was on patrol tonight, and she fought dirty.

“It’ll be fine,” Tim whispered back. “We get in, we inject the reanimation formula into as many bodies as possible, and we get ourselves a zombie army for Halloween.”

“And you’re certain that you worked out all the kinks?”

“Yep.”

“Absolutely?”

“One hundred and ten percent. Have you got that lock open yet?”

“Ten seconds ago.”

“Why didn’t you say? Okay, as we planned. You take the left side of the room, I’ll take the right.” Tim passed a bag full of filled needles to Mike and skipped, yes literally skipped, over to the nearest bank of freezers. “Come to me, my zombie army. Rise for papa!”

Mike rolled his eyes, clearly Tim had indulged in a few too many Monsters, and set to work on his half of the morgue.

--October 31st: Halloween, mid-morning--

The sounds of screams and weapons fire echoed through the Galactico buildings. If one was to look out of a window, they would see beings of multiple species fleeing from a horde of other beings. A closer look would reveal that some have the appearance of the recently-deceased. Of those that still look alive, all have a fresh bite mark somewhere upon their person, still sluggishly leaking blood, or their species’ version of it.

One might also notice that the weapons fire is mostly ineffective. A few of the shambling horde fall, but not many. Those with destroyed lower limbs continue to crawl, undeterred by what should be fatal injuries.

The humans gathered in the labs are not looking at these details out of the window. For a start, there are no windows in these particular labs. And they don’t need to look. Humans _know_ what a zombie apocalypse looks like, although their version of it is _usually_ a mono-species one.

“Timothy Jon McInson, what in Winterfell’s name were you _thinking_? The reanimation formula was labelled, in big red letters **DO NOT USE**!” A statuesque blonde woman was pacing the front of the room, ranting at the hapless self-titled Zombie King. “It wasn’t _ready_ for deployment.”

“I thought I’d worked out all of the issues with it.”

“You _swore_ you had. I wouldn’t have helped if I’d known that, well, _this_ would happen,” Mike grumbled from the corner. Bridget had already chewed him out for his part in this problem. She’d exiled the hacker to the corner, to ‘think over his mistakes’.

“It’s not the end of the world,” one of the other human interns chirped, from where he was hunched over a computer. “If we use Program DR4-G0N, along with the accelerated growth serum that we tested on plants last week-”

“The one that created Audrey?” another intern asked, waving a hand at the giant carnivorous plant in the corner of the room.

“Yep, it seems to be functional enough for emergency use. Anyway, if we do that, then we can fight the zombie horde from the air.

Bridget groaned and buried her face in her hands. Nerds. She worked with nerds. She had to _herd_ nerds. She had to herd nerds who had the skills to recreate their favourite parts of their favourite bits of nerd culture.

“Can you make Program DR4-G0N immune to the reanimation formula. We do _not_ want a Viserion situation,” she asked. As epic as that aerial battle had been, it would not help matters here.

“Oh, I already did that. I don’t really want a Viserion situation either.” The grinning intern pressed a button. “The eggs should be ready in a few minutes. The organic matter assembler is making them now.”

--October 31st: Halloween, evening--

There were few survivors among this part of Galactico Incorporated now. Most of the employees and their families had already been subsumed by the zombie horde, which now numbered in the millions. The survivors were mostly of the gaseous and liquid species, but they were a minority among Galactico’s staff.

Oddly enough, few humans could be seen among the horde. As soon as they realised what was happening they had fled for safety, arming themselves as they went. They were holed up in laboratories, or on rooftops, or in other easily secured locations. All of those in a position to do _something_ about the localised apocalypse _were_. From the multitude of sniper nests, to the frantic attempts to create something useful in the labs, to simply protecting and sheltering survivors of other, less prepared, species, the humans were helping.

“Hey, it was probably one of us who started this, so it’s up to us to end this,” one human intern had answered, when questioned why afterwards. He’d then cackled and swung an oddly shaped hammer from one hand. “Now, I wonder how zombies fare in a hurricane.”

It was into this situation, where the dead vastly outnumbered the living, that the Project DR4-G0N team emerged. Six vast, scaled beasts followed them, many times the size of the humans that had created them. They waddled forwards, looking ungainly on the ground.

“See, I _told_ you it would work,” the intern responsible crowed. “I could have made more, you know. Balerion, Meraxes, Vhagar, Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion might not be enough. There are a _lot_ of zombies.”

“And there are other humans dealing with them. We just have the solution with the biggest area of effect,” Bridget pointed out, waving at the storm raging over in the distance, and the red and gold armoured human zipping in between buildings, firing blue blasts into the zombie horde. “Dragon riders, mount up!”

The six interns chosen by the dragons, who were as picky about their riders as their fictional counterparts (though thankfully not as _lethally_ choosy), pulled themselves onto the backs of their beasts. With a great rush of air, all six pairs leaped into the sky, quickly gaining height and heading in the direction of the horde.

Soon zombies were aflame in all of the open spaces. Luckily Galactic Incorporated had followed intergalactic building codes, and so the fire didn’t catch on surrounding buildings. Bridget was pretty certain that she could hear mad cackling from the direction of Viserion, where Tim was mounted (‘hey, the Zombie King gets the Night King’s dragon, _sweet_ ’), and she resisted the urge to facepalm.

This was going to be tricky to explain. And some of those zombies were starting to take notice of the remaining members of Project DR4-G0N on the ground.

--November 1st: Receivership Day--

The dragons were still wreaking havoc among the horde, which had nonetheless managed to continue to spread. The ‘Avengers’ had retired from the field, citing the need for sleep and food before they returned to ‘smiting zombie arse’. A small group calling themselves the ‘Abel Township Runners’ had linked up with Project DR4-G0N, taking it in turns to lure zombies out of buildings and other tight spaces to where one of the dragons could deal with them. Three of that group, calling themselves Sam Yao, Janine de Luca, and Nadia al-Hanaki (which Bridget was pretty sure weren’t their real names) and had taken over a nearby computer lab in order to hack into security camera feeds to direct their ‘Runners’. Mike had joined them in this endeavour.

Three of those Runners were lounging in the corner of the lab, resting after having used themselves as living bait for a few hours. Eight, Three, and Ten were chatting between themselves, seemingly comparing strategies for luring zombies out into the open. Bridget half listened as they discussed what the undead seemed to respond to best, and what their ad-hoc on-the-go research was showing about the ongoing situation.

The rest of her attention was on the situation outside, where Four, Twenty, and Five were each leading a few hundred zombies to where a dragon was waiting. Bridget had put her foot down in the middle of the night, insisting that the group of idiot interns she was herding take some rest, and set up a rotation for who was currently on ‘zombie strafing’ duty. She hadn’t been surprised when they split into Team Aegon and Team Daenerys. She was pretty certain it was the former currently in flight - Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar and their riders, whom the Abel group had renamed as Aegon, Rhaenys, and Visenya.

She was also hearing about several Deadpools on the western side of the company buildings, slicing zombies with katanas. She was pretty certain she saw someone running around in a Konoha Anbu outfit too, complete with ninjato. There was at least one Godzilla knocking buildings down, although it had to be under someone’s control because it was avoiding ones that were known to have survivors in.

The Galactico intranet was, thankfully, still up and running, allowing those holed up in labs to coordinate and communicate. One of Bridget’s screens was keeping a running tally of kills, and another was holding a constantly updating list of survivor locations, complete with numbers and species, and another held a map showing the spread of the outbreak. These were all being updated by the various hacker groups surfing the camera network. 

--November 5th: Evacuation Day--

Ships had arrived in orbit, to retrieve as many survivors as possible. There weren’t many, only a few million out of the billions of Galactico Incorporated employees and dependants that had previously resided on the planet. The ships also brought even _more_ humans, along with some Farisians who’d heard there was a fight to be had. 

There were even more dragons in the skies now. The output of Project DR4-G0N flew alongside those of Project P3RN, led by bronze Mnementh and his rider F’lar. A band of SPARTANs were competing with Space Wolves, Salamanders, Ultramarines, Blood Angels, and (because there’s always _someone_ who has to go the evil route) Emperor’s Children and Word Bearers to see who could kill the most zombies.

Thankfully they were just cosplayers, and hadn’t gone to the extremes of genetic and surgical modification required to actually turn them into the supersoldiers they represented.

Galactico was finished as a company, and as a functional planetary society. Even the best efforts of the Runners couldn’t safely lure every zombie out of the buildings they’d got into. Infection wasn’t a concern, since someone had come up with a vaccine against the reanimation formula (which had been distributed to survivor enclaves by drone swarm), but being immune to zombification was no defence against being torn limb from limb while consumed alive.The only way to completely cleanse the planet in a sensible time frame without incurring unnecessary casualties would be to level it down to the bedrock.

This solution _had_ apparently been floated, but had been strongly objected to. By humans, unsurprisingly. They wanted to do it the ‘fun’ way.

Bridget’s nerd herd was still intact, and still safe. It had expanded as well, drawing in other humans and the survivors they were protecting. A shuttle was on its way down to collect those who actually _wanted_ to leave, aka most of the non-humans.

Bridget herself was staying. _Someone_ had to be the cool head among this lot, or they’d do something stupid like, oh, trying to release a nanite swarm programmed to eat flesh. _Idiots_."

I've either been ghosted completely, or get rejected once a final round interview is over. I've tried local companies, but all of them find me underqualifed or want someone older. I've tried frosh-soph specific programs and positions on campus, and all of them have rejected or said I'm too qualified. I am stressing out because I do not want next year to be the same shit-show it has been this year, especially when I have applied to many companies as early as possible.

While I had this gut feeling during an internship, it became very clear after working for awhile that I love computer science but hate software engineering. While the pay and benefits were absolutely mind boggling the work itself was incredibly unrewarding and draining. After sticking it out for about 1.5 years I decided to try a different company and found myself dealing with a lot of the same frustrations.  


At this point I'm ready to try something different, but not really sure what options are available to me.

I am intelligent and have some ""experience"", but no internship. Struggling to find an entry level position in LA. Help welcome!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR 

I have an honors CS degree from an accredited university and no internships. I started off trying to pursue a business idea with a friend by implementing it in a tech stack that was new to me. I needed money so started studying for interviews full time. Rejected an offer across the country and did well on an onsite interview from a reputable company in Santa Monica. It came down to the wire and they ended up choosing another finalist. Now I am here, applying to all entry and junior level positions in LA and some in the Bay Area. I have yet to even be given a chance to prove my worth. Any help or advice is much appreciated, including giving me feedback on my resume.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone! First, let me give you a bit of background.

I graduated from an accredited with honors in June 2018. I have not garnered any internships in my four years at college due to a dash of bad luck and a sprinkle of immature laziness.

After I graduated,  I took a month off to travel and relax. By the end of that stint I needed money so I picked up a job at the local coding academy as an instructor. 

In November, my friend and I had a business idea in which we wanted to birth into existence through means of a MERN stack. The possibility of it taking off while learning some popular libraries and languages used in the industry seemed like a win-win. I quit my job in December to work on it full time. We severely underestimated the time it would take to learn the whole stack and put out an MVP. We were running out of funds.

We split our time between working on the website, solving Leetcode problems, and studying system design and general CS concepts. Soon, we found ourselves in a dire situation to find a software engineering job so we made studying and applying a full time priority.

&amp;#x200B;

I received one offer across the country which I rejected and made it through a 6 hour onsite interview for a reputable company in Santa Monica. Even though I had a good impression of my interview, it came down to the wire and they decided to go with another candidate.

Here I am after two weeks of family vacation and three more weeks of applying to every entry level job I can find in LA and I still cannot even seem to get a chance to interview or at least phone screen. Am I doomed because I do not have an internship? I have worked with a team through a scrum process in a academic setting. I pursued an original business idea and leaned an arsenal of technology to build it. I apologize if this is starting to sounds like a bit of a rant. I am hungry to learn and eager to work!

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or advice is much appreciated even if you think I do not want to hear it. If you would not mind providing feedback on my resume and assuring me that it is not some sort of self-inflicted pesticide, I will forever be grateful.

Thank you for reading!"

The best school I got into was far away from home(360 miles, and only way to do so is to drive which is prohibitively expensive due to my car- no pleasure trips for me.). Not an issue, but it destroyed my relationship with my girlfriend, and all of my friends from home.. well, they seem to have forgotten I exist. Or they're off in college themselves(I have Asperger's. I'm high functioning, but just socially awkward enough that when it comes to maintaining friendships, nobody wants to put in effort my way, so unless I'm in person people stop caring).

&amp;#x200B;

I go to college, force myself to be social - get elected a student representative somehow - and dive into schoolwork to hopefully get myself in a position to get a good job. But that hampers my social life. As does the summer internship I take that keeps me at school(but I'm practically forced to take because an internship as a freshman is a godsend). 

I go back, and manage to get a co-op with a great company that lets me live at home. 

The work is great.. But none of my friends care I exist. Those I told about the co-op act surprised when I tell them I've been home for the past 3 months.. Not that they ever contacted me. My ex, the one person who helped me get this far, blocked me(we spent too much time going between dating and not for our liking after we initially broke up) and probably doesn't know or care that I'm nearby.

They also do not have many connections to government agencies I would like to work with. However, I know everyone in the department and the opportunities for research at this university are huge. Moreover, I would have a big data related internship immediately upon deciding to go here, which would definitely help me find a good job after school.

The other option is Johns Hopkins in China. I would have to take out significant debt, even though I have a 29k fellowship and will need to find 3k of my own money to afford going. My Mandarin would improve immensely and I would be able to follow a career path that has been cut off to me by financial constraints for my whole life. However, in two years, I will double my debt. Plus, besides my thesis in Mandarin, it doesn't seem like I will have all that many opportunities to conduct research, though many graduates from this program do go on to good PhD programs. The connections and name of the school will also be a huge boost, plus the professors are very approachable and the program is rather small.

What do you all think I should take? I know it is ultimately my decision, but I want to hear from actual grad students what you would do in my shoes. 

For reference, if I attend JH my overall debt will be about 81k, mostly government loans but with two small private loans with staggering interest rates. I am also a 23yo woman who may want to start a family one day."

Some background:
I'm a sophomore CS/Stats student who wants to pursue a data scientist/analyst role as an internship next year (obviously ideally, I'd settle for virtually anything tbh)

I've spent the first two years of my college time on math, so my actual CS skills are limited almost exclusively to basic algorithms and data structures in a couple of languages (Java, C, Python, I guess Assembly). 

I figure that I would want to do something with SQL since that's relevant, but I've also never worked with any sort of framework or done any sort of large project of that sort, so I was also considering learning React.

Basically, this internship was in one of my parents office’s where he was able to get me an interview in a different department for an internship which I was offered (there was 0 competition). However, apparently because of new management and their belief that this would be a conflict of interest of some kind (even though other interns are still there who are children of other employees) I was denied by upper-management after I was guaranteed the internship by my would-be boss.

I know that freshman internships are rare so I’m not too annoyed about losing the internship per se, but I stopped applying to internships after I was offered the internship and was denied/no response from the rest and now as a result have no idea at all what I can do over the summer since I had planned on working 5 days a week for the majority of summer. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on what I should do over the summer? They could be directly related to CS or other

I know some people might recommend summer classes but unfortunately those probably won’t be a possibility."

Been here for about 4 years. We are the sole software development team for a company of 50~ employees, our team including QA is about 10.

At my current job we don't use many collaborative tools for software development. I'm not sure of a proper term for it, but things like code reviews. Not a new thing, we have rarely used them ever since I interned here. Only on occasions when our architect wants more people to look at a fix for an odd or high priority bug, maybe a total of 100 times in total.

My worry is that I have little guidance in my work, especially as someone still relatively fresh out of school. I might get a feature or bug ticket to work on, spend half a day to finish it, but the actual implementation is whatever I decided upon. The result was often ad hoc implementations that didn't follow any set of guidelines, or make use of common patterns. 

As an individual this past year, I've spent time in and out of work on these skills, but I feel a lack of experience that I wonder if it would only come having my professional work critiqued by senior members consistently. Especially now as a relative newbie, I wonder if this is stunting my growth in a way that will be hard to make up.

Has anyone experienced such a job that lacked this sort of group collaboration? Do you think it ill-prepared you for your next job?"

I’m having a bit of a dilemma over what I should do this summer.

Currently, I’m a sophomore in college and a neuroscience major. I’d like to be a PA one day, and that’s my current career goal. 

The issue I’m having is this: I can’t decide if I should A) go back home this summer, and try to get some medical experience as a scribe or by volunteering/shadowing or B) stay at university and try to get a last minute research gig or take some summer classes (which I don’t really need to do, but it can’t hurt I guess). 

What’s hanging me up on this is two things. 1) my dad is in poor health, and might not make it 10 more years. We really just don’t know. He could make it 30, could make it 5. No idea. Me and him are very, very close. 2) I’ve always struggled severely with social anxiety, and this semester I made a ton of progress, and am getting to where I’m making some friends, talking to people, etc. I live in a VERY small town, so aside from like store employees, I won’t see many people. Not to mention losing out on a opportunity to get research experience, which I’m not even really sure I need? It seems like everyone I know is staying or doing some awesome internship this summer, except me. 

Sorry if this is too long or doesn’t make much sense or whatever, I just really need the advice. Do I go home and chill this summer, hope to get something job wise and shadow if I don’t, and spend time with my family while they’re here, or stay at Uni, get some experience/classes done, and keep meeting people/maintaining friendships?

Thanks to anyone who replies, I appreciate you all."

Dear all,

&amp;#x200B;

Let's me introduce myself first.

I am a senior student in Hong Kong. My major is electronic engineering. It is quite wired for you guys with the major of electronic engineering. But that is the way we separate the ECE into two majors, and we call them electrical and electronic.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to my story, I have received an offer from SJSU and my offer is MSEE. I would like to specialize in the area of VLSI since I have taken various courses related to circuits design. The courses are Op Amp Design, Power Converter (LDO) circuit, CMOS digital Circuit Design, Power electronics etc. I did not have any internship about VLSI through out the 4 years of my study.

&amp;#x200B;

My cgpa is not high in the standard of my college. But I don't know why I got CGPA 3.42 after the WES evaluation.

Also, I got the offer from Santa Clara University as well. It is still MSEE. As my GRE scores and GPA suck, therefore, I did not apply for colleges with high rankings like UCLA, UCSD.

&amp;#x200B;

The above is my background info.

&amp;#x200B;

My frustration is the chances that I can get a job in the US. Of course, I would like to find jobs related to VSLI but I know that the indian students are great and strong and I need to compete with them for the jobs in VSLI. I am okay with any jobs related to EE and I don't need ""dream jobs"" in FLAG. Of course, if I was admitted to those companies, that will be great.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am a Hong Kong student with no Green Card. In other words, I need the H1B visa. Will this become my obstacles when finding jobs? I know that those Tech Giants are willing to sponsor me with the visa. And What about those medium and small scale companies? Will they help for the visa issue as well?

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Thank you!"

bh52h8,2,2019-04-25,Flexibility of UCLA's CS Major?,notagamerr,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/bh52h8/flexibility_of_uclas_cs_major/,"This is a bit similar to another post I made [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/bfxcop/balancing_life_with_uclas_cs_program/), but more specific. One thing that I hope to do in college (I'm currently deciding between UCLA's CS program in HSSEAS and EECS at Berkeley) is take a foreign language alongside my major (possibly as a minor but not necessarily so). I was also considering a Linguistics minor, since that's a good supplement for going into ML/NLP.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on the [sample CS curriculum on the HSSEAS website](https://www.seasoasa.ucla.edu/curric-18-19/87compscicur18.html), it looks like UCLA's CS program doesn't really have much room for classes outside of the major. I've also heard that the program pretty inflexible and that most of the classes you need to take are chosen for you.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious if any current students might have a different perspective (or a similar perspective) on all this? Is it possible to take a decent number of classes outside of the major and still finish in 4 years (without completely sacrificing other good college opportunities like summer internships, research, study abroad, and/or clubs)? Thanks for the help!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

To give a little more context, [a similar CS sample curriculum for Berkeley's EECS major](https://berkeley.app.box.com/v/ugrad-sample-eecs-math1b) seems to give a lot more room for electives/courses outside of the major. This is backed up pretty well by something they say on the [EECS page](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/eecs/study-plans): ""One of the core philosophies of the EECS major is *flexibility*. Therefore, we encourage you to devise your own curriculum, according to your own interests, goals, and background.""

After looking around online, I wasn't able to find the same for UCLA's CS program, but as I really like many other aspects of UCLA, I'd love it if I could also pursue a more flexible approach to my major (i. e. with a foreign language) as well!"
bh5aei,0,2019-04-25,Can I get software jobs with a CS Minor?,moreddit2169,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bh5aei/can_i_get_software_jobs_with_a_cs_minor/,"Hello everyone, I will soon be a college freshman, attending UIUC as an Engineering Mechanics major. My specialization will most likely be Computational Mechanics.

The thing is, I will also be minoring in Computer Science. As far as I know, the CS department at UIUC is god-level, and I think it would be an amazing add-on to my learning experience and resume.

Most likely I want to get a career doing industrial machine design, graphic design or model simulation in robotics, or maybe even go into research. That's my ideal goal. But I would LOVE to keep the option of a purely typical software development job open too, since it's kinda interesting, and I am not half-bad at Java. It would also give some job experience which is all-important, and even give me some time to then dive into my specialization (in another company or even as a startup).

My question is, would this combination of studies allow me to keep hope of getting a job as a full time software dev. (Or as an intern)? I know that CS is very self-teachable and many people without degrees have become Silicon Valley gurus, but nowadays is a minor enough to prove your ""mettle"" and get a job in a Silicon Valley tech company? Could I realistically get something like a Microsoft internship from college, if they send recruiting representatives here? I don't care much about the prestige of the company, just that it should be sufficiently well established, put me in the midst of a large team, and give me proper working experience.

All in all, I just wanna know if this minor will help me keep a career path open. 

Thank you so much for answering. It is greatly appreciated.

I hated my high school for the first two years was going to drop out (failed all my classes on purpose - I know I was incredibly stubborn and immature and didn't realize how this would impact my future), ended up transferring to another high school, and just generally matured and worked my ass off to graduate on time. I ended up getting to skip some classes to take more advanced classes (for example I never passed algebra 1, but I still graduated having passed AP Calculus and AP Chemistry). I live in rural Nebraska, family doesn't have a lot of money, so I'll be going into debt and trying to find a good paying internship while I'm in school.

1) Are there any better value colleges for a computer science education I can feasibly get into?

2) Should I suck it up and go to a community college with very little in the way of CS classes for two years? I feel like this hurts my chances of being able to get into a top ranking university, as well as eliminates any chance I have for an internship.

Trust me, it's not quite as easy as it seems (at least for me). I've gotten advice from family and those who love me, but I'd like to hear from people who don't personally know me.

Straight out of college I went to the local community college to get my general courses done to eventually transfer to a university. I was bouncing between careers with no clue what I wanted to do. I was approached about an internship at a company that had some family and family friends work/ed there and play a MAJOR role at the place. Now this internship came with major perks like a fully paid scholarship to the nearby university, and I got to eventually decide which department I liked best. How could anyone turn that down?? Of course I took the opportunity and have gotten a ton of experience. I shortly chose a department and was steadily gaining experience while going to school part time.
During this time I've gotten to see what exactly what my future was if I stayed. I was fine with it, I liked it enough at first and had a good team. That team changed and so did the little motivation I had left, and I'm just so not happy. I've been mistreated too long and just realized that it isn't where I want to be working in 5 years. 

I could potentially get a new position in a field that I would be crazy about, doing things I'd really enjoy. But now I'd have some to worry about paying for a year left of school without the scholarship. I was already wanting and wishing I could take fewer classes, extending that year, because college is so difficult for me and I'd rather take less classes and focus on one or two classes to raise my GPA. In the long run I see myself being so much happier in this position, but I have a ton of guilt on leaving the place I've been at. 

Personally having a year of college to pay for is worth it to be doing something I'd be happier in. My parents are about the only ones who feel I should stick it out, but I don't want to continue taking advantage of situation that I am no longer happy in.

I'm sorry if this was a mess to read, I can be a difficult story teller.."

I think the part-time position would be fun, and look good if I could balance it and my internship effectively. The TA positions material overlaps what I'd be doing on a fundamental level at my internship.

&amp;#x200B;

My only hesitation aside from 2/7 days just completely gone, is that in order to really go above and beyond on the internship I was planning to work on my projects outside of my scheduled hours as well, which would be less practical if I took the part-time position.This is my first real coding internship, so I'd like to make a great impression.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it a feasible strategy to put in extra time outside of work into my projects during the summer internship, most people I've talked to think its overkill, but I think it would reflect favorably on me. Following that, what's your opinion on taking a part-time TA position in addition to this internship, for the sake of bolstering my resume + it might be fun.

I'm gonna come prepared with resumes and business casual clothing, etc. but I'm not actually REALLY looking for an internship, kinda just going cause I never went to one and wanna get used to it for when I actually look for an internship. I'm feeling kind of nervous though for talking to the recruiters cause I don't really have anything eye-catching on my resume nor do I have any actual skills to offer. Basically just wanna try to see what it's like being at the fair and talking to the recruiters that I plan on talking to.

Would I look out of place if I wasn't talking to recruiters in search of an internship? 

Is anyone else in the same boat as me?"

&amp;#x200B;

At a bit of a crossroads and seeking some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated in 2017 with a BSc Management (Business) degree from a Russell Group uni and have since gained some experience working in Operations roles. I failed to get onto a graduate program (got to the Assessment Centre stage for about 4) but wasn't overly vigilant in applying at the time. My CV is a bit all over the place (sales roles, ops, supply chain/internal consulting internship)

&amp;#x200B;

I am now wanting to transition to the tech industry and have left my job to dedicate myself to learning (via App Academy at the moment). My plan has been to go for an MSc conversion Computer Science program at somewhere like the University of Birmingham/Nottingham (e.g.  [https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/courses/computer-science/computer-science-msc.aspx](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/courses/computer-science/computer-science-msc.aspx)).

&amp;#x200B;

While I initially felt confident in this plan, I spoke with my brother recently who voiced some legitimate cons to this idea:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Money and additional debt:-** I'm already in over £40k debt from my undergrad, and though with the payment structure I don't really feel it, I don't know if an additional £10-15k debt will change that now or down the line. I will also have to get a job soon if I do decide to pursue a MSc in September - purely to be able to pay the accommodation and living costs - which will hinder my progression through App Academy's online platform in the short term.
2. **Additional year out:-** Though I see this as somewhat of a weak con since the time will be passing anyway and at the end of the day, I just want to come out with the best potentiality after the next year.
3. **Not being 100% dedicated:-** My desire to transition into tech is relatively recent and, given that I have just started learning programming recently, I find it difficult to say with full authority yet that I want to be a SWE.
4. **Differentiating me from competition:-** If my competition all have BSc Computer Science degrees (which seem to hold a lot more weight than conversion MScs), does it really matter if I get a conversion MSc or will my chances of gaining entry into the field be more-or-less the same if I just devote myself to learning web dev through App Academy and then brushing up on CS fundamentals with additional MOOCs?

&amp;#x200B;

All this to say, I really don't know whether I should be pursuing a conversion CS MSc and would love to hear your thoughts on it.

For my next internship I really want to work at a well known California company (Amazon, Google, FB, Twitter, Nvidia, etc). 


I have a few side projects under my belt. They aren't anything that special. It is just a simple Android app that makes use of MVVM, material design and GraphQL. Over the summer I am hoping to do a side project involving machine learning (or something like that since that seems like a hot topic right now and since it also seems really interesting :P). I am also planning to grind out leetcode but my issue is that I get stuck on some of the easy questions and I find the medium ones really challenging. My main focus over the summer (4 months) would be to get really good at technical interview. So right now I am thinking of starting with CTCI and [firecode.io](https://firecode.io) (since I have heard good things about it). I am planning to use these two for the first month and then do leetcode for the next three months. I am planning to practice algo &amp; DS for about 3 hours everyday for four months. Does this sound sufficient enough to get an internship for a well known company in California?


Also have a couple of questions about [firecode.io](https://firecode.io). For those who know about it, what level should I be aiming for to get . an internship in California? (As of right now I am level one). Also If I get to say level 4, would I be able to solve medium leetcode problems. Is 4 months (3 hoursish per day) enough? And do you have any advice for solving Algo &amp; DS problems in general - keeping in mind that I find some of the easy questions to be challenging?

I haven't learnt anything related to Design Verification. 

I got A-/B+ in the above courses.

The tracts offered: Networking, Software Development/Computer Programming, Web Developer/Graphic Design.

Semesters are broken down into 3.5 month ""Trimesters"", in which a summer trimester exists for mandatory second year internships.  I am currently halfway through my third trimester of the first year(sooo close to that summer break).

&amp;#x200B;

Some background: Always liked hardware and tech, never programmed before school.  Went into first trimester thinking I was too far behind to be a programmer, thought I would like networking. 

I soon realized the flexibility and creative problem solving that programming offered vs networking(networking was just knowing protocols and physically setting up networks), and decided to switch focus. 

I've really liked programming. It's frustrating (but in the same way solving a puzzle in Zelda is, or getting good at Dark Souls) yet rewarding. I feel very accomplished and proud when I can solve a problem without getting help.

&amp;#x200B;

**My problem is this:**

I'm currently taking Data Structures and Algorithms(we use Java and Eclipse), and I am struggling hard (I'm also learning Java syntax, as we used c# last two trimesters).

I read from the book, look up examples on forums and YouTube, scour stack overflow, work on code with classmates, and go to the teacher for extra help when needed. 

Every Friday the teacher has us turn in code that solves a problem in the current week's topic (BigO, Stacks, BubbleSort, Recursion, ect). Without fail, it takes me hours to solve one piece of a problem, and 95% of the I just end up finding similar code on forums or get bits of code from my classmates who help me. 

I feel like I'm not really learning as much as I should , and I've only managed to get decent grades by leaning heavily on resources and other people's help.

Is this a normal feeling for new programmers, or is this a sign I won't be able to cut it in the field? Should I just give up and take the mundane/safe route of networking? Am I not smart enough to make it as a programmer?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Struggling in Data Structures and Algorithms, feeling stupid despite working my butt off. Deciding if I should change my focus to networking."

Problem is my former &amp; soon-to-be-again boss is my most important reference. What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Last summer, I worked as a summer IT intern for my university's IT Architecture &amp; Security department and split my time working for both the architecture (drawing network diagrams, making RFP templates) and security teams. It was my first time doing security work (Using whois to find IP, MAC, using ServiceNow ticketing system, Trend Micro DDI, etc.)  I had a great time and I am now in pursuit of a career in cybersecurity.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks ago I got an offer from the same department for a 2nd internship this summer, but this time as a summer security analyst, and I accepted the offer this Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I got an email from Schneider Electric (applied for their security intern job 5 months ago) asking if I would be interested in moving to Montreal for a summer internship (I'm in Alberta, Canada) before they proceed with an interview. I felt the timing was off so I politely declined. If they had emailed a bit earlier, I would have LOVED to pursue this internship.

And then today, I got an email from a major Oil &amp; Gas company (applied for an IT project intern job 3 months ago) asking if I would be interested in a security internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a great time learning about cybersecurity last summer, but the university internship is definitely the lowest paying job. ***My dilemma is since I already accepted the university's internship offer, is it wrong for me to follow up with the O&amp;G company's interview?*** **My former &amp; soon-to-be-again boss (at the uni IT department) is my most important reference for my resume.** Many students applied for this job, but he personally reached out to see if I would be interested in coming back. And I said yes, so he probably didn't even interview anyone. I have this sense of loyalty to him too because he was very kind and patient with me as he answered all my nagging questions and as I learned the ropes of being in a professional environment for the first time. I would hate to burn the bridge with him. But the fact that I'm being approached by companies I wanted to work for has got me thinking...

&amp;#x200B;

I will be graduating next year so this summer is my last internship. **My main reason for wanting to pursue this O&amp;G internship is... I think if they liked me enough and I performed well, maybe just maybe there is a chance that they will offer me a FT position when I graduate.** I'm a business student so I don't have the technical skills a comp-sci or an engineering student would. I plan to get cybersecurity certs but they can be costly as you guys may know. I heard that most O&amp;G companies in my area will pay for certs as long as I remain with the company, so I'm tryna think what would be the most beneficial for my career. But like I said, my former boss at the Uni is my most important reference and he is also the hiring manager for the uni internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, ever since I lost my job (which is a blessing because I was MISERABLE there), I’ve fallen into depression and am finding it extremely painful to get my life back together. I have worked hard all my life and have a pretty nice resume with a lot of experience (college degree, 3.9 GPA, multiple internships, 2 year work experience post graduation). Problem is, I feel completely crippled by perfectionism and fear of rejection. I can’t even stand opening up my resume doc because I’m forced to look at my previous job and see once again that I didn’t reach my goal, that I didn’t end up becoming permanent. I get crippled over feeling like my resume has mistakes or needs improving, because the improving can go on and on and on if you keep finessing and analyzing. I’ve grown comfortable in my writing abilities yet I struggle to feel confident in my own voice updating my resume and writing cover letters. I fear sending out applications and never hearing back. I interview quite well, but I fear rejection. I can’t take rejection. But yet I realize that because rejection and fear of failure are such large issues for me, I need to face them, understand why I’m feeling this way, and move through it.

I can’t go on avoiding my fears and reality. I’ve been fortunate to be just barely making money over the past months selling paintings and freelancing, but I so badly wish to be working again. I’ve reached a point where I’m getting over the pain that they didn’t want me and I’m realizing it’s worthless to let it control my life and well-being. 

I’m wondering if anyone out there has any similar experiences that they can share, or words of advice to help me move past the fear of rejection/failure and get started on applying to jobs again?"
bhjaej,2,2019-04-26,Cybersecurity Career Q - How important is the company I intern with before graduating university?,nineth_wonder,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/bhjaej/cybersecurity_career_q_how_important_is_the/,"TLDR: I accepted an internship offer to come back for a 2nd term but received interview offers from more ""prestigious"" companies. Problem is my former &amp; soon-to-be-again boss is my most important reference. What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone,

Last summer, I worked as a summer IT intern for my university's IT Architecture &amp; Security department and split my time working for both the architecture (drawing network diagrams, making RFP templates) and security teams. It was my first time doing security work (Using whois to find IP, MAC, using ServiceNow ticketing system, Trend Micro DDI, etc.) I had a great time and I am now in pursuit of a career in cybersecurity.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks ago I got an offer from the same department for a 2nd internship this summer, but this time as a summer security analyst, and I accepted the offer this Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I got an email from Schneider Electric (applied for their security intern job 5 months ago) asking if I would be interested in moving to Montreal for a summer internship (I'm in Alberta, Canada) before they proceed with an interview. I felt the timing was off so I politely declined. If they had emailed a bit earlier, I would have LOVED to pursue this internship.

And then today, I got an email from a major Oil &amp; Gas company (applied for an IT project intern job 3 months ago) asking if I would be interested in a security internship.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a great time learning about cybersecurity last summer, but the university internship is definitely the lowest paying job. ***My dilemma is since I already accepted the university's internship offer, is it wrong for me to follow up with the O&amp;G company's interview?*** **My former &amp; soon-to-be-again boss (at the uni IT department) is my most important reference for my resume.** Many students applied for this job, but he personally reached out to see if I would be interested in coming back. And I said yes, so he probably didn't even interview anyone. I have this sense of loyalty to him too because he was very kind and patient with me as he answered all my nagging questions and as I learned the ropes of being in a professional environment for the first time. I would hate to burn the bridge with him. But the fact that I'm being approached by companies I wanted to work for has got me thinking...

&amp;#x200B;

I will be graduating next year so this summer is my last internship. **My main reason for wanting to pursue this O&amp;G internship is... I think if they liked me enough and I performed well, maybe just maybe there is a chance that they will offer me a FT position when I graduate.** I'm a business student so I don't have the technical skills a comp-sci or an engineering student would. I plan to get cybersecurity certs but they can be costly as you guys may know. I heard that most O&amp;G companies in my area will pay for certs as long as I remain with the company, so I'm tryna think what would be the most beneficial for my career. But like I said, my former boss at the Uni is my most important reference and he is also the hiring manager for the uni internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Any feedback is appreciated!"
bhjcht,4,2019-04-26,GPA concerned!,rayfusion7,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/bhjcht/gpa_concerned/,"I'm currently a freshmen in the business school. I foolishly took CS111, this semester, because I wanted to initially change my major to CS, at first it was fun and I understood most of it. But after the first midterm everything became extremely hard to understand, and I fell behind with understanding the code. This effected my second mid term score drastically, resulting in me failing it. Now I'm concerned about the final, because it is supposed to be harder. I think I'm in risk of failing or at the most getting a C. On top of that the profs said there won't be a curve this semester, IDK why. I'm just concerned that if I fail this class or even get a C it will kill my 3.5 GPA, and it would be extremely difficult for me to get a job in the future or a good internship! Please help I really am panicking. I get really worked up about these kinds of stuff. I really don't know what to do, or who to turn to. I really feel stressed and overwhelmed."

It didn’t. Everything is still shitty. I’m still and ugly depressed bitter lonely bitch.

I’m graduating in a year and it’s absolutely bleak. No boy has a crush on me, i have no friends, and I don’t have the option of moving back in with my parents. My health is bad too. Despite getting close to perfect grades from an elite university I still didn’t get a summer job or internship. 

I feel like fucking crap.

I have nothing to look forward to. I can’t even tell myself that I’ll have a job or graduate school after I graduate because I won’t. Why the fuck am I here? My best friend just deserted me to date a boy who’s best friends with my harasser. My other friend never talks to me anymore. I feel bad because I was set up to do well but I still failed at every possible turn. 

I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up again. I wish I could have just never existed. Never have met these people, never for a moment have fooled myself into thinking any of them care about me. I’m thinking of wandering the streets late at night to get hit by a car or shot. I don’t want to be here. I have nothing. I have nothing.

Part of me doesn’t do it because I hate upsetting people. But I think this is what people really want."
bhjxyf,7,2019-04-26,"Need help explaining how ""Good"" isn't Good",bobhob314,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/bhjxyf/need_help_explaining_how_good_isnt_good/,"Hello, in a bit of a rush as co-op evaluations are due quite soon. My manager might extend it by a bit as he's deliberating and communicating with others but either way time is running low.

The gist of it is, they agree I performed according to their standards. And I was a bit late (5-10 min) a for quite a few days. I explained the inflation and showed them the chart and they discussed with other managers (but didn't discuss with the other manager who boosted two interns' marks after they explained the same thing).

It seems the only way to convince them at this rate is to get some form of ""official statement"" from Waterloo, in any form, since this is a big company and my manager adheres to the company code in terms of how they usually give reviews, etc.

I discussed this with them for an hour yesterday and today but no dice. So I emailed my co-op advisor, but is there a better way I can email them to better persuade them? Is there anything that can be done?

At this rate I'll go from a ""very good"" last term (for the exact same reason, they didn't want to adjust based on the inflation) to a ""good"", in other words not only the bottom 5% of co-op students but also a decreasing quality of work is reflected.

Please, thank you, I was able to control my increasingly mounting panic during our talks but it's close to bursting now."

bhko92,0,2019-04-26,Is this internship worth it?,WhereisMcTeams,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bhko92/is_this_internship_worth_it/,"So I'm currently a second semester freshman going to a generic public state school in a low CoL area. I tend to have pretty good relationships with my professors as I try to socialize with them outside of class and am genuinely interested in the stories they have to tell (mostly about their careers anyway). Anyways, I'm in my DSA professor's office bantering around like we often do and I jokingly ask him, ""You wouldn't be able to get me a job would you?"" Well, he then goes onto tell me that he is apparently assembling a team over this very summer. 

Now I read this sub regularly and noted the glorification of internships. In my mind at that very moment, I'm thinking I'm the bee's knees. So here's the breakdown:

1. The pay would be $10/hr and I don't live nearby. I could maybe gather some money to find a place to stay or ask some relatives in the area, but that's not preferable. I have yet to ask him if a possible stipend could be given. 

2. I specifically asked him if it was an INTERNSHIP, to which he answered yes.

3. Although I'm pretty certain it's a CS-related internship, I haven't actually confirmed that 100%.

4. I didn't particularly have plans over this summer. In fact, I was intending to work on projects/study problems for the very purpose of getting an internship. And I wouldn't have to do an interview! (I think.)

5. It would be a freshman internship! That's suppose to be a big deal, right?

He told me to talk to him again next week to get more details, which I plan to do. With that in mind, what do you guys think? Is this a lucky opportunity or not a big deal? I feel like an internship with my university wouldn't be as prestigious as one in industry, but it would still be better than the nothing I have on my resume. Would it still be worth it if I had to pay for my own housing?

bhm6yh,2,2019-04-26,How to get an internship,Sig_Luna,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/bhm6yh/how_to_get_an_internship/,"Original Post: [https://mentorcruise.com/learn/how-get-internship/](https://mentorcruise.com/learn/how-get-internship/)

\-----------

*In many cases, when starting or changing careers, it can be a good idea to look for internships to experience the daily life in a job, make first industry connections and get hands-on experience in a topic. However, getting internships in the first place can be hard. Our* [*mentors*](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/browse/) *share some insights on what to do.*

## Paid, Unpaid &amp; Your Expectations

While unpaid internships start fading away due to most companies offering a small starting salary, you’ll have to think about what you’re looking for before reaching out to companies. Are you ready to do an unpaid internship? How long would you like the internship to last? Are there opportunities nearby? Are you looking for a full-time position after?

All these questions will determine what to look out for.

* If you are looking for paid positions only, it can be hard for managers to allocate budgets for unplanned internships, so cold emailing will get more difficult.
* While most internships are three months long, many companies will extend it to six months if you are doing a good job. Everything over that is usually too long.
* Most managers won’t bother talking about relocation and visa sponsorships for internships. If you can, look for something nearby or something you can get to in a acceptable commute.
* Be sure to make clear that you are available after the internship for a full-time position, but don’t expect them to hire you.

## Looking in the open

Now you know what you are looking for, so it’s time to get looking. Apply to publicly announced positions with your CV. This is a time where quantity might count over quality: Get your name out as much and fast as possible. You should apply to every suiting internship around you.

Speaking about getting your name out: Search publicly. Post on LinkedIn and other social networks that you are looking and what your terms are. You’ll be surprised about how many companies could use an intern.

&gt;**Need help with your CV or career development? Feel free to reach out to one of our** [**mentors**](https://mentorcruise.com/mentor/browse/)

If you’re lucky, you might already be close to getting an internship

## Cold Emailing

Against popular belief, cold emailing to ask for internships can work - especially at big companies. But you need to find the right contact person.

Try to find a manager, hiring contact or HR person of a company near you and reach out to them directly. You really need to refine your message before you click send. Be sure that your mail is properly formatted, free of typos, respectful and explains exactly who you are.

For reference, this message was sent from our Founder to a Vice President at NVIDIA. Just weeks later, he got an internship there.

&gt;Hey \[redacted\], I was wondering if there are any internship positions open at your Zurich offices? I’m currently doing Udacity’s SDCND and DLFND \[info: contact new about these programs\], as well as mentoring new students there, and looking for an opportunity to work in Deep Learning after this summer.

Not a perfect message by any means, but short, casual and sympathetic.

## Interviewing &amp; Offers

Let’s assume the previous steps worked out perfectly. What now? Chances are, that you might need to decide between multiple interviews and offers. When making an internship decision, keep these pointers in mind.

* When it comes to money vs. learning, try to tend towards learning. It’ll pay off later on a lot more!
* Try to choose a company with a known name - it’ll open doors after.
* It’s only temporary - so don’t turn things down due to organizational things (e.g. a long commute)
* Put in extra effort - you’ll get to work on more projects and do more exciting things.

We hope that this guide can help you with your internship search. Good luck!"
bhmavl,14,2019-04-26,"Graduating with CS degree in 2 weeks, is the airforce civillian job a good route?",Dankdogs321,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bhmavl/graduating_with_cs_degree_in_2_weeks_is_the/,"Hello,

I am having a dilemma. I am about to graduate here soon and I have an offer from the local airforce base (about 2 hours away). 47k starting with 20% sign on bonus and a raise every year, if I work there for 4 years I'll be making 74k, they'll pay for my masters, has decent healthcare, decent PTO and I get a secret security clearance. 

Now I know this is way below market price, but I really wanna get a masters. My GPA in undergrad wasn't that great but I am confident in my ability to code and general CS fundamentals. I have about 3 years of software development experience since I have been working part time at internships all throughout college since I needed the money.

I have been interviewing at other places but I haven't gotten any full time offers. One thing I do have is an internship offer(paid of course) for this summer that will turn into a full-time position at the end of this summer if everything goes well. This is at a pretty big financial processing software company.

I am having a hard time deciding on what to do since I really don't know if I'll actually be coding in the airforce. I do really want a security clearance though because I'd like to work for a govt contractor in the future. 

My resume isn't that bad, I have a hefty amount of work experience and undergraduate research experience. My tech interviewing skills could use some work.

My family wants me to take the airforce job since it's safe but idk I have a feeling that I'm locking myself in,  the work might not be good and it won't give me any transferable skills.

Any advice from someone who has had experience working as a computer scientist at an airforce base is nice. But I'll take any advice I can get. Thank you!"
bhmduw,1,2019-04-26,I dont know what to do or how to feel,A-tro,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bhmduw/i_dont_know_what_to_do_or_how_to_feel/,"Context:

I am 20 years old, soon to be 21 in November. Currently in community College and about to transfer soon for fall semester. This is where my pain, my ""depression"" starts. I spent 3 years here, taking much, much easier classes so I won't have to deal with intentionally weed out classes such as calc. I'm finishing calc 2 right now, and our 4th exam was a take home and what we are learning now isn't even necessary because we won't have another exam.

So I tried my best to not stress myself as I saw others and took the easiest way possible. What I gave up, is hurting me as I have a lot of regret now. Easier the classes, lazier I got. I did good in my math and CS classes but besides that, I maintained a few C's and one D by accident. So, my GPA is a 2.75 now. I recently got denied from my state school and that pained me in more ways I can express.

Here I thought, this is it, this is where I finally dissacociate myself from my past, from the people around me, from the place I am in. I thought I would start fresh, and yet I'll be going to a school with the same ppl from high school, with the same friends, etc. I'll still be 20 mins away from home, in a place I know like the back of my hand. Yes, I can *try* to apply again for spring but the state school doesn't accept CS classes, so I could potentially be looking at graduating when I am 23-25? Is that even worth it? I could graduate 22-23 at this university because ultimately what I am chasing for is a way to make myself happy, to experience a college life. Not as in drinking, partying, etc. 

College life as in, meeting new friends, creating a new group of friends, involving myself college activities, clubs, staying as far as possible from home, and being out with friends, forming study groups, attending school events, making amazing memories and just be surrounded by tons of new faces and people. I want to be surrounded by people.

I recently met this person whos had such an amazing experience in college, studied abroad, stayed on campus, was apart of so many school events, and just overall kept herself so social. Now she's getting ready to graduate, tho grateful of her experience, she just wants to focus on her studies and be done with it. Where as I am finally going into a university, hoping to start this experience. But, ppl at my age are the same as her, getting ready to graduate. No longer want to busy them up with the college experience, and just want to dip. Meaning, it looks like I am late. That, I too should focus on graduating and now caring about such things  anymore.

I know, most of this isn't really coherent. I cant seem to word and show how badly this all hurts me. All the missed memories, experiences, events, friends, etc. All because I decided to go through community College. I don't know honestly know any more. I feel alone, I feel lonely. I have 3 weeks left, and then I never have to look at this place again (hopefully) other then when I'm passing by it. Another month, and I'll be surondded by people, and I will busy up myself with work. I will be at my internship, and just be away from my house. 9-5.  I just have to hold on. Hope for change. I started the gym. I also know that, once I transfer, I have to look for opportunities, I have to look for clubs to join, for activties to join. I have to. I cant be embrassed by my age."

bhnksj,5,2019-04-26,Steps to move from Quality Assurance Analyst to (Jr?) Quality Assurance Automation Engineer?,gravv,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bhnksj/steps_to_move_from_quality_assurance_analyst_to/,"Hi,

I an currently a Quality Assurance Analyst. I started as in intern in May 2017 with zero QA or any software dev cycle knowledge, and was offered a full time position in August 2017, and have been working at my company since I left full time school for the full time job. Im still  taking classes online to get my BS in Computer Science and am (hopefully) going to graduate next summer. 

Skipping ahead to the big question: I want to become a Quality Assurance Automation Engineer. The majority of my job is revolved around manual QA work , but I do know how to automate tests with selenium via a keyword driven framework my previous boss (and our only Automation person) made for us before he quit. While I understand the basics of how the framework runs, I do not know the intricacies very well. I have programming knowledge with java and js, and a little bit in other languages (python, c++, php minimally) but have not used them in a work setting really only in school at the moment. HOWEVER, I was able to identify and understand a few bugs within the framework my boss wrote (I had to ask a lead developer for help to fix it correctly though) but that alone made me feel a little good. I also learned how to schedule a few of our automated  tests in Jenkins so that it emailed us results for each scheduled run. My boss was supposed to show me the basics of JMeter and performance testing, but he never quite got around to it in a way that actually stuck with me. 

Now that what I DO know is up there, what other skills/ things should I learn in order to become more qualified to become a QA Automation Engineer? I am not looking for a lead position or any sort of leadership spot, but rather a jr position maybe or just a normal tiered QA Automation Engineer ? Am I in a good position to start applying at places already (I personally don’t think so but am looking for others opinions).

Thanks in advance to anyone who can offer some insight !"

So that got me thinking, if i decide today that I wanna build this website for him, how long will it take for me to learn the required languages and other stuff? 

Right now, I'm fairly proficient in Java and C++ and I've done a little bit of python and ruby (got B- grade in both python and ruby classes). 

I know no one can tell me for sure how long it will take but can someone give me a rough estimate? And also can you tell me what should i go about learning first? I'm thinking JavaScript right now but i know nothing about the styling (HTML5?) or the hosting side of it. I have 3 month vacation coming and so I will have a lot of time on my hands. If this is possible, I'm thinking I'll go all in on this in the vacations instead of doing an internship.

During my time studying I've discovered that I'm really interested in Android programming, and have started looking for jobs and internships in that field. I haven't had any luck yet, so I went to an Android meetup a few days ago to get insight from people in the field, and when I told them about my experience as an audio engineer they all said that could be a really valuable tool when looking for a job. Most of their advice was based around building an audio-related app to use as a resume booster, but none of them knew much about what kinds of companies would be a good place to apply to.

My question is in two parts:

1. Is android too narrow a focus to have if I want to leverage my audio knowledge to find a job?

2. If not, what are some good companies to apply to or trajectories I can take to enter this area of the industry?"

However, the application fees combined were ridiculous (around $1000). I don't think I can get fee waivers, so I need to start knocking off colleges that aren’t realistic. What I wanted to ask you guys is what are the highest ranked/prestigious colleges in which I have a decent chance of being accepted. Side note: I don’t care much for prestige or even rank myself; I’m mainly doing it for my parents. ~~although I wouldn’t mind making it into MIT~~ I understand that the college application process is really competitive. I would honestly be happy to make it into UVA. Here’s my information:   
  
Major: Aerospace Engineering 
  
GPA: 3.97UW/4.3W 
  
SAT: 760 R/W; 730 M (I will take it again and concentrate on the Math section so I can superscore and get up to a 1560) 
  
SAT Subject Tests: Haven’t taken any yet, but I will in August (Math II, Physics)
  
Ethnicity: Pakistani 
  
State: Virginia 
  
Extracurriculars: I have been working at a job for the past 6 months. The job is being an instructor in a STEM after school program. I teach Lego robotics and recently, I’ve started teaching Python. I can get a pretty good LoR from my boss.     
  
I used to part of a FIRST robotics team as a programming leader; however, I had to leave it since I changed schools. Good news is, that I will most likely be setting up a FIRST team at my new school. I have a lot of volunteer hours associated with the team.   
  
I cook a lot and will do so more over the summer. 
It is possible that I will do a summer internship at Lockheed Martin as a software/systems engineer but I haven’t been accepted yet.  
  
(under ECs) Skills: I can program in Java and Python. I just recently started to learn how to CAD.   
  
Essays: I’m going to start writing them as soon as summer begins.   
  
LoRs: As I mentioned before, my boss will give me an excellent LoR if I ask him to do so. I’m great friends with a couple of teachers, so same with them.  
   
Preferences: I really don’t that many except for location. I would prefer to live on the North Eastern coast (Virginia and everything above) because of the weather, and California. I’m flexible with this though.   
    
Be as harsh as you need to be! Ask me if you need anything else. Thanks so much in advance"

And as of today (April 26, 2019) I still haven’t been able to find a job. Since my post from about 8-9 months ago I’ve now applied to over 760+ jobs since graduation and still no luck. I reside in the state of California and I ever since the new year has started, I have now expanded my search to the entire US but I’ve still been unsuccessful. I graduated with a 2.9 GPA with only one internship. In addition, I don’t have any connections from my university or my internship that could help me get a job. I was a nice student but I hated socializing so I burned many bridges that I can no longer amend at this point. For the past 6 months, I’ve been working part-time as a janitor at a hotel for 12$/hr and its barely keeping me afloat. But once my student loan deferment ($30000 in debt) ends, I wont be able to sustain my poverty lifestyle and I will probably have to undergo a default on them. 

So in order to avoid that, I planned on leaving to grad school this fall in order to extend my deferment and to also increase my chances in obtaining a job that I would prefer. I have read many other post saying that you should get experience before grad school because I’ll be in the same position, but what other choice do I have???? I planned on getting a masters in mechanical engineering and specializing in thermal/fluid systems since that was what most of my electives consisted of when I was an undergrad anyway. In addition, I will have gained some research experience during grad school, better network connections, and possibly and internship during the summer, and I was hoping that would help me land a R&amp;D job after grad school. Unfortunetely the major drawback is that I’m going to have to take an additional $30,000 in debt to accomplish this. But I’m becoming so desperate to the point where I don’t care anymore and I just want my life to start. So do you think this is a path forward in my current devastating position in my life? And do you think that I should continue to work at my 12$ job over the summer or find an internship before grad school? I’ve exhausted all of my motivation at this point to continuously keep applying to jobs (EVEN changing my resume constantly) and getting the same results. Its pure insanity at this point. I just want advice or mentorship from any experienced engineer in the United States at this point because I’m completely lost in my life."

Now I have to decide on one of them by May 1st, maybe sooner as space is filling up quickly!I was wondering what current students of either program think.  
Some background information if it helps:

* I am doing computer science, and I have enough credits to graduate in 3 years (I plan on doing Fast-Track for Masters in 3+1)
* I do not plan on getting a PhD, but I want to get a Masters. I am not sure if I will try for the Fast-Track at Georgia Tech or apply elsewhere like Stanford, CMU, MIT, etc. Probably the latter, and therefore, I want to have stuff to get into a good graduate program :)
* I want to either work at a large tech company (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.) or work/lead a start-up in technology, maybe both (first large tech company then start-up)

Some Questions (please specify what community you belong/belonged to):

* would you choose Grand Challenges or Honors Program, and why?
* What kind of opportunities (internships, connections, faculty, alumni) do both programs have?
* West or East side? (Food, Transportation)
* Which dorm is better?
* What community will help the most for graduate school? Will ""prestigiousness"" of Honors count for graduate school, even if the students know that Honors doesn't mean much?
* Do the projects in Grand Challenges really amount to much (or is it just bs)? Is it better to spend that time with individual research with faculty? I plan on graduating in 3 years, so time to publish/intern is a concern.
* Anything else of importance

1. OSU had representatives there (including Tina B. who is a super advocate for the Post-Bacc program). They definitely were generating interest from industry about events like the career showcase for Post-Bacc.  Throwing this out there because I think sometimes from the student side it may be a little hard to see the effort OSU is making to build these industry connections.
2. The state of the industry is great - every single company without exception is having time finding good software engineers. Everybody needs direct hires and interns.  (My work is no exception - please reach out if you are looking for a job in embedded - we have multiple open requisitions, and that number will be growing with new projects coming online.)
3. Got the chance to talk about what exactly a post-bacc graduate is, as Tina's presentation had people asking questions.  To paraphrase this gentleman's comments: ""Oh, that's great! If everything else is equal and I have a choice between a post-bacc student and a traditional student, there's no doubt I would take the post-bacc student every time...  because it's not equal in any sense.  The post-bacc student is going to bring more maturity and intangibles to the table every time.""  I encouraged him to connect with Tina to attend the career showcase if he wants to meet you all."

i applied under accounting, but i’m not sure if that’s what i really want to do. i know that community college has the benefits of allowing you to explore your interests, ending up with less debt in the future and possibly transfer into a higher ranked school. also, the university i committed to is in my hometown and going to CC and transferring to a school in a new city seems appealing. 

but i’m worried that if i do go to a CC, i won’t grow as a person. i know that probably sounds dumb but throughout high school, i didn’t flourish much socially and i see going to university as a fresh start. i have this whole idea of me moving into dorms, joining clubs, making new friends and thriving because i got out of my shell and became more confident with myself. i’m worried that if i go to CC, that won’t happen and i’ll have to play catch-up when i transfer.

i’m also worried that if i do figure out what i want to do while i’m at CC, when i transfer i’m gonna be behind the curve in comparison to everyone else who knew what they wanted to pursue since freshman year of university in regards to extracurriculars and access to internships related to my major and career.

should i just try to explore my interests at university?

TLDR; i don’t know whether to go to my state university or community college. i want to go straight into university for the “college experience” but i’m not sure if what i applied to for my major is what i really want to pursue. however, i’m worried that if i do go to community college, i won’t grow as a person."

I recently got accepted into two great computer science programs and needed help figuring out which is better for me.

Both programs are geared toward students with zero computer science backgrounds.

Here are my options:

1. DePaul University: 6 prereq classes to catch up and then I would be able to take grad classes. They offer many interesting classes and the opportunity to do research and earn credits for any potential internships. Would take me about 3 years of classes. Will cost me about $64,000.
2. Northeastern University: I got into their ALIGN program. The program is entirely for students with zero CS experience.  They offer amazing research opportunities and a guaranteed Co-Op opportunity (an internship).  Would take me about 2.5 years of classes and a 4-6 month co-op experience. Will cost me about $73,000.

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. I intend to attend school in Fall 2020 so I have some time to decide. Also, any tips or recommendations on how I could prepare for a MSCS would be amazing. Financially Depaul is a lot less expensive but I also want to consider internship opportunities, networking, and education. I am not sure if prestige or ranking matters in the computer science field Thank you."

I am planning to pursue my Masters degree in Ireland. I got an offer letter from DCU and University of Limerick. I have a couple of questions before I make my decision as an international student.

\-Which would you guys recommend between DCU and UL for computer science?

\- Would studying in DCU be considerably expensive compared to UL considering the staggering prices in Dublin?

\- Which would provide a better campus life and more opportunities for internships and placements in the Computer and IT field during the course and after graduation?

Thanks for your time and consideration.

Cheers.

P.S - I am still waiting for a response from UCD and UCC. If I also get an offer from these two universities then out of all 4 which would you guys recommend the most corresponding to the questions I asked above?"

My situation is probably an odd case, so don’t judge me too much lol

I am currently in my second semester of community college in Ohio, technically pursuing an associates in Business Administration. 

However, I’ve decided after getting my feet wet in the college world that I feel like I belong in Computer Science/Computer Science + Engineering. 

I obviously want to transfer to a school that has solid internship and job opportunities. I would really like to be in California, as I’ve always wanted to go to school there regardless of major, and it’s presumably a great place for tech majors.

I currently have a 4.0 college GPA, but I’m only a semester or two in, so there’s a chance it drops to 3.8 or so (I hope not obviously). In HS I had a 3.75 UW, took multiple honors and AP courses and had a 31 ACT (34 Math). 

I don’t have many EC’s really, but I want to work on them (any ideas?)

I’ve considered going to California to attend Foothill or De Anza college to get the rest of my California gen ed requirements and the CS pre-reqs mostly done. But obviously it is extremely expensive to find a place to live, and my family can’t afford that. Foothill actually offers many of their courses online though, and I could take them while still living in Ohio.

Obviously some of the great choices in California are UCLA, UC Berkley, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, San Jose State. I’m also interested in Washington. 

Do I have a chance at any of these schools considering I’m a previous Business major and out of state? Would it help my chances if I took classes and transferred my already earned credits to a California Community College?

Is there other good options I should consider?

I really could use any advice, and thanks in advance!!!"

Hi internet, you’re a beautiful mess today as always and I wouldn’t have it any other way

So I’m about to graduate with a degree in ISDS (info sys &amp; decision sciences) and I currently am an IT Intern for a rather large corporation (Fortune 200). It’s okay, but I’m only getting 14.50 p/h full time with no benefits.

They want me to work there for a year as an intern

I live in Orange County, CA so as you can imagine...that doesn’t really add up for me with bills and tuition payments on the way.

I’m moving to south county after I graduate so my room mates will be closer to their jobs, probably close to Irvine. In IT (I plan on getting my CCNA RP and other security certs post college) is it actually as easy to find a job as everyone makes it seem? Is there really that much of a demand? Is Irvine a good place to look? I currently am getting pretty great experience at this Corp that I work for but they don’t have a lot of happy employees for various reasons. Also, when we move I’ll be rather far from work, and I will have to get a car (currently only have a motorcycle)

I’ve been looking and I’ve seen plenty of positions sure, but with CA there’s also always a lot of applicants. I’m wondering how crowded the field is, from some of you further down the road than I"

I'm currently a Junior majoring in Computer Information Systems. I've had a few internships on the support side most recently as a Junior Sysadmin. I was just wondering if anyone had advice on getting a position as a cyber threat intel guy? I've spoken around with some in the infosec community and a few government agencies, and I've been told this falls between cyber threat analyst and CTI. I love Information Security as well as like current events and I feel as if CTI would be a perfect bridge between the two. I know doing this specific position requires a lot technical writing of reports, and being the guy who sees something coming before anyone else knows it, which i'm so interested in doing. I'm guessing the way to do this is to some how get into a SOC, and from there move myself up?"

My parents aren't paying for college, meaning that out of all my acceptances, I can only probably attend UT Austin or UT Dallas. With the details below, which seems like the better choice?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in engineering (mech, aero, BME), medicine, computer science, and business. I understand these are broad interests, but I intend to explore and figure out what I want to do (either in one of these fields, or combining multiple) in college. UT Dallas would be easier to explore at and switch majors, but UT Austin is arguably better for all of the fields above.

&amp;#x200B;

**UT Austin (Biomedical Engineering + Plan II Honors)**

Pros:

\- Biomedical Engineering at a reputable engineering university

\- Plan II Honors with some of the best professors on campus (they have to apply and be selected to teach Plan II courses)

\- Small classes for Plan II Honors

\- The connections that you form in Plan II Honors

\- Plan II Honors is very writing intensive, will help me hone my writing/communication skills

\- Research is not hard to find, in engineering or natural sciences

\- Strong religious community presence there (300+ community)

\- Only 4-5 hours from home, can easily get rides back with friends

\- A good distance from home, not too far, not too close

\- Will be surrounded by academically-driven people

\- UT Alumni Network

\- School Spirit actually exists

\- Better social sphere

Cons:

\- Providing that I become an RA for my 2nd through 4th years, I'll be taking out $60k in **unsubsidized** **private** loans

\- Large campus, no hand-holding for opportunities

\- Switching majors outside of engineering is very hard (if I want to move into CS or business)

\- Engineering at UT is very difficult, many weedout classes, low GPAs are common in engineering

\- The Plan II Honors program is Liberal Arts, so maybe not worth it as a major? idk

\- Not close to home, harder to live alone, no ease of access to go home and grab stuff

\- Will have to dorm with a random person

&amp;#x200B;

**UT Dallas (Bioengineering + National Merit Scholar Program)**

Pros:

\- Full Ride plus $4k stipend per semester, plus $6k to study abroad whenever, plus enough money to live in dorms for free

\- NMSP brings me in touch with many good professors on campus

\- Honors College (no idea what this means in the context of UTD)

\- Priority Class Selection

\- Easier to change majors

\- Since I don't know exactly what I want to do in the future, UTD might be better for exploration

\- Less academically-driven students --&gt; big fish in small pond (this is an assumption of mine, idk if this is actually true)

\- Less competition for internships

\- Easier to get close with professors ig, since not as many students try to go visit them

\- Dorming with someone I already know from high school

Cons:

\- It's 10 minutes away from home

\- Being stuck in Dallas after graduation would suck

\- Less prestige at UTD

\- Fewer (or lower quality) connections?

\- Its overall engineering program isn't that good compared to UT Austin's

\- Student population includes many people who are not concerned about their education, just there to coast

\- No school spirit (this is what current students have said)

&amp;#x200B;

Most kids between UT Dallas and UT Austin choose UT Dallas for the National Merit full ride and stipend. However, *most* of these kids are just deciding between the schools, nothing else. Also, they are usually premed or CS (for which the UTD full ride is worth it). I, on the other hand, have to consider that engineering at UT Austin is much better, and that I've also been admitted to an honors program.

So this is a throwaway account for various and obvious reasons. I’m trying to figure out what is going on at my internship, because things are off!

TL;DR at the bottom. 

It’s pertinent to know that I have Aspergers Syndrome/High Functioning Autism, which might be leading to some of this. My company doesn’t know this. 

I started my internship in the US this Spring semester at a smaller company. People seemed nice but extremely quiet at first. 

I consider myself a kind person who enjoys making friends, but I’m a couple of months into my internship, and I think I’m being frozen out of everything. People will talk to each other when I’m not in the room, but they’ll stop pretty quickly when I enter. They’ll leave the open office that a lot of us work in to talk to each other when I’m present. 

I’ll say hi to people as they enter, bye when I leave, and people just give one-word responses as if they have to but don’t want to, whereas they are much more talkative to other employees. There are even some people who won’t acknowledge that I’ve said something to them; they outright ignore me as if I don’t exist. 

I’m there for eight-hour shifts, and I get addressed three or four times the entire day. People are talking to each other, just not when I’m around and not to me! And people are slowly getting more rude or more distanced. They’re keeping me at arm’s length. 

**I’m not there to talk, but I’m also not there to be treated differently. **

And all of this has gotten worse since I started. 

My Aspergers therapist told me that the way the internship is structured is less like an internship (meant for learning something) and more like an attempt to get cheap labor on a part of the company. He has also acknowledged that he doesn’t see any reason that people would be put off by me (i.e.; I don’t have hygiene issues, I’m not a one-track-mind type, and I’m socially pleasant). 

To be honest, I’m firstly confused as to what in the heck this dynamic is, but I’m secondly kind of angry I’m being treated like this. I’ve dealt with being treated like this in jobs and various other situations before, and I’m sick of it. 

**TL;DR: I’m being ostracized and treated differently as a person with Aspergers at my internship, and it’s getting worse. I’d like to hear people’s thoughts to if I’m misreading this situation or if I’m correct in my assessment. **"

I had a pretty tough time. Applied to 200'ish companies and only had a few bare interview opportunities (maybe 3-4). I didnt have much time to prepare for the few coding samples that google and amazon did give to me (this was good news). So yes definitely partially my fault.  But overall I had a terrible return rate and difficulty getting anything besides a direct rejection after resume submission.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up taking a sales job to support myself which pays dirt (50 K on hourly wages so probably less). And will probably continue to pay dirt.

I really want to get back into software, I have a pretty strong desire to enter front end web dev (or anywhere in web dev), and I will honestly say I would like to do it in the bay area or seattle. (Currently live in the bay area).

**I need some advice for this time when I apply. Some things I have thought of are**

1. Practicing leet code, reviewing some fundamental lecture notes (ex harvard cs 100 online, udemy courses),
2. Try to do well on hacker rank, try out for triplebyte
3. Do more than apply online, probably reach out to recruiters directly
4. Apply to startups, anyone know if these guys will pay decently in the bay area?

&amp;#x200B;

I am genuinely a bit scared because after browsing this forum it seems like there are hundreds of students with good resumes from good schools not getting opportunities. Im willing to work very hard (already am) to break in and give it a second chance just want to see if its worth it or any better ways to try to get in.

I have my resume that I used back then for reference, not much has changed except 2 new courses completed and my sales job which is irrelevant

I currently live with my parents and I am enrolled in a community college but I may have to move out soon due to personal reasons and that is a scary though considering I make less than $13 an hour working part time.  If I do move out, which is very likely at this moment, I will end up working overtime and probably living in Detroit.  I am no stranger to working hard, but living on my own in Detroit working 50+ hours a week  is going to have a negative impact on my education and I fear may lead me to fail or dropout.  Perhaps if I didn't care about programming and computer science, I wouldn't care so much about dropping out, but truth be told I am very passionate about programming and have spent a lot of time learning on my own.  Through my own time and research I have created significant projects using Java, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, C#, Python, Prolog and many more langues, and I try to take at least an hour everyday to work on a personal project.  I've gotten all the fundamentals down such as if statements, data types, loops, ect.  Out of all the CIS classes I've taken, I'm usually in the top three of students as far as my grade, but also programming knowledge.   I am certainly not trying to brag, just trying to demonstrate that despite the fact I still have a ton to learn, I believe I am  capable of an entry level position at a tech company.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the point to all this is that I'm desperate and I am willing to learn whatever I can from people who are far more experienced than I.  Any advice, or anything anyone has to offer is greatly appreciated.  Hopefully someone who reads this will know something that could be of great help.  Even if it's not, I'm sure it will be useful.  

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, applying is an obvious start and I have applied to many places.  But everywhere I apply I read ""Bachelors Degree Required"" which is about 2 and a half years away for me.  Even internships usually require some sort of prior formal experience.  I had an OTP interview with a recruiter about an internship as a back end intern and he told me ""We usually only hire people who are nearing the end of their degrees"" which blew my mind because I thought internships were for students.  I also have a github with my most important work on there.

I know MQF is basically a math program, and I'm pretty confident about my own, as I've already known most of the materials like real/functional/complex analysis, advanced probability, stochastic process and analysis at heart. My degree is a CS from a decent uni in the states with a 3.7/4.0 GPA from quite a while back.

Do I need to somehow weasel my way into a relevant intern or can I just try my luck without further prep?

Besides, how is the writing exam? And how is the interview? For the latter, are you basically given a bunch of difficult problems and asked to get as far along as you can go with it? How difficult are the problems? I've done quite a few interviews like this, and a similar one with ENS though I got outright rejected."

There are like 3 interns and 2 full time developer who took over this project from the last bunch of interns and a full time who left. Everyone is new to the project, and the full times were also working on other projects as well so basically every new feature is added by the interns, the full time just do the review. 


We worked on the project but the transfer of knowledge and doc is terrible, and we basically patched on every module to come up with new functionalities, and the structure looks messy as hell since the previous co-ops have different understanding of the requirements. And now after a few months we leave and there would be other interns who take over from us.


I wonder how many turnovers would the project endure until it's completely unmaintainable, and what I can do to avoid this kind of problem. I did wrote some docs and comments but it really is difficult to follow someone else's train of thought and code ""the same way""."

One would think that should be enough to say it has an advantage but I wonder if the program is too applied.

For example a MSDS has no courses in data structures and algorithms, and only graze aspects of software development. Many of the stats courses don’t really teach any thing higher than stats many have already learned in a year long stats and prob sequence, just in the context of big data.

So I wonder if a MSCS that focuses on machine learning would actually be more competitive. Specific tools like Hardoop and Spark can be learned on eDx.org or during an internship. 

But maybe software development skills, algorithms, and data structures really aren’t that valuable for data scientists. Thoughts?"
bi5nq6,0,2019-04-27,Confused why everyone on this subreddit thinks UTCS is so good?,Lfsiaoz1,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bi5nq6/confused_why_everyone_on_this_subreddit_thinks/,"I’ve been lurking for a while on this sub and don’t understand why people think UTCS is so good. Using an alt account for obvious reasons.

I’m a current UTCS student, and I can tell you from first hand experience that it’s not that good of a CS program from what I can tell. Most of the people I’ve met significantly lack analytical skills to even be in the major. The SAT average for the program isn’t high at all compared to other CS programs, and to add insult to injury, I was in class the other day and some guy was asking why 2x^3 + 3x^3 = 5x^3. I mean, what the actual fuck. How did he pass middle school? 

Besides the student population, the actual academic part isn’t anything special. Most of the classes you take are pretty typical and focus mostly on material that is out of touch with today’s industry. While they do offer courses like AI, you can’t actually expect to learn it in depth when they only offer a 1 semester course in it. And even if you wanted to take it, it will probably be waitlisted by the second or third day of registration, so good luck getting into the class. The classes are overfilled to the brink, and it’s so bad to the point where they don’t even let you sign up for more than 2 CS classes at one time. So you’re essentially a CS major who can take all the English courses you want, but only two CS courses at a time. How the fuck does that make any sense? Instead of wasting money on $1000 lab chairs, maybe they should try to attract more professors to teach classes.  

When people talk about job prospects on here, it seems pretty good, right? There are several getting into top companies every year. But when I look at job prospects, our average salary is $85k, which is significantly lower than any other top CS school by a margin of $15k. I know many people in Turing Scholars who have to email hundreds of recruiters to try to get an internship, and the rest of the population barely even tries till junior year. Moreover, almost all of the people who get into those top companies are shoved into basic software roles at their local Austin sites. Try going on LinkedIn and see how many UTCS grads work at the Austin location of Google and Apple vs. the HQ in California (where they make executive decisions and have perks and dish out the big bonuses). 

After seeing all this first hand and listening to the advice from this subreddit on choosing college, I don’t get where all this positivity is coming from. To sum it all up, there’s nothing special about the student population, the academic classes, and the job prospects. If anything, this top 10 ranked CS program produces average candidates, and along with that average salaries."

UCSD 
pros:
- in state 
- great bio program (I'm going as microbio major and premed track) 
- close to home 
Cons: 
- too close to home 
- socially dead vibe (I've done research and internships at UCSD and I'm kind of sick of the school now :/) 
- super competitive

UW 
Pros: 
- beautiful campus 
- in honors program 
- I've already arranged for roommates there 
- I can imagine myself being happy there (I love being right next to the nature but also the city, I feel like UW has so much tradition and values because it's a pretty old school, and I feel like I'll feel as I BELONGED there?? If that makes sense) 
- decently far away from home (considering that I was thinking about going to Boston, the distance isn't too bad) 
Cons: 
- expensive cuz oos
- far away from home (pro and a con I guess) 
- although I can IMAGINE myself being happy there, that doesn't mean I'll actually be happy there so I'm scared that I might regret going there and paying so much extra to go there ://

This all took about a year, while I was in school. I sacrificed cramming 18 credits a semester into 2 days a week to extend my Summer internship into this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still woefully underpaid to an embarrassing extent. Seriously McDonalds employees make more than I do in some places. Started putting my resume out in November for Summer internships expecting some call backs based on the fact I had professional experience. None. Applied in all software related fields, because that is what I want to do. Nothing at all. On a whim in January I applied for some IT related positions, immediately I was receiving calls and taking interviews left and right. Tons of offers. But I don't want to do this.

I'm at the moment 22. BA in Economics. Was easy switch from my previous major then and I wanted to be done with school fast(finished half semester early and much happier since). Didn't intern then and wasn't interest in it as a career path or sure what I wanted to do.

Since graduation(Dec2018) I've been working at a gym as a service rep. Moved back with parents and don't have to pay rent which is nice. I really like my coworkers and the work has gotten better(stuck with kids all day to actually helping around club and interacting with adults). Wish more of them were single but that's another matter. I feel like I'm pretty good at customer service/making them happy and my bosses like me. It's pays min wage tho and I'm lucky I even get full time. I applied for other jobs but the pay, distance, and job itself were pretty bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Since about Feburary 2019 I've been working towards getting into tech. I fluctuated between IT and [Soft.Dev](https://Soft.Dev). Eventually decided to go more of the [Soft.Dev](https://Soft.Dev) route. Didn't go in blind, I had some previous experience coding/programming, but my progress as has been iffy. Mostly because I feel like I kept changing what I was aiming for(game, web, mobile, etc). After talking to r/cscareerquestions and r/learnprogramming I was mostly told to keep focusing on the fundamentals. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm getting progressively frustrated. I can't decide between just taking time off to do a boot camp or just keep going self-taught My goal would to be a freelancer or mobile dev, but other jobs like web-dev might be easier to get into. Best thing so far was some inconsistent communication with a company through [Angel.co](https://Angel.co) . 

&amp;#x200B;

But, at the same time, I question if I'm doing it for the right reason. Where I am, I'd need at least 45k/yr to afford anything, 50k to be somewhat comfortable. I have very little debt from uni, but I really don't want to go back to Uni and I've really liked doing something self-taught.  I like computers, tech, and etc. A lot. But whenever I take career quizzes I always get medical stuff and I've never been interested in medicine or therapy. I always liked the idea of military or cop but as I got older those specific roles aren't attractive for personal reasons. My GPA was 2.7 cum, 3.1 technically in my last semester.

&amp;#x200B;

My goal has been to get a salaried job by October since that's when my CPR cert expires. But also because I want to have my own place, have money to be comfortable and etc. Feel like an adult or something like that.

Should I keep aiming for tech/programming?"

I've been job searching for about 2 months. These two would lead me to two different lifestyles as they are in different states and have an impact on my career path. I need help making a decision on whether a job or internship is better for me at this state.

A:

* Full-time at $38k/yr (initially) at a low standard of living state.
* Small tech startup, less than 25 employees
* I applied to be front end junior developer. Midway they told me that they require me to learn a different role to learn their software for up to several months before I slowly begin developer work as do other employees (which is the one of the reasons why I hesitate because my job title will not be ""developer"" at first). I would be re-evaluated after doing some dev work about 6 months in. I did some linkedin stalking and it does seem to be the case as one or two developers were this \[""job title""\] before but I'm not sure about the length it takes to reach that point.
* I think I do trust them on eventually receiving developer work because the person I've talking to is really nice and have been pretty transparent throughout the interviewing process on my status. I've seen their software demo and it looks good.

B:

* Front-end web development summer paid internship
* Medium-sized marketing agency company with large clients
* Bad reviews on workplace politics, company seems on a slope and multiple layoffs on glass door. Somewhat irrelevant as an intern.
* Provides mentorship, networking opportunities, workshops, and the opportunity for me to be immersed in a work environment longer existing company that has a strong foundation in the industry.
* The intern will work on web projects but it could vary whether it is working on small modules of the website or something larger.

Shared:

* Both have a small development team.
* Working on the front end of web applications

A looks better as a full-time job at the same time B provides a lot of potential with the resources to offer me guidance throughout 3 months. The pay isn't a huge factor to me because I'm seeking experience first but I want to choose the one where I can develop my cs skills the most and also lead me in a more smooth transition into future jobs. A would be perfect if it wasn't for requiring me to learn a different role first with a different title. I could take the risk to find out since I'll give it 3-4 months but my experience would be weaker than the internship and a huge disappointment if it turned out to be a fluke. 

I would like some perspectives to see what I might not have thought of yet or to help process my concerns about each company. I'm open on any recommendations to help narrow it down a bit more between the two or keep looking.

Having a community of CS majors that are both reaching out for help as well as offering advice really helped me throughout my time in college. The clock is ticking down to graduation and I thought it might help some other people to share some of the ""life/professional lessons"" I gained not only from this sub but also from courses, professors, internships, and the fear of the unknown.


Imposter syndrome. You will experience it. It's more intense for some than it is for others. I can't tell you the number of times that I felt so overwhelmed by taking some huge leap in the start of my career that I completely shut down and avoided it all together. It happens, but you cannot let fear of the unknown control you. To overcome the fear, dive in. Try new things, find mentors, don't be afraid to fail. You will never achieve comfort with your skill set until you try. You're new to this. You're in college (or new to a position) and that's okay!

 
The tech world is always changing and that can seem scary. CS is still ""new"" versus health care, liberal arts, and math-focused degree paths. There's not really a solid foundation across the board of schools of what should be covered (I'm talking chapter by chapter and not your basic course titles). I see a lot of ""is my university bad?"" and a lot of the time, no. I don't think the descriptions given paint a terrible image in my mind (with some exceptions). I do really like seeing these questions though. It's important to pay attention and ask questions to make sure that you're paying tuition to get a good education.


Have fun. Don't just lock yourself in your room. Make friends, check out clubs and maybe pick up some new hobbies. It's easy to get burnt out early on if you eat, sleep, and breathe CS. Party responsibly, but keep your main focus on school. Enjoy, but don't over-indulge. Please stay safe and make informed decisions when you are out with friends.


Focus on your health- mental and physical. Your health matters. If you feel that you are becoming overwhelmed, developing or are already struggling with anxiety, ask for help. Seriously, I cannot begin to tell you how much every single person that I know that struggled, myself included, benefited from seeking counseling services from school or private psychologists/psychiatrists. CS is hard, college is hard, growing up and realizing that life is changing is hard. Everyone I am talking about agrees with me that we all wish we would have just reached out sooner. If the person you speak to isn't really helping, first ask yourself if you are being completely honest with them or leaving anything out that may be contributing to how you feel. If you don't click with that person, find someone else. Ask your school about options for outside help if money is tight. My school counselor usually only gives 3 free appointments per semester, but I have been getting free help for two years after being honest about financial hardships.


Learn how to ask questions. Practice in school with TAs, professors, and students. Practice how to turn technical language into something that can be explained to a non-technical audience and vice versa. Explain CS concepts to people following different degree paths. If you have a question on an assignment, Google first. When you ask for help, start with, ""*I attempted to find the answer to this problem by [x, y, z]*, but I wasn't able to completely wrap my head around the solutions I found. Do you have any insight on the issue *or have any resources that you can point me to that may help me find a better explanation?*"" This shows that you take initiative to learn on your own and you have confidence in being self-sufficient. Don't spend a ton of time looking for a solution though. If its getting to the point where you're spending too much time to find an answer (think about business- wasting company time and money), ask a colleague. All of this practice will come in handy when it's time to network, get internships, and apply for tech jobs.


Go to networking events. Practice speaking professionally. Bring your friends and go together, it helps so much to suffer through a flop introduction with companies at job fairs, but being able to laugh and relate with your friends makes it sting less. You'll fuck up, it's fine. Learn about speaking appropriately and clearly in a business environment.


Keep kicking. I never thought I would be holding this cap and gown in my hands right now. I literally cried. I seriously did not think I would make it through, but I did. It took me five years to complete this degree, but I made it. Nobody cares, nobody has mentioned it. All that has mattered are my skills and how my personality meshes with people that I would be working with daily.


I did so poorly on exams, but I forced myself to put myself out there. Every single opportunity that I've had has been through diving into the deep end. Professionally admitting that I felt a little lost as a second semester sophomore to a staff member ended up getting me a connection that lead to my first internship. Asking my favorite professors to be my mentors opened up doors for recommendation letters, internship opportunities, and encouragement. Forcing myself to go to these interviews and just give it my all and be myself landed me two internships as a junior in college. The connections I made in internships widened my network and offered so many learning experiences. Those internships got me even better recommendations (professors vs. superiors in the work force), they opened up more opportunities for me, they helped me stand out in a crowd of a ton of other CS students.


It's ok to feel lost but your professors were young at one point, struggling to get through the very material you're learning. They're human and many will go above and beyond to help you. Don't give up. To everyone that is graduating, congrats. This is a new step in life that we're all taking regardless of our age or experience in the workforce before jumping into CS. The blood, sweat, and tears will make it worth it in the end. Best of luck to everyone and be proud of even the smallest of achievements. You can do this.


A special note to those of you who are not in college: the smartest, most qualified person that I have ever met in my professional career did not ever get a degree. He is self-taught, he has worked in government contracting, he's held C-level positions. That's not to say that degrees don't help or they aren't worth it. You can get back what you put in with your time, effort, and practice. The person I am speaking about is looked up to by many people. He is very kind and welcoming to me when I joined one of my internships and became a mentor to me throughout this journey. Do what you can, keep trying. Build a portfolio, show off your progress. There are so many tools online to help and please message me if you want some resources."

&amp;#x200B;

Greetings people of Germany,

I (Indian student ) recently got an offer from a German University in Berlin, SRH Berlin, for Master of Engg and intl. business with a focus on renewable energy and waste/water management. Just to let you know that i do plan on learning German if and when i go there. I had a couple of questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is SRH Berlin a good University ( reputation-wise and how do employers view it) ? Also, any details you can give me about the uni would be greatly appreciated since there are only 1-2 posts on reddit mentioning the uni and 1-2 on quora, so dont have much to go on.
2. I know this question is going to be hard to answer - what does the job scene look like, i know German language is a must, but other than that what chances do i have of employment after my degree ? ( i know that germany allows you to say for about a year to look for employment ). I dont have much work exp. i have only done **two internships worth 8 months** in total 
3. This is kind of same as the first one but i know SRH Berlin is smaller than many other unis, but i have a problem judging it, since i know of big unis that treat international students as cash cows and its really hard to graduate from there and i know some small unis even though they are small they provide solid employment opportunities and a tight knit environment for students and a tight relation with profs. where does SRH Berlin fit on this scale ?

Any sort of help is really appreciated

Thank you and cheers!!"

I'm planning on going into dentistry later on, but I don't know which undergrad to go to.

I'm a little biased towards USC because LA is super fun and nice...

USC also has a dental school in it, so I feel like there may be better resources there?

But I know that Emory is known for having a really good/strict pre-health program, so I feel like Emory may be better just for applying, getting into, and going through dental school...

I don't really know much about the grading systems at either schools, but I know that grades are huge for dental school admissions...

Which school is better in terms of helping students apply to dental school, getting the resume for dental school, grading system, internships, and getting ready for DAT???

I only have like 4 more days to decide... please help!!!

EDIT: in terms of financially, I literally don't have to pay anything to go to Emory for basically all four of my years. With all the scholarships and aid that I've received from USC, I have to pay $2000 this year and probs like $7000 the three years after.... sooo.... IDK."

Now, I want to be at UofT. I rather live in a big city where I can experience things other than just engineering, and I want people around me who are helpful and super fun!  (people at UWaterloo seem to only care about outperforming each other and edgy memes, it also just seems depressing overall) 

However, it's just UWaterloo's co-op that is preventing me from choosing. Everyone tells me if I work hard enough and stay motivated, I'll find internships in UofT too and it'll be okay. I will definitely do both of those things (have already started on side projects and have a prior internship), but I just wanna make sure that I'll have the same opportunities here that I would've had in UWaterloo. I don't want to end up working really hard and still be at a disadvantage compared to UWaterloo students.

Do some recruiters only hire from UWaterloo, or are biased towards it? If I apply to Cali jobs on my own, will companies there not choose me because hiring through a university co-op system may be easier for them? Do the Big N companies come to UofT to hire interns? Basically, if I work super hard, will I get the same career opportunities I would have in UWaterloo?

Besides that, I have been programming for some time Python/Rust/Clojure and have some personal projects in all of them, along with some freelance jobs.

For example, when should I begin applying to full time positions? I have been casually applying here-and-there recently, but haven't really gotten responses and have tried to refrain, as I believe its too early for me to be considered 8+ months out.

Am currently working an internship that will run to graduation, and am planning on grinding leetcode and working on another side project over the summer, but are there any other steps that I can take to ensure I have options in the fall?

My internship will probably extend me a full-time offer, but I am not very interested in working there after graduation, so I really want to do what I can to ensure at least a few other opportunities.

bif2dw,1,2019-04-28,Help me choose between UMiami and Rensselaer,JB7FTW,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bif2dw/help_me_choose_between_umiami_and_rensselaer/,"Hi, I'm a senior that's in the process of choosing a school for architecture. The decision date is coming up soon and I have narrowed my choices down to 2 schools. UMiami and Rensselaer. I got a full tuition scholarship from UMiami (50k/year) and 28k/year from Rensselaer. The money isn't too important, I want the best education possible that will set me up to be successful. I also want to grow as a person so I want to go somewhere with a bit of freedom. Here's my analysis of each factor at school after attending each of their architecture tours:

&amp;nbsp;

Cost-

UM wins, but Rensselaer is not that expensive

&amp;nbsp;

Location-

UM wins. UM is near Miami which is a fun place to go to college and Rensselaer is in Troy, NY which is the opposite. I'm from the Northeast so I can withstand Rensselaer's cold weather if needed.

&amp;nbsp;

Facilities-

Rensselaer. Both have good facilities and are committed to spending money to better their facilities, but I would say Rensselaer at the moment is more technologically advanced.

&amp;nbsp;

Education-

Rensselaer wins. They cover a lot of abstract and creative ways of thinking that I admire, but I still question the practicality of a lot of their work. They also seem very computer focused whereas UM has more drawing and hand model making. UM is definitely behind imo, as the freshman student work from Rensselaer was a bit more impressive than UM's.

&amp;nbsp;

Social Life-

UM by far. Rensselaer seemed fairly depressing and while the student body was nice, they seemed contained in their respective areas. I'm not a jock by any means, but watching sports is a huge part of my life(if u lurk my profile u'll see) and I've always wanted to support a college sports team. UM gives me that opportunity to have a more normal college life that will be more enjoyable than Rensselaer.

&amp;nbsp;

Reputation-

Rensselaer wins (based on what I've gathered). Rensselaer seemed to really push that they're very well known in the world of architecture, which is why I'm here to confirm that. UMiami is a bit more of a rising school, not as good of a reputation.

&amp;nbsp;

Job Opportunities- 

Tie. Both are similar in terms of actually getting students to get jobs. Both encourage internships and have job fairs, but neither put you into a firm.

&amp;nbsp;

In conclusion, I'm pretty torn between these two schools. My parents want me to go to the closer and higher ranked Rensselaer, while the teen in me is leaning towards UM. Please give any advice on what I should do because I'm pretty lost right now."

I have been working with my company since the summer between senior year of high school and freshman year of college (for reference I am about to graduate in two weeks). I had worked my way up to a supervisory role and I was in that for two years. In order to graduate, I needed to get an internship. Because of this, I asked my current boss if I would be able to intern here. He said that would be no problem but that I should also apply to be the operations manager. I applied and I was chosen for the position. It would count as both my internship and my career. Soon after, I closed on an apartment with my close friend. This all happened within the span of two months. The first month of the job wasn’t bad as I was working along side my boss. He has never been overly receptive to questions (of which I obviously had many) and did not give much guidance. He left for vacation about 8 days ago and will return on Tuesday after giving me a long list of things to accomplish on my own. I quickly realized that I do not have the knowledge to be left in charge and have struggled to accomplish most of the tasks. Asking questions is very difficult, and I in fact asked an important question today and was told to “leave it until he gets back” and that I should start taking notes. I take notes of mostly everything he says but it would be impossible to remember absolutely everything that is being thrown at me.

I have quickly learned that this job is not for me but I feel trapped. If I were to quit, I would not meet my internship requirements, therefore would not graduate. I would also most likely not be able to afford my apartment on an hourly job. My only option would be to move in with my parents who live half way across the country. I am looking for guidance but do not receive any and am on edge every day that I am here. I have not had a day off from work or class in almost a month and it is affecting both physically and mentally. I understand this is a complex situation but I really feel completely lost.

TL:DR - hired for new job that counts as internship requirement, do not have the knowledge to complete job. If I were to quit, I’d lose my apartment, not be able to graduate, and would have to move half way across the country. Affecting both physically and mentally"

Every time I would come on this thread to ask advice or to look for information the majority of the responses were just toxic taunts and people trying to put others down. It seems like there are a select group (which is pretty large) of redditors on here who actively work to stress others out. So much of the stuff they talk about is just salary, ""passed deadlines"" for applications, and how amazing they are, however they spend the majority of their day on Reddit commenting

&amp;#x200B;

**I dont know what some of you people have stuck in your behinds but I would recommend you get your rectums checked out. Working for Google does not give you the right to put others down just because they work in say oklahoma or kansas for a lesser salary than yours (who knows if your ""salary"" is even real or just another fantasy of yours)**

&amp;#x200B;

Overall Im sure the way some of you toxic people behave is a pain in the ass for your coworkers and keep in mind when the economy does and will crash software developers are going to be part of the horde first to go. Being an ass to compensate for your lack of personality, friends, or social life, personal happiness wont help your story to keep your job.

&amp;#x200B;

I left for a career in Saas sales and had multiple offers in my hand within 2 weeks. My first job was a bit low paying where I had a 60 k base and a total commission earning of around 30 k per year pro rated, but I performed well and got promoted to an account executive within 5 months and of course the salary bump landed at around 160 total comp. I didnt leet code practice, need any internships, prior work experience or have to do anything fancy. I would not even look back at going into cs ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

And people in the sales community are friendlier, more personable, harder working, less rambunctious, and frankly more attractive. Its funny software developers are intended to collaborate to produce a stellar product but the majority of the work culture and balance revolves around throwing other people under the bus to a) climb higher b) compensate for your lack of phalic girth. Grow up."

Hey guys,

I'm a 26 year old business senior and I have only a few 'core' courses left to stall with. When it comes to Marketing (the degree I sought initially), I have come to feel like my skills might be better utilized elsewhere and I've realized I'm not really passionate about it. My main goal is working to live but at the same time I enjoy making a positive impact.

So the two main replacement candidates I've been torn between are Finance &amp; Business Administration but I'm worried that my relatively late start might make certain things difficult for me. I know my proficiency in math would probably make me a good accountant but I worry that the work would be boring or otherwise unfulfilling.

When it comes to Finance it seems like a lot of the sharp young students might get a fancy internship and go from there and I wonder if there's still room for me to shine. I've also read that you benefit from having a large personal network of which I am definitely unequipped of right now. When it comes to Business Administration, it seems like the thing to do is usually to go for the MBA which would mean I'm only halfway there. The prospect of being in school for another three years is a bit intimidating in the sense that I've historically been very debt-averse &amp; would likely have to take out some kind of loan to buckle down &amp; get 'er done.

Some potentially relevant tidbits:

* I have always been exceptionally good with numbers
* Did sales for a year and a half, I survived in a pretty cutthroat company, was definitely not bad at it
* Strong customer service background, I've also worked in retail &amp; the service industry, but the bulk of my employment has been centered around financial services
* I feel like I am generally pretty perceptive when it comes to people bullshitting, am generally pretty trusting of my intuition

A couple of limitations to note as well, due to playing a lot of video games for much of my life, my body has payed the toll a bit in the form of:

* Semi-regular floaters in my vision, they're pretty subtle but have been on an uptick. I plan to get it evaluated ASAP
* Some Carpal Tunnel

Right now I have a job related to fraud management, I work cases all day and pretty much stare at a screen. I take some measures to protect my eyes now such as reducing brightness &amp; setting the screen to a ""warm"" tone. Something to keep in mind when considering the job I might end up with someday. I know this is some pretty open-ended stuff &amp; I may end up trying to sit down with my academic advisor next week, but typically the stuff they handle is on the dry side &amp; I wanted to see if any of my fellow Redditors had thoughts."

I have to make a decision soon, so I wanted to get some other opinions on my situation.

I am looking to pursue a major in Computer Science, and I am having a hard time choosing between Chapman and Riverside.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapman**

\+ Small class sizes (40 is the largest)

\+ Professors have been in the industry (Companies like Google, Boeing, etc.)

\+ Environment is great. 

\+ Studying abroad is made very simple, as well as getting internships and doing research

\+ Faculty from the school has been nice and have been nothing but helpful

\+ Switching majors and taking on a double major or minors are very easy to do

\+ Graduating in 3 years is very possible

\+/- Campus is small

\- Computer Science is not their strong suit

\-  Underdeveloped STEM fields, but they are pouring a lot of money and time (Finished building a Science and Reseach center a couple of months ago and next year they will finish their new engineering building)

\- There aren't any popular tech clubs kinda like IEEE

&amp;#x200B;

**Riverside: SIDE NOTE (**I only went on their engineering tour because I couldn't make the campus tour**)**

\+ School is obviously more well known

\+ Their name may be helpful for future jobs, at least better than Chapmans

\+ Computer Science is their biggest program at the school

\+ Many clubs and research opportunities 

\+/- Campus is medium sized

\- Class sized are medium sized (200-300 students)

\- Professors may be harder to reach out to just because of the sheer amount of students

\- Switching majors and going for a double major or minor is more difficult

As of right now I want to go to grad school. I’m getting a great GPA, have a job at my school of engineering, am getting involved with the IEEE and ACM, and will hopefully do research next year along with an internship. 
I believe I’m making great progress towards grad school but I was “written up” by my school for a marijuana incident. I proved my innocence and my case has been admonished but according to the supervisor I talked to it will still stay on my disciplinary record. My record will indicate the incident report and note my innocence however.
From the grad school applications I saw you need to state if you have a disciplinary record and why. My question is how will this affect my chances of getting into grad school? I’m not set in any school / program yet so I’m just asking in general. 
Thanks!"

I am a senior from Southern California looking to study computer science/computer engineering. I have narrowed my decision down to the two aforementioned schools. I am finding it extremely difficult to chose and it’s getting pretty late, so hopefully you guys can help!

#USC: Admitted Undeclared

*Pros*

-Close to home (2 hour by train/car)

-Great weather that I’m used to

-Lovely campus (small, consolidated)

-Great Engineering program (flexibility, ample opportunity to explore various minors)

-Amazing internship/co-op/networking opportunities (engineering career fair alone is the same size as the school-wide career fair)

-Good class availability (small class sizes; all taught by professors; easy to get first choice classes)

-Great name brand and alumni network in California (would help with jobs)

-Could potentially go to same school as my twin brother (always a plus)

*Cons*

-Expensive (Didn’t qualify for government aid but got some scholarships; parents said they would pay for everything but I would like to minimize cost as much as possible)

-Sketchy surrounding area

-Alleged pretentious vibe (one that I didn’t really pick up on both times that I visited)

-Might not be able to switch into Engineering department* (I’ll explain this one at the end)

#UIUC: Admitted EE

*Pros*

-Exceptional Engineering program (lots of funding/research available; state of the art facilities)

-Great internship/co-op opportunities (department solely dedicated to helping engineering students find internships)

-Already admitted into Engineering (would most likely make it easier to switch into CE as it is in the same school as EE)

-Lots of niche clubs (many fraternities and special interest clubs)

-Nice campus (not as nice as USC but still nice)

-Great college town (lots of bars, eateries, and entertainment)

-More affordable (almost 20k a year less than USC)

*Cons*

-Less flexibly (Large public schools with less accommodation than a private school like USC)

-Less class availability (larger class sizes; some taught by TA’s; might be more difficult to get classes you want)

-Far from home (would take most of the day to get to; no direct flights into Champaign; traveling would probably also cost a lot)

-Shocking weather (will be especially brutal for ya boy)

-Huge campus (hard to get around on foot, would have to take the bus)

-Would definitely not try to switch into CS (heard it’s a nightmare)

-Name might not be as recognizable to California employers?

*I was admitted as UNDECIDED at USC. At first I wasn’t sure what this means, and I’m still not entirely sure; but essentially I would have to take 3 Engineering classes and 1 math class in my first year and obtain a B or higher in all of them, all while keeping above a 3.0 aggregate gpa. I’m not 100% sure, but it seemed like I would then be admitted into the engineering program of my choice once I am able to fulfill these requirements."
bik6i3,2,2019-04-28,Am I Beyond Help? (27F),AhkwardKat,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bik6i3/am_i_beyond_help_27f/,"Alright, so this is my first real post, so forgive me if I don't do this right.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost my job in Los Angeles due some shady dealings with my employer in November 2018. I worked and lived in a hotel and had to use my minimal savings to move back home (to South Dakota) as I had nowhere to go. I don't have many friends to speak of as I am generally very reserved in person, though online is a little different. My mother is toxic, an understatement honestly. I am preparing to move out now, however I'm wondering if the problems are myself or my family. I finally got a job after 5 months of searching and I want to move out, but now I'm wondering if I am the fucked up one? I'm sorry this is a bit winded, but I want the backstory and the math available to be as transparent as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

As children (I have two younger brothers, I'm the oldest and only girl) CPS was called numerous times, but nobody did anything since ""injuries"" were not in ""sensitive"" places and the emotional issues weren't severe enough either I guess? We were regularly subjected to things being thrown at us, I was slapped and tossed into walls. I have physical scars from some of the things that went down. My mom would call us horrible names and slaughtered any self esteem. Most of this happened after my mother and father divorced. My mother and father divorced when I was 8, after my mother up and took my brother and I away from my father just leaving the house randomly a few months before. From there until now (I'm 27), I almost never see him, and barely know him, so I couldn't go live with him. I was too afraid to tell anyone about the abuse because as military kids, we moved a lot, and never had any friends. We had lived in this one location after my mother married again (my first step father) and this was when the abuse started, or maybe I started remembering then. This started about 10 and lasted until I was about 16. Then my mother and first step-father divorced and I moved out of my mother's home and into my grandmothers home (almost 1500 miles away) and spent my senior year of high school in a new place. I was so messed up I was angry and threatening to a lot of people and saw a counselor for the next 3 or 4 years until I finished my first college degree (AAS in Animation). Eventually I calmed, but was very sensitive and my PTSD would trigger easily at first. I was ok for a time.

&amp;#x200B;

I never dated during high school or my first year of college. I am absolutely terrified to date, though I did try. I couldn't, and still, stand to be touched in any way. Even just from friends, or other family members. My body just pulls away instinctively, and this makes my ""friends"" think I hate them. I tried to date one guy, but after he tried to cuddle with me and I pulled away, I got scared of any commitment, afraid it would turn into a controlling environment after his reaction. So I left him after only a few months. The only guy I truly liked had died in a car accident in high school, so I simply shut down in terms of looking for any sort of emotional connection to anyone between the abuse and relationships not working out.

&amp;#x200B;

However my grandparents and I didn't get along either. We fought constantly, mostly because of issues with my self-esteem and anger from getting over stuff in the past. They said I wasn't living with Mom anymore and needed to ""get over it"". I was overly sensitive and angered easily, however my grandparents were also angry I was studying art and telling me to get a ""real career"". When I applied to transfer to another art college, I was literally kicked out. I moved in with a friend for about 2 weeks, I was 20, almost 21, and didn't my family didn't have to keep me anymore. I got my acceptance letter soon after and was granted permission to stay with my family for two weeks until I got my stuff together to move 2000+ miles away for my new college.

I got mixed messages from my family about them being proud of me for pursuing a Bachelors degree and for them being angry about it being Art. I should note I was not drawing all my life, I had planned on being in the medical or animal related fields but had a TB scare, and thus it was on my record, as far as I know, am not allowed to work with children or animals. I wanted to be in forensics or a biologist of some kind, probably bats. That's why I started drawing art, I loved animals and originally wanted to go into wildlife art. However during my years at my first and second college, I started loving storytelling and fell in love with comics, manga and animation. I was studying illustration at my second school and had a good enough portfolio to transfer and skip freshman year.

&amp;#x200B;

However college was still expensive, each year of tuition was about 30-40k. My father, who was far more supportive, gave me his GI Bill, but as the school was private, it was capped at 20k, plus the money I got from the VA and College via the Yellow Ribbon, so an additional 10k a year.  I pretty much got my tuition covered, and had to pay almost everything else. I still ended up with sizable debt in 3 different loans, one in my name and one in my parent's (mom and step-dad #2) names, which THEY decided to take. I was going to quit, but they took it out. I found this strange as they were not the most supportive, but eat of us had about 25k in loans, so about 73-75 was my principal amount. Yeah, I know it's a lot, but considering the 3 years cost about 150k total, I got away pretty good only owing half of that. I'm making payments, and have been since graduating in 2015. My personal loan is at about 24k, so I'm keeping up with interest at least, not too bad, and my mother and second step father are paying the Parent PLUS loans they took out. I pay one of their loans, on top of mine. So that is about 600$ a month I have going out since NOV of 2015.

Additionally, I know my mom and second step-dad used some of the loan money for THEMSELVES, because when I did the math on my loan money given versus what I spent, I was over 9k SHORT. I love math and am very good at it, I was a hawk tracking my money. The loan money was given to my parents and they had to give it to me, I know they kept some of it. They expect me to pay ALL their parent plus loans back and I'm resistent, so I'm only paying ONE of the two parent plus loans. Legally, they can't force me to pay more than I want to, and stealing from me was a betrayal on top of all the abuse growing up.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the fuck ups:

&amp;#x200B;

After graduation, I moved back to my grandparents, they needed some help, I needed a way to get grounded after graduation. My grandmother ended up in cardiac arrest and died for 7 minutes a few months after I moved back. My grandparents are not working, one on disability for 30 years and one just retired. Money was... not readily available without huge withdrawls. I had about 7k saved up and decided to help out my grandparents. I GAVE them the little money I had saved up for moving and getting my own place, and I found a job working at walmart at night to give me something for the moment. We continued to fight, they called me lazy and other things for staying up late and working on my comic and art after getting home from my shift at walmart. I did my chores and helped with finances and helping my grandmother recover from her near-death experience. She only survived, according to doctors because I was able to talk my grandfather through doing CPR (which I learned a few years previous when I volunteered at a hospital for high school community service credit). I was being treated like the bad one and kicked out after a year living there.

&amp;#x200B;

I had nowhere to go, my father couldn't take me in. I had no friends to take me in. My mother was my only choice, and she lived a few states away. She came to get me and seemed nicer, so I thought maybe she had changed in the years I was away at college. Not really. She was nice at first, but her and my step father were constantly guilting me about my loans. Telling me how them paying BOTH those loans (at 600 a month) was killing their retirement and that it's my fault for not having a good job and picking a shitty degree. I pretty much went from one frying pan to another. I got a ""get out letter"" for christmas 2016, literally on that day and moved out in January to a friends home an hour away and had to look for work, I got a job 4 days later, but was asked to leave my new home in March 2017 when one person and I simply didn't get along AT ALL. Again I was homeless and nowhere to go, I had only been working my job for 2 months and didn't have enough for a new place yet. Nobody would lend me the extra I needed to move into my own place versus going back to my mom's home... which I had to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't able to afford the 1 hour commute (one way) everyday, so had to quit my new job, but thankfully I got another job soon and worked very hard, lots of overtime and earned assistant manager position quickly. My mother and I went back to fighting over ""being lazy"" and ungrateful, despite paying them 600$ a month and doing all the chores, and I moved out in October 2017 into a good home, very cheap but mine. I worked regularly 70+ hours a week at my job, easy to do as an assistant manager to 3 different locations I worked at. I made a lot of money, which was great. I paid off all debt I had (about 5k in credit card and medical bills, mostly medical). I cut up and destroyed the CC's after it was cleared. Then in January 2018, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and begged me to move in with her. My step dad was an over the road trucker and wasn't home. She needed someone to care for her, I was initially resistant becuase I finally got my freedom, but she guilt tripped me. I gave in and moved back in. I paid rent, I was paying for the loans, I was her caretaker. I still was working 70+ hours a week and trying to be her caretaker too. I was on call for her and for work 24 hours a day. I got very sick, had lots of panic attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom's cancer wasn't even THAT severe. I don't want to minimize it, but she had Stage 0 Breast Ductal cancer. She acted like her life was over and she was going to die. She was an emotional mess and was angry with me if I seemed unsympathetic, usually I was just tired from doing commissions, caring for her house and her and working my regular job. Plus I was taking almost 600 to 800mg of caffiene a day. Most times I was on a high or a crash. no inbetween. I am SO ANGRY at how I was treated. I don't mind paying rent, that's fair, but I was frustrated with her calling me an ingrate and ""I wasn't working hard enough to contribute"". I was working myself to death already and began to have regular anxiety attacks. When that happened, she said ""I needed to get over it and stop worrying so much"".

&amp;#x200B;

I got my internship at a manga company in Los Angeles and moved there in June 2018 after my mom's cancer was cleared and she was proved cancer free due to treatment. The whole time leading up to my internship, Mom was telling me it was a mistake and a bad idea. she put doubt in my head and I found out after the fact, she doubted I would actually leave. Well I did. My internship was great, I learned a ton, it was unpaid and unlikely to get a job (I didn't), but I knew that before I left for Cali. The networking ALONE was worth it as I got a ""job"" with Wacom and Clip Studio while I was out there. I worked another job at the hotel I lived at but when I found some shady shit went down, I spoke up and was asked to leave. I did and was forced to move back to South Dakota.... with Mom. Since I moved back in, we fight almost daily. She mocks me for not having a ""real job"" however I do, I work for a wonderful company, making good money, 15/hr now and I'm up for a raise to 17 by the end of the year. I work in my field, art doing graphic and printwork and soon I'll be trained in lazer and sandblast engraving. I'm taking a business class and still doing comic and animation work privately.

&amp;#x200B;

I pay my own loans and one of theirs, 600$ per month total. I do teh dishes, laundry, catbox, sweeping, mopping, dusting, etc. They leave dishes on the table after eating (just walk away and leave it there). They can't throw trash away or put their own cloths away. I am told I don't contribute to the household. If I disagree with my mother in the SLIGHTEST, Mom has a fit and says I have an attitude. I am making enough to move out soon, as I am making 4$ more than I ever have before when I lived here. I can easily afford to move out in about 2 months, so I plan on it. I'm not telling HER that, because the time I even suggested it, she flipped out on me. Told me I am too inept to live alone, I'm not smart enough or wise enough, keep making mistakes and bad choices and I will fail if I move out. I can't even tell her I'm too tired to go out to a garden party/plant swap because she accused me of being uninterested in HER events and HER life. I had been up all night doing a commission and had only slept about 4 hours. I was too tired. I went anyway, and she ignored me the entire time and talked to her friends, pointless that I want.

&amp;#x200B;

She still gets in my face yelling at me. She still threatens me, but doesn't touch me anymore in terms of physical violence, probably because I'm not a child anymore and could kick her ass now. My step dad is even worse, calling me a millenial snowflake because I eat carefully (I have celiac disease and am intolerant to nighshades and milk). Says I am making it up when I have official celiac diagnosis, but unofficial intolerance. I haven't had insurance in 5 years, so I can't get a nutritionist to look at me. I'll have insurance starting in a week, so that's not an issue anymore, but they refuse to accept my dietary needs and regularly make food I can't eat, mostly stuff with gluten in it. I tell them I can't eat it, and they yell at me for wasting food and well, I make myself sick eating it. I know it is damaging my body, but it keeps the peace. I have started being mute at home in the last two weeks unless spoken to and HAVE to give an answer, but now they think I am being mean and giving the cold shoulder. Im just trying to keep peace since they always think I have an attitude in my tone of voice. So I can't speak and I can't be quiet....

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning on moving out in September before winter strikes. I'll have savings enough by then. However... I'm wondering if I am the bad one. If they say I have an attitude I do? My grandparents say it... I don't have a lot of friends. I don't ever ask for anything from friends or family. I don't talk much in general honestly except online. I don't talk about my homelife in person or at work. I literally have 1 or 2 IRL friends, both co-workers. If I got stranded on the side of the road, I would rather walk than call someone... I feel lonely and hated by everyone. I had a friend I talked to for almost 5 years every single day and she suddenly ghosted me for months. Later found out she got a GF, and was busy with summer stuff and her new GF. So I felt abandoned by her and I really only talk to one other person on a half decent basis. She is pretty busy, so I try not to bother her. Overall I feel abandoned, hated, ugly (I am overweight due to complications from celiac), and in general not someone anyone would like. I have bad health, I hate TV and going out. I hate movies, I don't enjoy stuff ""regular"" people like... idk I just... don't enjoy those things. I don't like parties or games. I like sitting in and reading, or drawing, puzzles and mystery documentaries and books. I've never had a REAL boyfriend beyond some dinners out, but it never went anywhere if you know what I mean. I don't know how to be close to people. I don't know how to make friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I just... feel like someone nobody likes and I don't know if it's me or my slaughtered self esteem or both. Probably both. I haven't really been this open before, so I apologize for the insane text wall. I mostly just want to know if people think if I really am a horrible mean unlikeable person... or if there is some hope for me.

&amp;#x200B;

EdIt: I forgot to add my two younger brothers who talk to her. They are so angry over how she treated them in teh past, they refuse to talk to her. So I am also dealing with her frustration there. I have a feeling she is trying to control me beacuse I am the only child she has access to now. I want to move out and never talk to her ever again. One brother has a child, her first grandson, which she has never seen and never met, partially due to living a few states away. So it isn't just me who doesn't like being around my mother, both of my other brothers are also avoiding her."
bikke5,2,2019-04-29,So I kinda screwed up a rejection and made this girl who is close to me cry.,Nomad_9811,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/bikke5/so_i_kinda_screwed_up_a_rejection_and_made_this/,"TL;DR. 
Had a brain fart because I was put on the spot and I was slightly drunk so I  rejected her by saying 
“I could care less of what you think of me” but what I was trying to say I generally don’t care of what people think of me and I can’t invest my time in relationships (despite my line of work I’m a bit of antisocial cunt so bear with me) by the time I realised what I had said I already saw her tearing up as she hurried away from the booth. I feel really bad for not chasing after her to tell her I’m sorry. As in I didn’t mean for this to happen I care for her but I don’t care for her in ‘that’ way. 

So at my previous workplace I was in charge of several interns in the operations department one of which is the aforementioned girl. She’s a really nice person, down to earth  and was always willing to go out of her way to help others. I know for a fact that a lot of guys at work wanted ‘get on’ with her however as her senior I had no interest whatsoever, the most appropriate way to describe how I felt towards her is, I regarded her as a little sister. It made me want to lookout for her because it’s her first corporate job, she’s straight out of university and that’s it. 

Fast forward 8 months and she gets the placement, I invite her to join our drinking group and there’s that or so I thought. Whenever someone brought up the topic of love or relationship I try to avoid it but as usual I tell them I don’t date anyone from work and I’m not interested in that sort of thing rn. Most of the time I’d stay back later than the others because well I live alone and I like to get borderline hammered and she also made a habit of staying back as well. She usually doesn’t get as drunk as I do but once I had to drop her home where she insisted I should spend the night at her place but I shrugged it off as not being herself at the moment. Despite having left my old job (almost 3 months now) I still hangout with her and the rest of the group and we never spoke of this incident. 

Alright now that’s the backstory let’s go back to last Saturday.

We had a couple of drinks the other guys bailed and yet again it was just the two of us. She was certainly drinking at a faster pace. We were talking about some stupid gossip or rumours the usual stuff  that had been going around my previous workplace and she asks how life is going on my end. I tell her I’ve never been better and all is good. She still probes me and she knew I was a bit down a couple of weeks earlier the cause for this was seeing my ex with her husband (the man she broke off the engagement with me to be with) while I was out. So I tell her this and she goes something along the lines of  
“ you know if you have problems you can simply talk to us. We care about you and I care about you a lot so and you don’t have to be alone. We can share the pain together. You are someone who’s important to me and I hurts me to see you like this” (this isn’t word for word but this is what I could I remember) she said this while she was holding my hand and it felt like she was going in for a kiss. 

I hate to say this but what she said then, it felt nice. She was genuinely concerned and knowing there is someone out there looking out for you; it was a warm feeling. But I don’t think I can bring myself to love someone again, it’s not I can’t get over her (my ex) it’s just the idea of feeling vulnerable and being truly open with someone else. It scares me now. I don’t wanna get hurt again. I don’t believe anymore, that you can love someone unconditionally because of this I said something I shouldn’t have said. 

In the heat of the moment, I was flustered and nervous. I literally had a brain fart as these words came out of my mouth. “I could care less of what you think of me” what I meant to say was I could care  less of what ‘you’ as in people in general think of me and that I’m fine by myself. She apologised for assuming things and I saw she was started crying right from the point she was leaving the booth. I could see it even more clearly through the window and all I fucking did was just stare like a dumbass. 

This is a bit of though situation for me all because I was a massive cunt to this person who cared for me. It’s always the same thing even with my family I keep hurting people around me and this is why I feel like I shouldn’t let anyone get close to me. 

So if any of you have suggestions to unfuck this all I can give you is my deepest gratitude from my heart."
biknem,1,2019-04-29,USC vs. Johns Hopkins,throwahhhhhhhhhway,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/biknem/usc_vs_johns_hopkins/,"Got admitted as a History major to both USC and Hopkins. Plan on doing pre-law track with a double major in International Relations/Studies or Poli Sci, but I might change to Economics down the road.

&amp;#x200B;

USC Pros:

\- Close to home, I would still live on campus but I could drive home on the weekends and stay close to my family/friends without having to worry about travel costs

\- Really pretty campus when I visited, and being close to LA is a plus as well

\- Weather

\- Alumni network

\- And yeah that's pretty much it...tbh the only reason I'm really considering USC is because it's super close to my home and I wouldn't have to leave, meaning I could stay nearby my family and friends and I would potentially not feel as lonely.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\- Doesn't really have strong History/Economics programs from what I've read

\- Huge party culture which I'm really not in to (I got this vibe when I visited campus)

\- Maybe too close to home? Being close to my family and friends is obviously a plus but also I feel like college should be the time to explore myself and try to open up more. I'm just afraid that I'm not ready to be so far from my friends/family and that I'll have a breakdown or something if I move away.

\- More expensive than Johns Hopkins

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Johns Hopkins Pros:

\- Much cheaper than USC

\- Prestige and reputation, top 10 history program with an amazing International Relations graduate program (meaning the resources are there)

\- So many research opportunities, even for humanities majors (ex. museum work/archeological digs)

\- Smaller campus which would make it easier to get around (although USC is also pretty small)

\- Close to Washington DC which is great for finding internships and work opportunities 

\- Big focus on research and academia which is really what I want to get in to, sends a huge portion of its students to grad school

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\- I never got to visit the campus. I did virtual tours and I've been looking at pictures so I definitely know what the campus looks like, but I know it's not the same. Everyone keeps telling me that it's more important to see what the people are like but honestly I'm extremely introverted and wherever I go I already know that it's going to take me a while to warm up to new people, no matter what those people are like. So basically at this point it just comes down to what I think of the campus. Everywhere I look online, people make it sound like a dealbreaker that I didn't visit, as in I shouldn't even consider going to the school since I don't know what it's like, but how can I pass up an opportunity like Johns Hopkins just because I never toured the campus? Idk, maybe I'm just being naive, but who knows at this point (I obviously don't).

\-  Far from home. Going here would really force me out of my comfort zone and I don't know if I'm ready for that.

\- Stressful/competitive culture? not sure if this is just a myth but yeah

\- Worried that I'll experience 'imposter culture' since I would be going as a humanities major surrounded by aspiring medical and engineering students, which is what the school is really known for

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know what to do at this point. Honestly I'm leaning towards Johns Hopkins but the fact that I never visited is really holding me back. My mom is also pressuring me into going to USC and staying close to home because she doesn't think I'm ready to leave but honestly that's just making me want to leave more, although I'm worried that she's right and that I'm going to end up leaving not because I want to but because I want to go against what she wants. I honestly don't know what to do and the stress is eating me up. I feel misguided and I don't want to make a wrong choice, but I'm worried that I will."

I am currently 23 y/o and am a senior majoring in IT. I most certainly want to apply my degree to a project management career.

I have 3 years help desk experience with a promotion to assistant manager from year 2-3.

So I was burnt out from the help desk job and needed a new one while still in school, so I looked for internships. I was looking for PM opportunities but unfortunately, did not hear back at all. Still burnt out and wanting to leave, an opportunity arose for an internship at a billion dollar company working in cyber security, so I took it. It’s been a month so far and I am absolutely crushing the work load but I am wondering if I am wasting my time. 

Am I going backwards with taking this internship?"

This is about to be long, thank you if you read all of it. I appreciate your time.

Like everyone on this sub, I’m aiming high. But when looking over everything I’ve done and what I’m involved with, I realize that I became the “failure” fable, the person that bought into vague advice and played life for the application, not the vivacity. 

I stayed busy just to do so and trusting that it would look good, but all I have now is a broad set of achievements, no depth, and no experience/investment in the areas I finally discovered I like.

I’m looking for advice on what I can do to finally pursue the passions I found this year, without dropping everything I’ve already invested myself in.

I want to figure out how to break my pattern of “doing stuff just because it would look good” and getting nowhere with it;  simultaneously I don’t want to quit everything right before applications. It’s the summer before application season, is it too late? Feel free to reply now and say if it is.

Snapshot of me:
3.97 UW, 4.19 W GPA; 6 AP classes mostly STEM and history 
Best guess of class rank is certain top 30, maybe top 15
Asian female (adopted)

1510 SAT retaking July
Subject tests planning Math II and biology August

3 Varsity letters in tennis and soccer, set to get a fourth this fall.

Taekwondo black belt (just 1st degree)

Select club soccer captain (I’m quitting club this fall; it’s no longer worth the time for the experience); league champions

KC and NHS member since freshman year; *local hospital summer program last year*; Tri M music honor society member; about 250 volunteer hours, but mostly unofficially logged and in non-consistent places with the exception of the hospital, that was consistent

8 years of an instrument; non state-placing or regionals-placing
3-&gt;4 years of school orchestra, section leader next year likely, as well as admission into chamber orchestra that just won state

Western aerospace scholar (10 large projects with a selective summer residency)

Knitting club president (irrelevant)

Will be paid interning with Boeing this summer on their 787 final assembly full-time, maybe Microsoft if that interview goes just as well


Tentative colleges:
(very) Reach: Duke, Carnegie Mellon, Pomona


Medium(?): University of Washington Seattle, UCLA, Gonzaga/Whitman



I’ve  tried to become involved with school board student advisor, ASB class VP, local city youth advisory board, state youth legislative council, KC and NHS board positions and been rejected/lost elections for all.

The essential question: how do I snap out of this and make my application stand out more, as much as I can before applications. How do I diversity my life and put my time into what I like.

My interests: medicine and writing. I enjoy the problem-solution side of medicine and the complex communication. I also love speechwriting; I can stand up and improv for hours  on a certain subject in class if I’ve studied it. I regret not doing debate.

I also enjoy weight lifting :))

Intended major is biochemistry, minor in philosophy, goal of med school

But what the hell do you do with those interests?

I’m scared; the lack of community involvement is bad. It’s something I’ve tried and talked to people to get involved, but each time it goes to someone more local, with more experience. And that keeps compounding. I’m looking for a way to make an impact without going through the very well-defined pathways to do so in my community; I have a special interest in privacy rights, specifically genetics and personal data, but don’t see a way to connect that. 

This is just one big thought barf. But if you could help me come up with ways to deepen my experience, I’d be grateful. I’m considering beginning to take up hours at the hospital again until the Boeing internship starts.
EMT is not an option to people my age, nor is assistant or any variant.

More recently, I spent about 2.5 years as an electronics engineer at a small business. Within a month of being hired, I was designing schematics regularly. My ""tedious"" tasks were creating BOMs and writing test procedures. I quickly became the go-to guy for schematics, board design, and embedded programming. I enjoyed this job so much that on weekends I sometimes couldn't wait for Mondays because I got to get back to my hobby. My boss said I ""had more potential than any engineer he had met"".

Anyway, I wanted to move to the city, and got a job up here that paid me 40% more. A software startup the exact same age and size as my last job. I never applied to them, but they contacted me because they wanted someone in electronics engineering and embedded development for their IoT projects. They said it may involve a bit of tech support while I on-ramp. Seemed reasonable.

It's been 7 months and my primary task is still tech support with no particular end in sight. Tech support drives me mad, especially because I was already DONE with all that. I was given some embedded software work a month or two ago, but I'm being moved off of it so that I can test GUI's in the afternoons after doing tech support in the morning.

To explain, tech support here primarily revolves around customers sending in HTML documents that don't render properly, and I have to troubleshoot their HTML.

I can say it is very draining and not something I can't sustain, let alone something I could possibly have a career in. I have friends telling me I should stop wasting my time with them and find a new job, and the CEO here reminds me he has plans in the future. But my managers insist on removing as much electronics and development time as possible in favor of tech support and testing.

I can't tell if I'm being improperly utilized or I'm just impatient. I just know I can't really sustain this, and I can't just sit here and look bad at tasks that are supposed to be ""easy"", when really I can't focus on what amounts to high-school tedium."

Most of the PCs here are running Win10 on SSDs, but we still have a few older ones with Win7 running on HDDs.

Now the guy who initially gave me this task left the company about 2 weeks after I joined and there are still some PCs left that I couldn't upgrade yet (since they are still actively being used).

Now the problem is that I obviously also need to deploy Office again, and activate it, but no one knows how exactly he managed the office keys. We have a huge excel sheet with 200-300 keys and their corresponding office version, but not which PC they have been used on.

What's the solution here? Can you just use the same keys multiple times without getting ducked by Microsoft as long as you have the correct overall number of licenses (I think that's what the guy that left already did)?

Is there an elegant way to extract the office keys being used on those PCs? I read there are some programs that can do this but manually extracting the keys sounds like a hassle, and feels like a pretty dirty solution.

Or is there any other obvious solution we are missing?"

Today's interview is with Jeremy Enns of [Counterweight Creative](https://www.counterweightcreative.co), a company that offers podcast production and strategy.

**Some stats:**

* Product: Podcast production and strategy.
* Revenue/mo: $10,000
* Started: April 2016
* Location: Canada
* Founders: 1
* Employees: 0

### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?

Hey there! I’m Jeremy Enns, the founder and Storyteller In Chief at Counterweight Creative, a podcast production and strategy agency.

We specialize in simplifying the process of producing a podcast for busy companies, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders, working closely to guide and assist them during the launch and setup phase, and then taking on the bulk of the production work once the show is live.

I started the company 3 years ago, in 2016 with one client, making $15/hour and have grown into a team of 10 contractors producing more than 30 shows per week with revenue of over $10K/mo.

### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?

I went to school for audio engineering, initially wanting to produce records for bands and artists. After graduating in 2012, I interned at a big studio in my hometown of Vancouver, and while I learned a lot, I quickly realized that I didn’t have the drive (or financial ability) to show up at the studio at 8am and work (for free) until 4am six or seven days a week for a year or more before moving up into a position that might pay $10/hr and actually start getting paid to work on music.

After interning just a couple of days per week for over a year, while also working full-time at a retail job, I quit the internship and put my dreams of working in the music industry behind me. I worked a number of manual labour jobs including landscape construction and maintenance, tree planting in northern Canada, and others before taking a year off to travel, bicycling across Europe, and backpacking through the Balkans, and Asia.

When I came home in the fall of 2015, I went back to a landscaping job making $15/hr and soon after discovered podcasts as a way to make use of the hours spent at work, diving into shows like Smart Passive Income by Pat Flynn among many others as I dove into learning about the world of online business.

After a few months of learning and beginning to experiment with a few half baked business ideas, a friend of mine with a well-known podcast made an off-hand comment about his podcast editor and a switch clicked in my mind. I had spent the past six months or so listening to 50+ hours of podcast content per week, and with my background in audio engineering I had more than the necessary technical knowledge to produce high quality podcasts for others.

I went home that night, started a profile on UpWork, got my first client three days later, and within six months had quit my landscaping job and was working for myself full time as a podcast producer.

### Take us through the process of producing your first podcast and launching the business.

When I first started, I catered my services heavily to my client’s needs and what they were asking for. While this was a great way to get clients early on, I soon realized that by creating set production and launch packages, I could charge more, and do more to ensure the success of the podcasters I worked with, as there were often crucial steps that they were overlooking when producing and launching their shows on their own.

Most of the people we work with have zero experience working with audio, and many have limited experience with online marketing and content production of any sort. One of the ways we’ve been able to justify raising rates while also helping our clients get better results has been by incorporating a lot of education into our onboarding processes.

Many clients come to us thinking all they need is the post production aspect of what we do. The problem is that without understanding how to capture great sounding audio at the source, conduct engaging interviews, structure their overall content plans, and introduce their listeners into a funnel, they’re not going to get the results they really want from the podcast. Expanding my initial services into this educational side of things was a big turning point early on that established me in many client’s eyes as a podcast expert rather than simply an audio editor.  

I also shifted from a per-episode billing model to a monthly “subscription” (of sorts) model. In the early days, I was charging as little as $30/ep, which often would take me 2+ hours to complete. Since I had a full-time job at the time and wasn’t chasing every single client however, I was fairly aggressive with my rate raises, upping my prices by $5/ep with every new client I got.

The monthly subscription helped keep my clients accountable to getting me and my team the materials we need to produce their shows on time, keeps them consistently putting out episodes which helps them grow their shows, and allows us to reliably predict our monthly revenues and expenses. But there were issues with how I initially set those monthly fees.

After switching to the package pricing 6-12 months into the business, I was making a better hourly rate, but I was still shooting in the dark when it came to how I had set my prices. I made rough calculations based on how long I figured the tasks included in the packages would take me, but had nothing to really back them up.

It wasn’t until 2 years in that I read a book called Profit First and really understood how I should be approaching pricing. To that point, I had a ton of overhead that I wasn’t accounting for when I was determining my pricing structure.

I had been in decent shape when it was just me, but as I started adding members to my team and outsourcing a lot of the work I had personally been doing, I realized that my current pricing was unsustainable as I transitioned from freelancer to agency.

I started tracking my expenses in much greater depth and basing all pricing by shooting for a minimum 40% profit margin over my costs - which included the costs associated with my own time spent working on any project. Setting prices this way rather than going with my gut has sped up the proposal process, reduced my own stress, and allows me to be confident that we’re profitable on every project we take on.

When it came to start up costs, there were almost zero. I already had the business registered and a website set up for my music production business which I then re-focussed on podcast clients. I owned all the software I needed, and did zero advertising, relying on free platforms like UpWork at the start and word of mouth as we grew.

I didn’t have an official launch for the business, initially applying for freelance job postings and doing cold outreach to potential clients, which grew into a referral-driven business.

For the first year I had almost zero online presence, just a simple one-page website outlining the brand story and the services I offered.

One of the things I had learned during my cold outreach and freelance marketplace application phase was that personality was *incredibly* important, and that clients would pay a premium to work with people they felt like they connected with on a personal level. So with that in mind, I injected as much personality into my website copy as possible, making jokes, and writing in a style that would appeal to the type of people that I actually wanted to work with.

For a while, I opened all cold outreach emails with something along the lines of:

*“Ok, so here’s the deal yo. My name is Jeremy and I guess you could say I’m a bit like a zombie, except instead of brains, I have an insatiable urge to devour audio and spit it out the other side all clean and spiffy! BTW audio is way tastier than brains, not that I know what brains taste like...”*

Our personality driven copy on our website as well as on all our marketing channels does a good job of pre-screening people, so that often before we even talk over a video call with a potential client, we’re both feeling really good about the prospect of working together.

A year into the business I began writing a weekly blog covering podcasting topics that I didn’t feel were getting covered elsewhere. Things like [how to improve your podcast by using the principles of storytelling](https://counterweightcreative.co/hollywood-teach-about-podcasting/) (specifically as they’re used in Star Wars of course. Yes, I’m a nerd…), [what Oprah can teach us about podcasting](https://counterweightcreative.co/oprah-podcasting-intent/) and [breaking down a client’s podcast launch plan](https://counterweightcreative.co/inside-successful-niche-podcast-launch/) were topics I covered among many others.  I also started a Facebook group, [Cut The Bullshit Podcasting](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cutthebullshitpodcasting/), which has grown into a thriving community of 1500 podcasters, and is often recognized as one of the top podcasting groups in terms of usefulness and the positive, supportive vibe of the community.

### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?

Since about the one year anniversary mark of the business, our client-base has grown almost entirely through referrals, of which we have a consistent stream. I attribute this to being picky about working only with clients who we *absolutely* *know* are a good fit for us, who know we’ll be able to get results for.  

Like most freelancers and business owners, when starting out, there had been clients who I had misgivings about from the start, but decided to work with anyways. While I never had a truly horrible client who refused to pay or tried to scam me in some other way, there were definitely clients that caused more headaches and frustration than they were worth. The problem with a subscription service like ours is that there’s no natural end to the project, and difficult clients could end up being thorns in our side indefinitely.

After working with a few of these types of clients I knew I needed to do a better job filtering problem clients out before beginning to work with them. I examined the clients who caused us the fewest problems and who were the most fun to work with and started noting the attributes that made the relationship work.

Generally we had similar approaches to business, believed in having fun with what we did, surrounding ourselves with positive people, and believed that the work we did mattered to the world. Our prices at this point filtered out most people who were just taking their first steps into the world of online business, but nevertheless I made a point of only working with people who had experience running online businesses, creating content, and had the systems and support team to be consistent with the production schedule. Maybe most importantly of all, our clients are clear on why they’re doing their podcasts, what makes their shows unique, and who their audiences are.

On top of working with clients who are a good fit, I’m a big believer in the value of providing a high personal touch. That involves regular hand-written notes, individualized gifts to commemorate milestones and a very generous referral program of a free month at their current production package for every referral who signs up and sticks with us for 3 months.

To encourage referrals, we share the details with all new clients during the onboarding phase and make sure to remind them about the program as part of our bi-annual customer satisfaction surveys.

One of the results of being extremely selective about the people we take on as clients is that often, the people in their networks are also a really good fit for us as well. We have some clients who’ve referred so many clients to us that we haven’t billed them in more than 6 months, saving them thousands of dollars over that time.

### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?

In the past 18 months we’ve grown from just me to a team of 13. In addition to myself, our team consists of six audio editors, four writers, and two admin people, all of whom are currently contractors scattered across Canada, The US, and The UK, who work remotely, although I’m guessing a couple of those may be converting into part-time positions within the coming year as we continue to expand both our client base and our team.

As with our clients, I’m incredibly picky with who joins the team. I’m a believer that skills can be taught, but culture fit can’t be, and as a result, my first concern when bringing anyone on is ensuring they’re a good fit for our team and our clients. Almost everyone on the team has been referred to me by existing team members or people in my network who are familiar with the work we do and our team’s culture.

I’m also a believer that my first responsibility is to my team, and then to our clients, and that a happy, cohesive team provides better results for our clients. I know a lot of similar agencies hire almost exclusively overseas as a way to reduce costs. While this is appealing financially, I’ve always had a gut feeling that in the long-run, there are intangible factors that come with building a cohesive team with a strong internal culture who are all based in the same geographic region as the bulk of our clients.

Financially, over the past year, we’ve tripled our revenue, and are looking to continue or exceed that rate of growth this year as we continue taking on new production and consulting clients.

Our profit margin is consistently between 30-40% across the services we offer, with an average customer value of $750/mo on an ongoing subscription basis.

The biggest focuses over the coming year are first and foremost to systematize the production side of things to a greater extent than they already are so I can remove myself from the day to day operations of production and work one-on-one as a consultant with high-level clients looking to start and grow podcasts.

Secondly, we’re looking to expand into digital products, packaging the knowledge and processes we use everyday with our clients to help beginner, indie, and hobby podcasters produce and grow their shows more efficiently and effectively.

We’re also really excited about The Podcast Power Pack, an annual bundle sale to help podcasters produce, promote, monetize and systematize their shows. The first Power Pack sale wrapped up in March and we’re looking forward to bringing together and offering a whole new suite of products for next year’s sale!  

### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?

I’ve always been a big believer in the importance of continual learning and education, and starting this business has definitely reinforced that belief. At the same time, there came a point - for me about a year ago - where I realized I needed to tone down my content intake and instead focus on executing what I already knew I needed to do.

One of the other big lessons or takeaways from starting my business has been that I have the ability and perhaps even responsibility to be a leader in other aspects of my life, including my general community. So many of the skills that are crucial to starting and growing a business can be used to help improve the lives of everyone around us. Often all it takes is to take the lead and get the ball rolling on some initiative and others will take it and run with it from there. I’m looking forward to stepping into this role more frequently and with more intention in the coming years.

When it comes to challenges, one of the things that has been difficult but necessary for me has been taking full responsibility for products or client services that fell short of expectations, either my own, or my customers and clients. While in many cases there may be extenuating circumstances, in almost every case where things have failed to meet expectations, I’ve been able to look back and point to areas where I could’ve personally done more to improve the outcome of the project.

One of the biggest mistakes I made was taking my foot off the gas and simply coasting after things had been going really well through the first 18 months of the business. There was a stretch of time where I lost a couple of clients and realized that I was not in nearly as comfortable a position financially as I thought I had been.

While this was a stressful few months, it was a necessary lesson and forced me to re-examine everything about my business and marketing, and led to a more diversified set of services, and a stronger focus on improving my lead pipeline.  

### What platform/tools do you use for your business?

The list of tools for the production agency side of things is fairly concise. We share files between our team as well as with our clients through Google Drive, communicate through Slack, and use Trello for project management, although we’re looking to move over to Teamwork in the near future for a better dashboard.

For online marketing we use ConvertKit and LeadPages regularly, and have our podcast community on Facebook. I’m also a big fan of Typeform for surveying clients, customers, our audience, team, and much more. I’m basically a survey nerd and would create them all day if I could...

### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?

I’m a big reader and podcast listener, so it’s hard to pick specifics, but I’ll give it a shot.

In terms of books, Profit First was a book that really changed the way I approached the finances and profit margins of the business, including how I was billing clients. Built To Sell was another book that, after reading, completely changed my mindset and approach to the way I was building my business and instilled a passion for systematizing everything that we do. Lastly, as a creative, both *Big Magic** *and *The War of Art* were really influential books for me in terms of understanding what it takes to be successful as a creative in business.

When it comes to podcasts, I’ve listened to hundreds of different shows over the past few years, but some of my favourites, include Smart Passive Income from Pat Flynn and Akimbo by Seth Godin. I’m someone who takes inspiration from a lot of places, and so while not specifically business related, I really enjoy 99% Invisible, Stuff You Should Know, and 
Revisionist History.

### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?

When it comes to getting started, I’m a big believer in moving slowly but intentionally. I waited to quit my day job until I was making just as much from my freelance podcast production work as I was from my paycheck. One of the most common mistakes I see is people quitting their stable jobs and going all-in on an idea that they’re excited about but is unproven.

Without the pressure of *needing* to earn a paycheck from your new venture you’re able to build things the right way from the start, be picky about your timing, pricing and clients, plus you’ve got a steady source of income which you can invest into your growing business.

I also think it’s important to know what you want from your business from the start. For me, I knew I didn’t want to be doing the actual production work forever, and so I made a point of documenting the various aspects of what I was doing from the beginning so that it was easier to begin shifting those tasks off of myself when the time came, and could be sure that they would be done well.

I’ve seen a lot of people work themselves into businesses that they don’t actually like, simply because they didn’t start with a clear vision of how their business would fit into the broader context of their lives, and how they would fit into their businesses.

### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?

We’re always looking to connect with audio editors who use Pro Tools and have worked on podcasts before, as well as writers for writing up show notes/blog posts for the shows to work as contractors.

We also may be looking for a dedicated Operations person in the near future. If you fall into one of these categories, we’d love to chat!

Personally, I was with Capital One for my last internship and had a great time working on the Platform Engineering team. However, I've never been remotely close to a consulting role and it seems very interesting and different.

Dear redditors,

I need some advice. This is my first post on reddit and I feel like this is a great place to ask advice.

I’m a 20 year old student from the Netherlands. I study Life Science (biomedical research) and I need to go on a 10 month internship/apprenticeship next year for my graduation. If I’m to stay in the Netherlands, it’ll start in november. But I’m thinking about going abroad for my internship which’ll mean it’ll start in februari.

I want to go far, either South Korea or Japan. I am really interested in those cultures and really want to learn the language and I though this would be a great oppertunity. I don’t come from a wealthy family and it’s a common thing to have a loan to pay for your studies. I have one as well and that would also mean I’d have to loan to be able to do my internship abroad.

At first I wanted to go to Japan but after thinking a bit more, South Korea seems more convenient. As far as I know, it's cheaper in comparison with Japan and the language is also easier to learn.

I have never been to either South Korea or Japan and barely/don’t speak the language (if this plan goes through I am planning on taking language and cultural classes before I go).

As I am not familiar with the countries I’d like your advise on the following:

1. Do you guys think I should do it, or not at all because I’ve never even stepped a foot inside those countries.
2. If the answer is yes, which country and why?
3. Do any of you know how well developed the science is in those countries. Is it known for it’s good science or does it lack in certain places.
4. Do you know any biomedical research labs/university’s?

I really hope you guys can help me out here with some advice!

Thank you!"
biv8cn,9,2019-04-29,HR Brother needs some advice after falling on tough times.,Hardboiledbutter,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/biv8cn/hr_brother_needs_some_advice_after_falling_on/,"Hello Everyone. First post here. Nice to meet all of you.

So about location. I am a Romanian who moved to **France**. I have not had an easy year. I need some advice. But first my story in brief:

I came to France at the end of 2017 to join my girlfriend who lives here (Toulouse). I spoke some french, but not a lot. I couldn't find a French job from Romania, but I was sure i could find something if i came here. I work in HR, BTW, I was an HRBP for an IT company (with 8 years of uninterrupted work under my belt) and thought there's no way I wont find something. I quit my job, i moved to Toulouse, and I start looking for work.After about two months i didn't find much.

During this time i have a really weird pain in my side. Just before the holly-days I go and have a check-up; turns out, cancer! Plot twist, i know, but don't get too sad, it all turned out OK. I am cured as we speak, but, needless to say, I didn't know that at the time. So obviously my job hunt takes a VERY back seat. For the next 2-3 months i go through check-ups, visit different doctors, and generally have new panic attacks every other day. In the end the cure was quite simple. I was an extremely lucky guy and all I needed was one kidney taken out.

No chemo, no complications, no nothing. Of course, again, I did not know that at the time. Waiting for pathology results, regular check-ups, recovering from surgery, etc. Next 4 month after the surgery, (we are somewhere in April-May 2018 now) and I am just beginning to realize I am probably going to be able to live my life cancer-free from now on. PROBABLY. But I'm still pretty shaken up but also kinda euphoric. MY GF is exhausted, I am in a state that I can only describe as extremely confused.

During all this time, I was unemployed, and this began to sink in. I start looking for work, but it's already been \~6 months of being unemployed and apparently my French is not that good. I take a 3 month french class, I realize Toulouse is not a great city to find work in, and on top of that HR in France is an alien beast. I am still taking regular scans to make sure my cancer in gone, so my mind is not quite where it should be yet. After the french class I take an internship in my GF's company for about 1 month. Everyone there likes me and all tell me to use the company as experience, and even stretch out my internship there for longer. They give me great recommendation letters, recommend me to everyone who calls for references, but no HR job there for me as it is already taken (small company, \~50 ppl)

We are in autumn and my lack of employment starts to sink inn. I am not getting any offers, and I'm going from one stress (illness) to another (unemployment). I'm having some panic attacks. My GF suggests I take a brake and reset. I do so. I take a trip to Romania and celebrate my new lease on life.  Good times with friends, they all encourage me and I get a much needed emotional boost. Mid autumn and I start my search again. Toulouse has nothing for me. With winter approaching, I decide to expand my search to London. But with the holidays coming, I only manage to plan a trip there in Jan. 2019. This turns out to not be such a great move as I cannot quite come up with a good explanation why someone from Romania who just moved to Toulouse wants to move to London. Recruiters in LDN  are VERY enthusiastic about my profile and my language skills, but nothing concrete happens. Winter is gone and it is Spring.   


After a visit to London, I realize I can now speak SOME decent French (TV, radio, conversions+classes), and my chances are best in Paris (huge labor market), where I can use my French and my English and some connections I made while staying here, and my story is more coherent. I start getting interviews, and I am now talking to some companies. I have a friend who lives there, and I can stay there for a while so I can go to meetings, etc. It looks promising, BUT:

I have been unemployed for 1 Year a half. To me it seems like yesterday coming to FR, but reality is different. I have NEVER been unemployed since I finished my studies and definitely not for 1Y and a half!!!! My question is:

How do I explain this? Do I mention the cancer? I mean it played a role but it wasn't only that. I was also  in a strange state of mind, I didn't speak French very well, I made some bad decisions (more than I have time to recount here), there were many things. So do I mention the cancer, or just leave it out as it kinda just complicates the story. People get confused (it is a very confusing story), and maybe think i'm using it a s a cop-out.  How do i present myself after all this? I also lost a lot of confidence, how do I avoid turning my explanation into a pity party? What would you advise me?

Also, any general advice for a foreigner looking for work in France?

Thank you for reading my boring ass story and for your advice. Peace, yo!"

biwylz,149,2019-04-29,Why is learning programming the de facto advice in this sub?,WhereIsLifeTakingMe2,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/biwylz/why_is_learning_programming_the_de_facto_advice/,"Hi everyone! I am curious about the ground reality of people saying ""learn coding"" to get a job.

In this sub whenever I see a post that is made by a teenager struggling to find a job, be it people who already graduated, seniors in college or even freaking 12th grade students who couldn't get into prestigious colleges, people always seem to suggest them to try their hands on programming.

I feel this advice is misguided for anyone except college seniors. Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum. Seniors from other majors can pick up on this quickly as most of them have had an introductory class on computer science in their freshman year and have batchmates who are computer science majors. I have seen many non computer science majors being placed in reputed companies by ""learning coding"" in their senior year.

But when we talk about the ones who have already graduated, it becomes tremendously hard to gather resources and devote time to go through those courses. Even if someone does do that, I can't seem to understand on why a recruiter might trust you on your skills. Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company. I think unpaid internships would be a starter for this section of job seekers. But it would be a long term payout to get a paid job and I think one can definitely do a better job to get immediate returns rather than focusing on programming.

Finally, what made me write this post today is people suggesting it to someone who couldn't score well in JEE MAINS. Most probably the OP for that post hasn't had any prior introduction to programming. Doesn't this tantamount to society's misguided opinion of engineering/medical being the only path to success. Heck, we narrowed it down to programming on this sub. I do realise it is just a suggestion, but I feel this restricts him from exploring his own interests. Not scoring well in entrance exams could be a red herring that he is on the wrong path. Maybe that is what needs amends.

I would love to stand corrected on my views. Please share your opinions on why we collectively do so.

Thanks!"
bix1jz,8,2019-04-29,Is joining the NSA worth it?,csquestion88,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bix1jz/is_joining_the_nsa_worth_it/,"I am a high school senior planning to major in cs and I have applied to a program called the NSA Stokes Educational Scholarship Program. The program is very selective and I probably won't even get in but I am curious about this.

The program requires you to attend a 4-year college while studying cs, comp e, or ee. They pay up to $30k per year for tuition plus a $20k stipend per year plus a guaranteed summer internship at the NSA each year. At the end of your time in college, you must work at the NSA 1 1/2 times however many years it took you to graduate (so if it took 4 years to graduate, you'd need to work there for 6 years).

What I'm worried about are the 6+ years I'd be spending at the NSA. I feel like that is a really long time to work at a single place, especially straight out of college. Also, I'm pretty certain I'd be making a lot less than what I would in a regular software job. The idea of graduating debt free and getting paid while in school sounds awesome, but spending that much time at a government job scares me.

I have never failed a class and am completely on my own with my finances. My mother makes around 40k a year and can't help me. My father is not involved and is unemployed anyway. To this date, Penn State has given me a total of $1,200 in financial aid. At this rate, I am to graduate in May 2020 with around 120k in debt as a first generation college student.

&amp;#x200B;

My first 2 years were at Penn State Behrend in computer science, where I also received little government aid, and realized I hated physics and math. I absolutely love programming and design, so I came to University Park and switched into IST once I discovered the major online from Behrend. I have visited financial aid 3-5 times a semester since coming to Penn State, with each visit ending with them only telling me what other loans I am eligible for.

&amp;#x200B;

I have become extremely fed up and don't understand what I am doing wrong. I have a current GPA of 3.01 (I completely focus on programming and not all the other stuff as much), but I am very involved. I am the VP of a renowned club on campus with fantastic alumni connections (which I have built and brought back to the university). I am involved in 3 other organizations consistently as well, who all better the PSU community at UP. I was not very involved at Behrend because I was still finding my passion, which came to be leading and programming, but I was in just as much need as I am now. I have participated in HackPSU and won 1st place solidifying my industry knowledge to myself. I have built websites, iOS applications and kept A's in all of my programming classes. I have hosted multiple technical workshops on campus for free, with hundreds of students sometimes attending and finding a new passion. I recently scored a full time job for when I graduate next year (software engineer at 80k starting) so I have certainly proved myself. I have friends who's parents pay for half/all of their tuition, and even with having net incomes of 100-140k a year, they receive $5k-$10k scholarships each year and have even LOWER GPA's THAN ME AND ARE NOT INVOLVED AT ALL. Yet, when it came to the budgeting of this summer, where I am going abroad through PSU to Shanghai for an internship, Penn State was once again able to give me nothing. I applied for every scholarship there was to apply for that could work for this summer, and I received $0. I am taking Mandarin classes and an internship abroad through the university's abroad program; they offered me to apply for a $500 scholarship right off the bat, which I received $0 from and was denied any aid at all. I was also denied any of the Gilman Scholarship and the Critical Language Need Award, even though I am becoming fluent in Mandarin and am at level 2 this semester. This summer is going to cost me around $12,000, and Penn State couldn't give me a dollar.

&amp;#x200B;

All I am trying to prove here is I am certainly an in-need college student, who receives the Federal Pell Grant each year, who is greatly involved on campus and benefits the community of Penn State, and who has been thrown on the back burner in Penn State's eyes. I honestly just need to know why."

I'm sure I can just apply to bunch of places online, but the problem I'm having is that as I am a student I'm very short on cash so I'll need stuff like housing and transportation covered by the company. I understand to be sponsored for an undergraduate internship overseas is probably very unlikely, but I ask here in hopes of some good news.

This is a temporary position that lasts for 2 more months, but i felt like this was beyond perfect for me right now. I love working there, i love the flexibility and bit of freedom I will have when I graduate. I felt like i'd have a little bit of time after this extremely stressful year and final weeks to not have to jump right into a brand new full time job. I honestly dont feel like I have the energy or drive to even interview or do anything for one right now, which is okay because i'd have a some time. Well, my boss took it upon herself to reach out to an owner of a company she knows in the field i ""work"" in (my area of study/what i would like to pursue) about a job opportunity (a ""permanent"" one, since this current one is temporary) that he may have for me. He said yes and he would like to do a phone interveiw. I feel so bad about how I feel about this, but I can't change how i feel; i don't want this opportunity *right now*. I feel like that's maybe sounds entitled or something for me to say, but 1:I'm not ready to start working full time, at a place that is a *very long drive* away and has *very, very long work hours*. I feel like if i was offered this a month or so down the line i would be ecstatic. But the fact i might have to start soon (assuming i am offered this job, which based on other info and such is actually very likely)  makes me feel sick. My other issue is that I can't just say no or somethig, my boss would be super offended and it maybe could strain the relationship our compmay has with this other company. It also would just look dumb on my part. Everyone i've mentioned this to basically told me i'm stupid for not throwing myself at the first opportuinity that presents itself, yet i still feel the way that i do about it. I don't want to do this job *now*. I know it may sound weird for a new college grad to want to pick and choose when to want opportunity to present itself or whatever. If anything i'd want to complete my temporary job (where i learn A LOT and I love working at, this is where i have been the happiest) for the rest of the full 2 month duration and then i'd idealy like to begin to embark on this new opportunity. I don't know if thats even something you can request to do or if that sounds crazy. All i know is i desperately need a break, and I also dont have time to go drive to this far location for an interveiw during finals week and worry about an interveiw and all of that. I just can't do it, i don't have the mental capacity, energy, or interest in doing so right now. And i feel terrible about it. If anyone has any advice for me i'd really appreciate it. Thank you"

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if these questions have already been asked a ton of times, but in your opinion what are the typical schedules and pay rates that people in entry level IT positions are given?

&amp;#x200B;

In particular, I was wondering about the average schedules and pay rates for 1) Helpdesk Technician Interns 2) Level 1 Helpdesk Positions 3)  Level 2 Helpdesk Positions 4) Level 3 Helpdesk Positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks."
bizdwd,3,2019-04-30,MathComp enrollment for CS classes,asian_flappybird,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/bizdwd/mathcomp_enrollment_for_cs_classes/,"Hi all Bruins,

I recently got accepted into Math of Computation at UCLA as a transfer. I have a few questions about the school and hoping to get a better view of life at UCLA:

1) I researched some of the professors who teach CS 180 and they are all got bad reviews. What is the definition of ""bad"" at UCLA? Was he/she not good at lecturing or that they give out unreasonably hard homework without any prereq ones?

2a) I also read on UCLA enrollment website and saw that the priority of first pass is given according to the units one has completed. And that first pass only allows students to register up to 6 units. However, all of my friends say that classes with decent professor filled up really quickly and, hence, the person who has lower priority will have to enroll in ""bad"" professor and doesn't enjoy the course. Is that true?

2b) Another question on the same topic: Is the first pass given out according to the number of units taken or also the major that one is in?

3) students from top tier schools who studies impacted major (right now CS) often claim that life for them is mostly academic and hardly social. They don't have many friends and much connections. However, IMO it is crucial to remand a social life and enjoy the process of studying. Hence, I want to know more about life in UCLA as a Math Comp major, as I don't want to constantly working, having a fixed schedule, etc.

4) I would be grateful if you guys can share your experience of seeking internships in tech industry at UCLA (especially the ones who in my major, but the more the merrier right? :P )

Thank you all and Go Bruins!"

bj01vp,12,2019-04-30,I graduated last June and completed an internship. I've been unemployed since and am stuck in a rut. I need advice.,Sperino,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bj01vp/i_graduated_last_june_and_completed_an_internship/,"A little background, I graduated last June with a BS in Business Information systems and had a 6-month post-graduation internship lined up with a fairly large company, which I finished in December. The internship was pretty high-level, most of what I did was busy work and I didn't learn as much as I hoped. 

Since then I've been on the job hunt with very little success. Over the last 5 months, I've submitted around 200 applications to entry-level positions and I've only had a handful of callbacks and 1 actual interview. I've gone through many different resumes and cover letters, nothing seems to be working. The biggest critique I'm hearing back from companies is a 'lack of experience'. I've almost lost all my motivation for the job search. I'm sort of at a loss for what to do, at this point I'm just looking through online job boards debating whether or not I'm qualified enough to apply for anything. What advice do you have for a disgruntled job seeker? What can I do get out of this rut and get my motivation back? What can I do to make my job search more successful?"
bj07at,7,2019-04-30,I've been biking to a bridge every night for over a week with a pocket full of pills.,bridge_sleepwalker,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bj07at/ive_been_biking_to_a_bridge_every_night_for_over/,"I'm a 15 year old guy, before all this shit started to happen I was working really hard and being future orientated to end the cycle of poverty in my family. I know how much it hurts to have constant financial stress and to not always know where your next meal will come from. I live that, so I wanted to get into politics so that I could protect institutions that help people in similar situations to myself. I've been taking on internships and positions in political campaigns making me super busy. Even though I worked hard I did have some joy through my girlfriend (Iz) (16F), I love her and she loved me, I was really happy about my future.

Despite our age, I feel like our relationship was pretty serious, we both got eachother out of really bad places. Around 7 months ago I was being pressured into doing drugs by some friends and that same time she had problems with anorexia and self harm stemming from family issues. We weren't super close but we had some mutual friends and nobody else was online one night that she cut herself too deep so she called me for help, I helped her and then we started a conversation that lasted all of thanksgiving break and started the process of helping eachother and eventually falling for eachother, I got out of friendships with toxic people and she credited our relationship as the cause of 6 months without relapse, her longest ever. 

We had a lot of fun together, even though our emotional relationship started from a serious place we were already pretty good friends beforehand, we had the same sense of humor and just enjoyed eachother. We would have pillow fights, play with her siblings, talk for hours, we cried together and we made eachother feel whole. This relationship was the important part of both of our lives.

In January we decided to audition for a community musical together and got in. It was a huge commitment (after school until 7 every night) on top of everything I was already doing, but I thought I could handle it. We were both in minor ensemble and tried to spend as much time with eachother backstage, but it was hard.

Late January was the first time people started spreading rumors about us. People would say that we got caught having sex on campus or that we were cousins, dumb stuff like that, but some people actually believed it. We also didn't know who was starting these rumors. We didn't care much though, but it definitely put some stress on our relationship. 

Rumors continued until late February, when I did some digging and found out it was Iz's best friend (R) starting the rumors. They talked and her best friend was having serious mental issues so we forgave her blaming it on that. R was actively trying to Iz against me for one reason or another. I reluctantly forgave her though because I knew how much R meant to Iz. 

In March my brother accused my dad of abuse, it's a false accusation but my mom believes him and now both of them are flinging shit at eachother and digging up affairs and suicides attempts of eachother from the past to try and further their cases (My parents are 5 years divorced). They also have been resenting me because I'm not 100% on either of their sides.

I was doing okay though because my girlfriend was really supportive.

Mid March I started to notice Iz being less passionate and pushing me away when I needed support. I blamed it on the stress from the musical which was soon to be released. 

On April 1st Iz broke up with me, even though she had been a bit distant for about a week this was out of nowhere. I asked her why but she didn't give me a good answer. I felt like shit. I missed school didn't show up to internships I lost the only person in my life that I was still close to. I had lost my family and my friends had drifted away. I spent 2 days basically crying and for the first time in my life thinking about suicide.

After 2 full days Iz texted me saying she made a mistake. I snuck out and talked to her for hours about it. She told me that she thought she was getting to close and would never be able to lose me if we kept it going and she was scared of that. I loved her and took her back. We had a really great week and an awesome opening night for the musical. Our 6 month anniversary was coming up and I made some covers of songs that had meaning in our relationship with my accordion and recorded it onto a cassette. (I made her a cassette mixtape every month after I gave her a walkman for christmas, but this was the first one with original music). The play was almost over and I was really hopeful for our future.

She broke up with me again April 15th, she put a note in my backpack saying that our relationship was unhealthy and it needed to end. No other reason or explaination, she blocked me so I couldn't ask her. I didn't know what I did wrong or why this was happening. I had my friend over every night because I didn't trust myself to not kill myself but I could tell he was overburdened. 

I was able to make contact with Iz with another account that Saturday and asked her why. She didn't give a good answer so I asked her if there was someone else. She said yes, she had fallen in love with R (I knew she was Bi, I am too). The same R that had been spreading rumors about us and turning Iz against me. They were going to start a relationship. 

My friend was with me so I didn't try anything but as soon as he left the next night I stole my dad's sleeping pills and biked as far away from my house as I could. I took a handful and jumped off a pretty high bridge, I wasn't sure if it'd kill me but I thought I'd drown. I didn't die and I don't know how but I woke up on the shore feeling hypothermic and sick to my stomach. It was bright so I grabbed my bike from a bush and walked home. 

Nobody noticed I was gone, I wrapped myself in covers and slept all day. At night I left again, grabbed some more pills and walked to the bridge but didn't jump, I wasn't sure if she might take me back so I decided to live for that possibility. I biked home and put the pills back. 

Every night since I've found reason to grab the pills and bike to the bridge, and every night I don't jump. 

I'm going to see Iz at school tommorow, I shared 3 classes with her and R is in 2 of them. I don't care about any of the politics or anything anymore, I just want the love back. They are probably already dating, if I see them together I'm not sure I'll have reason to go home. I don't care if I have to die because it hurts too much to be thrown away by the person you trust the most in the world for someone else. I have a link to this post written on a note in my bed. They'll see this if I kill myself tomorrow night. If you see this Iz, I love you and always will. Even though what you did was fucked up I don't care, we've been through so much. I still love you."

Hey Everyone!

I really need some advices on choosing universitiy.

I'm  22 years old who finished a community college 2 years ago and now I'm  trying to get a Bachelor's Degree for my future.  I'm majoring in  International Relations but I'd like to switch my program to Computer  Science (Or Double major if it doesn't take too long)

I  already got acceptance letter from two most wanted schools- University  of Calgary(in Canada) and Eastern Illinois University(in US).

The reason why I choose those universities was mostly based on my financial situations.

Since I'm an international student, it was really hard to find below 20k tuition per year.

Anyways!

Now I have to choose the university from two of them.

* University of Calgary

pros:  Highly ranked(vs. Eastern Illinois), 3 years work permit after  graudation, more internships opportunities. my parents will moved to  Calgary soon.

cons: 15k per year. No Scholarships(yet), need to take one more semester at least.

* Eastern Illinois University

pros: 6k per year with scholarships(6k). Small classroom.

cons: small town. small university. hard to find a job with student visa.

I definitely want to do some internships related to Computer Science!

Does scholarships do matter when I looking for a job in IT?

How do you think guys?

I'll appreciate your every advices!"
bj2cyn,1,2019-04-30,Advice request - negotiating with Seattle and Bay Area offers,PurpleCurve,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bj2cyn/advice_request_negotiating_with_seattle_and_bay/,"I'm in the final stages of interviews as a new grad, am starting to get offers, and would appreciate any negotiation tips to make the most of my situation. Here's what I'm looking at, both for SRE-type roles:

&amp;#x200B;

Company A: midsize publicly traded firm in Seattle area

\- $119k base, $64k RSUs w/ 4-year vesting schedule, $10k signing bonus

\- offers employee stock purchase program: can use 15% of income to buy company stock at 15% discount

&amp;#x200B;

Company B: late-stage SV unicorn, likely to IPO within next 2-4 years, returning intern offer

\- $132k base, $190k RSUs w/ 4-year vesting schedule, $10k signing bonus

&amp;#x200B;

Benefits at both companies are virtually identical (tl;dr everything is covered, no 401k matching). Both companies ""clicked"" with me and seem like great places to join. Company B would get the edge in my mind if they can raise their offer to provide the same quality-of-life in the Bay Area as Company A would in Seattle.

I expect to receive 2-4 more offers in the coming days which may change the calculus but for now, doing the math on salary alone with these shows the Seattle offer being equivalent to \~$153k in the Bay Area after accounting for cost-of-living and income tax differences.

&amp;#x200B;

The questions on my mind:

1. How reasonable is it to ask Company B to bump their salary \~$20-30k to match my post-tax and post-CoL take-home at Company A?
2. How close to ""topped out"" are these offers in their respective markets?
3. Is it okay to start negotiating these offers now or should I wait until all the others are in?

I’m an EE student in my second year right now.  Just finished an internship in Embedded systems (mostly working on Embedded Linux and IoT devices) and I really think I’m going to be focusing on embedded systems for the rest of my university (and for a career)!

I’d like to pick classes that will help me acquire good knowledge in order to make me a desirable candidate for some junior embedded systems designer jobs once I finish school.

My main interests are embedded linux, computer systems and architecture, and computer hardware.  At school, I like the microcontroller coding classes and I really enjoy the FPGA/VHDL classes.  I also have a strong background in hardware, PCB design, and telecommunication protocols.

Any suggestions on classes to look out for?"

Still, I can't find the motivation or will to work. I struggle to get out of bed.

I’m going to probably end HS with around a 4.1 weighted GPA (we don’t do unweighted) and a total of 6 APS. My SAT’s on the lower end (1270) but I plan on taking the ACT and getting a higher score (aiming for 32-34).  I really slacked on my SAT/ACT and didn’t study at all so I’m hoping/assuming the score goes up when I actually prep

Some schools that I’m looking to transfer into are: NYU Tandon (rejected this year), Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, as a reach I’d wanna go for Columbia but that’s very out there.  And as for the rest, I’m kinda stuck ):

I wanna major in integrated digital media and computer science and I was wondering what some good schools would be for me to transfer into considering my (potential) stats. I’d like to attend a T50 school if it’s possible for me and I’d like to start at my transfer school during my sophomore year(so apply as a freshman). I’m looking to be closer to a larger city so that I can do a lot of networking. 

 What schools should I look into? And what things should I do when I start at  mason to optimize the possibility of transferring into a T50? I’m gonna aim to maintain no less than a 3.7 gpa in college and hope to get an internship the next summer.

As far as my current resume, my ec’s look like this:

-Speech and Debate (Several state and regional awards and national competitor)
-Theatre (Historian and Vice President)
-Kode with Klossy (Scholar and an Instructor Assistant this year)
-I currently do website listings and light UX design for the company I work for right now (its a business start up)
-I studied abroad in Spain my sophomore year (credits from Tulane)
-I served on board for the American Nepal Soceity  and was heavily involved in organizing international night at my school

I’m just looking for guidance on this cause everyone else I’ve been told to talk to hasn’t helped. Thank you 🥺"

How to calculate?,ynot269,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bj488c/started_applying_for_other_companies_and_getting/,"So not necessarily asking my current salary, but I've made the mistake of giving them this information. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm nearly a year out of school and 10 months into my first full time job, I have nearly 2 years of worth of internship experience under my belt on top of that, but something I haven't quite figured out is the recruiter game. Specifically when it comes to salary, I've tried using COL calculators but (no humble brag intended) I make decent living in a relatively low-medium COL area, so any time I try to scale it seems outrageous and I'm not quite sure if it's fine for me to ask (for example) 140k in Boston. COL calculators seem to indicate that 140K in Boston is what I'd need to maintain my standard of living (based on COL here + current salary). 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe It's because I haven't applied to a job in awhile so I'm less familiar, but 140k for \~1yr experience out of school seems wild to me no? 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is what are you considering when you figure out your salary requirements?

&amp;#x200B;

I know if they don't offer 401k matching I should try to get something extra in my salary to compensate for that (since my current company does 401k match), but what else do you consider besides COL?

&amp;#x200B;

I only have 1 reference point so far, but as I apply to more jobs I'd like to have an idea of what I should be considering.

&amp;#x200B;

I know the main reason that COL is so much higher is rent, rent in Boston is 3x rent in my area."

How do I change to a development career?  


So the story goes like this, I was a bright young nerd who just wanted to write some code and get paid for it, and I'm pretty good at coding, the guy in the class who gets asked for help. I did a couple of internships where I sat in a room by myself and worked in a silo without anyone to ask for help (long story), but at least I got to code. Then for my longer 8 month internship I did an SRE internship as part of my degree. I was with an amazing company in Dublin, really loved it, learned some cool stuff, but it was mostly Ops and syseng (still good work).  


Then I decided to go get a real job, having finished college, and got offered a position as a ""Software Engineer"" in a big American megacorp on crazy money (I mean more money than anyone in my family has ever made). It was pitched to me as largely a development role writing Golang, with a little bit of Ops (all writing automation I was told).  


Fast forward 8 months and I haven't written any code. My team doesn't code, we provide technical support for prometheus, splunk and some other stuff. I spend most of my time working with horrible technology and doing dumb ops work that makes me want to burn the place down and live off the land. Now recruiters are emailing me daily with big numbers (crazy big numbers) for devops positions, but I want to get as far away from this hellshit as possible. Problem is that now my entire career has been Ops. I'm not eligible for grad positions, and I'm underqualified for even junior positions.  


Can anyone advise me on how to word my CV to show that I've been working, but want to apply for more junior positions in a different area?  


At this stage I'm honestly willing to take 10 steps back and do another internship, once I'm doing some development, but I think most companies are suspicious that there's something wrong with me, or that I just wasn't able to get a dev job in the first place."

Large public school; high Hispanic demographic and pretty bad test scores as a result (significant percentage of elementary school bottom 5 percentile for state) *EDIT*: What I meant was a significant portion of kindergarteners do not speak any English at all and as a result, standardized testing is abysmal. A handful of Harvard acceptances over the years, one recruited Princeton athlete, one recruited Stanford athlete, about 3 Cornell acceptances a year.

**Stats**

99.5 GPA weighted, 96.1 unweighted (no maximum GPA; honors weighted 1.05 and AP 1.1)

Ranked 16/575

My GPA- based stats are an interesting case. I was very unmotivated 8th grade (took highschool courses and received poor grades) and freshman year, so I'm not where I'd like to be. That being said, past two years I have had either the highest GPA of my class or the at least top third highest (8th grade-92, 9th grade-99, 10th grade-103.5, 11th grade-106.5 (pretty much unweighted 99.8))

I expect to graduate with a 102 weighted GPA and probably ranked 8/9th.

1560 SAT (770 eng/790 math)

First SAT was a 1510 if it matters; current score was second attempt and school record

760 World History

650 Chemistry (taken unprepared after Honors chem, didn't realize Honors did not cover 5 topics; will either retake or not send)

Planned: Bio and Math 2 (will most likely be doing well and sending these, I'm pretty good at standardized testing)

**Classes**

(h=honors)

8th Grade (GPA: 92): Algebra, Earth Science, Spanish, Studio Art (all highschool classes);

9th Grade (GPA: 99): English H, Geometry H, Global History H, Living Environment H, Spanish, Law and Legal System, Web-Design/Java, Sports Marketing,

10th Grade (GPA: 104): Algebra 2 H, AP Comp Sci A, AP Seminar, AP World History, Chemistry H, English H, Spanish,

11th Grade (GPA: 107): Advanced Data Structures (Comp Sci), AP Bio, AP Stats; Precalc H, AP Lang, AP Research, AP USH, Corporate Class;

12 Grade: AP Physics, AP Chem, AP Lit, AP Gov, AP Calc BC, AP Comp Sci, Health;

Most rigorous courseload except for science sophomore year (""promising"" students in middle school were placed into Honors Chem freshmen year and AP Chem soph year; I was placed into Living Environment Honors freshmen year and Honors Chem soph year)

To be quite frank aside from that one class, I have taken on the most challenging courseload possible and will be making up for it senior by doubling up AP Physics and AP Chem. I doubt course rigor is an issue.

AP Scores- Global (5), AP Seminar (4), AP Computer Science A (4) (no one passes this and I was one like one of 5 people to do so last year)

To be taken this year + predicted scores- AP USH (5), AP Bio (4/5), AP Stats (5), AP Lang (hard to predict, 4), AP Research (hard to predict, 3/4)

Next year: Calc BC, Physics, Chem, Lit, Gov, Comp Sci Principles

**ECs**

Robotics: Secondary software leader (not main code, I do like lights + vision); Outreach (""chairmans"") Leader + Team Presenter (host STEMinars for Girls, volunteer at coding clubs at middle school, host international teams); awards detailed below;

Model United Nations: basic MUN stuff, I chair so I suppose that's leadership;

Academic Team: JV Captain; next year Varsity Captain, we're trash but it's fun;

Science Olympiads: Team started this year; founding member; at our first comp was one of two partnerships to medal. No leadership this year; may be president next year. This year's vice president is running for president, but it's based on vote and I have nerd clout with underclassmen due to being friendly with them through other ""nerdy"" EC's, the random clout I got for SAT, and my boyfriends popularity with freshmen boys for some reason. I also have my medal; honestly I could maybe get president;

Corporate Club/Class: Club that's also a class grade for some reason; honestly I hate it but I like the opportunities; host multiple events with local small businesses; shadowed at local hospital and won $3000 award in resulting competition (I wasn't an original team presenter because I kinda try to minimize my interaction with the club as much as possible, but on the day of the presentation no one really knew what they were doing so I learned the presentation + stepped in +  am credited with saving the saving the team and securing the bag; honestly not trying to flex but I'm considered integral to team's success); will be getting neurology internship through club;

PTSA: School's PTA but with students involved; community service;

Honors Societies;

Will possibly be teaching local girl scouts about computer science (details in awards section);

Rowing: Most of my extracurriculars end in spring so I joined a rowing club; major time commitment (1 hour away and 2.5 hour practice); since I'm older + just started I am not really competitive for recruitment (that being said, same team is very competitive and had a girl my height join the same time last year and end up getting recruited so who knows); may do over summer;

**Awards:**

NCWIT Rising Star: in recognition of being female and active with computer science; pretty low-level but allows for me to run program with local organizations teaching younger girls compsci; will probably teach local girl scout troop;

(don't know if team awards count but I was very involved with this) Regional FIRST Robotics Engineering Inspiration + Chairmans Award: Both in recognition of community outreach/STEM initiatives; team lead on this + Chairmans is most prestigious robotics award;

9th in Regional Science Olympiads for Anatomy and Physiology: I know this isn't that impressive but it was our team's first year;

**Summer:**

Freshmen: One of two students selected for camp under federal judge to learn about legal system;

Sophomore: Community College class;

Junior Year: TBD.

I'm waiting to hear back from a national lab research opportunity. My school has a good history with placement +  I know comparable students who have gotten in; I have a very solid chance. However, it's not known to be outrageously prestigious and I honestly don't know if I want to do it if I get in.

My rowing team also has 5 hour practices every day. I really like the team + sport, plus the coach has indicated if I really put in the work over the summer, I could maybe get some college prospects. I will probably go with rowing, not even because of college but because I really enjoy it.

**Written**

LORs:

Humanities:

 I am the first student my APUSH teacher has ever had to maintain a 100 average year round. We joke a lot, and I am acknowledged as a class leader;

Science:

TBD. I have had my Bio teacher for 3 years for various classes (Seminar, Research, and Bio), and have done well. However, I am not particularly exceptional. My Honors Chem teacher will most likely be my AP Chem teacher, and he really likes me (and my boyfriend was one of his favorite students and he's really happy we're dating which is really weird but \*shrug\*), but he's also a school favorite/ may be swamped/ I may not have him for AP Chem  


**Looking at / for**

I will probably ED to Cornell.

My second choice would be Dartmouth. 

I will likely be applying to several t20's.

However, I am also looking for safeties.

I greatly prefer rural areas; I really love Northern Forests, the Pacific NorthWest and the Colorado region. Any school with a focus on the outdoors is really appealing to me. I really like UC Boulder, and am definitely looking for similar school's!

I will definitely be applying to my state schools. My counselor has nominated me for RPI's ""The Medal"" (apparently meant for most promising math/science student in each class), however, I know RPI is having some issues currently. 

**Misc**

The class above mine's admission season was really... weird. It was the strongest class the school's ever had (the top five students all had a higher GPA than the past several valedictorians, many had national awards, national merit, regional leadership positions, prestigious summer programs, a TON of research, basically CC's wet dream), but surprisingly, most did NOT do well. A couple dark horses got Cornell ( no hooks; 2 while males +1 Asian).

I'm a very similar applicant to those who got into Cornell, however, many other similar and better students got rejected. Only one applied ED, however, and he got in.

Not to be overconfident but I'm pretty well situated compared to my peers.

Am looking to be psychiatrist so probably either a Bio or Psych major (leaning towards Bio).

I'll start with the romantic part of this. I've had a bit of a troubled dating life pretty much always. I've dated people who were mentally unstable, manipulative, physically abusive and all the previous at once. My last partner was the worst by far and this person made me pull back from my relationships I already had with my friends and family. Even though this was about three or four years ago, I've not mended all these relationships. When I got out if that relationship, I felt very alone and very unwelcome among my friends but my closest friends stayed with me. Now, I've met someone new and I feel like this person is absolutely fantastic. I feel valued, I feel listed to, I feel like my opinion matters and I feel safe. But that is the thing, in my last relationship I felt all of this by this time as well. Plus this is a tactic I'm familiar with and with my dating history, I can find the bad apples pretty well and not realize it until I'm standing penniless and alone outside my parents apartment asking if I can have a hug.   


And now to the friend part. I've felt for a long long time that meeting most of my friends is like a chore. Even though I enjoy being with them and doing thing with them when I meet them, I feel like I have to go see them and not that I WANT to see them. A few friends come to mind where I feel this even as I'm with them, I feel like they're draining my energy completely but I think they are so funny and are such great people. I have the same problem with a few of my other friends, they can be completely uninterested in what I say and do but still ask me if I want to hang out and I often do because I also feel like they are funny and are good people. Just tonight, they kept talking about something I have absolutely zero knowledge about and act like I'm not there. I had to ask when one of them went to the bathroom if we could talk about something where I could join the conversation and when we did, I felt like they didn't enjoy the conversation. Paranoia maybe? I have a bit of a history with that too...   


This is also a very stressful time for me. I'm trying to get internships, do well in school, maintain my relationships with my friends and my partner, work, have enough time to work on my hobbies and myself.   


This is what I'm asking. Has my newfound relationship with my partner changed my perspective on how I want and should be treated or are they, like before, trying to pull me away from my friends? Anyone who has thoughts, kind words or hopefully experience and/or advice, please help me with what I should do. I'm stumped."

They sound pretty legit as you don’t have to pay until you get the job (for internships, don’t pay unless the salary is $20k+ over 12 weeks). Anyone have any experience with them?"

I have the option of doing independent study where I will be able to focus on a specific certification/project.

Anyone have any certifications that they feel contributed toward their aptitude as a developer? Any books or courses you would recommend?

I understand that a certification is often meaningless for employers, but I need the credit hours and might as well make the most out of the learning opportunity."
