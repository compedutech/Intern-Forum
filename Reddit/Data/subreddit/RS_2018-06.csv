I am yet another late 20s white male who is struggling with finding a suitable career. Shocking, I know. I don't know how I live with being so unique. Right now I drive truck, local monday through friday with weekends off and making okay money. I make enough to cover bills and if I actually budget right, I can start paying off debt and I can take a vacation sometime before I retire(become homeless when I stop working at 75). The problem is that I am unchallenged and unfulfilled. It is boring, and I derive no satisfaction from my work.

Part of it was depression, but I've been getting that handled pretty well lately, and I'm trying to tackle this issue with a fresh perspective. Honestly, it's the biggest source of unhappiness and anxiety in my life.

I""m not sure what I should do with my life. I""ve thought about getting into IT, but honestly, the thought of fixing computers and wiring networks and so on and so forth sounds very boring. I know I want to quit trucking, the problem is I can't just quit and take something in a field that seems exciting due to circumstances. I am a single father of a 7-year-old boy, though I only get him on the weekends. The result is that I have a certain amount of money I have to make to pay child support and a certain schedule to keep.

I recently did a thought exercise that helps figure out what to do with your life. Think of yourself at the end of a long life, on your deathbed. What does a successful life look like? For me, it means becoming a successful author and making a living purely from my creative efforts. I'm also very interested in photography, and I've recently switched from gaming to taking pictures instead.

The problem with both of these paths is that they aren't stable, and they don't fit my limitations. Writing for a living is notoriously hard and statistically rare. Photography is possible, but a lot of that involves shooting weddings and taking jobs that pay a lot less and also working a lot of weekends. I'm very constrained by my need to make a certain amount of money and to keep my schedule.

I'd love to combine photography and writing and become a photojournalist. Traveling the world and taking photos and writing stories and shining a light on real problems and affecting change and writing run-on sentences sounds perfect. But I'd have to go back to school for that, and the only school around me that offers that degree is rather hard to get into, and I lack the time to both go to school, work and do the required internships. It seems that most of my interests are nixed by my circumstances. And yes, I know I can write on the side while I make money. I'm doing that, but that's not solving the issue of making money and being fulfilled at the same time.

I love science and technology, and I love learning about them. I can talk for hours about the possibilities of people traveling among the stars, or possibly extending our lives by hundreds of years. I love the big picture aspects of these things. I'm not so hot on the technical details. As much as I love and admire scientists, a scientist I am not.

Honestly, I'm at a loss here. Were my circumstances different, I would happily live with a roommate and take that low paying job as a photographers assistant and 2nd shooter. Or I'd gladly go back to school and study photojournalism. But I can't, no matter how much I want to. My son is my number one priority, and raising him and spending as much time as possible with him is my main focus. But I'm also trying to find some happy balance of self actualization and economic security too. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. Hell, just talking about it is better than simply holding it all in. And if one of you solves my problem and gives me the eureka answer, I'll even buy you lunch.

If you've made it this far, congratulations. Your attention span is longer than mine, and I applaud you. Thank you."

I'm 22 years old and a year deep into co\-founding a tech startup and just about finishing up school. This summer my co\-founders and I have an office space and decided to pay ourselves to cover rent \+ food. This way we can stay 100&amp;#37; focused on the company since we are in a bit of a time crunch before our next sales cycle.

I want to work longer productive hours. Previously, the tech co\-founder and I worked a full time internship alongside our startup and we could hit 90 hour weeks easy. But when it was time to work on our startup, we were already depleted and tired. This resulted in a bunch of shit code that ended up breaking frequently and was nearly impossible to maintain.

Now we work 8 hours a day 7 days per week grinding out code at 80\-90&amp;#37; productivity. More recently we have come across some issues that have taken us 50\+ hours and several thousand lines of code to solve. By the end of the day my brain is gassed and I start making extremely basic mistakes. I know I won't make any meaningful progress after that point and might even dig myself deeper in bugs, so I call it a day. I want to extend my productivity so we can get more work done each day and roll through our development plan faster. It's a game of attrition after all.

I want to bump up my 50\-60 hour workweek to 70\-80 hours while retaining my productivity, no point in working 100 hours a week if you're unhealthy, sleep deprived, and working at 50&amp;#37; mental capacity. 

I am doing the following already:

Nicotine

Caffeine \(2\-3 cups coffee a day\)

Creatine \(Read up on mental energy benefits of creatine\)

Exercising 

Eating well

Sleeping 7\-8 hours

We try to stay away from harder stims \(adderall\) unless we know something has to be handled right fucking now.

Have any of you had long workweeks? How have you guys handled it?"

I have experience from internships, they took my plan that i had to mock up before the interview and gave it to the band that I made it for. She keeps telling me that this band is really excited to work with me, and that she knows managers that make less that what she's offering me. 

I keep telling her that I can't take the position, and she keeps telling me that she wants to work something out, but when I ask for like what kind of benefits come with the job, she ignores the questions.

I’m so scared of the interview’s practical skills part. To be honest I don’t really practice programming and just procrastinate my time away. I really like it though and the challenge to solve problems but I just don’t find any projects to do in my free time and if I find some interesting problems I just hush it away with the “somebody already made that thing”. At university we had programming in the first year and I almost failed in first semester then managed to climb up and get better grades but I never really practiced unless it was for a test. So right now I feel like my knowledge is not enough for someone to hire me and I was always scared of making a fool of myself. I’m just unmotivated, scared and disappointed in myself. Also, I’m snooping around on some local forums to get info about companies but sometimes I read the other conversations and I feel like they are talking about me and this discourages me even more. They talk about how bad some people are coming out from university and how they have no experience or not proper experience and how bad is our education system or how the people they interviewed sucked.  
How should I try to motivate myself? I tried some stuff like journaling, making goals or sticking to a plan but these didn’t really work for me. Also, I guess it doesn’t help that I feel pretty safe at home on my butt, doing chores and having financial stability right now (I was always good at saving my money). Should I just apply and see what happens? I guess my biggest problem is that I’m really scared of things I don’t often do or don't have practice in it.

I hope to, in the future, make enough so he doesn't have to work. He is very good at his job...but I don't know how much longer he can sustain it.

Where do I go from here? I've contemplated internships but there really aren't any being offered. I've looked on job sites and internship sites.

I applied to 5 Canadian schools (UofT, McGill, UBC, UWaterloo &amp; YorkU) for a start term this fall (Fall 2018), but got rejected from 4/5 schools for CS Thesis programs in AI/ML (haven't heard anything from York, but it's probably a rejection). My decision to apply last year was very abrupt and, as a result, I rushed the GREs, SOPs, LoRs, etc. etc. My profile at the time looked something like this:

* **GPA:** 3.79/4.00
* **GRE:** 157 V; 161 Q; 5 AW (wasn't satisfied, so didn't send anywhere except for McGill due to their requirement)
* **Research Experience:** None prior, but at the time doing a year-long Capstone Research Project in CS
* **Internships:** Software Engineer for Tech department at university (Spring 2016); FS Web Developer for Startup Company in Dubai, UAE (Summer 2016); Software Engineer for FinTech Company in New York (Summer 2017)
* **SOP:** I can send a copy? Any critique would be very appreciated!
* **LoRs:** One from my Capstone Research Advisor who I met weekly for a year (not sure if strong because it was rushed); One from the CS department head who used to be at McGill and who taught me two courses (I had to provide majority of the letter content); One from a Prof. in the Interactive Media department who taught me a class

I emailed a couple of professors from each university after I applied, asking if they had any funding for any of their research projects. I did not get a response and I did not follow up after.

Most of my profile, as one can tell, is based on work/industry experiences and no/very little research. However, I do know that I want to go to graduate school, conduct research pertaining to and learn more about AI/ML/Data Science that are appealing to me even though I do not have a lot of experience/significant knowledge about any, and penetrate the North American market thereafter in terms of work experience.

How should I go about improving my chances for next year's cycle? I plan to apply for the Fall 2019 term and was hoping if I could get some advice regarding the following things about my profile as it is now:

* **GPA:** 3.81/4.00

* **GRE:** Same as above (318), but should I retake it? Can't decide since most Canadian schools don't require it.
* **List of Schools:** Last time around, I applied to the big names without much research. How should I go about making a list of schools this time? Should I stick to Canada or go for US schools as well? I am not sure if I want to do a PhD at this point in time, and self-funding is a bit of a concern so tuition costs would be a factor.
* **Post-graduate plan:** I have been offered a position in the tech department at a top consultancy firm (Top 6) in Dubai, which I plan on pursuing in the meanwhile. One option was to maybe a year off and improve my profile in terms of GRE scores, doing some research work, and then applying. But I decided against it, wanting to gain some work experience instead (although I would've preferred going to school).
* **Research:** Submitted my Capstone Research project to two top CS conferences. One submission got rejected, the other's result isn't out yet.

Given all of this information, could I please have some help/insight about how I can go about improving my profile to increase my chances of getting into a top grad school program? I want to get into thesis programs, but with no research background and only industry experiences, how should I go about shaping my profile? Would appreciate any words of advice!


**TL;DR**
International student and CS major graduated from an American university in the UAE. Applied to 5 Canadian schools last year. Didn't get into any with my profile then. Wish to improve my profile given current stats (in bold above) and want advice about shaping my application to get into top CS grad programs for next year's cycle. Thank you!"

So needless to say I’ve been grinding leetcode after work. However literally nothing much is assigned to me at my internship and I’m pretty much looking blank or confused there. I want to make use of the time there but the problem is my monitors are pretty visible to not only other engineers but also the team leads who constantly move across the room since they work in a collaborative way in a really open environment. Is it rude to open leetcode then? Since it would be signifying I don’t like this internship how bad would it look to whip up leetcode on the screen? Also I get too tired to do leetcode seriously after working, and I really would like to make use of the internship time when I’m usually clueless. "
8nw41f,7,2018-06-01,Graduated college almost a year ago. Still can't find a job in my major or minor.,sportsguy1225,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8nw41f/graduated_college_almost_a_year_ago_still_cant/,"Hello,

I graduated from college almost a year ago with a bachelors degree in electronic media and film and with a minor in business. I have been applying for jobs in both my major and minor since then and still can't find anything in either field even though I apply for multiple jobs in both fields almost everyday. I have had numerous interviews but I either never hear back from them or I don't get the job due to little to no experience. I have internship experience working at a tv station editing video and as well as classroom experience running audio and camera and other things as well. I've been working part time jobs around where I live that aren't much more than minimum wage since I graduated in August. I'd prefer to move out of the area where I currently live for a job but wouldn't be opposed to staying here if the right opportunity were to present it self.

I have no idea what to do at this point. It gets very frustrating and upsetting. Luckily I am able to live at home while I work these part time jobs.

Any advice of what to do would be appreciated. "

The business owner scouted me and asked me if id like to work for her because she would pay me well after some months if i proved myself capable of the demanding job. She kept no timesheet system durring my internship but i know i was working well over 35-45hrs a week. There was no work schedule, she would call or text when we where going to work on a whim, sometimes within the same day, sometimes the night before, and sometimes she'd keep me hanging till the day was wasted before she decided to message me and say ""nevermind we dont have to go in today im tired."" Reguardless she expected me to post on the business social media accounts every 3 hours even if she had ""given me the day off"".
There was no written job description. Just verbal assignments given by her. There was no implimented break system. When i asked her about the timesheets or breaks she just casually said ""oh just take your break sometime at 9 then sometime between noon and 1, or you can just combine your break. But never really gave us time to stop work and take breaks. I was probably only really able to take breaks for a few days scattered here or there. And if we where scheduled to work an event then there where no breaks at all. 

So there was all that work with no pay and i was but 1 of 2 employees. 
So its safe to assume we really did everything. 

Im independent therefore i need to make my own income. I was searching for other work durring my time as an unpaid intern but the whimsical schedule made it hard to make interview appointments or provide hours of availability. Granted im at fault for being gullible and not quitting the internship due to the ever lingering promise of being paid well and being hired soon as her Personal Assistant.( The words she kept repeating to me. )

As i became more and more poor working for her i requested a leave of absence to find a job that pays me or she could hire me instead. At the beginning of april. Her response was that i could go look for a different job, or that i send her an email and continue to prove myself and she would hire me. 
At the time i had no money for rent and was backed in a corner so i took her offer and stuck it out expecting to be hired within april. The schedule at the beginning of the month was ""so busy"" she refused to tell me when she was hiring me but promised that id be hired on in time to pay rent. Before long it was nearing the end of the month and her response was that she would officially hire me as a paid employee May 1st. I was devastated. To top it off it was too late to look elsewhere and be hired sooner. Then there was discussion of my Pay. It was to be salary, paid biweekly. She gave no specific payday dates. The amount she offered initially to pay me was 1200 a month for my fulltime work. I turned it down and said i would work for no less than 1800 a month, to which she agreed.

Nothing but a general job application form, a confidentiality agreement i cant even read, and an employee equipment check out for my workphone and tablet was filled out. 

At the beginning of may i asked her for time off from the 18th through the 31st of the month. She agreed and allowed me the time away from work. I have an email confirmation of this. She had no other employees at this time. I was the only one working in the office. I worked for two weeks. she messaged me on the 16th of the month in the middle of the night saying that i had to work an event she just scheduled on the 26th or that my job was at risk. Knowing full well that i had nonrefundable plane tickets my boyfriend paid for so that i could see him before he leaves the country. I told her that i could not cancel my trip and that the decision to fire me for it was up to her. She got pissed. I worked on the 15th and 14th of that week. While i was on my trip i asked her to confirm weather or not i was fired and also what day i would be paid because it was already the 26th of the month. At the beginning of my employment she said she would pay me direct deposit in full and that i would do my own taxes. On the 26th She told me i wasnt in the system yet so she couldn't pay me direct deposit, and that she would have my pay for me when i get back. She still has not confirned however if i am fired or not. So i dont know if my pay will include the 2.5 weeks i worked or just the 2. Not to mention its late. 

I just want to know how i should approach this. I owe my landlord 1000 due tomorrow.

To clarify: i have not lifted a finger for her company since the 16th and i recently was hired at subway since i landed back in California.

Thank you so much for reading id appreciate any advice regarding legal stuff or otherwise :)"
8nwm74,19,2018-06-01,Bloom,Careful_Task,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8nwm74/bloom/,"It started out innocuous, but strange. I fell asleep on my old undergrad biostatistics textbook, poring over the chapter on data transformations yet again \- trying to avoid the inevitable conclusion that I’d probably have to analyze my results with a nonparametric test, agitated by my failure to draw what I thought should be an obvious conclusion, still in my work clothes.

I woke up in my night dress, tucked into bed. My hair still damp from showering. My textbook closed and on the shelf.

Strange.

I’m a biochemist \- well, I say that, but I’m a lab tech midway through doing a few years ‘in the field’ before going after my PhD. It’s embarrassing, as a biochemist\-of\-sorts, to admit that I snapped open my laptop, hit Google, and immediately lost my mind down the WebMD rabbit hole thinking I’d been carbon\-monoxide\-ed or something. I called in to work to let my supervisor know I’d be in late and caught the bus to the walk\-in clinic on the island near my lab.

I was fine. Nothing obvious showed up in the routine blood tests. The nurse asked me if I’d smoked anything. Of course, I hadn’t, and while I was offended that she would think that of me \- hysterical or not, I take pride in looking very clean\-cut as a young professional. I accepted the suggested drug\-testing, to be sure, though I know as well as anyone that twelve hours… twelve hours later? Plenty of things might not show up. My blood was clean, my vitals normal.

The nurse reluctantly released me with a clean bill of health, fifty dollars poorer after my copay.

After leaving a voicemail with my concerned landlords, who’d bombarded me with texts after seeing me hotfoot it out of the house without putting together my usual lunch, I walked the rest of the way to work. I was, after all, fine by all medical standards.

The Florida sun is brutal, and by eleven \- after a few hours in the clinic \- I quickly regretted my decision but didn’t see a clear path to an alternative. I didn’t want to go home \- at least in the lab I wouldn’t be alone, would have something to do. I was working on what I hoped would be my first published paper, a longitudinal study of phytopigment shifts as they define the day\-to\-day changes in phytoplankton populations at six sites around the island.

No rest for the wicked, the weary, or the marine toxicologists.

I was drenched in sweat by the time I got to the research facility and said a belated good morning to the receptionist who mans the doors.

In all the confusion, I’d forgotten it was Donut Thursday \- my bus stop is so near a combination gas\-station\-donut\-shop that I’ve made a habit of picking up two dozen donuts to leave in the break room near the coffee machine to lighten what is usually the most miserable day of my work week. Wednesday is the last day I collect and process samples from the six sites around the island \- both doing the footwork and preparing the phytopigment filters for HPLC \(high\-performance or high\-pressure liquid chromatography, depending on who you ask, for the non\-chemists out there\). On Thursday, I read and process the chromatograms, and on Friday I run stats. On these, the less\-fun days, one of the interns handles the sample collection and I spend the day hunched over my laptop in the darkened lab, staring at the peaks and valleys that indicate the presence and ratios of different forms of chlorophyll and auxiliary pigments.

It’s not bad work, but Thursday is the day I need a nice donut and the congregation of friends from other labs in the building that accumulates due to the popularity of Donut Thursday to look forward to over lunch.

Taking the elevator up to the fifth floor, I cursed under my breath. In one scatterbrained morning I’d hysterically phoned my supervisor at seven, shown up so late that I’d inevitably end up on the last possible bus home if I meant to get the week’s chromatograms read, and messed up Donut Thursday for the whole facility. Most people don’t know I’m the Donut Thursday purveyor \- I just write ‘happy donut thursday from phytoplankton toxicology’, which is one of the larger departments, so it could have been any of my labmates who dropped the ball.

The way our facility is stratified, Donut Thursday is often the only opportunity for the chemical ecologists and the phytoplankton toxicologists and the ocean tech guys and the environmental engineers and the skate\-ray\-shark rehab specialists and the endocrinology researchers and the \- well, you get the idea. We don’t communicate very much if someone doesn’t put out twenty\-four donuts as a reason to gather and shoot the breeze.

It didn’t feel good to have messed with that even if I was the reason we had the informal get\-togethers in the first place.

Nothing felt good, as a matter of fact. Time felt slippery. There’s no other way to describe it. I’d blink and reopen my eyes, certain that I must have just zoned out for a solid five minutes, and find that the elevator hadn’t even ‘ding’ed to the next floor yet. Then, without registering that I’d maneuvered down the hall, I was immersed in the green light of the lab, laughing with Marty over how a thirty\-minute walk in the summer sun had tanned me three shades darker, deflecting questions about whether I was okay \- I looked ‘sick’, which…

Well, when a twenty\-three year old ocean tech guy tells you that you don’t look well, that’s usually a euphemism for ‘you look like you’re not wearing mascara’, and I wasn’t.

I was glad I hadn’t stopped to put on makeup, actually \- my eyes had been feeling itchy since yesterday afternoon, and while it had eased off since then, I’d look like a raccoon if there was any black paint to smear.

At least I wasn’t too loopy to read chromatograms. Starting with the readings from last Friday, I resolved to work through lunch both to get a better handle on the workload and to avoid running into anyone who would bring up the notable absence of Donut Thursday. Dumb, dumb, dumb. At least I could redeem myself a little in my own eyes by powering all the way through to this morning’s chromatograms \- I could hear the current intern, Safia, in the dark room, centrifuging the samples she must have taken this morning to isolate the pigments for the machine, which would hopefully produce its readings by eight.

I could be on the ten bus home, if I was lucky. And tonight, I resolved to just go the fuck to sleep.

So I put my head down and worked, listening to Safia puttering around in the dark room as I methodically logged peaks and valleys in the Excel spreadsheet along with the last few months’ data. While the actual HPLC prep and running is performed in the dark room, most of the lab is kept dark save for green overhead lights where some facilities would have fluorescent bulbs. Any light but green light degrades phytopigments, so the sun is strictly a no\-go. The ‘dark room’, in contrast to the mostly\-dark lab, is pitch black save for the \(green\) backlighting under the fume hood where the actual samples are processed. After an hour or so in the lab, the white background of my laptop starts to look disorientingly pink, which is usually when I take a break.

Not today!

The strange \- there, that word popped up again, ‘strange’ \- disconnect with time made focusing only a little more difficult than usual. I found myself pausing to rub gritty brown crystals out of my eyes, feeling damp. The pink\-cast light from my screen seemed to be making my eyes water in a way that the sunlight hadn’t. The itching feeling seemed to be returning after a few hours of work in the lab.

I silently reprimanded myself for not having mentioned that to the harried physician or the concerned nurse at the clinic. Something either of them might have actually been able to help me with, eclipsed by my larger concern about last night’s lost time.

Three in the afternoon, then four in the afternoon rolled around. Unusually enough, there was no distracting sound of rain from an afternoon cloudburst \- I was grateful for that at first, having only marginally recovered from a longtime, recently\-exacerbated wariness of storms.

As a matter of fact, it hadn’t rained for the last three days.

My stomach growled. Two consecutive skipped meals isn’t my usual move, and I was missing my standard peanut\-butter\-and\-apple\-slices break. I wished I could take the elevator down to the first floor and have a donut with my friends \- but there were no donuts to be had, because I hadn’t brought any.

Finishing the Monday data entry, I closed out of the chromatogram and opened up Tuesday’s results.

I groaned.

Something must have gone wrong with the HPLC \- the machine could be finicky \- or the samples had been contaminated. Sometimes tourists, unfamiliar with the local waters, managed to capsize their oversized boats catastrophically enough to introduce unfamiliar fuels and cleaning agents into the fragile island ecosystems.

Sometimes I just fucked up, though not in the last few months. Maybe when I was an intern like Safia I would have accidentally prepared the solvents incorrectly \- she’s been coming in early and mixing the solvents, maybe she pH\-balanced them wrong.

Either way, the chromatogram was ugly. Fattened peaks, bizarre noise all across the usually neat spikes interspersed with flat connecting lines. The distortion was particularly bad towards the far right of the chromatogram, concentrated around the red pigment readings.

Ugh.

I made a note of the condition of the chromatogram, sent an email to my supervisor mentioning that something might be wrong with the HPLC, calculated the area of the peaks by hand rather than the heights, converted the loose estimates this technique yielded to percentages, and finished up adding Tuesday’s likely\-unusable data to the spreadsheet.

Unfortunate.

I wasn’t about to throw Safia under the bus \- she was new, but cheerful and hardworking, and reminded me a lot of myself back when I got my first undergrad summer internship. A pleasant young woman from a reasonably well\-regarded university in Maryland with accompanying accent who regularly came in early to get the lab up and running and stayed almost as late as I did.

Once I could close the window for Tuesday, I resolved to check in on her. Supervising the HPLC could be even more monotonous than reading chromatograms, and I usually spent the waiting\-hours washing glassware in the dark lab and listening to podcasts on my headset, brightness on my phone cranked as low as it could get.

Knocking on the closed door to the dark lab, I realized that not only was there no sound of rain on the roof overhead \- there was no sound but the mechanical whirs and groans of the HPLC coming from behind the door.

Maybe she had her earbuds in or something.

I opened the door just a crack and contorted my way in, letting as little light as possible follow me through the door.

Though it took my eyes a second to adjust, the shape of a dimly\-green\-illuminated figure in the far corner of the submarine\-shaped dark lab told me that Safia was as far away from me, as deeply shrouded in darkness as possible.

That was odd.

I knocked on the door again as I closed it, much louder, and she jumped half a foot with surprise, dropping a quart\-sized plastic nalgene bottle with a heavy thud.

For a second, I thought I saw a sparkle of red in the froth of the huge sampling bottle \- but like my pink\-tinged computer screen, I realized my eyes must be playing tricks on me in the green\-y darkness.

Worried, I rubbed some more itchy brownish goop out of my eyes and waved gingerly at Safia, who grabbed the bottle from the floor with a jerky motion before even registering my presence.

“Hey,” I said, raising my voice above the noise of the HPLC. “Just checking in, I know you’ve been occasionally running the HPLC alone for the last two weeks but she can be a finicky machine.”

“It’s fine,” Safia replied, short and unenthused.

“No worries,” I said placatingly, raising my palms in an effort to establish friendly intentions.

For my first few weeks, I had been more than a little paranoid that one of the older men in the lab \- my supervisor, Dr. Ranier, one of the post\-docs who used the lab for their own experimental results every so often and passed me the chromatograms to interpret \- would… I dunno, usurp my role or something? I’ve worked in less friendly labs before, but after a few weeks in my current position I stopped feeling so defensive about the quality of my results and the confidence of my superiors in my skills.

It made sense, though, that Safia, after just… three weeks, now?... still felt the need to hoard responsibilities as though someone might snatch them away from her.

“Any timeline on the HPLC results?” I asked. “No rush.”

“Fifteen minutes,” she told me shortly.

“Thanks!”

Trying to keep it positive, not wanting to make her bad day worse, I flashed a smile \- as though she could see it in the dark lab \- and backed out into the comparatively blindingly green\-lit lab where I was finishing my work.

I finally opened up yesterday’s sample, the last one I collected myself, and right away something was very wrong with the chromatogram. I was getting off\-the\-charts levels of noise, weird readings \- the wrong readings. I’ve seen messy chromatograms before. I’ve been responsible for them back when I was an intern like Safia. Tuesday could have been a messy chromatogram.

Wednesday was something fundamentally wrong. Such an unexpected chemical composition in a sample of ground\-up algae that the finely\-tuned HPLC, calibrated carefully to a 480 nm chlorophyll standard, couldn’t manage a coherent graphic depiction.

Rather than describing the data to Dr. Ranier, I sent him the file itself, not even knowing where to start on the erratic peaks and valleys as they descended into pure chaos across the chart. But how was I supposed to convey to him just how messed up the situation was? He’s a veteren phytoplankton ecologist, not a chemist. *I* was barely enough of a chemist to make sense of the confusion on the screen.

The more I stared at the chart, the less I could figure out what I was looking at. My eyes were itching anew, worse after my sojourn to the dark lab \- having trouble adjusting back to my laptop screen?

I reached up to rub at them again, and my fingers came away slick and brown.

‘Smudged mascara’, my reflexive thought filled in the blank.

I nearly upended my chair in my haste to stand up, get away from the screen, away from the charts \-

I wasn’t wearing any makeup.

Before I could… bolt, call the building’s health services, panic, even register completely that I was *bleeding from my eyes*, the vivid red invisible in the green\-lit facility, the door to the dark lab opened and Safia stumbled out, still clutching the mostly\-full quart sample bottle.

In the now\-eerie green light, I could see what looked like sooty water \- but must be blood \- streaming down her face.

“Emailed you the results,” she murmured.

I only had time to take two steps towards her before her knees buckled and she hit the finished linoleum floor with a noise like a bag of marinating steaks fallen from the kitchen counter.

For a second, I was frozen.

My laptop pinged as I received Safia’s email.

The noise shook me out of my confusion. I should have checked today’s chromatogram, first, to know what I was dealing with. I know that, now.

But she looked so helpless, sprawled on the ground, her headscarf cloaking her face so I couldn’t see if the bleeding had gotten worse. I know basic first aid, I know where the lab safety equipment is kept better than most people.

I rushed to her side, checked her pulse, lifted her head to make sure she was breathing \- she was.

She was also sopping wet, the quart sample bottle in her arms having lost its lid under the combined force of her own fall and its awkward angle of contact with the floor, popping the lid free.

And then I was outside.

It was at least nine at night, because the sun had set completely, and I was holding Safia, who weighed surprisingly less than I expected, like a rag doll.

It was very dark. Even darker than usual. All the lights in the lab \- the only inhabited structure on the island, a five\-story monolith \- were off.

We were in the empty parking lot. Most of the researchers are home by six if they can manage it, especially this late in the week. I was facing out over one of the isolated docks where I’ve been taking samples for the last two months.

Where the gentle crests of the glossy black waves connected with the dock’s supports, the mangroves, the shore, red fire seemed to glisten in the froth.

I wanted to look at it closer, longer, but my eyes didn’t just itch, they stung and blurred.

I have no idea how long I stood there, but my phone must have buzzed at least once as I overlooked the bay in a trance. Watching the red fire. So different than any kind of bioluminescent algal bloom I’d ever heard of. Not that I was thinking that.

I wasn’t thinking anything.

What saved me, I think, was that, after three long days of clear skies, late that night, a cloudburst tore apart the sky. Strangely timed. Nearly three inches of rain, the papers say. Several local beaches were entirely flooded out.

All I knew, at the time, was that something had washed the blood and poison from my eyes.

Mechanically, I walked to the same clinic that had turned me away nearly twelve hours before.

I’m not sure what hospital I’m at, but my laptop was in my personal effects.

I don’t know what happened to Safia, or anyone else at my lab. My parents are flying in from Minneapolis soon. I don’t think they’ll know any more than I do.

Nothing about my city has shown up in the news beyond the torrential rain and the erosion damage to the local beaches as the mayor tries to assuage tourists’ and snowbirds’ fears alike. I don’t expect to hear anything about a luminescent red algal bloom. Not if the city officials can avoid it.

Maybe the rain washed the evidence away. Maybe my chromatograms are all that remains as evidence that what happened last night was not some mad\-science experiment gone wrong, a freak accident better kept hushed by the laboratory's board of trustees.

I’ve been doing research on my own. I *am* a biochemist, after all, even if I’m apparently not a very perceptive one. Red pigment corresponds to any of a variety of dinoflagellate taxa. But domoic acid, a product of pseudonitzschia blooms of certain species, is associated with diatoms high in chlorophyll\-B, a pigment my most recent chromatogram registers in off\-the\-charts proportions. Pyrodinium species, which are sometimes found in our local waters, glow blue when they bioluminesce. Which one is it?

Maybe something new.

Dr. Ranier hasn’t responded to any of my emails. Neither has Marty from ocean tech. No one at the lab is picking up my calls. Not even the secretary at the front desk.

I hope they’re okay. I hope Safia is okay.

Please be careful where you swim this summer, wherever you are. Some dangers only reveal themselves in the dark."

I am having trouble trying getting jobs related to research. As much as I want to push through these obstacles, I am lost as to how to get a letter of rec without taking another half a year of undergrad before proceeding to apply grad programs/medical school. Looking back to my GPA, I could have easily gotten a \~3.2 science GPA and a \~3.4 overall GPA by just slightly cleaning up some bad work habits. If I had significantly cleaned the bad work habits and organization, I would have gotten a science and overall GPA around 3.55\-3.70. When it comes to the 501 MCAT, I was forced to take it much earlier than expected and only studied moderately for \~2.5 weeks. However, all of these are excuses, and when it comes down to it, I need to clean up my time management/organization. With that said, the accumulation of the bad GPA, no letter of recs, and bad MCAT score is weighing heavily on me for months as I essentially have had 0 progress since graduation. It is coming to the point that I think these are indicative of me and that I am a failure. I have noticed that I have been slowly isolating myself from friends and family as this is becoming a vicious cycle. I don't how to proceed. Should I take another semester of science classes, and try to get a letter of rec from classes where I would theoretically do well on them? Then proceed to apply for grad programs/meds school and retake MCAT? This would at the very least be another year before grad school would even begin.

A brief overview of my stumbling blocks to medicine:

* Recently graduated with a BS in biochemistry \(\~2.8 science GPA, \~3.1 overall GPA, 501 MCAT\)
* \-limited work experience even if you consider a half a year of an unpaid research internship \(However, I might get 1 publication\)
* \-no letters of rec from science professors \(due to low GPA and lack of a strong relationship with professors\)

Due to these stumbling block, I can't apply to any master's program related to medicine or science and medical schools including the Caribbean ones. I am having trouble trying getting jobs related to research. As much as I want to push through these obstacles, I am lost as to how to get a letter of rec without taking another half a year of undergrad before proceeding to apply grad programs/medical school. Looking back to my GPA, I could have easily gotten a \~3.2 science GPA and a \~3.4 overall GPA by just slightly cleaning up some bad work habits. If I had significantly cleaned the bad work habits and organization, I would have gotten a science and overall GPA around 3.55\-3.70. When it comes to the 501 MCAT, I was forced to take it much earlier than expected and only studied moderately for \~2.5 weeks. However, all of these are excuses, and when it comes down to it, I need to clean up my time management/organization. With that said, the accumulation of the bad GPA, no letter of recs, and bad MCAT score is weighing heavily on me for months as I essentially have had 0 progress since graduation. It is coming to the point that I think these are indicative of me and that I am a failure. I have noticed that I have been slowly isolating myself from friends and family as this is becoming a vicious cycle. I don't how to proceed. Should I take another semester of science classes, and try to get a letter of rec from classes where I would theoretically do well on them? Then proceed to apply for grad programs/meds school and retake MCAT? THis would at the very least be another year before grad school would even begin.

Lets say that the med school path is not the way to go, but I have no idea what's the next game plan. I have talked to a career counselor, but it didn't really help as she basically gave me a vast, broad list of potential careers. Instead, I kind of narrowed down the choices based on career path that I have at least moderate levels of interest and feasibility:

* computer science \(particularly AI and and a little of cyber security\) \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\&gt;No relevant experience in the field 
   * I have heard GPA is not as important in this field, but more about showing you're competent with skills from classes like algorithms, data structures, machine learning , etc. I have also heard that side projects are very important and that the learning process before getting a job can take as little as a couple of months of hard work to about a year and a half. Is it better to back undergrad again get a degrees in computer science or just take online classes from wherever I get them. How feasible is it to get a decent job related to AI or cyber security by just taking online classes? What are important skills to know or develop?
* economics/finance/policy \(investment banking, working for IMF or world bank on the process of allocating funds to places of need, and healthcare/economic public policy\) \-\-\&gt; Took intro to micro/macro and did well, but that's about it
   * I have heard that in order to get your foot into those kinds of jobs, it requires going to a top tier business school. However, from my limited knowledge getting a MBA from these sorts of school, you typically need couple years of work experience. Does that mean I have to go back to undergrad and get another degree? Should I just contact these master programs and hope that they can assist finding where and what I should do to get to these school.

I am scared of the possibility that trying to get into these fields won't pan out well despite time and money I am prepared to spend on them. I don't even know if these interests will evolve to passion or high levels of interest and whether or not the amount of effort I put in will be worth it.  This anxiety of not knowing what to do is killing me. I would really appreciate any advice given to me.

tl;dr: recent graduate with bad GPA, low MCAT score, and no letter of rec. Need help deciding whether to still try to get          into med school, go into computer science field via online classes or university, go into economics/finance/policy via masters or undergrad."

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8g25i4/new_tower_at_trinity_hospital_part_2/)

Time has become a blur. I don’t know if it’s been days, weeks, months, hours, I can’t think. My head just hurts, and I have no grip of time.

Working nights at the hospital becomes a nightmare. Family life screeches to a halt, and in an effort to try to keep your few surviving relationships through residency from imploding, you give up sleep. My wife has become more frustrated with my work schedule, yearning for more time together as my free time becomes more scarce. I tell her it’s a part of residency, that it’s all going to be better soon, but frankly, I don’t believe it myself. Half the time she’s arguing with me, telling me why I should put forth more of an effort, I can hardly keep my eyes open. I could fool myself into thinking she’s being selfish, that she’s not being supportive, but I know better: she sees caverns that once held vibrant, soulful eyes. She’s horrified by the man she sees, worried I may be falling too far. It’s a horrible economy I live in: if I want to stay married, I give up sleep. But if I give up sleep, I become a shittier husband. Sleep is a currency of life, the right to be still, and my own life account is rapidly falling further into the red.

Sleep. I can’t remember the last time I felt sleep. You know the feeling; the warm, releasing action of letting go as your bed gently drifts you into a peaceful state of unconsciousness, the place where the mind is unfurled and unleashed, a beautiful chaos of growth and expansion as awe inspiring as it is terrifying. Instead, I find myself sitting at a desk writing progress notes on patients when, next thing I know, one of the nurses taps my shoulder and I am violently slung back into consciousness 30 minutes from what I last remembered typing. The return is frigid, cold, and jarring, and the mind reaps no rest from it.

Worse of all, the few times I have afforded a moment in my bed, my dreams have not relented. These last few weeks, those dreams have changed. I have dreamt of fractals, infinitely beautiful in deep shades of blacks, blues, reds, and violets, accentuated by yellows in an effort to make a dark and stunning mindscape. As I dream, I am compelled to dive deeper and deeper into the fractal, falling further and further into its cooling, dividing embrace. Each permutation emits different colors than the last, until the endless division of divergent paths explodes like fireworks into brighter and brighter shades of oranges, blues, yellows, and greens, each division creating more spiral and spiked and curved and linear patterns until my mind is euphoric in a sea of mathematical paths and probabilities, each perfectly aligned and developed until the patterns, though they may all be different, impossibly hum in a chorus of harmony, itself imbibed with the voices of hundreds, all in glorious unison in the same note, all chanting a buzzing and busy song of peace. In that moment, I stop falling into the fractal, and rest, looking around at the colorful, incomprehensible everything. I can’t make any sense of it, but I feel at ease, and I rest.

But then, just then, at that moment of pure beauty, a voice calls to me from just above me, as if an impossibly small man was standing atop my skull, speaking in a shifty, careful voice. A voice that, at first, seems unreal and immaterial but as its concise message sets in I can make it out as my own voice. However, it speaks in ways I never would, as if it was wringing its hands in mischievous delight, as if it knew it was not supposed to be there.

“Go further.”

And without hesitation, I do, falling again deeper and deeper into the colorful abyss of mathematical possibilities, the chorus of voices now louder and louder, as the colors amplify in intensity. The patterns begin to expand and contract in rhythm, showing shapes and divisions that are nonsensical and indescribable, their beauty seemingly vibrating and rapidly devolving, as the hum of harmony begins to rise into a level of loudness that becomes increasingly uncomfortable. As I fall, faster and faster, the patterns seem to evolve so rapidly that their symmetry begins to fall apart, and what was once a beautiful harmony of color begins to grow darker, black and red, shadows replacing the vibrant color, until the coiling patterns begin to look much like the plicae of small intestine. The voices grow cacophonous, and their volume becomes deafening, until it almost seems as if they are screaming. The fractal begins to fall apart, no sense in its divisions and patterns. It almost violently twists and turns, expanding to so many chaotic possibilities that splay out like a splatter of blood against an aggressively black background. The chorus now cries in agony, each voice overcome by horrifying pain and gasping, now a heaping mass of yelling and screaming, and the patterns shift and rip apart as I fall faster and faster. What was a point of rest rapidly becomes a nightmarish, infinite hellscape.

And I gasp for breath, waking up, sweating profusely. Even though my eyes had only been closed for minutes, my mind felt trapped for an eternity. This has been my reality for days.

I haven’t slept, truly and restfully, in weeks. There are days I will be so tired, my mind will lose the precious barriers between reality and dream, and I will find myself talking to someone when all of a sudden we both find ourselves enveloped in the red and black hellscape, their words replaced by an open mouthed, dead eyed scream made of the sounds of a thousand agonizing voices.

I’m surprised I haven’t grown more unhinged.

As I mentioned, the last 3 weeks melded together into a formless amalgamation of lost time and mundane events, as the night float service is often punctuated by meaningless calls, late night admissions, and staving off sleep. Seldom was there anything to call exciting or exhilarating, which often made the days all the more difficult to endure.

Something does stand out in my memory, though. Something that happened about a week ago.

I was on another stretch of night float, about the 4th or 5th straight night. Thankfully, I had an intern with me: Dr. Weber. Weber is an interesting fellow, about 6’2’’, a tall lanky gentleman in his early 30s. His face is cut at pronounced angles and thin, giving him natural shadows that make his cheeks look hollow and hungry. His smile, though thin and toothy, is full and vibrant, and his eyes exhibit the glow of confusion and wonder that tends to inhabit the typical visage of an intern. He has a head full of thin, straight blonde hair with a balding patch just noticeable at the top of his head. His whitecoat drapes over his thin shoulders in such a way that it seems as if every morning he dons it with its hanger unremoved. He walks hunched over, like a spy from an old cartoon, and speaks in a hushed, deliberate, and flowing tone, as if he is always instructing a class on how to paint a mountain range. He is, in essence, a foil to my style of practice, the it's\-not\-a\-work\-day\-until\-someone\-is\-revived\-forcefully style, manic and looking for the worst case in the department. Truth be told, as smart as Weber is, I always wonder what made him end up an ER resident, a member of the hectic and loud and boisterous crowd of emergency docs. But Weber is special in his own way, and for that I can’t help but love the guy.

Nights with Weber are quiet and effective, most of our 13 hour shift workload conducted in about 30 minutes, the rest of our time relegated to waiting for admissions and answering calls from nurses. Most calls are inane and useless, simple clarifications of already\-placed orders by nurses, calls we seldom truly listen to and often answer with the phrase “just continue current management”. It is unlikely that any call needs of us any active intervention. Admissions come from the ER but are often quick affairs, seldom involving more that us ensuring the patient has a plan for care once the day team arrives at 7 am. Our work is tedious and seldom fruitful; we act as life support for the hospital as it lays its weary head to rest.

Our office is a small room in the 10th floor of Old North, the highest point of the building with a commanding view of the entirety of Trinity hospital, beset on all sides by windows that reach from the floor to the ceiling. Each of us man old oak desks with cookie cutter computer workstations and relay phones, commanding the majority of the care of almost a hundred patients in an effort to ensure the day team’s patients survive the night and are comfortable to get some sleep. The room is sparingly furnished, on one side containing an old leather couch featuring deep cracks from lack of maintenance and covered in mismatched blankets as a last resort for those who cannot overcome the need to sleep during a float shift. On the other side, an old refrigerator contains sorry excuses for “night meals” for the residents on night float; I’d be lying if I told you I’d ever seen anyone eat one of those meals. The wall length windows that comprised the entirety of the office are old and opaque from age, allowing a view of the outside world that consistently looks ever so grim. The office itself was the only room of the 10th floor that was in any way used: the remainder of the floor had once been a physical rehabilitation ward, but the addition of Trinity East had rendered the floor useless for almost 10 years. The entirety of the floor had been emptied out, leaving the solarium as our makeshift resident workroom and command center for the night float. Now, the elevator opens to empty hallways pockmarked with rusted and inoperable hospital beds and sanitation stations, each featuring dozens of empty rooms often housing old chairs and obsolete records. We once found a statue of an unnamed saint in one of the rooms, but outside of the occasional cockroach, the floor is eerily quiet. Light only emanates from the solarium at the end of the hallway, so the walk from the elevator to the resident workroom is often oppressive and oddly terrifying. So often I walk to the workroom and feel as if the entire floor is hiding observers that scrutinize residents as they take their post in the workroom for the night.

The night in question started like any other, and after a solid hour of work, Weber and I entered our usual holding pattern and filled the night with vapid chit chat and eventual pauses in conversation. Four or five calls broke the silence for a few seconds, but the flavor of the night was as bland as any other.

However, around 1 am, we received a call: one of the patients in Old North 5th Floor \(one of our Medical Wards, often containing infectious cases\) was spiking a fever after 5 days of being on antibiotics. He had no fevers prior, and was now complaining of a massive headache and neck pain with the new fever of 104.3.

Finally, we can be useful, I thought.

I hung up the phone and discussed the case with Weber, at which point we quickly surmised we were dealing with a case of new onset meningitis \(an infection of the central nervous system\). Our conclusion meant we would have to conduct a lumbar puncture \(an invasive extraction of spinal fluid using a long needle introduced into the spinal canal\) in an effort to elucidate what pathogen was causing the infection and what we could do to treat it. Weber, at this point a hungry intern looking for action and procedures as any good emergency medicine intern should, almost giddily jumped at the opportunity to conduct the lumbar puncture. I, having nearly no sleep and a thin film of sanity left, had no issue letting him do the procedure.

We made our way down to 5th floor and found a 45 year old male in the room we were called about in much the same way he had been described to us. We did everything we needed to do to prepare him for the procedure, and after a few awkward attempts by my eager yet still less\-than\-competent intern to enter the spinal canal with our lumbar needle, we finally extracted the sample we needed to conduct our necessary analyses.

Stepping out of the room, we bagged our sample and debriefed with the patient’s assigned nurse.

“Excuse me, ma’am?” Weber inquired, “We have the sample from room 516. Here you go!”

The intern stood there with the sample neatly in a biohazard bag, arm outstretched toward the nurse with a look of doofy innocence.

“Honey, what am I supposed to with that?” The nurse stood nonplussed.

The question was obviously not expected by poor Weber, who at that point began to turn red and sweat through sheer embarrassment.

“Uh, I\-I, uh...don’t you guys take these to the lab? You know, t\-to run the tests? Because...you’re a nurse. You are...HIS nurse, right?” Weber struggled.

Oh no, you poor idiot, I thought.

The nurse took no time to react to the blunder my intern had just committed. She smelled blood in the water, and she wanted a piece.

“Oh, OH, I’m sorry, you’re the doctor! Let me just go ahead and take of that, DOCTOR, seeing as how I don’t have 6 other people waiting for me to tend to their every goddamned need and how I don’t have only 3 nurses covering this entire unit which is most certainly is about to get an admission. YOU were able to go to the expensive med school, and I am just a simple nurse who…”

I did my best to quickly grab my rapidly melting intern and make a clean getaway from the 5th floor nurse station. Weber was still stammering the words “sorry” and “I didn’t know” while I informed him that we took our own samples at night to the main lab in an effort to help out our nurses. I made for the door and called for the elevator to take us to 2nd floor, the location of our main lab.

Upon arrival to the 2nd floor, however, we noticed the main lab was uncharacteristically quiet: no one was manning the machines, and the lights were all off. A simple sheet of paper taped to the entrance of the lab provided a concise explanation:

“Main lab now located in 4th floor New North”.

I don’t think I could explain why, but the sign seemed to emit a sense of dread, it made me terrified. Perhaps it was the way that it rested on the barely lit entrance of the motionless laboratory, or the way the note had been hastily written. Perhaps it was the way it gave it message in the dead of silence of an empty floor, much in the way our own 10th floor office felt as if we were constantly being watched.

But, truthfully, it was because of the image I had seen upon the death of the patient from room 7. The image of the man my tired mind had betrayed me with, displayed on that 4th floor.

“Oh, looks like we gotta go to New North. I’ve never been there, have you?” Weber inquired.

“Nope, I can’t say I have”, I lied, trying hard to hide my inexplicable fear.

“Cool! We’ll get to break the monotony by visiting the new place. Heard it’s gonna have our new emergency department. Glad this place is finally getting scrapped, it’s been around for too long\-\-”

“Let’s go, Weber, we gotta get this to lab”, I interjected. I was dreading the thought of going to 4th floor, but I still could not pin exactly why. I figured Weber might think me crazy if he knew my fear, so I led us back to the elevator and pushed 4th floor.

As the elevator opened, we could see the connecting portion of old North leading to the new tower. The connecting area showed a jarring contrast between the two structures, with the architecture of the Old North tower leading briskly to the shiny white flooring and white walls of the emerging New North tower. As we walked by the connecting area that led to the new edifice, we could see the lighting turn from the subdued and dimmed lights of the night settings in Old Tower to the fluorescent white lights of New North. The connecting portion ended at a glass door, the portal that would lead into the new floor of the new tower.

“Laboratory”, the door read. A small placard below the black etching listed the departments currently within the 4th floor.

Chemistry, Hematology, Pathology, Serology, Medical Examiner, Cell Lines, Specimen Processing and Storage.

“Looks like this is the place” Weber stated. “Where do we drop off the sample?”

“I think it’ll probably go to Specimen Processing, though to be honest I’m hardly sure. I don’t remember our previous lab having this many departments” I pondered. “We used to just drop it off at a front desk and that was that.”

“Hmm, Specimen processing makes sense. It’s a specimen, we need it processed. Plus I don’t see any other living being around here at this ungodly hour. Is there anyone around that can tell us where to put this?” Weber asked.

“Hell if I know”, I blurted, “Let’s check inside and see if anyone’s around.”

We walked up to the glass doors and noticed a badge access pad to the left of the door. I took my badge and tapped the pad, a green light and a quick beep indicating access had been granted. The glass doors briskly opened and Weber and I stepped in.

Inside, the theme of white flooring and white walls was amplified, the cleanliness and gleaming whiteness of nearly every surface making the rooms feel as if there was continuum between the ceiling, walls, and flooring. A small white desk sat empty in the middle of a sizeable lobby, with single, glass pane pull doors distributed evenly along the lobby leading to the various departments of the laboratory. The room was lit almost unbearably well, with the lighting flooding in such a way that shadows seemed to not exist in the entire lobby. The lobby was almost entirely silent, the only sound being the quiet hum of the lights and running laboratory equipment beyond the various doors of the lobby.

No receptionist, I thought. Guess it’s time to see what’s behind door number 2.

“Where to?” Weber inquired, quizzically.

“I guess we do specimen processing. Otherwise, we just need to find an adult who knows what to do.”

“I thought you were the adult, Dr. Upper Level”, Weber said, mildly mockingly.

“No lip, intern”, I warned Weber. “Let’s get this done so I can try to catch a nap.”

We found the door marked “Specimen Processing” to the left of the solitary desk and made our way toward it. Again, the door featured a black access pad to the left of the steel door frame, the door comprised of a single pane of opaque glass. The only visible thing was the lettering in black; the rest of the glass obscured what lied within.

I again took my badge and tapped the pad, again showing green and a beep. The door made an audible clicking noise, and I pulled on it to reveal the processing department.

At this point, I felt sense of unease: the door had led us into a small corridor, at the end of which another opaque glass door stood.

“Security is pretty tight in the new lab, huh.” Weber quipped nervously.

As we walked into the corridor, the door at the end of the hall featured a large light bar above it, which I noticed displayed a red color. With Weber and I now both inside the corridor, we approached the door at the end. Soon we realized the door we had just passed was closing on it’s own, and soon it closed with a firm click. As soon as the door clicked closed, a quiet hiss emitted from the walls, and the light bar above the far door displayed a green color.

“Real tight, Weber. Real tight”, I mumbled.

I noticed yet another access pad to the left of the far door. Tap, green light, beep, open door.

The room behind the far door stood in stark contrast to the rest of the laboratory. The door opened up to a long, thin room with clean gray floors and matted black walls and ceilings. The fluorescent white lights of the corridor and lobby were gone, replaced instead by wall fixtures that dimly illuminated the thin black room. The right of the thin room contained about 8 light fixtures evenly spaced along the black wall to provide the dim lighting, and to the left the thin room wall was made entirely of plexiglass. As we walked into the thin black room, we could see that the plexiglass was partitioned into 4 areas beyond the clear barrier, each the approximate size of a normal operating room and each separated by walls covered in black tiled foam. At the end of the thin black room was another door, a steel blast door with a small square window with reinforced wiring in the glass, the door itself featuring only a heavy duty steel handle and a magnetic lock. The door had black letters below the small window:

“Expansion and Storage. RESTRICTED.”

As we approached the steel door, we could more clearly see the partitioned rooms beyond the plexiglass: each room seemed to featured many of the same fixtures that are often employed in a standard OR. Overhead lights, telemetry monitors, anesthesia computers and carts, steel supply carriers, brushed steel tables, and instrument boxes were all arranged neatly at the periphery of each operating theater. A central fixture of monitors was present in the ceiling of each partition, each fixture containing a large 55” monitor pointed toward the thin black room as if with the purpose of showing observers beyond the plexiglass barrier what was going on within the room. Most peculiar, however, were two things: all of the equipment, flooring, walls, and draping was, instead of the standard whites and light blue hues of a typical operating room, colored in glossy black and gray colors, lending a tremendous darkness to each operating theater. Furthermore, the center of the room did not feature a typical operating table. Instead, a solid section of the floor seemed to be elevated exactly at the center of the room, the black tiles that covered the floor instead continuing from the floor to the elevated section. The section rose as a block to approximately 2 feet above the floor, and it spanned about 4 feet in width. The entire section was, most peculiarly, shaped like an octagon, unlike anything I had ever seen in any OR before.

“Woah, what the hell is this, dude…” Weber trailed off, as he approached the plexiglass and studied the black operating rooms.

I could hardly hear him, my mind taking in the entirety of this place. As I walked along the length of the thin room, I eventually ended up at the steel blast door. It was then that I noticed another black access pad to the left of the door. I looked at the pad, and almost instinctively reached for my badge, as if conditioned to open any door that had such a security measure. However, for what reason I do not know, my hand stopped, and my body began to poise itself in fear of an unknown danger. I lifted my eyes to look into the secured room through the small window, and I could see something uncanny: within the room were rows of high storage shelves, each comprised of glass cases and lit by UV lights. Within each case were rows of vials, each with a small label marked with what I could make out to be dates and names, along with a unique QRS code. Each case had a general identifier to it, with each shelf dedicated to an arbitrary label, such as “Cell line 112”, and “Growth attempt #3”. I tried squinting to see what each vial identifier was, what name was on the label, and what date was printed, as a cursory view seemed to suggest the labels for each of the hundreds of these vials were identical. Just as I could make out the label, Weber tapped my shoulder:

“DeSola, we need to get out of here, we are SO not in the right place, man”, he hurriedly stated, pointing above the door we had entered to get into the thin black room.

Above the door, whirring and blinking, was a motorized camera, audibly zooming into and tracking us.

I felt immediately cold and my heart raced. Wherever we were, we were not supposed to be here.

“Let’s go”, I said, immediately going for the door to the corridor.

“Wh\-what about the sample?” Weber hurried along.

“We keep it, put it in the fridge, throw it away, it doesn’t matter. Back to the workroom, now. Sharpish, Weber.”

We hurriedly backtracked through the corridor, back to the lobby, through the glass doors and back to the elevator, the thought of that whirring camera causing us both to periodically look back to see if anyone had followed us. The elevator seemed to take an eternity, but soon we were closing the doors on 4th floor and walking back to our desks on 10th.

The rest of the night was marked by an uncomfortable silence in the workroom. Our sample lay on Weber’s desk for long enough that it made us both uncomfortable, and eventually we stashed it in the fridge, rationalizing that it would be day team’s problem soon enough. Truth be told, though, we both felt an indescribable fear just by looking at the vials of spinal fluid, and could not bear to see them in our line of sight any longer.

Eventually, night turned to day, and the day team plodded in to take report. We quickly checked out our patients to them and gave them the sample from room 516. Both Weber and I failed to tell the new team about our excursion into 4th floor, and the team took the sample with little questioning. Weber and I made our way out into the morning sun, and parted ways, each clearly perturbed by the thick mass of mystery that had enveloped the events on 4th floor.

Weber and I had other nights on float, uneventful and boring. We never again spoke of that night.

I certainly did not tell him about what was inside the steel blast door.

Nor did I tell him about the voice I heard just as I pulled my hand away from my badge.

The voice that at first seemed unreal and immaterial, but as its concise message set in, I could make it out as my own.

“Go further”.

He had pulled me away just as I had read the label on the vials. Hundreds of vails, each with a small label marked with what I could make out to be dates and names. Each with a small label marked with what I know was one same date and one same name. One same room.

It couldn’t be. But I know what I saw.

Sorry in advance for this being long.

I just graduated college a couple weeks ago. Just curious, does anyone have some advice for people out of college looking for their first full-time job? I’m living with my parents and they live in a camper and it’s not been very accommodating so far. And I feel very frustrated and it’s been hard adjusting to living in a camper with my parents. 

Last summer I interned at a large bank and it’s been challenging emotionally to not have a job yet. I feel like I’ve let my family down and I’m still recovering from my first breakup after my ex left me (I dated her all of college except my last semester). Maybe I’m just being impatient or just really burnt out and emotionally stressed with life. But does anyone know how long it takes or should take to get a job (a range?) I apply to jobs almost daily and I’ve applied to about 20 places since I finished my last final 3 weeks ago. I had one HireVue interview that was a disaster and I stuttered during the entire thing (I haven’t done so poorly on an interview since high school).  

I was invited where I interned to do their commercial training program back in February and I passed the first round and I was cut from the final 200 people they brought to the final round in late March. (Very intense interview. They took 20 people only).

My degree is in economics and I even have been trying to network with alumni and it’s been hit or miss for receiving advice on that end. My strategy for the job search has been just keep finding jobs that relate to my internship (credit analyst jobs) and it’s hard to see what I can do and what jobs I should ignore cause I’m not eligible for them or they want a certain candidate (my gpa was 2.93).

I’m talking to job agencies but Im wondering if I should be open to temp- to full time positions as well as full time positions? 

Sorry I know is long. I don’t usually post stuff like this and I don’t really have anywhere else to turn to (sad I know haha), if it helps I’m in Maine and I’m trying to move back to the greater Boston area where I went to college. 

Thank you

(So I can figure out what I would like to do at a potential internship next summer.)

I currently work in my institution's IT department, and actually have a very good working relationship with the sysadmins here.  I'm torn between working in an IT setting and shooting more for a job at a software company—both have benefits and drawbacks.  In my own personal work on my lab, I've been experimenting quite extensively with k8s (edit: kubernetes) and Docker, and it shows promise and is incredibly interesting to me, but I wonder if it's even used in IT at all.  My bias leads me to believe that it is probably *not* used at companies that are primarily Windows shops… any Linux sysadmins using it yet?

Thing is I'm 24, married with 2 kids and I'm halfway through my degree. While despite being stupid I wouldn't mind taking an internship if I was single, but I'm not, I don't have time to take on a low paying/non paying CS internship (that's how it is in my area) I have to work and go-to school full time (not that I'm complaining, I can handle those just not an additional BS internship on top)

But now I'm thinking that I'll have a hard time getting a job after college without one, if it really is all that important what else can I do to replace it that won't take too much of my already limited time?

Maybe make contributions to projects on GitHub?

Thanks."

Lately I've been feeling like everyone around me is moving on with their life and I'm just stuck here. My sister got into a serious relationship and they're planning moving out together in the next two/three months and they're planning to go onto multiple trips throughout summer (Bali for a month, New York, etc.) and she has always been my travel so that freaks me out that I won't have anyone to go on any trips. She's seriously my soulmate but ever since she's been in that relationship I think we've only hung out once together (aside from being at home together, that doesn't count.) I told her how this bothers me that we haven't hung out but she never bothered changing her actions so that's that. 

Then my best friend is going to graduate with her mba next week and she recently told me that she's seriously considering going out of state for work (only two hours away) and it literally breaks my heart not having her around as much if she were to move away. But aside from that, she's also going to Europe with her boyfriend with a month (most of June, part of July) and I was originally going to go (yay for third wheeling) but I started a new position at work and I feel guilty about taking time off (which I shouldn't have, I should've been selfish and just bought my ticket because I regret it now.) (PS I could still probably go with them but it will only be for 10 days and the tickets are a bit overpriced but it's not out of my financial range. I'm debating about saying fuck work and just go live my life and be stress free. I also wanted to go Ibiza but unfortunately they didn't plan it in their trip and that place is so amazing to me so that's originally why I didn't buy the ticket but now I'm panicking that I should go to not be alone here)

On top of all this, a lot of my coworkers, friends from school, are leaving for the summer or actually moving out of state for different reasons. This makes me feel so alone. I know it's not intentional for them to be doing this and it's a part of life for people to be moving on but I've been feeling so unhappy with my life right now because I'm not where I would like to be. It's really frustrating because anything I ever wanted I had to work so hard, I've always felt like I'm constantly struggling and I have no idea with how I am going to cope if everyone just leaves. I originally wanted to be signed with an agency this summer and really focus on modeling but unfortunately if you saw my last post that didn't happen. I'm also in school for accounting and entrepreneurship and I didn't get any internships either. I am left to continue to work as a server and office assistant (my new position was doing administrator work such as tips, invoices, etc. but in all honestly I reallllly dislike it due to having to work closely with my managers who always create so much drama) I should've just been selfish about what I wanted from the beginning.

My First 2-3 days I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown. My mentor ran me through how to do some CRUD and then set me loose on some of my own tickets. I was so lost and honestly started to rethink my field. Hell, the other intern that started with me quit after her first 2 days! 

Not only was I alone and confused, but on my 3rd day they assigned me to a brand new project they were actually doing for a client. Little did I know this was a blessing in disguise. They started me from the bottom up with using .NET core (which they just started using). I created the domain models, mappings, and services before finally digging into the views and starting in on some CRUD. Now at the end of my second week I've completed a ticket that used to take me 14 hours in 3. 

I think learning from the bottom up and seeing how all the files communicated really helped in moving forward. I feel like I've learned more in these last 2 weeks than I have in my entire time in university. Not only this but I'm having a ton of fun doing it. I was worried that maybe SE would bore me, but I can enthusiastically say I love it.

I have, many times, sat down and think of the reason why am I like this, I came to the conclusion is I usually surround myself with negativity so I wont get too cocky about myself but instead, really on the inside, Im very competitive. Its like, yeah i had it coming rather than being positive and hoping things would turn out better.
Also, I keep comparing myself to others and its killing me, it leads me to biased criticism of others. And because I judge many work so biased, im so afraid of people saying im not good enough and that's my limit, etc.

8nzqlw,3,2018-06-02,US-German Engineer : Is my career making any sense (please critique)?,MosesBro,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8nzqlw/usgerman_engineer_is_my_career_making_any_sense/,"Dear Reddit,

  
I don't know where to begin, but let's start with my bachelors in mechanical engineering which I finished in December 2008 from Charlotte, NC. I graduated 'cum Laude' but it didn't matter because it was the worst of the financial crisis and companies were laying people off, and no one was hiring.

  
In addition to this story, I had a 4 year long health crisis \(necrotizing pancreatitis\) that started when I was 20 and finished when was 24. It was very terrifying and I've had many major surgeries, and had tubes/drainages hanging out of my abdomen for years. But I'm lucky, and I was able to live normally after opting to have half of my pancreas amputated \(I know this isn't necessary for career advise, but its part of a story\). And through all that I did graduate with a bachelors. I was 26 years old then.

  
Anyways, I developed quite an interest in the medical field after having the benefiting from the best technology the world had to offer to keep me alive. And since in early 2009 the economy still wasn't looking good I though it would be cool to get a master's degree in biomedical engineering. So then I applied to the Master's in Biomedical Engineering program at the RWTH University in Aachen, Germany! I thought it was a good deal because tuition didn't cost anything compared to American standards. Health insurance was cheap for students, and I was able to afford a room, and completely support myself with student\-assistant gigs. I mostly did a lot of LabVIEW programming and automation in laser\-labs. And I did my thesis in programming the control software for a surgical robot \(openCAN / real\-time / embedded stuff\). And I met a really cute physics student, who found a PhD position in Vancouver, Canada after graduating.

  
So then I was 29, just out of the master's program and followed my girl to Vancouver to see if we could start a life there, and we placed our first child on order \(born 2012\). But that's when the financial strain hit, because my wife was paying tuition as a PhD student in Canada, and everything is expensive in Vancouver \(rent / daycare / living costs\). I couldn't find a biomedical related job to save my life. There are just a few companies in Vancouver, and I had a few interviews, but no takers. Sure enough, I started doing day labor, and even got a job as a driver for a roofing company \(and received the worst abuse I'd ever taken in life\). Eventually, I got a gig in a University, again doing LabVIEW programming and automating non\-linear spectroscopy experiments. And it kept us above water for a bit, and we had a second child. I also took some online\-programming courses through EdX \(intro to programming w/ Python, intro to data science with Python, and Embedded Systems\).

  
Good luck finally strikes and my good work at the university got me a reference to an optical sensor company in 2014. Things are good, my first real salary. I was hired as a research engineer \(lots of reading\), and i get into all sorts of things; fiber optics, sensors, quality control, and lots of success with computational fluid dynamics \(even spinning up simulations of AWS\). ... Things were going well and my manager is happy. I can afford daycare for my two little ones and my wife's PhD tuition.  And in 2016 my third little one comes along.

  
Then things took a bad turn at work. The owners tried to take money unannounced from the company \(it made the newspaper\). CEO got fired. New CEO comes in, but only lasts 6 months and was allowed to resign. New managers come in, and my new manager is just not competent. Its the kind of engineer who rattles off technical sounding words in an attempt to sound smart. I start getting really insane research requests. Later some colleagues start joking with me how they just make up stuff to get the manager off their backs, and they know it ends up on my desk. I was being picked on by proxy. ... And eventually I get laid off because I wasn't able to complete impossible tasks.

  
And then again, in Vancouver, I had a clustered work experience, with degrees in mechanical / biomedical engineering but no experience in those fields. Again, only a few interviews. And I get told that I'm 'overqualified' a lot. One company offered me an internship as a mechanical engineer for $12 / hour, but I couldn't afford rent on that. So we make the decision that we'll use my unemployment money to be a stay\-at\-home dad, so that my wife has a last chance to finish her PhD. After that, we bail back to Germany where I saw that most of my previous study colleagues had gotten jobs in their fields \(or at least at biomed companies\). We pack it up and ship in all back to Aachen in late 2017.

  
The move is heartbreaking. I feel so sorry for the kids. But my wife actually succeeded to passing her committee meeting, and just needs to write up her thesis \(which doesn't have to happen in Canada\). She was also offered a job with her old colleagues in Aachen, with fantastic pay, so we first decided to land here in Aachen, Germany again. Kids are in day care \(costs us only €80/child\). Rent is €650 w/o utilities. And I looked around for what I could find, and turns out that there was a posting for PhD position at my old Uni for programming and medical stuff, at a computer science department. And after a year of unemployment, I took the PhD position, starting two months ago. I'm 35 now.

  
Here's my question Reddit. Does any of this make sense? Have I been bouncing around too much? And should I even be considering a PhD at this point? How should I really be thinking? ... Right now, all I've experienced is desperate uncertainty in the job market since getting my bachelors, that I'm actually just filled with anxiety when it comes to work / job search. And when it comes to this PhD, the problems just seem a continuation of my anxiety. I have a hard time sleeping, and I've been reduced to tears about even this.

  
I've written too much. I'll just end it here. I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who reads this."

The length is 2 months and the compensation is the same. My objective is to learn as much as possible in CS but I am a bit scared of feeling overwhelmed because of my performance anxiety.

Team A is a neurosciences team. They actually proposed me to continue 2 projects they already explored a bit. The supervisor is really kind, pedagogical, benevolent and explains everything in a way I can easily inderstand despite my non existing biology / physics backgroud.

Project A1 would be a C\+\+ simulation of the cycle of scaffold proteins in synapses. They want to test the accuracy of their theoretical model to see if it works... I know C and Java so learning C\+\+ excites me and the project is really valuable and interesting.

Project A2 is building a SVM to classify between 2 kind of spikes in neurons. It\`s also very promising, and I ve done a liitle bit of ML before \(a convnet\) but it sort of scares me because its not just programming. 

Team B is a bio imaging team. The supervisor is not a professor but a PhD that is close to my age  and we get along really well, like friends. She was also very kind and reassuring but the project is less delimited and structured than teamA prof. Or actually is may be that the topic is less accessible so I had a hard time understanding what is was about.

 She is trying to distinguish between images of neurons of sick patients \(Aizheimer\) and normal ones, and understand what descriptors make a network decide if someone is sick or not. She proposed me to build a siamese network or do some clustering. Like Project A2, this is really scary to me, but I feel like I would learn a lot. Unfortenately I didnt feel well the day we met so I sort of forgot why she wanted to do the siamese/triplet thing... so i already feel like a stupid potatoe. I´m scared of being really incompetent and a burden.

So there are several questions here really:

\(1\) I will have other opportunities to program and do C\+\+ in my life, so I want to take a ML project. But I feel it´s somewhat risky and I dont want to be a burden to the researchers.

\(2\) Should I prefer the super friendly PhD or the pedagogical professor? 

\(3\) Whch of the projects will teach me the most CS skills? \(simulation c\+\+ / SVM / siamese\)

Thanks a lot :\)"
8o0ipr,7,2018-06-02,What's the possibility of career trajectory going from technician to engineer,uncertainfuture321,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/8o0ipr/whats_the_possibility_of_career_trajectory_going/,"Hi all, this will be quite long so please bear with me. Some background info at first, question towards the end.

* Graduated about half a year ago with a B.S. in Physics from a large, well known US public university. My program allowed me to take some engineering electives and I made full use of it, focusing in mechanical. While these electives all belong to an ABET accredited program, my degree is not.
* While I always did well in the engineering electives, overall they only make up ~25% of my degree credits. I did not enjoy most of my physics courses, especially the theoretical ones, and my grades reflected this. My GPA is an unimpressive 2.89. 

* I’ve looked into getting a Masters in Engineering, but they all have 3.0 GPA requirements over the last 2 years of undergrad, which I do not have.
* Participated extensively in engineering clubs in high school and my last 2 years in college. In college I definitely spent more time on those than my courses.
* Had one internship last summer at a mechanical engineering form. My duties were the exact same as the salaried full-time engineers. Unfortunately, it’s a small company and before I joined, they made clear the inability to extend a full time offer after my internship.
* Relocation is not an option for me, which I know limits my options severely. I do live near a big city with a fairly good mechE presence. 

Clearly I have made some costly mistakes the past few years academically. Another mistake though is I only started applying for jobs after I graduated. Initially I focused on applying for entry level engineering roles at literally any nearby company with openings. I later also included technician roles. In the past half year I received 4 calls that all led to some form of an on-site interview- 3 for entry level mechE positions and 1 for engineering technician. Out of those, only the company where I did the technician interview gave me an offer.

Do note, I have nothing against being a technician. I see it as a good way to get some experience in the industry and a foot in the door. I also liked the company from my interactions with them (HR, on-site tour, panel interview with 3 different engineering managers). The pay is no where close to an engineering position, but my financial situation isn’t shabby. Looking online though, including some past posts on Reddit where people had a similar predicament, I see a lot of concerns about how taking such a role can look bad when I apply to actual engineering jobs later in the future. The one big difference I see though between my situation and theirs though, is they have an actual engineering degree which I obviously do not.
Few more pieces of information to note:

* I have gone to every large job fair hosted at my university starting 2 years before I graduated. Initially to practice speaking with recruiters and getting resume feedback, and then later to try and get jobs/internships.
* I have had my resume looked at by friends in the mechE industry who have more experience than me, as well as career services back when I was in university.
* I will paraphrase, but this technician role’s listed responsibilities include: Supporting the engineering team to develop documentation, models, and drawings. Conduct product testing, validation testing in a lab setting, assessment of process efficiencies, and reports on all three things. I don’t think it’s smart to post it verbatim here but if any of you want to take a closer look, drop me a PM.
* Studied for the FE after graduating but put it aside for now after state DoL said they count my degree for 2 years, meaning I need to work under someone with a PE for an additional 2 years before I can take the EiT.
* Several people within the engineering team at this particular company started out in a technician job. They tell me I could have the possibility of moving up internally after some time, but maybe that's what they tell everyone? I acknowledge I will need to be a rock star to possibly move up and am willing to put fourth my best effort if I think it's a legit possibility.
* If I were to accept the job, after about 1 year if I don't see it going anywhere, I plan on restarting the job search because I'm scared of my career stagnating and never getting anywhere.

Recap: I’m pretty tired of applying for jobs without much success. Grad school is off the table for now, as is the FE exam. My end goal is working as an engineer in the mechE industry. I don’t mind starting as a tech and working my way up if it will help. I feel like the position offered to me (based on job description) can be valuable experience, but maybe I’m wrong. If I keep waiting, I feel my chances of getting more offers will only go down.

Maybe you good people of Reddit have been in a similar position, or know of someone who has. So my question is what should I do? Keep applying and hoping for the best, or is taking a technician job, specifically one offered to me, a viable springboard into a future engineering job?

I did most of the design work on my own time, outside of class, and obviously this wasn't paid, because of the context and I'm still new to this industry.

Another big reason why I picked up this double major was so I can be able to get an internship in the summer, which would count as a technical elective, so now I only need four classes to fulfill the double major. 


Only issue now is, I’m not even sure if it’s worth it anymore. While doing my concentration in CompE with my EE degree I took all the fun classes and my school is so limited on Computer Engineering technical electives, I have to take grad level classes. Theres only three undergrad CompE electives at my school and they are systems programming, digital image processing, and digital signal processing. Those classes don’t really sound interesting to me except for DSP. And two of those classes overlap! So now I’m in a situation where I’d have to request taking a grad level course to count and then I’d probably have to do an independent study with a professor to count as a course. I did land an internship and I like it so far. Ideally I’d like to ask if I can stay longer. 


I can finish this internship, come back home and do one more semester of school then graduate in December with a double major in CompE and EE. What im thinking of doing is requesting to stay at the internship longer, then coming back home and just graduating with the degree I’ve already fulfilled. It doesn’t really feel like a double major, feels more like I’m a CompE who took a couple of EE classes. 


What do you guys think? Do you think this double major is worth it? Will it help with employability? Or is EE with comp E concentration sufficient? I am lightly considering a masters degree in CompE too, would that make my double major irrelevant? "

My First 2-3 days I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown. My mentor ran me through how to do some CRUD and then set me loose on some of my own tickets. I was so lost and honestly started to rethink my field. Hell, the other intern that started with me quit after her first 2 days! 

Not only was I alone and confused, but on my 3rd day they assigned me to a brand new project they were actually doing for a client. Little did I know this was a blessing in disguise. They started me from the bottom up with using .NET core (which they just started using). I created the domain models, mappings, and services before finally digging into the views and starting in on some CRUD. Now at the end of my second week I've completed a ticket that used to take me 14 hours in 3. 

I think learning from the bottom up and seeing how all the files communicated really helped in moving forward. I feel like I've learned more in these last 2 weeks than I have in my entire time in university. Not only this but I'm having a ton of fun doing it. I was worried that maybe SE would bore me, but I can enthusiastically say I love it. I see a lot of posts from worried college students in my situation on here and thought it would be good to make a positive post."

Honestly I don't have anything really under my belt outside academics so I wanted to dedicate this summer to working and CS. I know some things include...

* **Work on a personal project**: I know it should just be something you're interested in? Like it doesn't have to be new and revolutionary but just as long as you can show that you're able to apply some of the things you know. I think I have an idea of what I want to do, but does anyone have any tips for this?
* **Leetcode**: I haven't really taken a look into this yet but I heard these are good questions to solve? Are there any real ""tips"" for this? Do I upload these to GitHub and kinda show I can do these?
* **Github**: I kinda touched on this during INF43 but honestly I barely know much about this. Can I upload my school projects? Do I put the Leetcode and personal projects on here?  
**Books to read:** I remember seeing somewhere that there were a few good reads that'll help with interviews? I think one of them was *Cracking the Coding Interview* but I feel like there were others that I forgot about... I thought I saved whatever post it was somewhere but I couldn't pull it up again.
* **Prepping for an internship**: What things, besides reading those books and doing a personal project, could I do to get an edge on getting one? I understand the career fair and most apps are during fall quarter so I wanna get shit done over the summer.
* **Languages to Learn**: I currently know Python \(ICS 3x series\), C\+\+ \(ICS 45C &amp; 46\), and Java \(ICS 45J\) but not much else... I wanted to take that Flutter course offering by Google \(which is written in Dart?\) and maybe front\-end languages \(JavaScript, CSS, HTML\) but again I'm a little lost in terms of where I should be looking or investing into.

So first off I am a college student. I have an internship thing that I am going to be doing part time starting in June, but I need to be busy and work while I am not doing that.

For the last 3 summers, I have been working at a warehouse. I really enjoy being at that warehouse, I love the people there, and I seem to know it pretty well by this point. However, being in the warehouse very negatively affects my head. I am not sure how to really describe it. It is something physical, I do not know what exactly, but something about the warehouse (maybe the insane amounts of dust or other debris) messes with my head so much. I get these feelings where I feel like I am a zombie: not being able to focus on anything, missing large portions of conversation and feeling like I am not even physically present. Last year I noticed it and suffered greatly but I thought it was a concussion. However, from my 3 days there so far, I have again been having these feelings. I cannot work there if I feel like I have been feeling, as it has made my life terrible the last few days.

So, as a rising junior in college studying computer science, what other options do I have for a part time job? Of course, I could apply to food establishments if I desperately need something, but is there something better for me? I was thinking some sort of IT, but I am not entirely sure if places hire for such a small amount of time.

Any advice is greatly appreciated :)"

I graduated with a BE in Biomedical Engineering in Dec, 2016. Personally felt that degree was a complete fraud, which was confirmed when I failed to land any related positions up until this day. It was a lot of dissapointments and heartbreaks in a difficult period of my life.

So, I got accepted into a masters program for EE in City College, NYC. I'm really determined to do it right this time. Can someone here guide me a little on what the different specializations really are and what I should be focusing on? In case the question is vague, I'm happy to elaborate more.

EDIT:  So, these are the ones offered in my University:

Computer Engineering, Systems Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering, Photonics Engineering, Electronics/Communication. I'm considering all other than computer engineering.

I'm wary of systems engineering as that track only offers 10 classes and sounds like an amalgam of different engineering fields \(mechanical etc.\) which smells like the all\-over\-the\-place curriculum that was Biomedical Engineering.

Basically, at this point, I will prefer to do whatever lands me the best chance of landing a job or a valuable internship that can lead to a job. I'm not someone who grew up experimenting with electrical systems and always wanted to be an engineer, so my goals are not as clear cut. I'd like to just have the best chance of landing an employment and go from there."

I'm going to start in a few months but until then I want to see if there's any way I can match the salary trajectory of folks that start out of undergrad at the other top companies (with their hefty signing and yearly cash bonuses) without staying for several years and waiting for the company to hit $2T (lol). 

1) if I somehow get into Big2/3 within 6 months, I lose out on the 1st year signing because of the clawback and will likely have a resulting TC  that is only 20-30k higher, most likely in a different area leading to lease break costs. 

2) If I leave after the 1 year mark I don't have to worry about the clawback, but then I'd be on the start of the promo period for L5. Of course, this isn't guaranteed - this becomes easier if I just suck at my job - but I'd have to choose between wanting to leave on a lateral level or stay and increase TC by increasing on a vertical level. The problem is, I'd probably hit the lower band of the next level anyway and make about as much as I would moving externally. THEN, if I DID move externally, I'd have to start the process all over again, so I'd be at the same level for 3 years instead of 1.5/2 (I basically lose a year of earning trust and learning the company). 

3) OR, I quit after 1 year/6 months, do a grad program (spending 2-6 years in school for an MS/PhD, with whatever living and potential tuition costs if I do an unpaid MS) and then apply (and hopefully get with more interview experience) for more Big2/3 internships. Then I'd lose out on 2-6 years of earning full pay, but I'd start at a higher salary and possibly a higher level which could even things out to work on more interesting projects perhaps?

When he asked me, What were my interests, I said Linux, Networks, CG. He asked me ""Like what in networks?"", And I just couldn't answer this! I don't know what exactly I should have responded with as an answer to this question. 

In past 2 years, I have learned quite a few things. Currently, I host half a dozen APIs on Mashape, Bunch of forums, freelancing and I also started a company(which has 6k+ paying users as of 6 months ago) with my friend(I left this company 6 months ago because he started pivoting towards Blockchain, I have no interest in blockchain).


Despite all this, I still feel like all I have done is touch the surface of a dozen different things and I have no practically useful knowledge that other people who have worked on 2-3 things for the last 3 years. 

I asked the engineer who was offering me internship when is the interview, And he just replied with, ""I have been reading your messages in Groups(The Linux/DevOps/Go/General Programming groups). I believe you can do the project, I don't need to take your interview"". 


Problem with saying Yes to the internship are, 

1. I started learning ML very recently, I only know about regression right now. And Yes, I get the whole ""You need the learner mindset to move 
forward in life"", But I have read quite a few blog posts on things like LSTM and RNNs and they seem complicated. Going from knowing nothing to writing RNN and LSTM and working on a LIVE project in 2 months sounds like a stupendously difficult challenge to me.  

2. I never had any counsel and no one to point me in a direction. I didn't want to be stuck with 1 thing for the rest of my life, So, For the first 2 years, I explored Web development(JS/React/redux/mobx/Node etc), Computer Networks(Implemented some simple protocols like UDT/TFTP, Read books and made bunch of networks related projects) and tried my hands on Go/Rust/Haskell/Node/TS/Python. I have grown to love Computer Networks and CG. I also want to learn Machine Learning because I can do interesting things with it but I have not yet made any significant progress on that front.

3. I have a severe Anxiety problem. I am an introvert and I have been living alone for past 5 years(Since High school) and it's very difficult for me to adjust to a place where I don't know anyone! This is one big hurdle for me. 

4. Data analytics is not one of my interest. 

5. He trusts me so much and I am afraid I'll let him down. 

6. I want to spend time at home because it's comfortable and I get great food at home. 

7. My last concern is, I want to work on something I love! I have a project that I want to work on(It's miracast implementation for Linux). 
This project encompasses the tech I love, If I decline the internship, I will be working on this project. So, Technically, I am not wasting my team sitting at home and doing nothing.


There is only 1 of my friend who is doing an internship. He has been learning ML for quite some time and he has got an internship related to ML. 
I feel like I am far behind than everyone else.


I just don't know what I should do and I need help in deciding what I should do. 


Currently, My resume only consists of some projects, The company I started, More projects and that's about it. 

I have cleared 3rd year of a 4-year curriculum. Are internships really important? Should I (regardless of all the issues I have with this internship) work on it anyway? 

I didn't apply anywhere to get an internship. Currently, My plans for summer are(If I don't work on this internship),

1. Implementing a Wifi Direct driver for Linux(I have divided Miracast implementation project into 3 parts and this is one of them)

2. Learning ML by completing Andrew Ng's course and hopefully completing the first deeplearning.ai course. 

3. Completing the Discrete optimization course. 


I am not trying to slack off and skip the hard work, The biggest factors for not doing the internships are Anxiety and uninterest towards Data analytics but if it's super-duper important, I'll probably bite the bullet and go for it..."

I graduated with just above a 3.0 GPA. I have had two other internships related to energy efficiency.

For the last 2.5 months, I have been interning 40 hours a week at a company because I was only taking one last class I needed to graduate. They have been paying me **$20** an hour to write firmware. It was an intern-to-hire position and they just offered me a full-time job. Their offer was a salary of **$45,000** with standard benefits. Initially I thought this low offer was just a negotiating tactic, but I have learned over the past week that this is not the case. They are not interested in negotiating.

Besides the low pay, the company has other poor attributes such as: mandatory 1 hour lunch, strict 8-5 work schedule (your managers and the CEO get an email each time you are not clocked in for exactly 9 hours or if you leave before 5PM/arrive past 8:05AM too often), and no remote work.

I have enough money to sustain me and my student loan payments for about  **3 months.**

How will accepting their offer affect my ability to get other better jobs? How will hiring managers look at my resume if I am applying to jobs so early after starting an engineering job?"

8o9f1c,2,2018-06-03,I need guidance on my setup,road__not__taken,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8o9f1c/i_need_guidance_on_my_setup/,"Hello, I just got started as an intern at a startup, and one of my first tasks is to setup the digitalocean server we just got for production as well as development and testing.

The server will be used to create a dashboard and to plot charts and other data visualization tools by using the data that sensor sends to the server every few minutes. 

I have no prior experience in web development at a production level and no prior experience in devops, and this requires both of them, I have searched around but I'm still doubtful whether this would be the best solution. Here are my concerns: 

* *Language:* I have chosen to to use python for web application.  Would Python would be the right choice, if not what else should I use ? 

* *Framework:* I'm yet to decide on the framework, Dash from Plotty seems to be what I'm looking for, is it fine to use this in production or should I restrict the choices to Django, Flask, and Pyramid ? 

* *Web Server:* I have been setting up uWSGI web server 
with Nginx as a reverse proxy. Is this preferred way to deploy python applications or should I be using something like Dokku ? 

* *Database:* Considering, there will be multiple sensors in the future all sending data every few minutes, what database should I choose which will scale to few 100 sensors. 
The data would be used for visualization and analytics. 
Would MySQL or PostgreSQL work for this or should I look into NOSQL database ? 

* *Control Version System:*  What revision control software should I be using ? 

This all has been overwhelming, It would be fine to just work on web app but setting up the production server and given the task to decide my own tools is been both exciting and stressful.

I want to make sure whatever I make or do can be useful to company in the future, they would like to move to cloud platform, if they get investors."

I'm currently an undergraduate student in my senior year from South Korea. My school isn't the top, but it's within top 3 in the country. As the title says, I have recently made a decision to pursue higher education (hopefully to the PhD level) and apply to graduate programs in the US, specializing in computer science. I mentioned my stats are below average, so here's what they look like:

&amp;nbsp;


**Major: BA in International Relations &amp; BS in Computer Science (double major)**

I always wanted to study computer science since high school, but got sidetracked and applied for international relations instead. After completing my military service (it's mandatory in Korea) mid-2015, I decided I'd pursue a double major in computer science. This was when I haven't touched anything remotely similar to math/science, and so I was basically expecting an uphill battle. The past year and a half have been extremely difficult (which would explain my GPA) but also extremely rewarding. I learned the hard way that it's not easy learning everything at the same pace over a year or two compared to those who have been in the ""math-y"" field since high school. Some graduate programs require a BS to apply, but when I contacted them to confirm most of them told me I'd still be able to apply with my rather unique degree, but I'd be at a disadvantage.

&amp;nbsp;

**GPA: 3.44-3.5 (4.0 scale)**

I wrote down this range because I currently have two semesters left to go, and if I calculate my cumulative GPA by the time I graduate I'll have a 3.44 realistically, and if I manage to do very well then my goal is to get a 3.5/4.0. Most of my courses in computer science I got a B or a B+ in, with a couple of A's. It's not a very good GPA, and it's one of my biggest concerns along with my lack of experience.

&amp;nbsp;

**Professional Experience: Almost none**

For the past year I've been interested in the technology behind the (in)famous Bitcoin known as blockchain and have been working in a place called Bitcoin Center Korea for the past year. It's more like a community center that aims to educate and help more people on what cryptocurrency is and how the technology works. We also do some individual or team research/studying on new tech in the field, although I'd say it's far from professional research done in laboratory environments.

&amp;nbsp;

**Research Experience: None**

Well...yeah not much to say about this one. One thing that I regret is that last semester when I did well for my Information Security class, the TA emailed me regarding a recruiting notice for undergrad lab interns. I didn't take it because I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to grad school or not then. I still regret it to this day.

&amp;nbsp;

**GRE: N/A**

Haven't taken them yet, but I'm going to prepare for them over the summer and am aiming to get at least a 330-335.

&amp;nbsp;

**TOEFL: N/A**

Same as GRE, haven't taken it yet. I lived in the US from when I was born up until I was 13 years-old, and for the TOEFL exam I took a few years back I got a 118/120, so I'm not too worried about this.

&amp;nbsp;

This is the situation I'm in right now. I'd say that my stats are mediocre at best as of now. My field of interest specifically is cybersecurity (and its implications with future tech to be even more specific). I've been looking at the past admissions statistics that many schools post on their websites, and frankly it's a bit intimidating (some schools state that the average GPA for admitted students was 3.7-3.8/4.0), and it has gotten me feeling a bit inadequate. I'm not letting it stop me though, because this is something that I really want.

I'll be able to get some solid letters of recommendation from faculty members and past employers, and I'll also write a compelling statement of purpose. Is there any additional advice that you guys could give me?

Thank you."

So last summer I I finally took the plunge and built my first PC with all the knowledge i gained from this subreddit. 

But at that time, the prices of video cards were a bit inflated due to mining and I wasn’t gaming enough(or at all) to justify spending that kind of money on one. 

But this summer I landed an full time paid internship as a software developer while keeping my part time weekend gig and I’m finally ready to add a video card to my PC. 

I’ll be playing off a 4K TV mounted above my pc and was wondering which video card I should buy to help get the best experience.

Here are my specs

- i7 7700k
- Asus z270e gaming motherboard
- Samsung 250gb NVME m.2 ssd
- Western Digital Blue Caviar 1tb HD’s
- g.Skills 16GB 3200mhz DDR4(single stick not dual channel)
- EVGA 850w g3 power supply
- NZXT Kraken x62 AIO cooler(front mounted)
- NZXT Aer fans(140mm top, 120mm back)
- NZXT s340 elite case

Let me know what you guys think. Should I wait for the next gen video cards or pick up a 1080?"

8oa9p0,37,2018-06-03,The Devil in the Church’s Window,ExtraSocietal,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8oa9p0/the_devil_in_the_churchs_window/,"To be honest, I’ve never been a particularly motivated guy. Sure, I made it through High School alright. I never was in any advanced classes or anything but I didn’t really get held back either. When it came time to apply to University I sat around and watched as all my High School friends got in to their colleges of choice, or second choice, or third\-\-but me? I didn’t get into anything.

I fooled around going to the local community college for a while but eventually my parents started nagging me to pull my own weight around the house. You see, my family was never really all that well off and to be honest even if I had gotten into a University I wanted I don’t think we could have afforded even a semester. So yeah, I dropped out of the community college and got a job. For a while I took any odd job thrown at me. I delivered packages, I worked on a farm tending to animals, I even did a little construction work for a while but never could really hold anything stable.

Eventually I thought maybe getting closer to the big city near by might help me find a more desirable job. I’d avoided moving that way before because the cost of living was insane the closer you got to the city\-\-all those tech\-bros just kept running the rent through the ceiling. But there was one city within commuting distance which still had fairly affordable rent; if you were okay with the possibility of your place getting broken into and your car being stolen. I figured; “What the hell”? Not like I had anything worth stealing anyways, my most valuable possession was my last generation console with an outdated first person shooter game on it. I figured I could whether a few thefts so I took the plunge.

For a while, things were looking up; I had got a place near the big city, I had a pretty well paying and stable job at some hipster coffee joint in the city that seemed to think my rugged look was ‘on point’. I actually started to feel pretty comfortable. I actually had some sizable pocket change for once and\-\-to be honest\-\-I really didn’t know what the heck to do with it. That’s when I discovered the big city’s nightlife. I got so addicted to the clubs, the girls and the drinking that I practically went out each night. Between the cost of drinks, ride\-shares and late night binge\-eats I barely left room for rent and day\-to\-day expenses, but somehow I just scraped by every month.

“Jesus Sean, you look like shit,” Amy; my co worker took a drag from her cigarette looking me up and down with a mildly disgusted look on her face. We were taking a quick smoke break between the busy hours.

“I’ll be fine, just need another shot of espresso,” I said and gave a sheepish laugh. My voice was hoarse and felt all too dry. It was the telltale sign of another late night screaming “I love this fucking song” wasted out of my mind to some nameless girl on the dance floor.

“What’s up with you lately?” she asked. I sighed and took a deep drag of my own cigarette.

“You’re just barely on time to work, the circles under your eyes are so deep I could mistake you for a panda and you have this soulless stare when a customer comes up to order,” she continued.

“I thought the soulless stare was part of why they hired me. Isn’t it very ‘on point’,” I said. We both laughed.

“Yeah, I guess. But I’m serious man, you can’t live like this. It ain’t healthy,” she said.

“Oh, it *ain’t* huh?” I said mockingly. Amy wasn’t from the around here. She grew up in the midwest and moved all the way out here, leaving her family behind. She was following ‘the dream’ to come the ‘tech mecca’ and get a six\-digit salary making obnoxious apps for lazy people. Occasionally her midwestern slang would slip out and I’d tease her relentlessly.

She groaned and gave me a death stare, her thick black eyeliner made it especially intimidating. I decided to change the subject.

“So, are you still taking that coding thingamajigger?” I asked.

“Hack Academy? Hell yeah” she exclaimed. She balled her fist and shook it in a triumphant gesture causing a few strands of her purple dyed hair to fall into her face. “I’m almost done, then I’ll be outta this job” she said. She did a quick glance around to be sure no one else heard her then gave me a knowing smile.

“Good for you,” I said. I threw my cigarette butt down onto the ground and stomped it out before heading back towards the shop to resume my shift.

“Hey, you could like, not litter you know?” she said.

“Yeah, or I could just wait for you to come up with some app to get people to cleanup my cigarette butts for me.” I turned and walked away lifting my hand in a lazy wave.

“Asshole,” she said, barely audibly. I glanced back and saw her bending over to pick up the butt I’d left on the ground. She was such a goody\-goody sometimes.

I went back to the shop, it was my turn on the espresso machine so I zoned out and got into a rhythm of making coffee until the day ended.

Amy was locking up tonight so I headed out and started on my commute home. My commute consisted of a short subway ride and about a twenty minute walk back to my place every day. I actually enjoyed the walk and the ride because they felt like a break from the everyday grind.

A few minutes into my walk home from the subway I’d pass a giant church with seemingly entirely of wood and glass. During the daytime it wasn’t particularly special but during the night they would light up the interior causing the pattern on the glass window to shine through dramatically. On my way home from work I’d stare at it regularly, absentmindedly. But this evening while I was looking at it I felt a chill down my spine. The image was always a little fuzzy and hard to make out but what had once seemed to me surely to be Jesus with his halo suddenly looked twisted and wrong. I stopped walking down the street and stared at the image. What had once been a halo around Jesus’s head looked unmistakably like rams horns curling off either side of his skull. What had once looked like a serine smile now looked like a twisted snarl. His hand once a formed into a blessing now looked like a claw reaching out to me.

I stared at the depiction on the church’s window it didn’t change. I closed my eyes and rubbed them furiously and looked again. It still looked wrong.

“What’s going on...” I muttered under my breath while staring up at the church from across the street.

I was broken from my trance when a woman squeezed past me on the sidewalk avoiding me like I was an unkempt hobo shouting about lizard people. I shook my head and realized how crazy I must look. *Okay, I’m going home and going straight to bed*. I hurried past the church glancing at the image a few more times hoping it would return to its old image but it remained haunting and twisted.

“I’m gonna go have a smoke, you want in?” I looked to Amy who was just wrapping up cleaning the espresso machine.

“Yeah,” she said.

“Steve, you mind holding the fort?” I asked to our other co\-worker Steve.

“Yeah, sure, I’ll stay at the register. While you guys go ruin your lungs. Alone. Again,” he said with malice.

“Thanks bud” I said, patting him on the shoulder. He gave me a cold glance and watched as we walked out of the shop into the alley out back.

“Steve’s a real charmer huh?” I said to Amy once we’d got out back. Amy gave me one of her signature glares.

“You should just be glad he doesn’t report us for taking so many smoke breaks, Sean,” Amy said. I looked up into the sky, it was a little overcast, people didn’t have much coffee on days like this\-\-it’d be a light day of work.

“Yeah, I guess.” We smoked in silence for a few minutes. “Hey, you know that church that’s over near where I live?” I asked, breaking the silence.

“Which one?”

“The one that’s practically all glass. The one near the lake.”

“I know of it.”

“Have you ever seen that image that shows on the glass at night.”

“Yeah,” she said taking a drag, “what of it?”

“Did anything seem...” I paused as I searched for words, “off to you?”

“Off how?”

“Never mind, it’s stupid.”

Amy eyed me suspiciously; she wasn’t one to leave good enough alone. “Spit it out Sean.”

“Last night when I was looking at it, it like, morphed or something. It turned into some ram headed creature full satanic shit man.”

Amy started to laugh immediately. “Come on Sean. You’ve been partying a little *too* hard if you think I’m gonna believe that cliche ass story.”

“I’m serious Amy, that’s what I saw. Clear as day.”

Amy tilted her head and looked piercingly at my eyes. “You’re really not jokin’ are ya’?”

“I’m not.”

Amy looked at me, frustration in her eyes. “You seriously need to take a damn break from all this wild life shit Sean. It’s fucking with your head.”

“I guess.”

We finished our cigarettes in an uncomfortable silence, neither of us knowing what else to say. I spent my entire shift thinking about that damn image at the church. I just couldn’t stop seeing it’s evil snarl burned into the back of my eyelids.

It was my night to close down so I was leaving later than usual. I decided I needed a distraction, I was going out tonight. I went straight to the club after work. It was a Wednesday night so the crowd was pretty lame so I just ended up getting shit\-faced and hitting on any girl with two legs. Eventually 2am rolled around and the club emptied. As I stepped outside of the hot and steamy club the cold night air felt like a slap in the face making me nakedly aware of my own drunkness. I looked around at all the other partiers stumbling around and laughed a little. This was such a familiar scene to me by now it almost felt like home.

Then I noticed her. A girl in a pure white gown, blonde hair and piercing pale blue eyes stood at the edge of the sidewalk in front of the club’s entrance. She was staring directly at me, no emotion on her face. I looked around me wondering if maybe she saw someone she knew or someone was doing something weird behind me but all the club\-goers had emptied out and I was the only one standing there. She was staring. At. Me. *What the fuck?*

I strode up to her full of drunken bravado. “Do I know you?” I asked in what seemed like a very imposing tone. The woman stared at me with her eyes wide and emotionless and said nothing. After a few long seconds of silence\-\-without breaking eye contact\-\-she reached a hand into the sleeve of her robe and pulled out a small white object that looked a little like a credit card and extended it out to me.

I stared at it for a moment and then took it from her. I looked down at the card. It was pure white, solid like some kind of hard plastic, or maybe... glass. In pure solid black lettering it read ‘Cathedral of Light’. “You’re from that church\-” I started to ask but as I looked up from the card the girl was gone. *What in the world.* I looked back at the card and flipped it over. The backside read, “3:00AM \- Holy Repentance Service,” in the same imposing font. I glanced around and noticed some other drunken club goers were being ushered away by the club owners and decided it was my queue to go home. I slipped the card into my wallet and stumbled back to my apartment.

The alarm on my phone beeped incessantly in my ear as I struggled to keep my eyes open long enough to enter my passcode to turn it off. I groaned as I crawled out of bed and downed some water before hurrying to get clothed and off to work. I showed up to work just barely put together but on time. Amy was just opening the doors as I came. She shot a concerned glance at me as I walked up.

“Hey, Sean, I want to talk to you about something at our break today, okay?” She said.

“Of course,” I said, “so serious all of a sudden,” I laughed.

Amy shot me a look that said ‘I mean business’ and continued setting up the shop for the day’s work.

When break finally came around Amy and I went to our usual spot and I lit up. Amy did not.

“So I went to that church you were talking about last night.”

My cigarette practically fell out of my mouth. “No shit?” I said in shock. “Why would you do that?”

“I don’t know, something about the way you told me about that just made me feel like I had to know.”

“So, did you see it?”

“No. Well, yes. Not at first.” She looked visibly shaken speaking about it.

“Whoa Amy I’ve never seen you like this. You really saw it didn’t you?”

Amy nodded.

“Well, at least I know I’m not crazy,” I said.

Amy laughed weakly. “I was staring at it and I just saw the same old Jesus figure I remembered then suddenly it started to shift, just like you said.” She shook her head side to side. “The horns, claw, and all it was a strait up demonic image.”

“Right?” I said. “I still can’t get the image out of my head!”

“Yeah, it’s almost like it burrowed in there.”

Suddenly last night’s events came flooding back to me in bits and pieces and I remembered the card. I desperately pulled out my wallet and searched it for the card. There it was, right were I’d put it last night. Still ominous and pristine as the night before. Amy noticed and came closer to take a look.

“What’s that?”

“Get this, some girl from the church handed it to me outside of the club I was at last night.”

“What, like she was flyering or something?”

I handed her the card to take a look at. “She was like in this full white robe like something out of the eighteen\-hundreds or something and she just stared at me until I took the card.”

“What’s this on the back of the card?”

“Beats me. Some kind of event for their werido religion?”

“This is some creepy stuff man.” Amy handed the card back to me and we stood in silence for a moment. “Wanna go check it out?” she said, breaking the silence.

“You know that is literally the worst idea possible right?”

“Yeah, but I already can’t stop thinking of this place since last night. You know how it is, I just gotta figure what all this is.”

I’m ashamed to say that I straight up bailed. I know I probably should have had her back, or talked her out of going but all I could think about at that moment was not wanting to have more to deal with. I guess old habits die hard. “You can go by yourself Amy, I’m not interested,” I said coldly.

She scoffed at me and walked off back towards the shop.

“Amy, I didn’t\-” I stopped as she stuck her hand back and gave me a middle finger without stopping. “Whatever,” I grumbled to myself and lit up my cigarette before returning to work. Amy wouldn’t talk to me the rest of the day and even Steve seemed to be sensing something was up as he kept glancing between the two of us. Amy left early and Steve and I were cleaning up before he had to close the place down.

“Lover’s quarrel?” Steve asked.

I laughed. “Who knows what goes on in that girls mind,” I said apathetically. Steve and I finished up and I headed home.

I laid in bed for hours but I couldn’t sleep. I saw the creature in the church glass, the girl in all white, and Amy’s cold stare. “Fuuuck!” I shouted in frustration. I glanced at the clock: 3:15AM. I punched the bed in frustration and got up, hurriedly getting dressed. The church was about a 10 minute walk from my apartment, maybe a little less if I speed walked, but I was practically sprinting. My chest was pounding and something just felt wrong, a primal feeling of worry, something you just know but can’t understand.

When I finally arrived at the church the creature in the glass was illuminated and towered above me. I tried not to focus on it as I circled the building looking for Amy. Before I could find her I found a large double door, slightly ajar. A faint light seeped from inside the building into the darkness of the night. I slowly peeked inside.

The building was dimly lit inside except the glass wall where the figure was illuminated. Candles lined a walkway leading to a pedestal with a spotlight shining on a book. Something about the book drew me to it. Maybe it was just a natural instinct to approach light in a dark room, maybe it was the mystery, maybe it was something else but I couldn’t fight the urge to approach it. When I reached it I saw that the book was in a language unlike anything I’d ever seen before. In the candle light the words seemed to shift and writhe on the page like snakes in a pit. On one page a drawing depicted a dagger dripping with some liquid. I flipped through the pages frantically each page filled with that strange language and more and more disturbing imagery.

A loud clicking sound ignited my heart and made me spin around to look at the source. A long laborious squeak sounded as a door opened slowly behind me, seemingly on its own. “Hello?” I said. I meant for it to sound strong but instead it sounded meek and timid. “Amy?”

Nothing responded. I walked to the door, I could feel my body shaking, I was terrified. As I approached the door I could hear a dull tone, almost like... chanting. I pushed the door open to reveal a spiral staircase, dimly lit but with a stronger light flickering down below. I methodically walked down the staircase and the chanting grew louder and clearer with each step. As I approached the bottom of the staircase I could clearly hear the chanting though I had no idea what language it was in.

The first thing I saw when I made it to the bottom of the staircase was Amy. She hung in the center of a room, her hands were tied on either side of a large wooden cross, her legs tied to the bottom. She was gagged, and completely naked. Her eyes shot open in a mixture of fear and hope as she saw me and our eyes locked. I quickly scanned the room. Hooded figures in orange, their faces obscured surrounded Amy. Several girls like the one I’d seen before\-\-only now they wore no white robes\-\-danced, spinning and jumping in jerky stilted motions around Amy. The hooded men chanted methodically in the otherworldly language. The chanting filled the room with a cacophony of deep booms and piercing hisses.

I started to speak. The chanting stopped. All the girls in unison stopped dancing in mid\-motion and turned; staring at me.

“A\-Amy,” I barely manage a squeak, paralyzed with fear. I stepped into the doorway. “Repent and be reborn,” they all chanted at once. I don’t think they were speaking english but suddenly I could understand the words.

“I\-I...” I tried to speak.

“Repent and be reborn,” they repeated. “Repent and be reborn.”

It was then that I noticed the ornate dagger lying on a pedestal next to the cross where Amy was tied. Once I’d seen it a flood of visions entered my mind. I saw myself the head of an empire. I saw possessions beyond anything I’d ever dreamed. People respected and aspired to be like me. Clearly none of it had happened but they felt like memories. Memories of the future. Then, suddenly my purpose was clear. For the first time in my life I was intensely motivated and I knew exactly what I had to do.

“Repent and be reborn,” they said.

I walked towards Amy, she looked at me with hope in her eyes.

“Repent and be reborn,” they repeated.

I reached Amy and tears streamed from her eyes, her thick black eyeliner streaming as she stared into my cold eyes.

“Repent and be reborn.”

“Repent and be reborn,” I said as I grabbed the dagger and shoved it into Amy’s chest in one swift movement. She screamed violently even through the gag as her eyes faded and the life flooded from them.

“The ambitious fall,” the voices said in unison. “The strong shall rule,” they continued. I stared at the blood on my hands as the people around me slowly walked towards me in unison.

It’s been ten years since Amy disappeared. After the disagreement we’d had in front of Steve, he suspected me, but after they found a note in Amy’s apartment claiming that she just couldn’t take the pressure anymore after failing to finish her Hack Academy degree the police dropped the case as a textbook case of burnout.

I’m a successful CEO now. I was able to come up with a highly successful social media website despite my relative lack of knowledge and use that fortune to build several other successful apps on that platform. I never worry about money any more. Sometimes I check up on my old High School friends just to laugh about what their University degrees have gotten them. It’s an amazing world we live in where a relative nobody can become a world name just by creating a simple website. Just by having the motivation to do what it takes.

Thankfully, the high pressure environment in the my tech bubble means no one worries when every few years the ambitious new intern just stops showing up to work one day."

I'm really excited as the job is a really great opportunity. During my interview with one of the executive directors who will be overseeing my team, he specifically mentioned that with each intern, they leave open a full time position at the conclusion of the internship. I know this is not a given thing and that I will have to work hard and prove myself to get a full time offer.

This is my first job as a software engineer, and my first job in a corporate setting in my field of study, so it is all pretty new to me. I start next week, and would love to hit the ground running. If you have any advice on what I can do to help my chances of getting a full time offer it would be much appreciated."

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but anyway.

I am 28 years old.  I have a job interview tomorrow for Test Engineer position\( more on EE side\), but there are a lot of concerns that impact not only the interviews but also in everyday life.

**Experience and Schoolwork, History:**

I graduated with an BSEE. I only have a couple of school projects. I never had internships and the reason is that I was taking summer classes for making up courses that I fail and courses that I'm required to take to graduate on time. I worked with my friend on the startup after I graduated. In the startup, because the money wasn't there I learned Android, Node.js, and AWS on my own to setup frontend and backend. I wasn't able to begin a project due to not finding investment, so I left. I worked as a QA analyst. It is a contracting position. Then I was let go due to contract reasons. Now I am currently looking for work and doing Uber \(part time\). I now have a year of unemployment gap. If anyone is interested in looking at my updated resume. Please let me know.

**Problems I'm facing now:**

Finding a job is hard, but having difficulty of articulating thoughts/experiences to an interviewer makes it even harder.

I have a learning disability when it comes to expressive and receptive language all my life. Due to my limitations of vocabulary usage, I take more time to process and understand things. I also sometimes have trouble remembering the tasks that i was told to do. For example, I instantly forgot what I have been told.  I have to record my phone calls and I have to rewind them many times to make I understand them.  

Does anyone have any suggestions for my situation when it comes to job interview?  I was told by my therapist that I do need to go back to elementary level to catch up with what Adults have.

Thanks"
8obsjo,13,2018-06-03,Pentesting internship interview questions?,DerpStar7,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/8obsjo/pentesting_internship_interview_questions/,"Hi all, 
I'm interviewing tomorrow, and I would like to know what kind of questions are usually asked during a first level technical interview (I passed the HR round a week back). Will the questions be more conceptual (think Dan Miessler) or about pentesting tools and scenarios? I'm nervous because I've taken the OSCP  and didn't pass around 8 months ago, which I think will impede my chances. Are interviewers generally more concerned with your existing knowledge or are they a bit more forgiving for internship positions? Thanks all!  

UPDATE: I ended up getting the internship! Thank you guys very much for your input; for my interview, the questions were a mix of how I tackled my OSCP boxes and technical knowledge. For the latter, /u/subsonic68 's GitHub link was invaluable. I can't stress how comprehensive it is, and is 100% worth your time to go through. In general, all of the comments are very useful in concepts that you'd want to brush up on. 
I hope this thread is useful for other internship seekers, and if you'd like to know more about my interview, please feel free to PM me or comment :) Again, thanks a lot you guys, I hope to learn a lot from my experience and share it back with the community!"

8oc8fa,14,2018-06-03,"Reverse chance me, please. I am a rising senior, my school has no counselor, and I have a whole summer. What do I do? I am looking for direction.",isConvention,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8oc8fa/reverse_chance_me_please_i_am_a_rising_senior_my/,"**INTRODUCTION** My summer has ended two weeks ago because I live in Arizona and I have woken up to the smell of regret. The school I attend is small, 27 kids in my grade, and it offers no AP classes. They convinced my parents and sadly me that colleges these days don't care about AP and that honors “does the job”. What fools, we were. 

**BACKGROUND** A little background about me, I am a well-endowed white male, rising Senior, with relatively shitty grades and relatively shitty test scores. I have spent several hours yesterday and today scrolling through this subreddit and I realized how much of a idiot I have been these past few years. I see how many of you overcome your troubles and have to fight tooth and nail for scholarships, meanwhile I sit around like the lazy-assed idiot I am and watch movies. To further explain to you that fool I am, I want to get into a highly competitive degree, film. I always have been interested in film and I have spent most of my life probably watching movies. While everyone else has good grades and good test scores, I neglected homework and studying, focusing on finishing some obscure Portuguese director’s filmography. I don’t ask for pity, I have myself for that but I do ask for help.

---

**GPA** Two weeks in and my school still hasn't posted my grades yet, but honestly I can probably estimate my grades. My GPA will pretty much be a *3.5*. The first semester of my freshman year, I got a 3.5 then a 3.0 with two C’s (one in Science and one in Spanish). The next year I got up to a ~3.8 then a ~3.6 following semester (both ballparks). The subsequent year, I got a 3.5 the first semester and I probably got a 3.5 again with a C in Pre-Calc and a B in Spanish. Currently, my parents are advising me to retake my possible three C’s to make my transcript look better. Most good film programs require a 3.7 to 3.8, I have a dismal 3.5. Can I hope my supplements will be good enough?



**HONORS** About honors, I took as many honors as I could. First year - two honors. Second year - four honors. Junior year - all honors. I also took our dual enrollment program via the local community college which was available our junior year; I took dual enrollment Biology, Pre-Calc, US Lit, and US History. Does no AP classes royally screw me or was my school somewhat right?


**SAT** My SAT is a *1230* (English/640 | Math/590). My essay got a 12 (Reading/3 | Analyzing/3 | Writing/6). I have not taken the ACT yet, should I plan to take it? I do plan to retake the SAT though. Looking at my schools, I need to rise my grade 100 - 200 pts. Is that possible in one summer of studying?


**ECs** As for ECs, I did Model UN for three years and I plan to do it for another. My third year, I got recognized as a distinguished diplomat in the closing speech. I got no awards but a shoutout saying that I should of received an award-- if that counts as anything. I did computer club for two years, but that got disbanded. My sophomore year, I joined DND club and led the club the next year if that counts. I plan to lead it next year again. Furthermore in my sophomore year, I started up a film club at lunch and in my junior year, it turned into a class. I had to leave the class the second semester because kids only wanted to learn from me and not the teacher; the teacher asked me to stop being a bad influence which I told them I was not and he asked me then if I could leave to help him out, I saw where he was coming from and I regretfully left. Oh do, I regret leaving because how can I explain that on my app?

**INTERNSHIPs** I never had a job because I was extremely lazy but my school is forcing us to get an unpaid internship next year if we want to graduate with an honors diploma, so I have been meeting with all the local film studios near me. Every single one so far have told me that though they do appreciate my passion for film, they only offer internships for students in college. They told me to keep them as contacts, which I did but none of them can find a studio that takes high school students. I am still looking this summer. Does anyone know some places (Phoenix/Scottsdale area) where I could get an unpaid internship in the video production industry for 100 hours? Also, if I do get a good or at least decent internship, will that be enough for ECs or do I need more? Finally is not having a job or not participating in NHS going to seriously harm me?


**RECs** For recommendation letters, I plan to get one from my 2nd/3rd year english teacher. He writes emails, once a month, to my parents about how I am such a great student and in a few, he has mentioned seeing my love for cinema in class. Also, he already has written me one for Chapman’s summer film program where they denied me but I will still try to get in the school! Regarding getting additional recs, I possibly plan on getting one from the person who I intern for but I know that is not always a possibility, so I am thinking between the teacher teaching the film class and or my next English teacher who also led the Model UN club-- she and I are close.


**ESSAYs** Taking the advice of people on this subreddit, I will start writing my essays this summer.

---

**MY GOAL** Some schools I am looking at are USC, UCLA, Chapman University, UNSCA, Wesleyan, NYU, Emerson, UT Austin, and Cal Arts-- but all of these are extreme reaches for me. My GPA, my EC, my SAT all are not satisfactory for them. I am destined to be rejected, but I will still try. I am playing the lottery after all. But after a long fight with my laziness and lack of regard for the outside world, I think I am in a better place and I finally feel awake enough to do something about my situation. I am ready, I just hope it is not too late. What are some good safeties? What are some matches? Is there any chance for me?"
8ocafk,12,2018-06-03,[rant] My mother is a bully ...,KindChipmunk,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8ocafk/rant_my_mother_is_a_bully/,"Heads up, just got into an argument with her.

I've been raised in a typical traditionnal asian household and I'm starting to realise how toxic this can be (at least in the country I grew up in and live in, France).
I've come to despise every aspect of it (especially since my last argument with my mother).

1) I've been raised to respect the elders. Good thing you might say, right ? Well, except when it becomes unreasonnable and turn into an excuse for everything. See there, I'm 22 and do not pretend to know all about life and such, but for my mother it is a reason for me to know less than her about EVERYTHING. 
Before I start telling this story, you have to know that my mother doesn't (or barely) speak French and doesn't know how to use a computer. She was looking for some stuff for the home and ask my dad to look for it. He did and sent me an amazon link so that I could buy it (I'm prime and all ...). Considering how they taught me to always save money (I've been yelled at for using too much ketchup -and we're not even that poor- ), and realizing how bad of a deal it was (cardboxes for over 60€), I told her it was way too expensive for what it was. She started yelling at me for how disrespectful I was, how greedy I was to her, and started ranting about how other kids buy ticket plane for their parents. 

But today was the last straw (she talks about how other parents are lucky every day), so I went on also and told her that she doesn't even know what she's talking about, she doesn't even know how to read the product informations nor to use the computer. And then she completely went berserk, saying how ungrateful of a kid I was, not even willing to spend money for their parents and if she would know beforehand, she would have had an abortion (when I've come to think about it, it's such a violent thing to say to your child, but I'm not even bothered by that anymore, seeing how often she tells me that). I then thaught of explaining it to her clearly, thinking she didn't understood and told her that she could get the same kind of product for way less, or better quality product for the same price. Hell no. She wasn't willing to hear me (She seriously put her hands over her ears) and ask my father to say something.
My father who witnessed all of this, backed me up saying I was right about the deal (I didn't knew back then, but he already told her about how bad of a deal it was and actually argued with her about that earlier. He still sent me the link because he often gives up in arguments with her). She then started yelling at him, saying all these years she never asked for much and doesn't spend much, and started demonizing us for not letting her buy anything. Maybe I shouldn't have but I kinda mocked her saying noone is preventing her to buy anything, her own inability to use the computer is, and left because I was so sick of how she always shows herself as a victim.


2) Since I'm at it, I'll continue to rant about her. I find her to be a despicable person. She always talks shit about everyone in their back, here is a few examples: 

-her brother's wife, always deforming reality and also demonizing her, yet I find her to be a gentle person. She never dared talk back to my mother even though she had harsh words said to her face. Presumably because my mother is older and her brother ""married down""

-same thing about my dad's sister

-some of the ""friends"" she have

-some of the kids of her ""friend"", some of them being friends of mine too

-my cousins, my father, my sister and I

She complains about everyone, to everyone. Even when she has reasons too (and god know it doesn't happen often), she completely over-exagerate everything, and always putting herself as the victim.



3) She is a bully to her own kids and nieces and nephews. She always mocks each default, imperfections, bad life choices, physique, intellect we might have. And she always says it's for our own good. But that's completely stupid, some of this cannot even be changed. I seriously don't know if she knows how disturbing that can be (trust me, it's not your typical mockery). And for fuck safe, if you got to do that, keep it for your own child, not others. And also avoid telling **your own kid** he is a son of a bitch.



4) She has a way of boasting about me, but without giving me credit and always talking me down. See, I'm doing pretty good in school and she never misses on telling it to everybody to show how 'superior' she is to my cousins parents or her friends (""My son managed to enter that school, blablabla ...""). But mind you, she is not doing it as if she was proud of me, far from it. Of course, everytime she says that, she has to add that I'm a lazy fuck, always go out, never focused, ungrateful and irespectful kid ... And obviously, when we are on our own, I got the typical ""You're stupid, can't even be top of your class"". And don't even try to reason with her, she will give you that typical ""Why do you never compare yourself with that one older cousin of yours who is successful ...""   Side note, I did achieve more academic success than him a fear years later, and now she has to show off everytime we go see my aunt.


5) She is a hardcore believer in those spiritual thingy. Acupuncture, herbal medicine and such. She once tried to physically forced me to get acupuncture. AND THERE WASNT EVEN ANY REASONS FOR IT ! I wasn't sick or anything, she just had that doctor at home and wanted to save money. And I tried to challenge her thinking (not change, just challenge) about it, oppening up the possibilities that it doesn't work like regular medicine does. I even pulled the chinese wikipedia pages on the placebo effect, but the wouldn't read it and belittled me. 



6) She's a racist. TBH, I hesitated about posting this one. I'm ashamed to admit that this behavior of her did had effect on me when I was younger. She recently went to several of her friends kid wedding, and some of them married outside their race (a white and a hispanic if I recall correctly). Boy she talked about it for weeks. That was bad enough for her, but she always said that it could have been worst race-wise. And at least one of them were financially well off. She then started to rank origins of son-in-law and how money can uprank you a bit, with one of my aunt. Of course without forgetting to laugh at that one asian dude who had a more artistic job. 
I knew she was like that (she wouldn't open the door to people who aren't asian, would that be neighboor or delivery guy. I wasn't allow to be friends with non-asian kids), but being vocal about this, I was just shocked. I just don't understand how someone from a minority that has experienced a lot of racism first hand can be so hardcore into it.
For her, every bad stereotype is true for the vast majority, and exceptions are so rare that it's not even worth trying to know people from other races. And her racism also reach asian people. Koreans and japaneses are also monsters, south east asians are filthy asians, other chinese ""clans"" are also evil. 


I'm currently back at my parents house for my internship for geographical practicability but I can't wait to go back to my residential appartment to finish off my last uni year and get a job overseas. And seriously can't deal with this anymore. 
I'm mad at how I was raised, at her, at my dad who is passive about all of this and back her up in front of me, and yells at me when she tells him to. But dad, too bad I can hear you try to reason with her from my room, and how she hysterically accuse you to always back me up.
Apart from her being a socially distasteful person, I seriously wonder if she does love her kids. I definitely had stuff when I was a child, and my parents did provide so that I can have good academic education, but I do wonder if it's not just about investing on your child as if you would invest on a business. Everytime she has a reproach for me, it always goes down the path of ""my love for you was misplaced, all those sacrifices I made for you are pointless, I should have strangled you when you were a child or get an abortion"". But shouldn't love be unconditionnal, at least to some degree ? I seriously think of giving her back the exact sum of money she might have invested in me when I can, not a penny more, and just never talk to her again. 

Am I being white-washed and turning into a sensitive snowflake ? How normal does my mother stands in the asian moms scale ? 
Anyone feeling the same way ? "

I’m 22 and have had one internship before, and have received two Cyber Security internships for the summer of 2018.

One is with a Private Corporation in DC (I live here)

The other is with a branch of the federal government (also in DC)

Both pay $15 an hour, however the Feds are allowing me a full time 9-5 work schedule at 40 hours a week.

Private Corp caps me at 30 hours and its not even guaranteed that I reach 30 during the week. they also specify that I will receive *No Benefits* during my tenure as an intern. 

The internship with the federal government comes with some basic stuff but the big draw for me is that I’m all but guaranteed to get hired back on with the government once I graduate. 

Here’s my problem, I have received my final offer and starting date for the private corporation internship, it begins tomorrow.

The federal government internship has sent me a tentative offer with a starting date for June 11 (next week), however I am still waiting on the FINAL OFFER from the feds.

After reading a slew of horror stories over in r/hr And other random places around reddit, Iv’e learned that a tentative offer can be pulled for pretty much any reason and I shouldn’t consider the job mine unless my ass is in a chair in the building doing something (and apparently even THEN I need to be on my toes :P)

Question is, what would you do in my situation? In my mind the best course of action is to just go to the private corporation internship for now. When the final offer comes in from the Federal Government, I was going to inform them that I received a better offer, thank them for the time and opportunity to improve my skills, and be on my way.

If the Tentative offer falls through for whatever reason I can simply remain at the private corporation.

I know from a legal standpoint I can do this, but should I? I feel like I’d be making a mistake if I stuck with the private corporation out of loyalty"
8oddz7,40,2018-06-03,What are some tips for learning coding specifically for finance and data analysis?,Jakob2293,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/8oddz7/what_are_some_tips_for_learning_coding/,"Hello all,

I'll try to keep this brief. I am a recent college grad with a degree in finance. I missed the opportunity to leverage networking and internships while in school and have been having trouble landing a job in the analysis and equity research field.

My current goal is to learn code and start building algorithms and programs for analyzing large sums of data, which will hopefully make me a more competitive candidate for my target career. I've signed up for several Udemy courses on python and algorithmic trading, have been researching syntax, reading other programmer's code, and overall reading up on the basics of computer programming. I allocate at least 3\-4 hours a day towards studying and have been picking up the basics.

For those of you with similar experience; what resources, techniques, or methods helped you learn coding \(particularly python\)? What would you recommend for a 24 yr old with little prior coding knowledge but huge aspirations? I understand being able to fluently code takes hours of work, but I am committed and ready.

Any advice would help! Thank you!"

I am scared I won't find a job after graduating, and I cannot find anyone willing to take me on as an intern. Every time I apply they ask me about my past experience and previous internships I've had. Like, that's why I am here because I have not had an internship and I need to start somewhere, but apparently that doesn't apply anymore. 
So I guess what I am asking is how would you recommend I go about finding an internship, specifically in the Engineering field. I am graduating next year and I am hoping to be able to make up for lost time in this year. "
8odeud,1,2018-06-03,When should I ask for equity?,CSCQuestions121,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8odeud/when_should_i_ask_for_equity/,"I've been at this startup-like SAAS place for about 7 months now. There are technically five employees at the company: owner, team leader / manager, and three devs. However, we share the office with another of the owner's business whom we support. Normally, I would ask for a raise about now given the following:

* I was able to switch to front-end work when our previous front-end developer left. We hired a new guy, but between ramp-up and an increased demand for front-end work, my flexibility helped us hit key deliverable dates.  

* I have been responsible for assigning work to our new intern and managing him. So far, I think we have been able to make better-than-expected progress and I've shown that I'm able to take on additional management-like responsibilities.

That being said, the headhunters who got me into this place mentioned equity briefly, but it never came up again. Now that we are starting to make some bigger sales, I think now would be the time to get on board before the chance is lost. Is this the right move? How much should I ask for? I know they need me, so I have some leverage, but I also don't want to overplay my hand. If the company ends up with a 40 million valuation, a 3% stake looks really nice, but can I get that much? Can I get 5%? What is reasonable?"

They are fairly compensated for their work and are expected to contribute at a level similar to junior engineers. A lot of full time employees (yours truly including) were former interns. Traditional areas were electrical and mechanical engineering. 

Since we have formed a dedicated data science team (myself and another employee) we have started to look for students with relevant skills to assist us in our day to day tasks. I was expecting a lot of resumes. I got tons. What I wasn’t expecting is lack of even remotely relevant skills/experiences/projects in the data science or analytics area that we could use. I have gone ahead and interviewed a few candidates that seemed like a lesser evil. Nothing. I got blank stares event to the simplest of questions. This sets a certain level of expectations, if a person could not be bothered to do even the simplest homework before the interview (like look up what is cross-validation and why it is used) then what kind of employee is he going to be in a position that requires constant learning?

This brings me to my question. In your opinion, what is a lesser evil, getting someone who is sub-par (although I admit that the interview is not the best predictor but given a lack of any other information...) or not getting any one at all?"

8oeps0,7,2018-06-04,Older brother planning to commit suicide,throwawaysuicidalbro,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8oeps0/older_brother_planning_to_commit_suicide/,"Apologies ahead of time for this being overly long, rambling and vague. My head's in a bit of a jumble right now.

Some backstory first. I'm a 21 year old Canadian of Pakistani descent. I live at home with my eldest brother, and currently my mom and one of my older sisters. My father lives and works in the Middle East, and my mother goes to live with him for a few months every year. I have another sister who's divorced and raising two kids in a town an hour away, and another older brother who this post is about.

My brother is 24 years old. He completed his Bachelors degree last year \(after needing a couple of extra years due to academic troubles\) but was unable to find work in Canada afterwards. He got an internship in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, in the fall, and currently lives there with my uncle and his family.

I've known that he's been unhappy since he went there, which surprised me because he always loved going to Pakistan, especially Karachi, and has old friends there as well. As I understand it, there's been some ongoing tension between him and my uncle \(the one he's living with\), but the specific details are unknown to me.

Last night I heard my older sister \(not the one with kids\) crying while on the phone with him. I figured they were having an argument and left them to it. About an hour later, I found my sister in the living room still talking to him. My mother was sitting next to her and writing stuff on a notepad, which my sister would occasionally glance at when prompted. I realized I should remain silent, and gestured to her to inquire what was going on. My mom scribbled something on the notepad, and passed it over to me. It said ""suicide"" in my language.

I decided to stick around and listen until the call ended, and then talked to my mom and sister. Apparently my brother had let slip to a friend of his here in Canada that he was going to kill himself very soon. That friend told my sister, who asked my brother about it. He denied it at first, before eventually coming clean. He intends to do it this month, even though he'd prefer not to since ""June is a bad month"". He's planning on getting a gun \(pretty easy to acquire in a city like Karachi\) and shooting himself. My sister asked him to wait until the end of the month, when her Masters degree will be complete and she can come visit him. My brother refused, so my sister said she was getting on the first plane to Pakistan. She asked my brother for help with the booking, but my brother kept on refusing and saying that he didn't want her to come as there was no point and she couldn't change his mind. As far as he knows, she's the only person in the family aware of his plan. Whenever my sister asked him to think of how devastated everyone would be if he killed himself, he'd just say that we'd get over it eventually. He wants his savings given to one of his friends after he's gone.

Fast forward a few hours, and my sister's on the phone with my brother again. This time it was a normal call, with my mom \(who pretended not to know anything and acted casual\) and my other brother \(who actually doesn't know anything\) chatting with him. I briefly talked to him as well and asked him when he was coming home to visit. There was a pause, and then he said he'd be coming back in July. When he said that, I suddenly found myself getting emotional for some reason, said goodbye and left the room. My brother's always been an expressive/exuberant guy, but he had this weird flat affect in his voice. He'd sounded like that earlier as well in the private call to my sister. My sister's plane took off about 10 hours ago. She's about halfway there I think.

Me and my mom are just discussing the whole situation in snippets when my other brother isn't around. We're keeping it a secret from him, my dad and my other sister, as all three are liable to act rashly if they find out, which we think might lead to him making an early exit. While expectations/pressure in my family aren't as high as is \(stereo\)typical for immigrant families, my parents do of course want us kids to do well, and so far that isn't happening for any of us save for the sister who just left. We think my brother thinks of himself as a failure, and it doesn't help that my father apparently has responded harshly to my brother's suggestions of coming back to Canada, saying that ""he wasn't worthy yet"". This btw was on a Skype call with my uncle and his family in earshot. My brother's always been much closer to my dad than he is to my mom, and takes everything he says to heart. He also has a lot of built up resentment against a lot of people in my family, which comes out during fights/arguments. I dunno if this is relevant, but he's very obsessive about certain rituals he performs \(shutting doors a certain number of times, angling random objects\), which I've always thought of as just an odd quirk, but he once vaguely suggested that it was a a big problem for him. Sounds like OCD in my uneducated opinion, but obviously I don't know for sure. My brother's always been very melodramatic, but his flat affect and matter of fact manner throughout these talks has us convinced he's serious.

Lastly, being Muslims \(as most Pakistanis are\), we're not just worried about him killing himself, but also about his ""soul"". In Islamic belief, killing oneself is basically booking a one way ticket to hell. I know most people on here might find that idea objectionable or worthy of an eye roll at least, but that's just what we believe, and I'm mentioning it because of how scared the idea has us. My brother was warning my sister on the call not to bring it up though, as he's always been very ambivalent about Islam and finds religious talk irritating. However, he is attracted to some aspects of Sufism \(basically a rather liberal and mystical form of Islam \-\- with emphasis on music, meditation, etcetera \-\- that my family avoids as we're rather orthodox in our beliefs\), so I suggested that they visit a Sufi shrine \(or other site\) in Pakistan to cheer him up. I also suggested that they cross the border to Iran, as that's a country my brother's always found interesting/appeal. Obviously, all of this is dependent on whether or not he even agrees to go along with her.

So yeah. That's the situation so far. Apologies again for how awkwardly\-written and structured it was. Any help or advice from people who've been \(or even people who haven't been\) in a situation like this would be appreciated."

I’m currently searching for some advice on if I have any sort of legal ground or am just screwed and should eat the money. TL;DR at the end.
Edit: Apartment discussed in Indiana, was in LA for internship, home is Houston where I am currently. 

I roomed in an apartment with three other girls, and this past semester was fortunate enough to get an internship out of state. So, in December I packed up most of my things and locked my door, and made it clear I would be back at the end of March to finish off my lease. (internship only 10 weeks, roommates are college friends) 

Well, my luck is awful and I ended up breaking my arm after my internship thus having to return home for an extra few weeks rather than going right back to my school apartment. Come to find out, during the three months I had been gone for the internship a roommate allowed her friend to pick my lock and move into my room. They did not have permission and didn’t bother to even inform me until after I confronted them about it. Upon my return, my new TV that I had purchased before the school year was broken and unusable. 

When confronting the girls the one who lived in my room said she’d pay for a months worth of rent (though I asked for all three, have texts here saying she’d pay for three weeks only but she verbally said she’d do a month) and her friend who allowed her to pick my lock said she’d cover the cost of repairing the TV. So I thought great, it’s settled civilly and no worries. (Tad bit optimistic) 

Well today I went to go get a quote on fixing the TV and sent it to the girl who said she’d pay for it only to have her say I was harassing her and how it isn’t her responsibility. (I have her texts saying she’d pay for it no problem) The girl who lived in my room who said she’d pay for rent has my number blocked and I’m blocked on literally every social media, including Venmo.

So I’m at a loss here- I was stuck paying rent at that apartment, my apartment for my internship, as well as medical bills from my arm since I had to get surgery. Subleasing for the three months I was gone was not an option since it’s a college town. That money for rent could’ve prevented some of the debt I’m in from the medical bills. 

Do I have any sort of legal standing here? When I went to the apartment complex they told me that since I didn’t call them when it was happening it’s not their problem, but I didn’t even know until after the fact. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and send over some help. I feel at a loss and would love to hear any opinions. Hope I was able to be clear on the situation.

TLDR: roommate allowed her friend to pick my lock, live in room I was paying for, came back to my things broken and they said they’d pay rent and cover cost to fix tv, now I’m blocked by girl who was in my room and tv girl refuses to pay anything 

Edit 2: Sorry one more question, should’ve added this in OP. I would file charges or go to small claims in IN correct since that’s where all of this took place? I’m back in Houston currently so I would have to make travel arrangements to go up north. Might be a dumb question but just wanting to make sure I approach everything the right way. "

hey! i'm an international student who'll be applying to the US this fall to start class in 2019. i study under the GCE british curriculum (A-Levels) so i'd like some guidance into how my progress at school would be when it comes to applying to colleges in the us. feel free to recommend any reaches, safety schools, schools that you think might be good for me, etc. any advice/information is welcome! (I'll be applying for financial aid/scholarships in case that helps). 


Tests:

- The New SAT: Took it in December without studying (literally an hour of study) and scored a 1310, and a 7/7/7 for the Essay (Math: 690, Eng: 620)
- I'm retaking it this august and have been preparing, so I'm confident for a 1450+ score (i've actually been at it for a while now and think i can achieve this)
- Considering taking the Math 2 and Eng Lit SAT Subject Tests as well, aiming for anywhere over a 700

My IGCSE (Grade 10-11) subjects were Mathematics, English Literature, English Language, Science (inclusive of bio, chem, and physics), Business Studies, ICT, and Geography
The respective grades were: A *, A *, A *, A, A *, A *, A
with my A * grades all being 90%+

My current AS Level (Grade 12) subjects are Physics, Computer Science, and Mathematics
I'm predicted an A * , A *, A in them respectively by the end of my A-Levels. 

Extra Curricular Achievements:

For a bit of background, I've been attending a school of which I'm the first graduating batch, and I'm graduating alongside about a class of 65 students. My grades put me in the range of the top 5-10 students on average. Since we're the first batch, we don't have as many opportunities as other schools in the area, but I've participated in a number of national-level competitions as well as charity events.

In school:

- Member of the School Council for 4 years and counting
- Served as school's Head-boy years 2016-2017
- Engaged in general student leadership activities, ie volunteering with younger school, helping out staff, specialty in arranging end of term assemblies, weekly meetings, in school charity events, etc
- Undertook role of making end of term school videos, have a passion for videography and music
- Certificate of volunteering with the Red Crescent (equivalent to the Red Cross) charity organisation and organising events with them within school.
- Multiple subject/leadership related certificates

Competitions:

- National App Development competition for a well known bank in my resident country (Grouped, Finalist, Youngest Participants) 2016
- National Microsoft Student Ambassador Competition (Solo, 7th in the nation, Awarded title of Microsoft Student Ambassador for my school)
- National Hackathon 2018 (Grouped, Honorable Mention, Youngest Participants)
- Duke of Edinburgh Digital Entrepreneurship Award (Duke of Edinbrugh visited school, I recieved the oppurtunity with 4 other students to be his guest to observe a Business Competition at a prestigious and royal palace)

Hobbies:

- Self taught musical producer, i've always been interested in musical production, but was never able to take up any instruments or any sort of lessons as a kid. Since last year, I've taught myself digital production and have gained a following of 500 people, with a cumulative 120,000+ plays on media platforms (soundcloud &amp; youtube)

Internships:

Looked for these myself since my school is relatively new and we don't have as many connections with organisations.

- Summer 2017: Worked and completed a introductory program for Amadeus Travel Technology at a certified Travel branch in my home country. So I have basic industry level certification for their global travel ecosystem software.

- January 2018 - Current: Junior Volunteer at the Make a Wish Foundation; I gained this internship solely through my own intuition (scouting for internships myself) and was offered an internship here. I applied and recommended it to my friend as well, both of us have been working with Make a Wish ever since. We're the youngest volunteers out of the group and certified &amp; trained volunteers. Myself, along with my friend, were also the first Volunteer trainers for the organisation in my country of residence; we trained other volunteers as well as presented to the Regional Managers and other heads of the organisation regarding professional videography and photography (something that stemmed from doing it regularly at school). We've attended multiple charity events with them as well and we've become well acquainted with everybody at the organisation.

Some past, more junior school achievements:

- Participation in organising and helping out during Debate competitions, participating in Model United Nations (good public speaking, leadership activities, etc)
- Runner up in Whole school art competition, awarded trophy by a prestigious artist in my home country

- National Microsoft Student Ambassador Competition (Solo, 7th in the nation, Awarded title of Microsoft Student Ambassador for my school)
- National Hackathon 2018 (Grouped, Honorable Mention, Youngest Participants)
- Duke of Edinburgh Digital Entrepreneurship Award (Duke of Edinbrugh visited school, I recieved the oppurtunity with 4 other students to be his guest to observe a Business Competition at a prestigious and royal palace)

Hobbies:
- Self taught musical producer, i've always been interested in musical production, but was never able to take up any instruments or any sort of lessons as a kid. Since last year, I've taught myself digital production and have gained a following of 500 people, with a cumulative 120,000+ plays on media platforms (soundcloud &amp; youtube)

Internships:
- Looked for these myself since my school is relatively new and we don't have as many connections with organisations.
1) Summer 2017: Worked and completed a introductory program for Amadeus Travel Technology at a certified Travel branch in my home country. So I have basic industry level certification for their global travel ecosystem software.

2) January 2018 - Current: Junior Volunteer at the Make a Wish Foundation; I gained this internship solely through my own intuition (scouting for internships myself) and was offered an internship here. I applied and recommended it to my friend as well, both of us have been working with Make a Wish ever since. We're the youngest volunteers out of the group and certified &amp; trained volunteers. Myself, along with my friend, were also the first Volunteer trainers for the organisation in my country of residence; we trained other volunteers as well as presented to the Regional Managers and other heads of the organisation regarding professional videography and photography (something that stemmed from doing it regularly at school). We've attended multiple charity events with them as well and we've become well acquainted with everybody at the organisation.

Some past, more junior school achievements:

- Participation in organising and helping out during Debate competitions, participating in Model United Nations (good public speaking, leadership activities, etc)
- Runner up in Whole school art competition, awarded trophy by a prestigious artist in my home country

I'll be completing my studies on end of this month, but our graduation is on October.  Many reputed companies in my country takes us as SE \(mainly because of the reputation of our faculty and we have 6 months experience as interns\) . We have around 250 in our batch and around 120 were able to get jobs \(already signed the offers, they'll be starting on Junly\) . But still I couldn't find a job even though I've been to around 10 interviews for SE position.   


As a faculty and a batch we ask for a good salary. Many companies consider that and offer them as we expect. But as there are graduates from other companies who asks like half of our salary some companies don't like to give us that much \( As we have worked with those other undergraduates during internships we know our value \) .

  
Now this is the thing. As this is our final month studying we have exams \+ final year project evaluation in this month. So, I'm confused and don't know what to do. I can't think whether I should continue applying or focus on the studies. The thing what worrying me is I'm bit scared if I pause job search until end of this month and start from July, it might be hard to get a job or even if I get a job, the offer will be low. Has anyone ever experienced a situation like this ? What should I do ?  
**TLDR :** *Final year undergraduate who'll be completing the studies on July \(but graduation will be on October\) without any job offer. This month we'll be having final exams and final year project evaluation. Should I continue my job search or should I pause the job search until end of June and focus on studies ?*

I recently graduated from a coding bootcamp and I am working a job I hate. I was hired as a software engineer at a huge very notable company. During my first couple of months a lead within the company asked if I would take a non-techinal position on a project in exchange for getting high profile technical work later. That technical work never came.I have now been working a non-techincal position for over a year and no one remembers the promises that have been made. I have spoken to upper management multiple times about the situation yet no one cares/makes any actions.The work is very tedious,high stakes, and essentially work that no one else wants to do. Not only is the work like pulling teeth it also includes doing part-time work on a remote team. My whole team works 3000 miles away yet I am are still forced to make the hour drive to the office each day. The remote team doesn’t not care that I even exist and treats me as if I am the intern. I have become a joke within company my coworkers constantly laugh at how I am are still doing this none technical work and how I got taken advantage of. I have tried to leave this position multiple times but upper management will not let me leave. I have learned a great deal about the job force and about saying no to things I do not want to do. The anxiety of having to go back to work every Monday is crippling me. I feel humiliated for being taken advantage of and worthless.I really would like to put in my two week notice but I not only support myself  but two other family members and do not have the money to just quit.

The reason I called out to work at home is because I lost my wallet. I had a back up card to pay things with but I completely forgot it at home when rushing out. It's a 2 hour train ride to work as well. I was hoping I can use Google wallet and get cash back but it didn't work out that way. I work in New York city and I normally take the subway to work so having no cash was an issue and walking to work is an hour and 15mins.....

So I just decided to go home. But I feel terrible, if I didn't lose my wallet or forget my backup card when rushing to make the train, I would have been at work. 

It's my first job, I was actually an intern there and I am still an intern because I just graduated college. They are giving me a month project and depending how I do they will hire me. 

Im just not sure what to think right now, because to me I don't think I have a good reason but I will be working from home so it's not like I'm taking off... But i could have made it to work if I didn't have my back up card...

What should I do or say? Should I explain to my boss my situation since accidents happen or just leave it as personal? I'm not walking an hour to work and an hour back to catch a train to get home but I feel like i should because of my screw up...

I have mixed feelings obviously can someone tell me how I should feel and handle this? "

A few ideas so far:

* Have you run into any blockers, or areas in which you're struggling?
* What are some things you like or disliked about the last week?"

Our idea is to find a job in Canada or in the US and imigrate legally. Although we don't have relatives over there, we do have friends in both places.

Regarding budget, we don't have any fixed value, we actually don't know how much we should bring, but according to the Express Entry Immigration tool, we can try to work out the amount of CA$12k.

We know many people try to do that and there are a ton of websites that say they will help you find a job/imigrate to other countries by a certain cost, but we don't know how legit they are.

Also, people who managed to find a job and imigrate to Canada, how did you do it?

I need to get it all off my chest and into writing.

My university is hosting an internship fair this week, where many companies gather to interview us students. It's a pretty great opportunity.

We're all STEM students; that is, computer/electrical engineers, programmers, and bio-chemists. Personally, I study computer science and just finished my 2nd year.

Problem is, I don't really know what I can do in a company. I could just list my skills in my CV:

- A decent grasp of Java, and hence OOP programming languages in general
- Some experience in web development, but my knowledge is rusty and outdated, and it's not a field I want to focus on (despite being the easiest to get a job in in most companies, in my experience).
- Interest in machine learning, but very little experience: some surface knowledge + a genetic algorithm program written in Python from scratch for fun, no libraries or anything.
- Speaking of, some rudimentary knowledge of Python. Not very hard to acquire, that.
- General experience of (casual) years in coding, to the point that I'm comfortable with learning things I don't yet know to tackle challenges that are beyond me.

...But there are plenty of other students who are much better at programming than me. What's more, my interest lies in video game development (design, code, marketing, and all), and that industry is essentially nonexistent in my country. I plan to solo it and sell via the internet (Play Store, Steam...), but at the same time I don't want to miss out on a good internship, so that I can more easily secure a normal 9-to-5 job later on for financial security, if things don't work out.

So, what can I sell to the prospective companies? I'm interested in pretty much anything, be it sales or programming or even management, but my experience in these is little or none."

Having an internship would provide much needed experience in the resume but I think ethically it's wrong to work unpaid as I'm a masters student and should be getting paid something. 

Should I negotiate the timing that I can only work for 2\-3 hours per day in the internship and for the rest of the time do the research and personal project?

8oiuip,1,2018-06-04,Internship vs Developer positions,Shed412,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8oiuip/internship_vs_developer_positions/,"I'm in a bit of a pickle. Back in October, I interviewed with two places, one was for a developer role at a start up, the other was for a QA role at a large well established company. The start up didn't have money to pay me yet, so I ended up taking the internship with the larger company. The issue being that it was part time, and might be for the coming summer too, when I wouldn't have any classes. I am currently a senior and have one semester left at University.

Fast forward to now. The start up has now received funding, and wants to hire me again for a full developer role. I am still working at the larger company, but they have given me the option to work for full time hours in my intern position. 

Everything has been established and I am 100% allowed to work for both at the same time contractionally. However, I feel weird about it. The start up is kind of scary since there is almost nothing done and there are pretty tight deadlines. These were things I wasn't exactly aware of until I was on boarding so there was no way I was going to know. I feel like I'm capable of doing it, but everything hinges on it taking off and me finishing school and me leaving the internship in August, which would be a couple months early. 

The start up position is also currently a controctor position. So I have to use my own things for it which, given the other places I've worked for, feels weird. It also pays monthly which I find to be strange. I would trust that they pay, but that infrequently is odd to me.

I have worked a day at the start up. I haven't signed any contracts yet, however. The only reason I don't just leave is because it would be an actual development position before graduation which would look REALLY good on my resume. I just don't know if the stress is worth it.

Thoughts?"

Pros: 

It's an internship

Paid

High level security clearance

Recruiter said they hire 90% of interns after graduation (Slightly worried he may be jacking that number up)

In washignton DC which would be a cool experience

Could open doors to defense contractors



Cons:

While paid, it's less than most other internships

Have to move across the nation

May not be as prestigious as other CS internships (Friends have gotten internships with amazon and google)

Workplace may be very different from private sector

For reference, I graduated from a large university with a Bachelors of science in neuroscience with no intent of ever pursuing medical school and maybe pursuing a masters later in a different subject (possibly biomedical engineering or computer science). The possible masters decision came during my final year of school, where it would have made zero sense to switch degrees and spend 4 more years there so I just took the Bachelors for what it was, a certificate saying I completed a four-year degree with no hope of the actual content helping me very much (the fact that I at least have a Bachelors is not lost on me)

In my own mind, I have done a pretty piss poor job of setting myself up for the workforce in general over college, no academic research to speak of, no internships because I was mostly school oriented and my degree program didn't require one, I never attended any job fairs (I have no excuse for this, just poor decisions and laziness), and to top it off I was (formally at least) in zero clubs. I regret all of this but try not to dwell on it as that does nothing to help the situation I currently find myself in. I did, however, hold a job for 3 years throughout school that involved heavy customer service oriented talents and some light security. I became a supervisor at this job during my last year and have just left it to pursue.... something else.

The crux of my problem lies in that I want to try and get involved in the technology field, and maybe eventually work with A.I, but have zero skills in this area. I am slowing working towards learning about tech and finding free online help guides to direct my learning, currently I'm learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and have started learning basic in Python but am at a loss for what I can do with any of it since I'm so fresh and people want experienced workers. I still just feel overwhelmingly incompetent in everything.

I welcome any advice people can give me because I feel extremely lost and dejected at the moment. If this would be a better post somewhere else, please let me know that as well, I mostly lurk so am not up to snuff on these things."

Brief introduction: I'm an undergraduate math major with a lot of cs theory experience and moderate coding experience from tech internships. I've worked on a few personal projects mostly related to my math interests or automating things in my daily routine. I'm realizing that I'll have a lot of time this summer to work on projects.

I should admit that this is partially motivated by the desire to pad my resume, however open source projects are something that I have used and taken advantage of a lot in my computer science career and I would love to give back. There were many times where I really wanted to contribute to things, but I've never really felt like I was competent enough to be contributing (at this point I think I'm realizing that I will never feel like that and it's okay). Is that fairly normal? 

What is the best way to start contributing? I would love to do something related to math or visualization, but I also have a ton of time and would be excited to learn something new.

No matter how hard i work in the gym i still have bitch tits, can't even go out with friends to the beach because of it. All of this combined is making me feel like shit :("
8okgz7,0,2018-06-04,How do I leverage an engineering degree to find a job outside of my field?,Hoyt_Corkins,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8okgz7/how_do_i_leverage_an_engineering_degree_to_find_a/,"I graduated in December with a degree in Computer Engineering from a top 5 program in the US. I have no interest in a job in the field I’m supposed to use it in. I do not enjoy programming and I’m not good at it. I had poor grades and barely graduated. I had no internships or programming projects other than classwork. How can I use my degree to get a job in another industry or a job that doesn’t involve programming? I’ve been applying for Business/Systems Analyst positions and have only received two call backs. Both recruiters asked technical questions about programming that I bombed. I don’t know what other interests I have other than fitness/bodybuilding. I’m located in Chicago, but I’m open to relocating (actually working of prefer to move somewhere else).

I realize I should have changed majors, but I didn’t and now I’m in my current position. 

Edit: posted from my phone and can’t find the flair option. I will change this when I’m at my desktop."
8okx0e,528,2018-06-04,"Why do so many job posting flag themselves as ""Entry level"" and then require 3+ years of experience?",confusedGuy17,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8okx0e/why_do_so_many_job_posting_flag_themselves_as/,"I am so demoralized right now I am ready to just lose it and bawl my eyes out.

Entry level = 3 years of experience!?!?!? HOW? And this isn't a few postings, this is a lot of postings. Finding an entry level position that is ACTUALLY entry level (I read the entire posting which I should do, right?) is impossible!

I am intentionally trying to filter out non-entry level positions and then their mandatory list is longer than the list of courses I've taken during a full degree!? Like why is this such a common thing?!

I think I'm about to have a breakdown mentally. I am intentionally trying to filter entry level so I can find shit I can fit into with just barely under 2 years experience and all I get are these intermediate positions. A lot even say 5 years experience, one I just saw today even said EIGHT (8) YEARS!? And was flagged as entry level.

I have crippling amounts of student loan debt, over a year of industry experience through an internship and a degree in compsci and am more than confident if any of these positions would let me work I'd do it.

I just want to scream and cry. 

It feels like the more I try and the more I look and everything else the worse it looks."

And then for the other four weeks, I would be working on projects they give us with other ""interns"". And these projects would be made in the Racket programming language. The only downfall to this internship is, I would have to live with my brother and pay for my food and travel for the 8 weeks. So my question is, would this opportunity make my resume look better?

I just got hired full time at a pretty big tech company. I went to a state school and I've been working professionally since I graduated college for 4.5 years and I've had two jobs. However, neither were in tech or even close. My last job was supposed to be marketing operations and I was reduced to an administrative assistant essentially but got to keep my pay. I haven't discussed this with anyone, I've just said I was in operations. 

Everyone who started the same date as me is either an intern from MIT or Stanford or a FT employer coming from a different tech company. I cannot get it out of my head that I don't belong. Everyone has such great questions or talks about cool projects they previously worked on. I feel like I can't even compare. I've never used any of the apps that are pretty standard for communications, documenting, etc. at tech companies. I've never even used a Mac before (which we all use). Today, I had to screen share and it was so obvious I wasn't comfortable navigating the desktop. I've mentioned this to a few people but I'm not comfortable talking to my assigned mentor about it and no one in my class gets it. No one is rude or stuck up to me and I know deep down I made it through the same interviews as them but I am so worried the second I get thrown into real work, I am going to look like an idiot and everyone will know. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? Does anyone have any good tips to either get over this or approach it differently? Any podcasts or online courses you'd recommend to build back confidence?"

When should I start actively looking and actively applying for jobs if I'm planning on graduating this December? I've sent out a couple feelers in May and I've been told to check back with them later in the year. I want to appear ambitious and enthusiastic but I don't want to start things too early and have my applications be lost in the backlog of things.

Also, my GPA isn't the best. It's around a 2.9 - 3.3 depending on how I do next semester. But I have a lot of projects and internships under my belt and I've won the biggest hackathon in my city. What kind of positions can I realistically expect? I do plan on applying to the Big N just for the hell of it and don't really expect anything past an interview but am I wasting my time with my GPA? 

Thanks in advance!"

I’m nervous as hell. I failed to find an internship for the summer and I feel like after taking all of these cs classes. I feel like I don’t know anything. I feel like I still struggle with programming and this is what stresses me out the most. I feel like my classmates are so far ahead of me and I can’t do anything to catch up to them. I try to use spare time to better understand concepts but i feel like it’s no use and this is why I’m freaking out about a job when I graduate. I don’t want to graduate and be unable to find a job because I’m too dumb. Is it too late for an internship? And what’s the best thing to do in my situation? Should I give up?
8op57h,740,2018-06-05,How our education system failed us,Fullthrottle191,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8op57h/how_our_education_system_failed_us/,"Back in 2009, prepping for ICSE class 10. Everyone told me, 90% is the benchmark. I was told, it was the biggest exam of my life. Too immature back then, I studied hard, never saw the light of the sun and ignored all, studied as much as i could do. And then I appeared for the exam, and passed with some 92.xxx(almost 95 if best of 5 etc was done). 

What changed? Nothing. As the results were declared, it was like, ""meh, class 10 is nothing. Your talent is actually tested in IITJEE"". Medical was never my cup of tea. Yet I was forced to take Biology by my parents. Beta, you can appear for medical too they said.Study hard. Very hard. YOU MUST SUCCEED. TOLD MY PEERS. Yeah, and I did study. 

Back in those days, we used to have Regional Mathematics Olympiads. That was the gateway to INMO and next IMO. My school didn't want to give me a pass to appear in the RMO exam, and it was after a lot of firefighting that I was able to appear for the exam, all on my own self. School used to send nominated candidates those days, 6 of them. 

When the results came on 26th December, 2010, my heart sank. In spite of a pretty good exam, my name wasnt there in the list. I cried. It was my first acquaintance with failure. I never knew the surprise that was awaiting me. That evening, I got a call from ISI Calcutta, yeah I had been selected. How I failed to see my name in that list, I still dunno. But that small and short experience of failure was going to come pretty handy.

 I was always good in maths. But boy, you are just a piece of shit if you aren't a Btech.  I failed in IITJEE. And yeah, I saw the faces change.

 Teachers poured scorn on me (lets accept it, I am not the coolest of guys to be with. A cocksure cully kind of a guy. So, yeah, mostly lonely and having a rebel kind of attitude. But these were the same men, who praised me only 3 months back when I was the lone guy cracking RMO.), Those who cracked JEE, after as if they were super intelligent. A guy with whom I had been best friends with, made it through. But after that, he seldom kept contact. They acted as if they were busy, but I could see through their thinly veiled VANITY. 

I made it to one of the better NITs. But I could realize something. That for all that we LEARN, it fails to teach us certain basic aspects of life. If not, then why are we so lonely? If not, then why are people, running haywire, to meet their insatiable aspirations? Aspirations? My foot. When was the last time I did something I truly wanted? NEVER. THERE WAS MY ANSWER. 

When I tried surfacing these doubts to my parents, they laughed at it, with scorn, contempt and a bit of vain sympathy. I could feel that. They told me, that's how life is meant to be. Yeah, true maybe. MORE MARKS. MORE CGPA. MORE MONEY. But it never told us, that our prime responsibility was only one thing. TO QUESTION THE STATUS QUO. TO ASK WHY IS IT THAT AM SO EMPTY INSIDE? WHY THE FUCK ARE THINGS SO BLOODY WRONG?

During my college days, I thought it would change. But it was all so the same. The more I wanted Respite, the lesser it seemed plausible. Money, marks, bloody numbers, jobs, and yet so less people interested in LEARNING. When I was trying my hands at Texas Instruments Analog Design Contest, I found it difficult to get a partner, given it had no leverage on marks. Those who would latter help, would do it, solely so that the future publication at Elsevier would have their names on it, and they could use it for their SoP while applying for MS. Nobody was doing it for love, for purpose. 

Rewind, 2015. I had made up my mind. I had to go for MS. But then, Lord Giveth. Lord Taketh. My Grandmom, had kidney failure. My uncle, being an agricultural labourer, failed to fulfill her medical expenses. Our financial conditions became pretty bad. Pretty pretty bad. So, my parents asked me to shelve plans, at least an year. So, priorities changed. You must get a job. Campussing. Job. Your life will change. You will have FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE.

Yo, I did land jobs. Not one, two of them. People told Jio was going to be the next big thing in telecom. I joined Jio. Life changed? Haha, yeah. SHIT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. THINGS THAT WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE FOREVER. AN ETHNOCENTRIC, EGOTIST self , that treated all ""Non Science"" background people as idiots was going to change. I was going to change my way of looking at life. 

Jio, 2016. Merry making, joining Parties, flurry of Facebook posts. In 3 weeks time, I was in charge of a group of guys, who were a bit of trashcan to handle.(they said they were INTERNS, and my team said to extract as much of testing as I could from them). But I told you, I was always one cocksure cully to deal with. My first few days, with those guys, they were the most gentle guys around. My manager Mr xyz. (with a name, starting with a V word, that's a common meme term these days, related to Acche Din), started pressuring me to get them to raise a 1000 test cases a day, regarding connectivity issues and that too with a 3 member team. One fine morning I found these guys, foul mouthing this man and arguing with the HR, a lady, (and by far the worst crook I met till this day). My manager had lied to me. These guys werent INTERNS. They were given a Designation. Assistant manager. I had found it earlier. But I didn't Question. No. I DIDNT. BECAUSE, THAT WAS NOT EXPECTED OF ME. NEITHER IN NY CHILDHOOD. NOR MY ADULTHOOD. 

These people (later I found an absolutelot of so called assistant managers) had not been paid wages for 2 months. They were not given an official contract letter. Everytime they asked, they were told they would be confirmed after medical tests report would be received. (And medicals happened in Reliance campus itself). They shared with me their frustrations. I felt very bad. The worst. I asked myself, what am I doing? Isn't it my moral responsibility to ask for these people? My brain told me, no, dont. Shit will hit the fan. Ah, those days of moral dichotomy. And then one day, these people were asked to leave, since they weren't upto the organizational standards. And no. They weren't paid any wages for 4 months. They left, but I asked myself, what kind of a supreme Douchebag fails to take stand for those people with whom he spends 9 hours a day. I did my undercover sting, and I found some 73 people, who were undergoing the same fate. 

That day I made my mind. I will question. I gathered all the courage in my heart, and I went for lunch, took the exact1 opposite chair to that of Mr. xyz. I asked him, that why were these poor brats not paid wages? (The new team assigned to me, were undergoing the same fate. However unlike the previous ones, these people believed that Reliance wouldn't dump them). He replied, that the company will decide. A few more questions, and I could see that he was getting uncomfortable. Peddling lies. Finally he told me what I knew he would tell me, tumhe apna tankha tym pe milta hain naa, chup chap apna kaam karo.

I would very well realize, that my tym here was coming to an end. (Regarding Mr XYZ, this man was a typical specimen of a NIT and IIM passout blockhead. Such was his Knowledge that he told there was 1 high court and 24 supreme courts in our country in our intro session. I laughed. But most others applauded. Maybe that's where WE ARE COLLECTIVELY going nowadays). I could see the world changing. I prepared for AAI and IBPS( sbi ka form khatam ho chuka tha, and my peers told, psu will be better). One fine evening I was called by the lady HR. I was  told, my performances weren't being good enough and I should take this as a warning. I slapped my notice period the next day, with a 1000 word letter to mr. ABC who was the VP those days. And tell you what, I was told that I can be relieved before completing my Notice. I didbt pay a damn, coz I had made it to AAI ATC. Medical were pending. Bade adieu to Navi Mumbai.

Education FAILED to teach me that I must Question. Experience taught me otherwise. Not that I reaped any Praise or Reward, (in fact I was looked down upon with scorn and anger by all) but the fact that I tried to question, gave me confidence. Confidence that I might Fail, but it doesn't necessarily mean that I am wrong. 

Aai atc, medical took place. I was to receive the WORST NIGHTMARE I had to. I was rejected. I came to know I was Color Blind. All of a sudden, I had to make peace with the fact, that I did not have a job. My brains told me, that had I not started that January BS, I would have remained in my place, cozy and fine. All of a sudden, I could see everything going down the drain. I had problems recognizing other colors but blue previously, but no one cared. Neither did I. I thought my Relationship would end too, it was 4 years old then. I confessed to my girlfriend, and, all of a sudden I was looking at an uncertain future, with pretty less number of jobs (given in India, you dont end up with good core jobs in PSUs if you are Color Blind). 

Fortunately I had also made it through IBPS. April 1, I felt so lucky. But Buddha had said, all fortune is the source of some misfortune. Before joining banks, I was actually looking at what path I can choose. I was looking at my self, and asking what can I do, what suits my nature. It was here that I found Civil services, something that I had looked upon with so much contempt and disregard before. 

Yeah, I want to make positive changes. Yeah, I want to make this place a better one. Yeah, I want to raise my voice against stuff. It ticked a lot of boxes. And tbh, its not possible to change  the system if you don't know it well. To make a software better you need to know it. Even to hack it. I shelved my plans for MS. 

2016, I joined one of the more famed PSU banks in India. One of the big 3 (excluding SBI). Life was joy and bliss and innocence. I was in the recovery section. Shit hit the fan once more. I found out that one of the branches passed fictitious MSME loans (mostly of the order of 4.xxx lakhs, because less than 5 means no investigation). These loans never had any recovery. And CGTMSE coverage was used to recover stuff.  I reported. My DM promised to investigate. My manager told me that the person used to be in Disciplinary Cell (the cell that metes out penalties to employees for stuff) and that her husband was DM/AGM in our bank. And yeah. Once again the ground below shattered . Within a days notice, I was transferred to Lawngtlai. 

Another day. Another resignation. This wasn't due to the fact that I was tired or anything. I was preparing for UPSC, and it was just 2 more months left for prelims. They were already delaying my NOC etc. ( as per this bank rules you need to inform the bank if you are appearing anywhere, that's what the HR told me). All this was taking a toll on my prep. 

I resigned. Prelims 2017 wasn't the easiest. But I didn't fare too badly. Given the shitstorm I underwent. Results came. I failed. By 2 marks.

Today, I stand, Voluntarily Unemployed. But I can tell you people few things I learned, from my experience. That our education fails to teach us

1. Its okay to FAIL. We all must FAIL. Accept it. Move on. Our education speaks so much about success. It cherry picks the stories of success. But it fails to tell you that 90% of us will Fail in our goal.

2. Have a purpose. A life without purpose is a meaningless life. I see these people waking up everyday going to jobs. They never ask why they are doing it. In their private counters they accept that they are doing it for money. They have MONETISED their lives. 

3. QUESTION. Insurrection is the bloody most supreme of all duties said Lafayette, and it holds true everytime. Everywhere. QUESTION. Your own self. Why? Why you are doing something that you are doing.

4. Enjoying your life and being happy is a choice. Yes. You want to be happy? Enjoy cherish and value all that you have. You have much more than you actually think you have.

5. Invest in human relationships. That's the best thing to do. Talk with your parents. Your girlfriend. The unconditional support these people have provided me, in spite of all the trouble I have been giving them, i can only be indebted to them.

Sorry for such a long post. Wrote it all on mobile. Actually, had a lot of free time after prelims, so, decided to share the story of my life. There's so much more left to share. Thank you for audience.



Edit :

1. Man, I am not glorifying failure in any sense. I don't consider myself an outright failure, as such. And this post has nothing to do with failure or success. I just wanted to tell you a story, that is personal.

2. Regarding parents. No they weren't at fault. The problems that they overcame are far more than I would ever do. That's the reason I do have the luxury to do certain things. Its very easy to contemplate etc, when you got someone to pick you up. Not so much, when you dont. Tbh, my parents with time have started giving me the freedom I craved for. 

3. Don't stick just to the pre college part. It was an insignificant part. 


Edit 2: Never knew this was gonna get so much traction. I follow randia closely. But am not a permanent reddit contributor. Randia does amaze me sometimes. I can see people giving out of the box solutions to help other people solve problems of the worst kind. I can see the satire in the political posts. While during kathua case, I remember reading half of randia screaming that Humanity is extinct, the Empathy that I see on this sub, on a lot of days, tells me, not all is lost. In fact, if the fellow randian looks into his work, you will find, he has far greater qualities than just being a coder or engineer or doctor or anything. 

I would love to go through all the comments and personally reply wherever possible. Another thing people, I became decisive just because it felt VERY BAD. You all would have felt the same had you saw all this. It never had anything to do with personal courage and bravado. Although I wrote all that I did, I can vouch on the fact that 80% of the junta working in Jio and that Bank are actually honest, hardworking middle class junta. Its just a number of crooks who game the system."

Not to say this wasn’t expected but I’m supposed to be working here for 4 weeks. I’m thinking of shortening the duration to 1 week as I don’t see any point of doing this internship. I should probably find a new one where I can be sure I’ll be learning something.

Major: I'm thinking of mostly doing Statistics, as that's a class that I really liked junior year. 

Test stats: 

GPA: 3.6

SAT: 1220 (Gonna retake that)

ACT: Will be taking that soon 

No Subject Tests 

APs: 

- Computer Science: 5 

- World History: 3 

- Human Geography: 2 (I know what I'm not picking) 

- Awaiting test scores for APUSH, Statistics, European History, Physics I, English III

Background (Boiling it down to relevant parts):

- Hispanic Male

- First Generation 

- Family Income is $11K/year 

- Essentially no way to pay for college 

- Mom is a single mother who also has clinical depression

- Lived in Honduras for 4 years 

- Living in Texas now, but moved constantly from New York to Florida, etc 

Skills: 

- 1 year in Classical Guitar &amp; Chess (Never had any music experience until Junior year of high school)

- Apparently not bad at programming considering the 5 in Comp Sci 

- I like to write, so I guess I'm pretty good at that 

- Starting an activity with friends that gives me an active leadership role with every meeting we have. The objective is for me to set up a situation that I've written or improvised in which I guide or allow my friends to figure out themselves to work together as a team to resolve the situation to the best of their abilities. Several situations packed together is usually referred to as a ""campaign,"" with the activity usually being referred to by the name ""Dungeons and Dragons."" 

Internship: 

I'll be interning next week in the Dallas City Hall in the department of Communication and Information Services, working specifically with Contract Management. So in terms of work experience, I'll also have that. 

Colleges: 

- I'm thinking of keeping it in state as to hopefully not drown myself in debt, with those colleges being Texas A&amp;M at College Station. Also maybe UT Austin but that's kinda a stretch. 

School: 

- My school is a class of 75, and we have Talented and Gifted in our name so I can only presume that that's somewhat relevant. There's no rank in the school but if I were to rank myself, I would most likely be in the upper part of the bottom 50%, since everyone in the top half have had A's from the beginning of freshman year.

I would be applying as a transfer student (technically, although I dropped out of college a long time ago). I was going through personal stuff at my last college so my GPA was pretty low, and I wasn’t involved in many extracurriculars and never had any impressive internships or anything. My last school was also lower ranked than UFL.

I know they say UFL online admissions are just as rigorous, but I wonder if it would be a bit easier to get in? Seeing as they don’t have to limit spots to how many people they can physically have on campus, and the applicant pool might also be smaller (?)

Anyway, I’m just wondering what other people have gotten in with.

If you transferred, what was your transfer GPA?

Has anyone gotten in from a lower ranked college?

Anyone get in after a long time away from school, and/or without a lot of professional or CS-relevant work experience?

Thanks!"

I’ve had a fairly bumpy ride this far in terms of my academic success for various reasons and only have a C average. The past two semesters have been significantly better however. Recently I’ve been trying to better myself and pursue opportunities to do such, applying to dozens of internships since early February. I’ve been approached by 3 places since then and have had 5 interviews total, 2 of which were followups. Unfortunately I’ve yet to be given an offer and admittedly it’s becoming increasingly demoralizing and I’ve started doubting myself even more than usual. I’m starting to question how this result will translate to next year when I’m searching for a full-time position and I just don’t know where to go from here. I’ve been searching for, and applying to, different places daily, mostly temp-agency type stuff since there are very few internship postings around my area  at this time, and unfortunately I do not have my own mode of transportation, and other summer employment opportunities around Philadelphia. But so far I’ve had no luck.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
8orelo,2,2018-06-05,I feel so lost in life,DisastrousTomatillo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8orelo/i_feel_so_lost_in_life/,"A year ago I graduated college as a Math major/Computer science minor thinking that I would get a programming job, make good money, and be happy. I did a web dev internship but after that I've been unable to get a full time job that involves any sort of programming. I ended up taking an IT support type job in NYC which pays decently, but not enough for me to be able to afford to live without roommates.

I really am not happy at this job. It is in an industry I really don't care for (TV) and I feel really out of place. I have awkward interactions with nearly everyone I work with which has made me feel very lonely as I don't really talk to anyone here as a friend. Additionally, for the past couple of months there hasn't really been anything to do so I've just been at my desk reading random crap on the internet and scrolling through reddit to pass the time.

Meanwhile I have friends/peers from college who literally piggypacked off of my work while in school and now have better paying jobs than me and actually work in the software development industry. I have continued to apply to some jobs every now and then but I rarely hear back from anyone. I know that if these people can do these jobs then there is no reason why I can't but no company seems to think I'd be a good hire. I just feel like a failure.

I'm in my mid 20s now (24), and my health is starting to get worse. Over the past few years I've gained about 60lbs from a really bad diet consisting of a lot of pizza and takeout because I've been too lazy to cook. I've recently started to get into cooking healthier foods now especially since my father recently had a heart attack. However, I'm really not good at cooking and I have a lot of paranoia when handling raw meats and stuff so it always feels overwhelming when I do try to cook. I also don't have a working oven in my apartment (I do have stove burners).

I've been in a very unstable relationship with my girlfriend for the past 3 years. We've broken up/gotten back together many times and have both done hurtful things; though most of the mistakes have been made by me. I have always felt that she has been very demanding and it has drained a lot of energy from me. We fight a lot and sometimes I get really mad and snap and say mean things that I don't mean to say. I feel like the relationship is hopeless but at the same time we are so attached to each other neither of us wants to leave.

I have had mental health issues for as long as I can remember and it only seems to get worse. I've attempted suicide and been hospitalized many times. Even with insurance I don't really feel like I can afford therapy but maybe I'm just being cheap and care about money more than my health.


I moved to NYC because I thought I would have an easier time getting a job I wanted and making more money. So far it seems like the opposite is true. It seems like everything is super competitive here and that I'll never afford to get a decent apartment I can pay for on my own. I've started to think maybe now is the time to consider moving out west again like I've always wanted and start over, but I've noticed that starting over seems to be something I've done too often. It seems like anytime I'm not happy with something I just want to scrap it and start from scratch.

**TL;DR:** I don't know. Overall I just feel terrible about life. I hate myself for things I have done and for how I behave when in disputes with other people. I hate myself for being socially awkward. I hate myself for mistreating my girlfriend. I hate my job. I hate that my slacker friends from school got better jobs than me. I hate my living situation and having roommates. I hate feeling like I don't have a purpose in life. I just seem to hate life in general.

I'm sorry if this is all incoherent. I don't know what to do."

I have an internship at a PR firm. I'm a dude, fellow intern is female. Woman who owns the firm is amazing. Her story is she struggled to the top and faced many challenges as a woman, finding few female coworkers, mentors, and bosses in her years. Now she wants to help minorities and especially women in PR.

Now, when we have projects, I consistently outperform my coworker. She's always given a lot of notes and redo assignments. We're kind of friends though, so we always help each other to catch up or fix mistakes, and I usually save her from big mistakes. We kinda have a loyalty pact.

But when our boss wants anything done or wants to talk to someone, she always call on my coworker. Half the time, it's like I'm not there, I'm always just relayed the message through someone else. When there's a special project, it's always offered to her first even if she's busy and I'm free, and I usually end up just tagging along as an afterthought. They'll talk about girl things, and I just end up pretending I'm listening to music because I'm clearly not being talked to evem if it's a group.

I don't think I'm unpleasant, as I do get along with other people who work in the office and chat with them. So it can't be she dislikes me because she still will talk to me (my boss), just not preferably compared to my coworker.

My boss is a super nice person, so it's probably not on purpose. Maybe she subconciously gravitates towards women. But I feel... way below her and my coworker. Yeah, I guess I kind of get how women feel in the workplace when they face office sexism. 

Just... I don't want to make a scene. I just want to get through the summer. How do I move past any jealousy and perceived sexism and control myself?"
8ositx,1,2018-06-05,Some advice needed on PC for sister,PcPatrick,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/8ositx/some_advice_needed_on_pc_for_sister/,"My sister is an architect student and has just completed her 4th year and is going to enter her 5th and final year in August. She currently has an internship with an architect. This architect is a one person show, so no equipment is provided. 

My sister has been having trouble because she has been using a gaming laptop for her programs. This laptop is decent and is only 2-3 years old. She is having trouble though because the workload has increased and the laptop isn't really cutting it anymore. I've looked at it and it's virus free and I cleaned up what I could, but with a laptop typical pc maintenance steps are usually futile. 

Anyway, she wants me to find her a new laptop that will work much better. I tell her time and time again that she really should build a desktop as laptops don't last and are more expensive as well as slower than a desktop. I've built my own pc and have no trouble doing it for her (I'd be happy to, building a pc is fun!). I understand her main points; she can't just carry a desktop everywhere, as it's not practical. Her other point is that her future employer will provide her with a pc to use (which I'm a bit doubtful of) but a personal computer is still necessary anyway. 

She has a budget of around $1,000 USD, which is practically nothing for a laptop but can get you a pretty decent desktop. I can easily whip up a pcpartpicker and compare against laptops, but I have a strong feeling she wont be phased. I also don't want to suggest a laptop for her to get just to have it slow down and be extremely inefficient in a year or two, as that would make me look bad even though I've told her these things. 

I have two main questions: 

1. What else should I be telling her so that she can further understand why getting a desktop is the better option;

2. If she does go the desktop route, she obviously can't carry it everywhere. Would a program such as teamviewer from her laptop to her desktop function as a way to use the desktop without having to carry it everywhere? 

This post may seem as if I'm trying to completely sway her away from a laptop. I believe she can choose what she wants but a desktop is certainly the best option as the only drawback is having to transport it. If she absolutely decides no desktops, I'll still help her find a laptop, I'm just trying to help her out the best I can.

I’m not sure if this is allowed but I would love your advice on how I should spend my time with a quarter (3 months off) before summer begins after my senior year.

Currently, I’m a 3rd math/computer science major @ UCLA and will be finishing up a quarter early my senior year and am evaluating my options on how I should handle it.

I plan on getting another internship in software engineering after I graduate before finding a full time position, I have a good internship this summer but I’d like one more.

I wish to use this time off for either: getting a big project done, going to a software engineering academy/boot camp if it exists to improve my craft, become an apprentice to a practicing software engineering mentor, or try to already get started searching for internship stuff.

I just really want to improve my craft more before trying to get a full time job. What would you recommend I do with my time off?

Much appreciated!"

I finished school in May from a state school with a bachelor's in CS. I have not had luck finding any jobs as of yet, but I was contacted by TCS, and though I have seen some less than ideal reviews I am still interested in joining them. To give a reason on why I am rushed, I have a wife and child and don't make enough money at my current job. I also never did an internship, as I worked full time throughout school. TCS is the first real interview I had, though there are two other (almost definitely lower paying) companies I am also talking to. On to my questions, if anyone can please give me an idea.

I interviewed on Saturday, and felt everything went well. I had 3 interviews that day, one with two guys that was slightly technical, a second with a guy and woman that seemed more logical, then finally after a little more waiting a third with a single guy who made sure I was okay with relocating (I said yes, and said I preferred Ohio). Everything was going pretty well in the last interview, and the guy was making sure I would be okay with diversity (I'm a US citizen, and I know they're Indian), and we were just chatting about the job for a bit. Then it was over, and I double checked it was okay to leave at the front desk, and the girl there said 'you had two interviews?', to which I said I had three.  She sounded surprised in a good way, and said she checked me out and I was good to go.

Then yesterday I got a phone call from an Ohio number, and there was a message double checking about my location preference. When I called back, the guy asked if I would be open to Rhode Island (which was mentioned earlier), but I said I would much prefer Ohio. He said that was not a problem and that they had many opportunites there too. I asked if he knew anything else, and he said they were working on my paperwork and I would hear back in a couple of days.

For anyone who has gone through the Tata / TCS hiring process, how long did it take? And does this seem like good news? I am just trying to get an idea so I can know if I am moving or not, and I can't really find a lot of information by searching. 

Thank you!

TL/DR - How long is Tata hiring process, and is it good if they call you to double check location."

I'm looking at the requirements for jobs and there are so many requirements that I honestly don't have many skills in. 

I have 3 years of work experience as an IS intern as a part of the management team.  I had a pretty broad list of responsibilities, but I did change network paths, close/open/lock ports, and deal with the company wide antivirus program. I am very inexperienced in the ""security"" part of IT, but it is the path I want to take. My fear is taking a regular help desk job for now then having to ""restart"" once getting into infosec, if that makes sense. I don't want to be at the bottom again. Do I need to find internships even after I received my degree to progress my career in the infosec path? 

I've had classes in networks and basic information security. I've dipped my toes in the stuff and know enough to know how little I actually know. I'm currently working on a Network+ cert and will have to get Security+ because I am also applying for government jobs, but those background checks are going to take a while.

Hey guys,

So I recently had an epiphany and started mass applying to internships because I realized as a rising junior I should be looking into those now. Luckily, I got two interviews: an SE internship and a web dev internship. 

For the web dev internship, I did a phone interview, met up with them, and later received an offer. For the SE internship, I did a phone interview, met up with them, but now they want me to do a take home project (a very open ended one using node.js) to present to them at the end of June. I know the general consensus from Reddit is that take home projects are a waste of time, but I asked the people from the SE internship and they said that although they can't guarantee an offer for me until after the presentation, there is a high chance I will be given the position based on my skills and previous interviews with them.

Other factors to consider: the web dev internship offers less in terms of salary and has a longer commute.

What do you guys think?"

I went to a CC, transferred to the 4-year and I went through the program in two years and didn't land an internship.

She wasn't aware of these scams and went along with it. She said while the person was working on her computer, she could see her password on the screen (I'm guessing he talked her into remote access and tried to pull passwords). More unsettling though, is that he turned on her webcam and proceeded to tell her she was pretty. You can imagine how violated she feels having a stranger hack her webcam and then give out unwanted compliments. Luckily, she didn't give out any credit card info. 

I'm not very knowledgeable on cybersecurity so I was hoping I could get some advice on how to help her remove any traces of what happened, and be more secure moving forward. This was on her personal and not work issued computer so I don't know if going higher up in the IT dept would work, but I still want to help.

I already advised that she change her passwords, make sure there's no unusual activity on her credit cards, and from what I've read on this sub, I'd probably want to either run anti\-virus, anti\-malwares to get rid of everything, or wipe the hard drive and re\-install OS all together.

* I'm 23 and my parents have no insurance, nor do I live with/near them.
* I'm going to school across the state and am in a summer internship (paid, but not enough for private insurance) that's in a different state.
* I was on medicaid for a while but it only covered psychological treatment, I needed my coverage transferred to my school's county, but they won't let me move it unless I'm currently going to school. (I start back up in September)
* I need my medication to function, but I haven't had the ability to get access to even a prescription let alone the medication itself. 
* I've been borrowing off of someone else because they don't need it anymore. (Grew out of it, they were diagnosed as a kid.)
* I'm tired of feeling like i'm being teased by health institutions. I need my medication to function. I've been told by so many professionals that I need it and I found the exact medication and dosage that works consistently for me. (Vyvanse 40mg)

Now that the backstory is out of the way, I need your help. 

I'm hopeful that someone on here can point me in the right direction as to how I can find a consistent source of my medication.

If my wall of text was too much, I'm sorry. This was kind of a vent, too.

I've tried researching this term to get a little more in depth understanding but I've only found [this pdf](https://consultations.entsoe.eu/system-operations/common-grid-model/supporting_documents/160204%20CGMMforpublicconsultation.pdf) which states:

&gt; An IGM is defined as ""a data set describing power system characteristics (generation, load and grid topology) and related rules to change these characteristics during capacity calculation, prepared by the responsible TSOs, to be merged with other individual grid model components in order to create the CGM""

So if I understand this correct, an IGM is basically a data model used to monitor/regulate smaller powergrids to regulate the whole powergrid?

I took three classes in 200 level- two on OOP (mostly Java focused) and one that combined data structures with discrete math.

But all things considered, I still consider myself mostly self-taught as I never took enough CS to even minor in it, and picked up a few gaps in fundamentals. I have been in web development since, but I don't consider myself as good enough as the CS graduates from good schools.

So for my reasons of going back to college to finish CS: I feel like I am only good enough for ""bootcamp jobs"" and nothing else. I don't want to do web or mobile forever. I want to go work for Nvidia or AMD and get closer to semiconductor work. And I want to get there through an internship or a co-op, which is only possible through college.

Can I just binge on CS and Math and skipping all the non-essential stuff? Or is there a college that has a Masters program that big tech companies such as NVidia pay attention for hiring interns from?

Getting into low-level semiconductor work especially with graphics is one of my dream jobs, and I feel like it's gonna be 100x easier powering through college than by sending in applications as a web developer with no formal CS education."

I'm a junior planning to enter the Regeneron STS in the fall and am working to at least achieve semifinalist status. I have a research internship at UCI this summer where. I'm not gonna delve into specifics, but the research combines medical imaging, quantum physics, and machine learning. I think I could get a very decent letter of recommendation from the professor. This is my first time doing a formal research. I've also been working on a theoretical computer science research since February, but it's still in the seed stage since I've been learning a lot of prerequisites. However, I'll have a result this fall. I've never done any science fairs, competitions, or olympiads though, so I don't have any big awards. Most of my extracurriculars involve programming projects.

My biggest concern is my GPA. I have a ~3.5 unweighted plus a downward trend. I had an almost perfect sophomore year, but an extremely rough junior year. I got a ~2.7 first semester, and while I improved second semester, my uw GPA was still ~3.5. I'm taking some advanced community college classes this summer and plan to get A's in them. Will the ~3.5 disqualify me from becoming a semifinalist, especially when I don't have any other big awards? My test scores are perfect, but those can only help so much.

Can anyone here provide some insight. Do I still have a shot at semifinalist with my pitiful 3.5? How can I overcome my GPA in this competition?

I know how a lot of these types of posts usually are, so I would appreciate if you read through the whole thing before jumping straight to the end and get the wrong impression.

I started an internship this week doing simulation work. The work is very cool and coworkers are very nice and helpful. The problem is that I didn't really receive any training or anything whatsoever, and was just thrown right into the thick of things (which isn't necessarily bad I guess). I've done simulation work with the software they use before, and never once exaggerated, lied, etc. about my skill set. I told them I was familiar with the software and good simulating practices, but usually had just done relatively simple models, and gave them some of the examples of what I'd done. Now all of a sudden on my first task I've been thrust alone into a simulation problem way more complex than I've ever experienced before, and it's stressing me out.

I am not afraid to ask questions (I ask quite a lot), and I always try to figure things out by myself before seeking help. But with no training, and working completely on my own (though I can ask my mentor questions) on a problem that seems way out of my league given my specified experience, the stress is kind of getting in the way of me succeeding. I am having a really tough time making progress, and I'm not working with anyone else on this specific problem. I feel like I've been put into a hurricane with a pair of floaties.  I just keep getting caught up on the complexities of the situation, and when I try and break it down into smaller problems, each of those come with their own sets of complications. I know what I need to do is calm down, relax, identify what I don't know, and solve from there in small problems. I know they wouldn't hire me if they didn't think I could do it. I know I'm here to learn and shouldn't know everything yet. But the stress is just getting in the way of me keeping a level head. A lot of my questions get answers that result in me having even more questions, and I can only ask them to elaborate or clarify so much/so many times.

To be clear, I DONT feel like giving up. I WANT to succeed and learn this. I more or less wanted to make this post to see if any of you have experienced something similar, and if you good provide some advice.

I'm pretty keen on trying to improve myself as a CS student, as I would like to try getting an internship next summer instead of bar work. With that in mind, I was hoping people here could give me some advice on what I should do. Learn another language, see what GitHub is all about and try doing some projects, try working with game engines, or building a website or something or anything!

I'm quite career driven, so anything that would look good on a CV, or allow me to develop more skills, or allow some creativeness.

Any advice from people working in the industry would be really welcome! Thanks.

I'll try to switch over to computer science but seeing how competitive it is these days, i really don't see that happening.

My aspiration is to be a front\-end software engineer, and I was wondering if not having a pure CS degree will negatively impact me when looking for internships and future jobs in the fields. I'll definitely list that I'm taking a CS minor and list coursework relevant to the job requirements on my resume. I am also willing to self\-study any material necessary for potential jobs and internships, and if i take any formal courses online to help me prepare,  i will add that to my resume as well. I will also showcase any personal projects I have completed on my resume.  But would not having a CS degree be a red flag to employers? Will they automatically see me as having less potential over someone who actually does have a CS degree?

And yes, it would be dope to intern/work for big companies like Google, Apple (I have a connection here so that might make it easier for me), Microsoft, Intel, Buzzfeed, etc. I'm especially worried that not having a pure CS/software engineering degree will hurt me for these big\-name companies.

I am willing to work hard and bring out the potential in myself, but I'm worried about employers not seeing that potential because of my major. 

Here is a description of my major from the college website directly:

    The Department of Computer Graphics Technology touches all aspects of computer graphics, from animation to scientific visualization, and from user experience to game studies. Research projects on these topics push the boundaries of how the medium can be used, while the variety of degree options to prepare students to be practitioners and managers in an array of computer graphics-related careers."

If you don't know what Grace Hopper is, it's a conference for women in computing. It contains tech talks, research presentations, networking events, and the absolute best career fair in the nation (better than you'll find at Stanford). Many companies will reach out to you in advance to schedule interviews at the event, while others do on-the-spot interviews when you visit their booth. If all goes well, you get an internship at Faceooglesoft, get paid $40+/hr this summer, and set yourself up for life.

It's also expensive. This is one of the things that make it unethical, it's a diversity event unaffordable to those who need it most. This year it is in Houston, Texas, so you have to pay for flights, lodging, food, and event tickets. You can be rich, or you can bank on getting an internship out of it so that it pays for itself. Or you can apply for company-sponsored scholarships, many of which close soon. Facebook's GHC scholarship application closes on the 30th, for example.

You have to be *enrolled* at a university to qualify for most of the scholarships, so this notice is aimed at '22, not '23. There may be some available to high schoolers, I don't know.

This has been another installment of ""things I didn't know as a freshman"".

**Edit:** You can also contact your university's CS department to see if your university will pay for you to go. A lot of privates and some publics offer GHC-specific travel grants or general conference/travel grants that you can apply for and use on this.

**Edit #2:** Registration will open July 11, 2018 at 9 a.m. PT. Tickets sell out FAST, so you should ideally know how you're paying before that. The conference itself is Sep. 26–28 in Houston, TX. Professors are used to scheduling tests around conferences and interviews, if you tell them in advance."

This year has been a banner year for me in terms of getting things done, I landed a position on a grant with a really high-achieving advisor and I got my dream internship.  (I am completely freaking out about that last one.)

This next week is the last week of the RAship.  I have been at a conference the whole week and was working my tail off to get my presentation finished and have been working really hard on the grant project.  
My goal was to finish most of my grant work because I have a family reunion next week that I’ve been looking forward to this whole year, especially to get a little R&amp;R the week before the big internship.  Well, that was a failure.  I got all my work in but received a ton of feedback and have a huge additional pile of work including redoing most of the analysis.  It’s about 80 hours of work if I were to really complete it to my advisor’s standards.

I am totally miserable.  Should I skip the reunion if I’m not going to enjoy it anyway?  How am I going to get work done if I’m already feeling this burned out and have the upcoming internship?  Is this the sort of thing you would approach your advisors to talk about, and if so how would you start that conversation?

*I know I wasn’t going to go to the reunion work-free because I am still on the grant, of course I would still get things done.  I guess I was hoping to work in a relaxed state and just put in the hours that are required.  I’m worried they will think I’m doing a terrible job if I don’t get all the work finished…
Thanks in advance for your input! 😊

Since December last year I started applying for internship (placement year more specifically) as this was pressured a LOT by my university. Me, as a newbie unexperienced CS student decided to apply as well just becuase, at worst the companies will say ""no"" to me (which they did for the most part) and at best I would have gotten an intership to improve my current skills. Months go by and in February I get my first interview, and I still applied for other positions in other companies. After few weeks, at the beginning of March, I received an email by the company that I got the interview from and they say they would like to take me in. Now the position I thought I applied for was Technical Support and Assistant. It was pretty vague in the specs on what kind of role I was supposed to do as it asked for JS, SQL, HTML, CSS but never specified the day to day responsabilities. I thought to myself it was vatsly related to web which was fine for me (so webdev right?), but when I got the interview they showed me that basically I am going to fix stuff in websites and that's it. I am extremely upset as I accepted the position as I thought I would have not found anything, which is still true for now,and the university pressure was too much. But that's not what I would like to do in my future career, as i would like to focus myself in ML, AI and something more coding related than ""just fixing"" some clients websites for this company.

I will not start until mid august, but I would like to know, even if unprofessional, I can refuse to go there if I find another internship more related to my interests."

Apologies if this is a repeat.

Little story: First job after a very crappy job hunt for a year (my fault, no impressive side projects, 2.7 GPA, no internships - UofT was brutal for me) via a contact in the company, (in charge of all IT/dev...incredibly lucky) and thankfully they were willing to take on a new grad despite being big data scala+hadoop work. 6mo contract to hire, 4 months in they are looking to convert me. On contract I was offered 60k, but really turned out to be $30/hr at 37.5 h capped a week. I took it without question because I had no prospects at all after hundreds of apps and a handful of interviews.

Now I feel as a new grad hire I'm killing it. In 4 months the only things I haven't taken on is ownership of high level design specifications (understandable) and spark work, both which my technical lead has been hanging onto. I set up TDD, am highly active on process, and take on almost all QA issues in addition to my assigned tasks. I work with business on a daily basis to help them document and analyze, and provide some analysis myself. I put in extra hours whenever needed to get the job done. I feel I've contributed a great deal, but don't own the ideas behind the design decisions yet which is expected since this project was kicked off and owned by the current lead. 

The question: am I wrong for thinking the offer of 65k plus a 10% Bonus (?) is a bit light? The number was unofficial, but my manager was pretty sure about it. I said it sounded good, but now am thinking its low. Would it be a bad idea this early in my career to push for more given my performance? For Toronto fintech/big data is this a fair offer? I was thinking of providing my manager with a toned down version of above as my reasoning for asking higher, beyond the obvious of wanting to move closer to reduce my 3h a day commute + pay off my student loans.

I found my way into my field through internships and self\-teaching.

I've spent a good deal of time exploring Australia as a potential option for immigration, through its Work and Holiday visa   ([https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visa\-1/462\-](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/visa-1/462-)), which American passport holders are eligible for. Though this visa confers 1 year work auth, holders can only hold one job for up to 6 months (perhaps if things go well, I can get sponsored down the road; I would be interested in this, but haven't researched it at this point). As a result, I've been limiting my job searches to contract positions with initial periods of \&lt; 6 months. There appears to be good opportunity. I've spitballed the idea of arriving in\-country with a contract gig in hand, working it out, then spending the remainder of my time traveling Australia/SE Asia/etc and/or doing casual work (it is a work and holiday visa, after all!!), though I am not tied to this idea. I have plenty of savings to get myself started.

To the wonderful folks of r/iwantout, I pose three questions:

1) To folks familiar with the process of going visa \-\-\&gt; perm in Australia, what is there to know about getting professional work on a WHV (which may typically cater to service/ag work)? I am not opposed to ""typical WHV"" work, but working abroad in my field would certainly be an invaluable experience.

2) Given my age, nationality, and skillset, what does pursuing regular employment and gunning for sponsorship off the bat look like in Australia? Are there other countries my profile would find a suitable match in this realm? I've done a bit of looking at Express Entry for Canada.

3) Are there other countries where work in this tech field may be plentiful that I haven't considered?

This is kinda just a rant, but I wanted to get it off my chest. Basically, I am an undergrad at an ivy league school and haven't had a great time with finding/landing internships. I switched into computer science early on from another major because I love the problem solving. But I've come to realize I'm not that good at it. I have a high GPA, but I work really hard for it. I diligently take notes in algorithms classes, do problems by myself, and do outside problems. Regardless, I still struggle with algorithms and find it very frustrating when I see people who don't seem to be trying that hard answer complex questions so easily. Anyways, this lack of natural talent has definitely plagued my internship interviews, and I haven't been able to land anything great. It's hard looking around at my peers and seeing them do so much better (eg google, facebook, airbnb, etc.). I feel like I'm working hard and not really getting good results.

On top of that, during my internship I've bumped into people from mediocre colleges who seem to be more skilled and able to land better positions than me. I appreciate that CS is pretty meritocratic and the school name isn't all that matters unlike some other fields (eg. Ibanking). But I also can't help but to feel that I am wasting my time and credentials doing something that I'm not great at. I always think about trying to do something else like consulting, but I don't even know if I can land something like that now.

I am a (soon to be) second year business informatics (cross between IT and econ basically) student, two years away from my bachelors degree. I am also a part time ""PMO intern"" at a national firm in the financial sector in Switzerland. Basically I attend and minute meetings, create presentations, project charters and create and maintain spreadsheets of various types.

Initially, when I started out, the term of my contract was set to be 6 months, but after mutual agreement (as my manager has been really happy with my work) it was extended for another 9 months. So after a year of working there, the contract is nearing its end and they already approached me and showed interest in renewing a contract with me for a second time.

Now here's the catch - I've been paid a (to be fair - rather competitive)  **intern** wage for a year now. 
But as I have plans to move out of my parents home very soon, I could definitely benefit from a pay rise, that is of course, in exchange for a more responsible/challenging role at the firm. 

(Although I've got to say that the work that I currently do IMHO could already be seen as more advanced than a usual internship)

Is it acceptable for me to ask to get out of this ""intern"" role after 15 months of part time work?  (Well to be precise: 6 months of working full time &amp; 9 months of working 30%)

What even is the average duration of an internship?

I've been thinking about applying to other jobs in hopes of scoring an offer that would meet my expectations more than my current situation. 
Would it be a smart move to kind of put the pressure on them to reevalute their offer? "

I have some coding experience (primarily in Java) and have managed to create some pretty cool projects in my opinion. My first project I did the summer before sophomore year, basically you input a quadratic equation as a string and it outputs a bunch of useful information about it (factored form, vertex form, etc). I didn't know object oriented programming at the time so it's just one big class with a lot of methods.

My next big project I made when I was a junior, we were learning Swing at the time (ik, outdated) so I coded 2048 from scratch and placed pictures over the tiles. I also incorporated some file i/o. This time I included a couple classes.

For my senior project I made a pokemon-like button based game w graphics using JavaFX. It allowed you to save your progress and really showed how well I knew object oriented programming (instead of pokemon i called them Creatures, and three creature builds -beasts, fishes, humanoids- extended the Creature class). Many other features were added, like instead of evoution you could merge Creatures and an algorithm would pick the best traits from each parent and put it into a new Creature. My peers and teachers were really impressed with it.

I'm wondering if it would be beneficial to upload these projects to GitHub. Ive read that uploading projects you've created is great for internships and eventual employment but i'm not sure if these programs are good enough to even bother uploading. I don't want to look like a fool if people see these projects after i've gained more coding experience in the future. What should I do?

I do love the knowledge of engineering and technical stuff, I just feel that I'm not really excel in it.

Prior coming back to my hometown I've applied for Australian Visa because my wife is a Permanent resident there and want to keep her PR status, so I decided to go there. Knowing that I will be off to Australia in 6-8 months, I spent my time traveling, planning my wedding, etc. while I was waiting for my visa.

I have been looking for a job since 6 months or more and find that it's very difficult to find a initial job in engineering, especially for the mechanical role. From what I observed civil engineering and building services are the most in demand in Australia. I did get few interviews and one 2nd interview but get rejected at the end.

There is always citizenship/PR requirement for role that closely related to my major. Mostly because Security clearance.

I am out of hope at the moment for engineering job. I feel that I brought the wrong degree. I though I should have studied civil engineering before.  I am thinking of taking diploma in building construction related /structural engineering later when I get my PR perhaps in 2 years.. but I'm not really sure if that won't be too late for me.

In 6 months it will be 2 years since I have graduated and I won't be eligible for entry level role like graduate program. So I am feeling a lot of pressure at the moment regarding my engineering career.

If there is anyone who has experienced similar situation, what did you do? 

Any suggestions will be much appreciated.



Sorry for the long post.

8pghhi,25,2018-06-07,Worth learning C or C++?,[deleted],computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8pghhi/worth_learning_c_or_c/,"I'm a rising sophomore double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics as of now, and I was interested in eventually getting an internship with Apple. The internship I was interested in required, among other things, skill in C or C++. In some other job listings I've seen on Stack Overflow or LinkedIn ask for experience in C++ or some other language like Java or Python. 



I already am proficient with Java and Python, and very comfortable with Swift, but I was wondering if it is worth it as a computer scientist to learn C and C++ and their low-level memory management techniques. From what I gleaned on wikipedia, C++ is just an amalgamation of *too* many features, and C++ programmers just use a subsets of the language in practice. From this perspective, learning C++ when I already know some other languages seems optional and not very useful.

What are your guys's thoughts on learning C or C++ for computer science enrichment?"
8pgqfy,6,2018-06-07,First generation to go college here; I have a load of questions,necessitaayuda,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8pgqfy/first_generation_to_go_college_here_i_have_a_load/,"Hi reddit!

I'm currently a sophomore in high school, going into my junior year. I'm the first generation of my family to go to school here and I'm generally clueless as to how anything works, and I wanted to ask a bunch of questions because I don't fully understand what I need to get done when, and what my general time frame is.

Right now, what I have right now is a little underwhelming. My GPA is on the lower side 3.9\~4.0 (weighted), I take 5 Honors classes, and I've planned to take 3 AP's next year, an honors class, and 2 AE classes next year along with most of my SAT testing (I'll be taking the Chemistry SAT and the Biology SAT, Math 2,along with the normal SAT). I'm going to be taking the AP Computer Science, AP History, and possibly AP Stats (just because I'm into that kind of thing). This year, I haven't gotten much volunteering in, but with what I have planned for this summer I should easily get 100\+.

So I guess I should start asking my questions:

1. I read online that you start applying in the summer before Senior year. Does that mean I can't fit more into that Summer (because there were courses at Columbia and Harvard that I really wanted to take)?
2. What GPA scale is more common when applying to schools?
3. Do most colleges count Freshman year for GPA?
4. How does Senior year affect GPA?
5. When do I do college tours?
6. How does being a high\-school entrepreneur look to colleges, especially when the product you made is used at the college you are applying to
7. Do online courses do anything for college applications
8. How do internships look on college applications? I have plans for 2, but I'm a little low on time so I want to make sure what I'm doing is good. (They're both in fields I really want to learn about)
9. If you want to take a Pre\-College Course and it has a pre\-requisite that I can only fill Senior year, can I self\-study and still fill the requirements (I need to know some basic calculus for a Data Science in Python course @ Harvard)
10. What are recommendation letters, and how well should I know my teachers to get these.
11. What are college essays, how many do you usually write, how long are they, and are the topics supplied from the college
12. How important is NHS in terms of a college application
13. I play piano, but I've never taken the test. Would taking a test and putting something to my name help me at all (I've been playing for about 10 years)
14. I've heard about racial preference towards Caucasians or African\-Americans during college applications. Is this so, and what does my college application have to do to surpass that bias?
15. I've heard from some places that colleges want to you to get away from home for a period of time. Is this true?

If you know the answers to any of those questions, it would be highly appreciated."

my Ex\-Gf recetly broke up with me. She asked me to text her at some point durring the day every day just to say hi. I did not do this 3 times befor and she said if it happens again then she would brake up with me.

Background to this story:

we are 7 months togeather and she recently started living with me due to money concerns on her end. I geenerally pick her up from work twice a week. I am a grad student who recently started a internship. I was working on a paper tonight thats due tommorw and i lost track of time and did not text her that i would not be coming to get her from work or text her much today. I got several angry texts after 11pm saying how she hates me and i will not change. She baically said that we are done and its over. She recently got home and I told her that i still want to be with her and i want her to stay with me, but i understand why she is going to break up with me and will not beg for her to come back. Maybe i was not pushing enouph for her, idk.

We agreed that the last several months where fun and that we are sorry for how this turned out. I am just ranting becouse I did this and messed up a good relationship that i had and am mad at myself. I feel like i always do this with my past relationships and while i try to prevent it, i seem to always mess it up. im more mad and let down with myself then anyone else.

Please note i dont want a pitty party over my situation, I know my faults and i know my errors and i am working on fixing them, i just slip up sometimes. I am just mad that it cost me my most recent girl

Thanks all

8phkjf,1,2018-06-08,Did my boss just forgot to pay me? How to ask for it ?,FluidReality,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8phkjf/did_my_boss_just_forgot_to_pay_me_how_to_ask_for/,"Hello,

I'm currently doing a 4\-month\-internship as a Data Analyst which I started a little less than 2 months ago. I live and I'm doing my internship in France, where over\-2\-month\-internship have to be paid by law. My convention also states that my internship is a paid one.

Yet to this day, I haven't received anything. If anything, I'm paying to go to work ( transport is supposed to be covered 50&amp;#37; by the company, also stated in my convention). I also asked other interns in other services who have been there longer than me if they were paid, and they all said on the first day of the month.

Of course I can be wrong, but I'm repeatedly told by my tutor that I'm doing great job and that I'm autonomous (He was apologizing for attending to another new intern and not having time to tutor me). I've been publicly congratulated in the company text group for the automation process I put in place to avoid some employees to take 5 hours a day to do it on their own, by those very same people. I received direct mails from my tutor superior and the boss to also congratulate me for the work I accomplished, since I'm working directly on missions that concerns them. I'm also doing overtime pretty much everyday. So I'd like to think that me not getting paid is not because I'm slacking.

Since my internship counts in my academic achievements, I don't really want it to terminate just like that. And I do actually like what I do and learn a lot (but tbh, most of it could be learned working on projects on my own). But meanwhile, I also feel like I deserve to be paid, because it's stated in my convention, but also because I'm actually working. 

How should I approach this ? Should I wait for the end of my internship to claim my 4 months salary ? Who should I claim it from ? My tutor or my boss who is actually personally doing the paiement for the employee (but he doesn't work at the office, so I'll have to either call him or send him a mail) ? What's the best way to do it for someone who is far from being confrontational ? "

8piptv,1,2018-06-08,"Breach of contract - software development. Client in USA, developer in South Africa.",reddit-ulous,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8piptv/breach_of_contract_software_development_client_in/,"Hi /r/legaladvice, not really sure where to turn before hiring a full legal person but then I remembered this amazing community! 

I'll try to keep it short: 

We have a software development company in South Africa. We got a client in USA that wants to build an app, details for this are not relevant I guess. From early on the client was very difficult but it was good money so we pushed ahead, we have a legal agreement and everything. 

The timeline for delivery was around March and the client, every now and then, would fire the product manager in charge of working with us. Client was hiring interns in order to save money (even thought hey have lots of cash), and so over the course of the months we worked together, we were introduced to around 7-8 different product managers. Around February, communication started dropping massively from their side. We kept it up with sending updates and reports and so on, but we were receiving very little feedback (for those of you familiar with app development, there's always a testing and QA control with a lot of back and forth). At this stage we had only been paid for one of our 4 invoices, on a milestone basis, we had invoiced for the second milestone and received no response. 

I tried hangouts (the usual method of comms), emails, skype calls, and no response. Around April I then got client's phone number and called, she responded saying i'm in the rain right now give me a call in an hour (but sounded very flustered). This had been around 2 months now not hearing anything from them (from their side whoever gets fired is immediately cut off from email and we can't reach them). I tried calling an hour and several hours and days later, and received no response. Active avoidance of my calls and anything with my country code. Following that i wrote an email officially saying we are no longer going to work on this project (we had taken a huuuge financial hit and we're a small company earning South African Rands, so a US project was a big deal and we focused everything on it, it was our only source of income).

A couple of days ago i received an email from client's legal counsel saying we are in breach of contract and they are demanding immediate repayment of everything they paid us (under 20% of the total sum). 

Their email states that we are in breach because of unsatisfactory delivery of the application. I went through the contract and there is a section that responds to that immediately: 

*If a delivery date is missed, the Company may, in its sole discretion, declare such delay a material breach of the Agreement under subsection 4(a) and pursue all of its legal and equitable remedies. The Company may not declare a breach, and the Developer cannot be held in breach of this Agreement, of this section if such delay is caused by an action or failure of action of the Company. In such case, the Developer will provide the Company with written notice of the delay and work on the Application System will work until the reason for the delay has been resolved by the Company and written notice of that resolution has been provided to the Developer.*

This is exactly what has happened as far as I'm concerned, they were not responding to any of our emails, they didn't pay us, we tried to reach out several times, they did not respond, then we informed them that DUE to the lack of response we are putting the project on hold (i used that specific term, project on hold, and didn't say termination, wondering if that's an issue). 

I'm wondering what the next step is, I was actually thinking of how we can get the money that they owe us but now they're saying they want money back!

In addition to all this, the brand they've created for the app we were making, they still are promoting! on Instagram and facebook and so on. So this makes me think that what they're trying to do is sue us out of the picture and take the source code (it's really quality code of android and ios in native, plus a very advanced backend with microservices and integrations and features..so it's not exactly a little website worth 200$). 

What does /r/legaladvice think is the best course of action? We burned through our bank account paying salaries over the past few months so I'd rather find a cheaper way than hiring an NY/California lawyer. Additionally, i wanna make it clear that since this is the approach, we get to keep all the IP and code. 

Thanks so much and apologies for the wall of text!"

I don’t have the desire to get out of bed knowing that I need to go to a place just because I need to finish a fucking degree that I hate. 

I’m most likely going to fail my internship and probably not passing this year, but I will not go back at it next year. 

I’m packing my fucking bags and moving out of the country in 37 days now, with or without a degree. 

Fuck it!

8pjadf,3,2018-06-08,Is this internal job posting designed for me?,ABSOLUTELY__BASED,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8pjadf/is_this_internal_job_posting_designed_for_me/,"Hi everyone.

At the start of January this year, I was transferred into a new organization at my work as a means of cutting cost in the other organization. It wasn't performance rated, as I ranked in the top 10% of performers, and also had glowing reviews from my lead, with the last sentence of my review post-transfer saying something along the lines of ""it's a shame we shouldn't keep him"".

What they did as far as I can tell is take the youngest 30 or so people in that old organization and distribute them amongst other groups.

I've been incredibly unhappy with work since then, and have been applying to other companies for the past couple weeks with no response yet. I'd really love to stay within this company, but if I can't work in that old organization then I'm out at my first opportunity.

Since that set of transfers was a cost cutting measure, there's been a hiring freeze in the organization I want to be a part of again since January. *Interns who received offers before the hiring freeze were still brought on.*

This is where my situation is now... yesterday on the company's internal job posting site a number of positions were opened, all of the description ""2019 ___________"". Additionally on the website's filter system on the right, these are all classified as ""Entry level"" postings, which I don't exactly qualify for, having been here full time for 3 years with 4 year's continuous internship experience.

However.

Open the job posting, nowhere in its description are the words ""entry level"", or ""recent graduate"" or anything similar listed.

Would it be worth it to just drop my application in anyway?

Again, ideally I'd stay within this company, but get transferred to the organization where these postings are advertising... But I really just don't think these positions are open to me.

The last thing I'd want to have happen is word getting out of my looking for another job/transfer before I've got anything for sure, just out of risk of losing my current job that I hate.

What do you think, should I drop in an application?

Thanks for any advice."
8pjuy8,1,2018-06-08,Stay in Townsville or follow the money?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8pjuy8/stay_in_townsville_or_follow_the_money/,"I’ve almost made up my mind, but I wanna hear whether what I’m thinking is a solid decision.

So I left uni in December and got an internship at a great nat’l magazine for the summer. It’s a really great program: past interns have gone on to work at The Atlantic, Vice, New York Magazine, The Nation, all places I’m super interested in. While I’d love to continue working there in the fall, they presently have no opening entry level positions in the city I’m based in.

I work in Citysville, but live in another nearby city - let’s call it Townsville. I also work part-time in a bookstore, work that I like a lot but doesn’t pay suuuper well.

While I’ve been looking for full-time work in the city where the magazine is, I’m not wildly optimistic about the job market and don’t yet feel confident enough in my journalistic skills to dive into a full-time job. 

I have had three editorial internships in Townsville, but they didn’t at ALL teach me the things my current internship is. Speaking of Townsville, there are literally no jobs in my field in there. There is ONE newspaper and they hire mid-career journalists. My best bet is to continue to seek work and freelance in Citysville OR apply for work outside of these two cities and go where I’m hired because I have loans and  bills and shitty credit to worry about.

Thing is, the bookstore recently offered me a full-time job and a promotion for when the internship ends. The promotion would come with a raise, up to about $15/hr, and more hands-on experience working with publishers, visiting conventions, etc etc. And I do like the job; rather than just selling books I also get to curate sections in the shop and organize/host great author talks. If you told little 18 y/o English major me this was my life now she’d do a backflip.

I am very very very lucky to fall back from a prestigious internship (in my field, no less) to a full-time job at a cool bookstore offering a living wage. And there are a lot of reasons to stay in Townsville: I got a gorgeous apartment on the cheap, I have friends I want to get closer to (and sort out my intimacy issues), I’ve made some great relationships with local businesses (free movies and discounted wine, hey-o!), I don’t have to do long-distance while my partner finished his media degree, and I’m always only 20 minutes away from my dad. 

Plus, my specific kind of journalism requires I read a lot of books I haven’t yet. I can’t afford to go to grad school, so working at a bookstore, freelancing on the side and devoting a lot of my time to reading before really trying to kick off a career at a magazine sounds like a dream. (I want to work at the New Yorker someday.) At my age (22) I want to start laying the foundations for my adult life: relationships, mental health, physical health, education.

However! Another thing I really want to get right is my money, and student loans are already rearing their ugly-ass heads. Already got a Nelnet letter in the mail. I’m going to try to defer them for six months but after that? I need savings.

And again, ain’t no jobs in Townsville. It’s kind of a toxic city that I don’t like. I’ve tried corporate but that didn’t work out. I’ll still be seeking work in Citysville while at the bookstore - and the bookstore has provided me with some great connections to people in my field so I def don’t want to leave it for a 9 to 5 having nothing to do with it - but I worry about struggling financially for the next, like, two years because I didn’t uproot my life by taking a job in Delaware or something.

So far my decision is to stay. It seems like the mature one, I think: staying to nurture my personal and professional relationships as well as my intellectual developments, so when the time DOES come to relocate, I’ve got a great support system, resume, portfolio, and my partner can come along rather than stay behind. Plus, I’ll be in proximity to the magazine in Citysville in case they ever do start hiring. I just worry a lot about the money because bills sure do pile up, and I worry I’m making the wrong choice because my journalism prof in uni always said to take a reporting job anywhere to really start a career. Plus, freelancing is hard. I’ve done it before and am doing it now but depending on it? Ugh."

If they were to offer me full-time, the salary would be fairly low for my area, and I wouldn’t enjoy the work.

I can either take the full time offer and continue to look for jobs. The caveat is that i do not have access to a car and so commute is almost 3 hours both ways a day, and I have to pay for rent which is fairly high for this area, doing a job I hate since I am not doing any real development work (even if I do get full-time I would only do mostly database stuff which is not what I want), and I will be working a lot of weekends and overtime, while finding the time to interview and studying for them since there is  going to be technical coding interviews.

Or

I can go home to the Bay Area and live with my parents where I don’t need to  pay rent, have access to a car and apply for software Engineer jobs full time, and if I land a job in they Bay I wouldn’t need to pay rent which would effectively more than triple my income. Also, I haven’t seen my family in months, and I haven’t spent any holidays with them for almost 4 years cause of school and part-time jobs, and finally going home would give me that chance.

I am currently applying for jobs and studying, and trying to get something by then end of July.

If I take the full time offer and have to quit within a month, is it worth it to burn the bridge with my current company? Also, this will be my first full-time job after college.

If I don’t take the full-time, then I can say that I decided to pursue other options after my internship ended and I would keep a good relation with my current company, and immediately begin full-time job search without constraints.

What would you guys do in my position?

Thanks again, and sorry for the long post!

My wife has been there for some 18 years now and they are very close. She leads getting his pet projects done and I kid you not they have more of a family dynamic than an employer one. 

I have been at my company for 15 years. I am done trying to figure out how to move up. I wanted to retire from here, but I have no opportunity to show what I can do. There just doesn't seem to be a future here and I literally have been told to stop trying so hard. I have gone back to school for computer programming to follow that passion. I told my wife's boss about this and he was ecstatic. He now has me interning with him in my off hours trying to learn as much as I can from him. He just gave my wife permission to purchase any books I need for my trying with the corporate card. 

I have told him about how hard I am struggling with work and he has offered to bring me in at one of their entry level positions doing customer service for the organization. 

Thus the idea would be for me to work my 8\-5 doing this job, and then training with him after hours and doing projects for him on the side as an Intern.

This has potential to launch my career in IT. I would face a pretty big wage cut, though, and I am pretty nervous about how the rest of the company would view my wife as she is a Manager there. (Different department from where I would be working.)

Any advice to help me decide what I should do? Am i just blindly grasping at straws to make something exciting happen?"

To combat the high traffic of spam/phishing emails we recently implemented a ""Report Phishing"" button into our outlook client, which has definitely helped our employees avoid compromising our network, however every email that gets reported as spam is sent to our IT security team for inspection, which means emails start piling up and sometimes we can't get to all of them or the report goes mia. I would like to start a project that is able to run on a server and automatically check on all reported emails every hour or so, determine if the email is indeed spam/phishing, and automatically send an email back to the employee who reported. I understand that a lot of determining the authenticity of an email comes down to social engineering, which is not something a program can really do, so maybe the program could generate a report that contains each reported email and its status (legit, spam, malicious, could not determine) and then have a user from IT security go through a quickly double check the statuses and hit a button to send the emails back to the user. Would this project be feasible or even useful?

What do you guys do to handle high volumes of spam/phishing that gets through filters?

TLDR: Employees use a ""report phishing"" button we integrated to outlook to send our IT security team potential spam/phishing emails for review. Emails pile up and not all reports get responses. I want to automate this process with a program. Any suggestions or alternative solutions?"
8plrcc,25,2018-06-08,I'm a kiddo who wants to become a theoretical physicist and I have no fucking idea how,marsasola,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/8plrcc/im_a_kiddo_who_wants_to_become_a_theoretical/,"Hi, I'm an upcoming junior and since secondary school, I've wanted to be a theoretical physicist. The biggest issue right now is that there are barely any resources out there on how. All I've been able to figure out myself is to keep researching things, get into a good college, and just further educate myself. That's my greatest passion I guess, to learn and keep learning. I just think the universe is the coolest fucking thing and that's what I want to explore with my life. My goals are to get a PHD in physics and math, then research a bunch of cool shit. My family is loaded so we out here. 

What I want to research in particular is string theory, especially trying to prove the existence of the graviton + observing the higgs boson by possibly getting a job at CERN. I want to explore supersymmetry, specifically by trying to prove the existence of the magnetic monopole, and a bunch of other things. I've taught myself extremely basic calculus to try and better understand the math behind all of these ideas, but I only have working understandings of them conceptually, which is not great haha. If anyone could let me know what they think is important for me to know, I'll study the fuck out of it because I really want to do this. Learning is my drug, as pretentious as that sounds. I just want to be able to understand all of these things, I want to be able to wonder with depth and explore all the universe has to offer, I want to marvel at this world for what it is. Holy shit I sound like a fucking nerd. Anyways, here's some college things, if that matters. 

My top colleges currently are CalTech (dream school! Probably'll never get in, but doesn't hurt to try), Harvey Mudd, UC Berkeley (my dad went here though he's gone now, that might help my chances), Stanford, UC Santa Barbara, and CU Boulder. Unfortunately, they're all reaches besides the last one, and maybe the second to last one. 

My stats are as follows: 

Only two AP's since I couldn't take any freshman year, haven't gotten scores back yet for them - AP Government and AP Seminar (a long-term research class, basically)

Junior year I'll be taking the following AP's: lang, world, art history, physics c, BC calc, and psych

My non-AP class is this thing where you enter a competition called Source America and R&amp;D and R&amp;E something that will ""help the nation"" for first semester, and then find an internship with a STEM institute second semester. 

Senior year I'll be taking MV calc, AP lit, AP research (exactly what it sounds like), quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, AP music theory, AP studio art, and two other classes I haven't figured out yet. Most likely AP econ and AP stat.

Extracurriculars: Will be doing Model UN throughout high school (won a few awards), dropping debate, starting a particle physics and sign language club that I'll be doing both years, and math team throughout high school (honourable mention for a few competitions + gunning for president for next year)

SAT's: literally haven't taken a full practice test since 8th grade (1340/1600) and I'm aiming for 1500's though I have no idea if that's feasible or not for me.

That's all the stuff important to college; I guess my questions are

Is it important which college I go to if I want to become a researcher? I figure it'd be better to go to a more prestigious college so I can ""climb the ranks"" and eventually research there.
 
Are there any theoretical physics programs I can do to develop my learning?

How did you become a researcher at your facility? (if applicable)

Any other information you guys could share would be really great, and thank you so much for your time! 

Edit: Holy shit guys, thank you so much for your insight and time. I appreciate the support so much, especially since this is the first time I've truly talked about this and my passions. I tend not to mention anything relating to this because I don't want to come off as snobby or pretentious among my peers and my parents don't really take me seriously when I talk about my future. It feels really really good to have people who believe in me and are actively giving me advice, which is crazy because you guys are just a bunch of strangers on the internet who don't know me at all. Isn't that something? "

Like the title says, I'm an IT security intern. I'm curious if this sub can recommend any fun projects or tasks that will help me become more familiar with the netsec/InfoSec environment. To disclose a little about myself, I would actually consider myself more of programmer than security, so a lot of my knowledge about computers is centered around program/software development (mostly in C#, but also java and C\+\+). Ideally, I'm looking for programming projects that could be useful to my employer. We are a pretty big company and we already have all the essentials such as web/email filtering, VMs, databases, threat monitoring, etc. I really like this internship, but this past week I haven't been given a single assignment and I've been left to just ""do my own thing,"" and I feel like I'm just not learning. Do you guys have any suggestions for projects or even program that I should try to get more familiar with? I recently installed Wireshark to learn more about network protocols and packets, and it's going well actually but I can't do this the entire summer. Some tools currently at my disposal are Trend Micro suit (DDI, DDAN, anti\-virus), Wireshark, and Visual Studio.

I recently got 2 offers, one at the same company I interned at, doing applications again which I really enjoyed, and another doing embedded for a software consulting/contracting firm. The later involves heavy training, and I don't really have any prior experience with embedded, other than knowing C\+\+. 

So I suppose the question I'm asking is, what is embedded like, I'm starting as a total novice in this area, and the idea of working with hardware/EE stuff doesn't really interest me as much as application programming, but maybe I'm misrepresenting what embedded really is? And then a second question would be if I go into embedded for a few years and don't enjoy it as much, would it be difficult to find work or transfer to a traditional applications software developer? Is  getting pigeonholed into embedded a thing in the software world?

Thanks for reading!"

I decided to take a summer class and I have no roommates. Basically goto class in morning and spend the rest of the day isolated and alone. I hate this, I get isolated, I don't feel like going out, social anxiety creeps up and I just feel worthless being on the couch all day doing nothing but mess with laptop/phone, go on reddit, anonymous apps, and watch youtube, Netflix and the news all day. Like, why am I living? 

I have a year left of college, my parents support me financially, I've yet to have a real job. I used to be so socially anxious. My freshmen year I basically hid in my dorm and only went out for food/water. Next year was about the same but off campus. I tried getting help the end of 2017. Things did get better last semester, got involved in a church group and a couple organizations. My class schedule was also spread out and I was kept busy with just classes and the extracurricular activities. 

Well now it's the summer, and most people I met last semester graduated or aren't in town. I've never really had a close friend to just hang out with, that kills me more than anything. I feel so socially incompetent, I'm 21 and I've yet to have a real job. I guess I could just work at a fast food place, grocery or some other store but I have such high fears of having a mental breakdown or something. Like if I can't work a basic job providing customer service how the hell am I supposed to get an internship and a job after college? Only one year left.... One semester really since I have to do an internship as part of a class for the Spring. 

Idk, I just don't see stuff panning out. I just sit here, alone, isolated, and do things to try to avoid reality, some which may be destructive to me. I hate this. If I killed myself I wouldn't have to put up with it anymore. I see people with friends and doing stuff with their lives and I feel trapped in a box, never to have that. Why suffer? Like I believe suicide is wrong and I think physician assisted suicide is going to just cause more issues. Like, why should I go on? Why should I bother to survive? To not kill myself when others are doing it and governments are promoting it? If I'm merely just a tool to be used, I can easily be replaced by a robot. Ending myself would mean more resources for others, is that not a good thing? 

And people pretend to care ""Oh, don't do that"", do you really care about my life? You don't know me, no one knows me. I bet if my views don't align with your own you would just push me outside like anyone else. I hate this world and humanity. Idk, I'm tired. It's just the same thing, over and over....

I'm hoping you guys can give me some advice. Will try to keep this post short but as complete as possible.

I'm a 23-year old software developer who has been coding since the age of 12, with a strong focus on back-end development. I'm a polyglot comfortable with over a dozen languages (including Java, C#, Python, Go, JS...)

So - since I was 19, I've been working as a developer at different types of companies for 10-20 hours per week total. I have however just finished a 6-month internship (software development, 50 hour weeks) at a reputable company.

I really wanted to work at a specific company, so I got in touch with a corporate recruiter through LinkedIn. He told me they currently only had vacancies for senior software engineers. I figured ""fuck it, why not?"" and applied. We quickly did a phone screening and he stressed how they did not care how much experience someone has or how old they are, but only consider their skills.
This is a big, global SaaS company by the way. They do really know what they're doing, and you have probably heard of them.

At this point I was given a take home assignment which I completed. Their engineering team reviewed it anonymously, and they said it was done at senior level.

After another interview with their engineering lead I was offered a position. As a **senior** software engineer. Without - other than that internship - ever working full time. Let alone as a software engineer.

I am of course insanely excited about this opportunity, but I have a few concerns: I'm hoping you guys can give me some advice on this entire situation.

tldr:

- 23 years old, programming since age 12;

- getting paid to program (part time!) since 19;

- just finished internship;

- have offer for position as senior software engineer.


I have a few specific questions:

* Would you accept the offer? If not: why? (Let's assume you either get hired as a senior, or don't get hired at all).

* What experience/knowledge/... would I miss, never being a junior and going straight to senior (provided their engineering team seems to agree my work is at senior level...)

* What if I decide to leave the company after 1-2 years and take another job... as a junior? How would that look on a resume?

Any advice regarding this matter is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

So I’ve been trying to understand how each of these would affect my career and basically try and figure out which one I should focus on pursuing.

I’m currently a rising senior in college. I’ve had two internships with the same company - decently big and well recognized company where I have been doing a lot of data modeling and analysis which I find very interesting.
Now I find my work pretty interesting but I’m still curious about what else is out there in terms of things to learn. I’ve dabbled in a little machine learning and natural language processing in my free time and found that interesting as well.

My understanding is that an MBA is to progress into a more management position.
Masters and doctorates are to further knowledge in specific fields of computer science.

At this point in time I don’t have a specific field of CS that I want to explore further so I’m not sure if either of the doctorate or masters is a right fit for me. But at the same time I’m told most people don’t pursue an MBA until much later into their career... so I would still have time to consider grad school??

If someone could give me more insight into what these advancements accomplish in the CS industry I would be very grateful!

Is there a big difference between their programs where one is better than the other or is the gap between them small and won't make a difference to the employers or admission team? Does brand name make a difference? Pros of UCI is: I have friends going there from my CC and I would feel like I could meet a lot of cool people there that I can easily talk to. At UCSD I like the campus it is huge and has lots of interesting buildings (UCI is really nice too, I like the park and placement of the buildings around the park in a circle) but I don't think I know anyone going there and it would seem a little bit more difficult to make friends there but it would be interesting to meet new types of people. My dream company is to work at Apple Inc as a hardware engineer working on the iPhone, iPad and other devices. My other choices would be Boeing, SpaceX, NASA, Lockheed Martin, Intel, AMD, IBM and/or Nvidia. What would be a better choice of school to get an internship/job at those companies? What would be the best specialization? I am looking into communications/rf/dsp/optics/controls specializations.

If you're not familiar, it's a computer store similar to Fry's Electronics. It's good experience with IT stuff, but it really isn't relevant to software development, which is what I'm going to school for. Retail is kinda making me miserable -- and by kinda, I mean *really*. I'm dying to get a new job. Like I've even considered going back to being a dishwasher like I was straight out of high school because at least there I didn't feel depressed like every other day.

I did an internship for about 3 weeks with the NFL for the Superbowl in January, which I thought would do me wonders on a resume, but really the only response I've heard from it was ""*That's it? Only 3 weeks?*""

I've basically been looking for a new job ever since. Not working retail made me feel *great*. I started sorta looking around last summer but I wasn't really taking it seriously. I've probably done 60 or 70 job applications, but there aren't exactly loads of new jobs every day that are relevant to my skill level around Minneapolis.

Out of high school, I was attending the University of Minnesota for computer science, but I had to transfer out due to money problems. I'm now attending Minneapolis Community and Technical College and will be getting an AAS in Software Development this fall. I did a year and a half before transferring, so I've done intro-level Python and Java twice now, since my current school didn't accept my CS classes for transfer.

I've known Python and Java for about 3 years, I taught myself to be somewhat familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JQuery around December, and I just finished a C# class as well as a SQL Server class. I have a few projects under my belt but nothing overly big or spectacular. Many of the ideas I have rolling around in my head are well above my skill level and are probably too lofty for one person to accomplish on their own.

I took time to challenge myself on my second run through Python and Java, often finding more advanced ways of solving problems than was required. It greatly improved my ability to problem solve, and my debugging skills have improved a ton as well. My skills are a lot more refined than those of my classmates, yet I see more of them getting job interviews than I do.

I'm having difficulty finding *any* company that will even consider hiring me. I've had one interview throughout this entire process, and it didn't go well. I had to take a 2-hour long test in Java, and it involved interfaces, which I've had basically zero experience with (wasn't covered in either of the courses I took), so I basically bombed the test and never got a call back. I've attended three or four job fairs in the last year, and had many recruiters that seemed interested, but only one ever got back to me after I reached out to them. We were going to chat about a position she had available but then she just ceased contact out of nowhere. I've even looked into IT positions as a back up, but even that came up fruitless.

I've been in frequent contact with a friend who's a developer, but the leads he has been able to give me have come up dry. I've also talked to some co-workers that knew some people, but once again, nothing concrete.

I've gotten a bit disheartened and feel a bit inadequate, and at this point I've just accepted that I'm in for another fun summer of retail, but I wonder if maybe I'm just getting ahead of myself? Should I forget about trying to get a job until I get more experience? Should I bother with a Bachelor's, or will I actually get a job with an Associate's?"

Clearly you need practice"" and stuff like that. Finally when the president showed up, she pulled me into the office lobby while other people were sitting around and she said I had no experience and that I wouldn't get the position. They didn't ask a single interview question. I live far from NYC so I wasted time and money to go into the city for someone who never even looked at my resume before sending an email about interviews. Is this right for a company to do? I get it I'm not experienced but jeez. "
8ptswu,1,2018-06-09,PwC Tranformation Confidence - Basically PMO?,pwcthrowaway321,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8ptswu/pwc_tranformation_confidence_basically_pmo/,"Hi r/ITCareerQuestions

So a little background about me first: I'm in my penultimate year at one of Australia's GO8 universities in Sydney (I guess the American equivalent of that would be a ""target university"" or something), with a double major in Finance and Information Systems (much more interested in the IS side of my degree).

Through networking in an extracurricular development program, I managed to land myself a job as a Project Coordinator in the ITPMO of the same university that I attend.

Now I was also lucky enough to recently secure a summer internship in PwC's Risk Assurance service line - more specifically in the Transformation Confidence team. I wanted to join transformation confidence because I was under the impression that it was all about optimizing business processes and helping an enterprise actually implement their IT transformation initiatives, but as I actually get to researching the business unit more and more, I'm starting to come to the conclusion that it's just more PMO work.

While I don't mind working in PMO now as its definitely taught me a lot of valuable things (i.e. stakeholder management, reporting, data analysis and making deliverables), I know 100% that I don't want to stay here - I would love to pursue a career as a BA or a Digital Strategy Consultant.

So I guess my questions are: 
Is PwC Transformation Confidence actually just glorified PMO work? (If anyone who has worked/had experience working with this unit could give me some insight into what sort of projects they work on, that would be great! :) )

How does one prevent being pigeon-holed into PMO work? I vaguely know, after scrolling through this subreddit, that you need to ""take control of your own career"" which involves talking to your career coach/advisor/etc and networking with the right people. What I want to know more of is HOW you prevent being labelled as the ""PMO guy"" i.e. what skills to learn to stand out and differentiate yourself, what the consulting lines in PwC are looking for etc.

If you yourself have made the jump from PMO to more BA work/Tech Consulting, how did you manage it?

Thanks guys - any and all advice would be appreciated :)"

If I had the ability to go back in time 5 years ago this is what I would do differently. 

1.  Get a summer intern ship every year I was in the CS program. If you do well you can easily get a job because you learn the workflow and stack of the company. This is my biggest regret in college.
2. Go to the seminars the CS program hosts and give them a job applications afterwards. They aren't there just to talk. They are also searching for new talent. 
3.  Get a 3.0 or higher GPA by any means necessary. A lot of employers use it to cull a long list of candidates.
4. Start applying for a job at least a semester or quarter before you graduate.
5.  Practice answering coding questions verbally and doing a shit ton of whiteboard problems. 

If you didn't do these things in your college years than you should:

1. have any basic job to show that you're not waiting for the perfect job to come to you. if you can land one that is a dumb down version of your dream job than get it and be the best at it.
2. keep Practice answering coding questions verbally, doing a shit ton of whiteboard problems, and writing code.
2. ask for family or friends who already have a job to be a referral. In a pile of hundred or thousands of applications you want to stand out and the easiest way to do that is to have a referral. Recruiters can do this if you can impress them but family and friends are often easier to get.
3. Make friends in the industry for more referrals. Got to networking events and start climbing that social ladder.
4. Make your resume as unique as possible. It's a fine line between professional and unique but it's well worth the effort to make your resume pop out. 
5. If you have personal projects than don't just talk about it on your resume. Give them a link to the actual project. I had deployed all of my projects deployed on github IO pages."

We ended up choosing the same course for grad school (we chose the course prior to dating). Things were great at first, but didn't work out in the long run, and we had a solid 3 months of arguing/unhealthy relationship and broke up a year after we started dating. The break-up itself was very rough, and I stopped talking to Sam because he said a lot of shitty things about me to our friends and was generally a POS about being respectful after the breakup. I avoided talking to him as much as possible, which was pretty tough because we share so many mutual friends from our undergrad and grad school, and since we're in the same course we see each other pretty much everyday. 

It took me a while to get over the breakup, but eventually I did and about a year later started dating Daniel. Daniel is a really sweet guy, and he's pretty much the opposite of Sam. Sam was very loud, outgoing, and open while Daniel is much quieter and private. I initially started dating Daniel because he was so different than Sam, and seemed a lot safer. Daniel and I have been dating for a year now, and though initially things were fun and exciting, I find that the qualities I initially started dating Daniel for make him quite boring. He never plans fun things, isn't very excited by anything, is happy just to stay at home and watch Netflix for dates. I was ok with planning most of our dates and fun days out initially, but after a while it just got tiring. I've talked to Daniel about this a few times but nothing has changed, and for the past few months I've been starting to feel like our personalities just don't match well. 


Recently, Sam and I entered a research internship in the same department and see each other very frequently. Co-workers were planning a dinner out, and we ended up sitting next to each other and started talking once again. It was just casual, but we clicked again right away because we have so much in common. At first it was nice that after 2 years of animosity, we were chill with each other again. The amount of stress I had about him turning friends against me and spreading rumors about me was extremely high and affected my mental health. But now, the more time I spend with Sam, the more I see how Daniel's personality does not match mine as well as Sam is. There's a part of me that still isn't fully over Sam, even though he did a lot of shitty things to me in the past and I haven't forgotten it. I'm not sure what to do. I feel so much more lively around Sam than Daniel, but feeling confused because I'm still hurt by what Sam did to me in the past. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I should continue staying with Daniel because he's a ""safe"" option...at this point, I'm indifferent in our relationship and the only reason I haven't broken up with him is because he is a very sweet guy, and I would feel really bad hurting him. I also would never cheat on him (especially with Sam lol) and haven't crossed any emotional boundaries with Sam since we've started talking again - my relationship with Sam is friendly and a bit withdrawn. Is it possible to not be over someone even 2 years on? I've tried my best but it's impossible not to think about him when I have to see him so often because of education/work/mutual friends.  "

I am an international student with a bachelor's degree in bioscience, and I just got the offers from USC and Northeastern. But I am kind of indecisive between these two, and want to hear the opinions from you. My goal after graduation is to be a bioinformatician who can build software that can be used by other people, and I may apply for a Ph.D. degree after I earn the Master's degree.

Here are the pros and cons about these two universities/programs.

Both are not thesis\-driven master degree.

Northeastern University\- Bioinformatics:

Pros:

1. It has Co\-op programs.
2. There are more biotech/healthcare job opportunities in Boston.
3. It has more computer science courses in their course curriculum, especially in data science.

[http://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/science/biology/bioinformatics\-ms/#programrequirementstext](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/science/biology/bioinformatics-ms/#programrequirementstext)

Cons:

1. Northeastern may not focus on pure academic.
2. it uses  Perl as the primary computer language   


University of Southern California(USC)\- Translational Biomedical informatics:

Pros:

1. USC may focus more on pure academic.
2. It has a better ranking, and it may have a better reputation.
3. It is a very new program, so it may only have less than fifteen graduate students per years. The students may have more resources/better faculty\-student relationships.
4. USC is closer to silicon valley. It may be easier to get a job in the technology area. (?)

Cons:

1. Its course curriculum may not make me built a solid foundation about computer science. [https://keck.usc.edu/translational\-biomedical\-informatics/courses/](https://keck.usc.edu/translational-biomedical-informatics/courses/)
2. It is a new program, so it doesn't have graduates statistics about the career path.
3. I cannot find too much job opportunities for bioinformatician in LA on the Internet, and most of they required a Ph.D. degree. It may not be easy to find an internship.

Any opinion will be greatly appreciated!"

Please note that my views about this might be different than advice you hear from other sites or even other posters on this subreddit. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.  

ADMISSIONS JOURNEY TIMELINE

JUNIOR SUMMER ☀️

Get involved with stuff:


Yourself (exercise healthy habits , personal hobbies and projects, READ real books,  practice mindfulness and meditation). 
Your family (help with sibs, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, take care of dinner one night a week). 
Your community (community service—can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects). 

Get a summer job. 

Just an old fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, a willingness to step outside your comfort zone, and determination. 

Practice and prep for the PSAT. 

You take it in October and it helps you qualify for national merit if you score high enough. 

Practice and prep for the ACT and SAT. 
Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of junior year.  Definitely take one in early spring semester.  It’s nice to have testing completed before you start senior year. 

Take SAT subject tests
especially if you are considering applying to highly selective schools. Take one or two in August that fit with classes you’ve just studied.  

Enjoy your summer. 
This is super important.  You need to take time to recharge your batteries.
That’s part of being Involved with yourself. Be sure to just take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff. 

Start Your Resume. 
If you haven’t already, make a list of all your activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year.  Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old fashioned summer or part time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to the more traditional research, internships, and in and out of school clubs and sports. If you use coalition app, you can start on your locker. Keep this list updated throughout the next two years. 



JUNIOR FALL🍁

Pretty much all of the summer stuff applies still.  😁

Add to that:

Take the hardest course load you comfortably can. 
Colleges say that your course rigor is more important than your grades and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. 

Get to know your teachers. 
Visit them at office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. 

Keep up your grades. 

Read  📚Read  📚Read. 

Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. 

Stay involved with everything I listed for summer and also get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or just do individual activities that add to your school environment. 

Keep prepping and practicing for ACT and SAT.  Start testing in the late fall or early spring. 



JUNIOR SPRING🌸

Letters of Recommendation
Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters.  I encourage you to ask junior year teachers who teach you in core academic subjects. 

College Visits🏛
Start visiting colleges if you can.  Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you would consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you.  Just hang out on campus. You don’t have to do a tour or info session if you’re not ready for that yet. Then, if you can go on College Visits for schools you might find interesting, do so. Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also just wander around. Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations.  Do you like what you hear?  Talk to students.  Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night?  Don’t be shy.  They remember what it was like to be a prospie and even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares?  They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Just move on and find a kinder person.  Check out the dining hall and the gym. Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one.  Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable. If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get the feel for the kind of vibe that works for you. 

College List
Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big ole list.  It’s ok to have a ton of schools on this initial list. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter schools out. 

Think about these six fits:

Financial: will you need full financial aid? Will you qualify? Will you qualify for any aid? Do you need full merit aid? These are important considerations.  You and your parents need to spend some time thinking about this and going through net price calculators on various college websites. 

Geographic: what areas of the country appeal to you?  Open your mind here, too. I can’t tell you how many kids say no Deep South or Midwest without really thinking about it, and in doing so, they are depriving themselves of some amazing options and merit aid. Also, do you want urban?  Do you want rural?  Do you want an enclosed campus or one that’s incorporated into the cityscape? Do you want beaches? Mountains? Corn fields? Do you wanna get out of your comfort zone here or stay with the familiar? 

Weather☔️☃️☀️:  also important. If you really really hate the cold, then moving to Boston or Chicago or Maine might not appeal to you. If you have to have four seasons, then the Midwest or the northeast might have good options.  

School Culture : are you looking for that stereotypical American big college experience with the big game on the weekends? Or are you looking for the quirky school ? Or something that has it all? 

School Size:  do you want a big ole state school with loads of options? Or are you looking for something smaller or even mid sized? Do you want discussion based classes where you can develop strong relationships with your professors or are do you want to be in big lectures where you can take notes or go to sleep? 

Potential Major:  if you don’t have one, don’t worry. You have plenty of time to figure that out and it actually frees you up a bit.  If you do think you know, research some schools that might be strong in your major.  Maybe touch base with a professor or two. 

This requires putting a lot of thought into what you want out of your experience and about who you are and who you want to be. It doesn’t require pulling out USNWR and listing the top twenty schools.

Make a NO COLLEGE TALK ZONE 😶
Make a No College Talk Zone in your house.  At my house it was our dining room table.  This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year.  

New College Email Address 
Make a new college only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate!  This is important because then all your info from colleges wont get mixed up in your other emails, and I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to it if you feel comfortable with it.  Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes so you don't miss important info!  

Get in touch or make contact with your high school counselor.  
They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way.

If a college comes to your town or close to your town or your school, go listen.  Make sure you sign up and sign in.  

College Fairs

SENIOR SUMMER ⛱

All the same stuff as junior summer.  (So, rising seniors, read the junior summer info). 

Finish up testing. SAT, ACT and subject tests 

Summer Job 

Be involved 

Take time to recharge batteries 

Take time to care for your mental health and your body. 
Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga.  Get outside and walk or run.  Listen to music.  Have dance parties in your room. Breathe.  Listen to books or podcasts.  Hang out with friends. 

Write.  

Write like a motherf*cker as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself. Don’t worry too much about the essays just yet. Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. Figure out who you are. Use themostdangerouswritingapp.com to force yourself to just get words on paper. This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1.  

Think and Practice Writing the Personal Essay

Remember--no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message, the topic is YOU.  Just focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are.  Don’t worry about being unique; worry about who you are.  Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader.  You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside.  Let the reader know what’s happening inside you. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value.  They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application.   Focus on More Expressing, Less Impressing.  If you’ve read this far and you’re interested in some more materials for creating a less-stress Personal Statement, you can send an email to me at dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com.  

Make a common app and coalition account.  

Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background.  

Update your resume. 

Sign up for information from any college you’re interested in
—even if they’re already sending you stuff. 

Visit Colleges if you can. 

Your List: Start narrowing down your list—including a wide range of selectivities. 

Make sure you have a SFSS (sure fire safety school) 

This is one that guarantees you auto admission based on your stats, that is a financial fit for you, and in a place where you can see yourself. Don’t take this lightly. This is a very important school--maybe even your most important one.  

Keeping in touch with Colleges

Sign up to ""request info"" from the colleges if you haven’t already.  Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for your colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following Common App, too.  Also, it’s ok to contact your regional college admissions officers or the general front desk with questions.

Begin to narrow your college list. Make sure you have one or two surefire safeties that you love and that will be good financial fits, and then a collection of matches/reaches.  

College Spreadsheet

Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges.  Add application deadlines.  Supplemental Essay topics--and look for overlap. Testing info. Contact info for your regional officer.  

Early Action

Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available. Make a calendar of deadlines and work through them one by one.  

Letters of Recommendation

Check back in with your recommenders.  Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can.  Be sure to give them a big thank you! 

High School Guidance Counselor

Check in with your guidance counselor or college counselor if you aren't in regular contact.  

SAT/ACT/Subject Tests

Finish up any testing you have left to do.

Essays

Start writing your essays. Focus first on your Personal Statement.  Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates.  How many Why College Essays do you have? When's the first one due?  Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the ExtraCurricular Essays.  Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. And then group the others.  Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1.  

Interviews

Be sure to check your email (and trash and spam folders for interview invitations).  Every school has a different method for signing up, so read the website carefully.  Some you are automatically signed up. Others require you to sign up yourself. In most cases, they are optional and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity. Don’t worry (as long as you’ve checked your trash and junk mails).  I do suggest that you do them though—even if they’re optional and you’re nervous.  Lean in to your fear, admit it to them, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go. 

LOCI

If you are deferred Early Decision, be sure to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest).


SENIOR SPRING 🌻

Finish up applications

Sure Fire Safety School🔥

Make sure you have a sure fire safety school. If you don't, look for good fits for you that are still accepting apps. 

Keep up your grades

Take time to care for your mental health and your body

Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga.  Get outside 🌳 and walk or run.  Listen to music 🎧. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal.  Breathe.  Just acknowledge that once those little baby applications have flown away from your computer, you no longer have control. 

Emotional Planning

Plan for the worst 😢, but hope for the best.  Acknowledge that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too connected to any college except for your surefire safety.  

Gratitude🙏🏾

Think about what you are grateful for.  What are the good things in your life? Try to make a mental list every day. 

Enjoy these last few months of high school. Connect with friends and family.

Whew! I think I'm done! You can also find this post as a blog on my website: http://admissionsmom.college/mindfulness/wait-what-do-i-do-when/

8pwlgw,1,2018-06-09,Accounting to Law Enforcement / Medical / Sales?,Analyticalnquiry,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8pwlgw/accounting_to_law_enforcement_medical_sales/,"Hi, I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in accounting. I chose the major because I could not decide between premed or engineering freshman year and figured that you could apply accounting to any business including those two fields. I enjoyed learning about accounting during school except that it was much more corporate than expected; I was expecting to learn how to run and operate a small business efficiently rather than the federal GAAP and GAAS rules for publicly traded companies.

Well, fast forward to working as a clerk in a tax office for one year, a temporary contract in accounts receivable for two months, and a three month busy season audit internship and I've had it. I have hated every single one of these jobs and barely made it through each one compared to school which was fun, social, meaningfully competitive and enjoyable. You sit on a computer all day, sedentary, doing repetetive meaningless tasks and it's really very lonely where you can put headphones on practically all day while working, and the hours are horrible. The people are often nice but defeated and silently (or vocally) miserable and stuck. One of my roommates from college overdosed and passed away during the audit internship and made me question ""why am I wasting my life doing this?"" Huge existential crisis ensued which I'm finally coming to accept and understand. The only other areas of accounting I have left to try include tax preparation and staff accounting / finance for a private company or corp, neither of which appeal to me anymore.

I am now underemployed working as a Valet attendant for high end weddings and LOVE it. I would do it for free as a hobby if money weren't a thing. My family has a strong background in sales and I think I should give that a shot even though I'm scared to leave accounting after all that I've been through. I have no idea about my skills or ability in sales but I know that I love interacting with people in Valet and servicing people. The conditioning and marketing I was exposed to during school makes me feel like I'd be giving up a lot of potential to leave the accounting profession which is a big deal because California is so expensive. My dad is an engineer and I've always wanted to make him proud; I don't want to let anyone down, including myself, by leaving a professional career and later regret it. I was always the studious A level student but school was less nuanced than real life. The way I see it though is that some professions that used to be respected, like Law, are no longer great options given high debts and oversaturation. Accounting seems to be going a similar way with new graduates and automated software.

Now, I also have an interest in law enforcement. I've applied and gone through some tests at the local police and sheriff's department. These are very competitive in my area in SoCal and you can't count on a job with them. There's a slim chance that I'll get called in to interview even though I passed all tests (so did 50/75 other guys on my particular test date) especially because I don't have a perfect background in the recent last few years. It's not too bad but not perfect. Anyways, in order to secure a job in law enforcement, I've been considering joining the US Army as a Medic or Intelligence Specialist for ~3 years. As a Medic, I would be able to further explore my long lost unexplored interest in Medicine. The combat training and leadership experience could benefit a career in law enforcement or fire etc. and I believe that I'd for sure get a position in law enforcement afterwards as long as I don't get injured or dishonorably discharged. I am 22 so I'd be applying again at 25 or 26. Or, if I love the medical work, I could study premed classes during that time in the army, use the GI Bill to take a post bacc biology program, then apply to medical school. Perhaps I'd love the military itself and make a career out of that and learn all sorts of fun new stuff like military intelligence, flying helicopters, or something like that. In any case, it would give me 3 years to travel, think, and mature.

I can't imagine living my life stuck in a cubicle for 30 years doing something that I really don't enjoy. What do you guys think?

My concern is that I might be offered a job at company A that I will be expected to make a decision about on the spot. If I pass up this job that I don't think I'll be very good at or enjoy, and then not get the job at company B, I'm' up shits creek. But I would really rather e at company B.

I am currently an undergrad at a state university for mechanical engineering. I am 22, and I know this seems young but I still have about 2-3 more years to go, which means I will be finishing up my degree when I’m 25 (more or less). I am not sure how it is elsewhere, but I have met many people who are younger than me (18-20) but are in the same classes if not advanced. I will be finishing up for my degree within 6 years while I know others are doing it for 4-5. However, I’ve also met some other students who are in their mid to late twenties, going back to school to pursue engineering. They will probably graduate in their late 20s to very early 30s. 

Thus my question is, will age matter that much for companies seeking fresh out-of-college engineers? 

I understand that seeking internships throughout undergrad is important, but I’d love for the answers to also take into account those who are not able to seek out internships for their own reasons (if it matters). 

Thank you all for your time!

8q0yhn,2,2018-06-10,How to overcome feeling lonely/unloved,not-account,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8q0yhn/how_to_overcome_feeling_lonelyunloved/,"Hi, I'm currently struggling with a lot of negative feelings and am looking for advice how to get over it.

First, quickly about me: I'm a PhD student, currently doing a summer internship away from my university.
By the nature of my work, I'm typically working alone, a little bit less now during the internship, and normally don't see people until I leave work. (During the internship I actually have lunch with others)
My field is filled with a lot of people who lack social skills and typically don't want to interact with people. So naturally I made friends outside my field.
I'm very ambitious and have a lot of goals outside of work. I'm learning a language (taking a class), and work out a lot (twice a day on good days).

Now lately my girlfriend kinda broke up with me, but we're still texting a lot and sending photos and she's coming for a visit in a couple of weeks. So I'm not so sure what's the state, but I know once I'm back from the internship, the relationship will be different than it was before. For her it was too much, too soon. For me, well, I can't wait to move in with someone and even wouldn't oppose the idea of having kids.

Now here comes the bad thing. I try medidation &amp; journaling nowadays to deal with my negative emotions, but the day after she broke up with me (although she still spend that day with me), I couldn't help but sit there, crying thinking ""why does nobody love me"". And this feeling doesn't go away. I wake up, feeling lonely, sad, and, for me as a morning person, I'm starting to struggle getting out of the bed to start my morning routine. I've been through a way rougher breakup last year, but this feeling is just killing me. My motivation for anything passes so quickly, and every minute I'm not distracted by doing something, the feeling comes back. I'm still loving this girl, and not getting texts from her is killing me. Meanwhile, I'm at the point where I'm getting anxious about texting her (I don't wanna project that I'm super needy, although she knows that).

If I was at my university, I could go to my councellor and talk to him, but unforutunately, this is not possible. I'm not depressed, and I know it could be way worse (like last year :/). I also don't really have friends I feel comfortable talking to about all those feelings, especially not here. I always had a hard time talking to guys about my feelings, and, well, the girls I've talked to about my feelings kept falling in love with me, essentially destroying the friendship. Don't get me wrong, but talking/opening up to guys is so tough, and I also know people don't like a ""downer"". (I also don't have a any friends at my university that I'm close enough with (I'm an international student)). I further really don't feel comfortable telling my guy friends, even the good/best ones, that I just want someone to hold me and cuddle with.

I'm really trying to reach out to friends now, more and more, but it feels so sad to me, that they never reach out to me. 

I'm not quite sure what I should do to overcome all this, and I'm glad for any tips you could help me to get over this lonely-unloved feeling.

Maybe I should add, that I'm not close at all to my family and when I tried to closing that gap last year, it didn't work out."

Since I've started work I've realized that it's incredibly hard to work on something or with someone I'm not passionate about and inspired by.

Game development is something that I am extremely passionate about. I developed several games while I was in university. One of them was even eventually published to steam, and while it was not super successful, I am still very proud of it. 

I attempted to apply to local game development companies, but didnt hear back from any of them. I live in Georgia so notable ones include HiRez, Tripwire, etc. This surprised me because due to my school, internships and projects I had a lot of success with non-game development related companies.

I have experience mostly in Unity, but I am starting a new project in Unreal since larger studios seem to prefer it.

8q1tm8,310,2018-06-10,My company had a bad year and started bringing in more interns to do the job instead of professional programmes. Time to bail?,csguy77,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8q1tm8/my_company_had_a_bad_year_and_started_bringing_in/,"My company is small and seems to be plagued by a constant series of bad decisions, both on how to conduct business as well as hiring.

Last year our numbers (revenue) were not great, so starting on 2018, management began bringing in interns and even high school kids to help out. A few things that worry me:

- The problem, from where I’m standing, is that they hired a lot of people by giving them average to low salaries and we ended up having 20% professionals, highly productive employees against 80% unprepared, low-performing employees.

- Instead of trying to set the ship straight, they are now expanding the internship program expecting that those of us on the 20% range will teach the interns so that the company can get more productivity out of very low salaries.

- Another reason is that a few of the employees in the 80% group have a good relationship with management and are around 40 years old, so management doesn’t push them as hard as those younger (like me, who am 29 years old), making things hard overall. I don’t complain because my salary is higher than theirs, but I don’t like what I’m seeing.

- They also don’t want to cut people out of the blue because they are afraid of what the other employees may think. The end result? We currently have 6 (non-devs) people whose job could be done by 3, and half of these already showed they are not good at their job, but the money keeps flowing out...

- The second plan they have to future proof the compamy is to develop an in-house product. Management is so convinced that they “have to do something to stop depending on clients” that they got a loan and are betting a couple of months of work to get this product up and running, as well as using some of the client’s work to our advantage.

It will be a disaster as they are not even remotely prepared to succeed and they are betting on a stupid idea for a new CMS system on an already saturated market...

At the same time, we never say “no” to any new work as we “need the money” and can’t afford to lose either the work nor the connection. The end result: constantly overworked...

We hang on because we have a couple of big clients that pay a lot, but, in your opinion, is it time to bail?

**EDIT:** the idea of bringing interns is to teach them and prepare them to do the job so that the company can “invest” on them and avoid bringing in people who a) will cost more, and b) may not be prepared to do the job.

Of course, this happens constantly as they don’t pay a lot, but they never question that aspect. Not even once did they stop to think that the intern may tell them “f* off” afterwards.

*They see this as an investment on the future...*"

I changed my major after a semester sophomore year, but the grades I got (a C, 2 D's, and an F) are still weighing down my GPA significantly.

I'm scared and need advice.,urgkid,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8q33x8/is_it_okay_to_email_my_new_employer_and_ask_what/,"So I got a new job that I start on the 18th however I have no idea what I'm doing.

I interned for 2 weeks at a steel mill in their administration offices. I had really no idea what I was doing, they just told me to log in data through their systems, showed me how to do it and showed me a few other things to do.

Through there I met a guy who works at another company through association of the steel mill (by looking it up, I think his company is a health and safety training company) and his offices are attached to the steel mill offices.

I'm pretty good at faking confidence and am good at fake being bubbly and positive. We got to talking, he said he needed an admin girl and got my email.

A couple weeks after my internship he emailed me asking if I'm still interested. Of course I had to say yes (even though again, no confidence and scared) I came in for an ""Interview"" which wasn't really an interview, it was just us talking. In fact he wanted me to make a PowerPoint presentation on a hobby of mine but when he couldn't get his sign in to work, he said he'll give me 15 minutes to interview HIM for a fake company of mine. It was super weird but again I faked confidence and tried to be charming and funny.

He said he initially wanted someone with experience, not someone fresh out of school, however 3 of his other interviewees didn't show up and I did so I got it.

We never really talked about my role, what their company is doing and what I'll be doing but by the sounds of it, there's going to be lots of changes to this company.. Or something... And my position is rather a new random position (maybe to help with these changes or transitions?? I have no idea) anyways I go home freaking the fuck out because I still don't know what I'm doing really.

He emailed me a few days ago just say how's it going and to say ""you're entering a new company with little systems in place so please think about what may be needed in your role in each requirement. Remember because it is new, suggestion on requirements are welcome. No suggestion is out of place or unwelcome"" 

However, I have no idea what the fuck he's talking about. I have no idea what I'm doing or even what specifically his company does or what my ""role"" is or responsibilities. 

I don't want to show up on the first day completely blindsided. He expects my computer skills to be good and while they are decent, I'm terrified of coming across something that's deemed ""easy"" or ""easy to figure out"" and I'm sitting there making a complete fucking ass out of myself. 

So back to my question, is if bad to email him back and explain what exactly my role is and what that would entail of me? Again, I don't want to look stupid and have him think ""uhhh I thought you knew??"" 

He also mentioned a program called ""zoho"" and he's like ""you know it?"" and I said no but nothing to that nature was addressed again. I've looked it up and researched it of course but I'm going to need to be trained on it but I don't want him to think I should already know what I'm doing. 

Urg! Any help and advice is welcomed. Sucking dick for money seems way easier than this shit."

8q4l66,7,2018-06-10,What to expect when I get out to the real world?,bigazoz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8q4l66/what_to_expect_when_i_get_out_to_the_real_world/,"I'm graduating May 2019 with a BS in CS. I have had an internship at a smaller company that I didn't enjoy. And I'm currently interning at a big, old company, old that people who develop programs are 50+ years old. I wanna know if people feel the same way when they get an internship/job. I feel like I don't know much about company systems and how everything work together and need a little bit of training. For ex, when I started my current internship, they were talking about this software is on the production server, they need to make backup of that server and start developing a new software because this software is too old. Never worked with servers and don't know how. If, let's say I get an entry lvl job as a developer, do they expect me to know how do to backup and how to run a program on their servers? Or should they give me some guidance as to what to do? Right now I'm developing a program but still on my pc, am I supposed to get it up and running on a server by myself?

I developed a program for my company that has a gateway, so all I had to do to run the program was to go to that gateway (ip+port#) and click launch. And the software automatically adds an icon (client mode) on the desktop from which users can use is the future. But I haven't done a programming project (in eclipse for ex) and ran it on anywhere else other than my pc. 

Also, some companies out there have 2-year programs where they train their software developers 6 months in different divisions. For companies that don't have such programs, how much training should I expect? 

Btw I'm talking about newly created programs. Most developers, from what I heard, import existing codes that have been already running on servers. 
Please share your experience at your first job and tell us what to expect :)"
8q4s0l,1,2018-06-10,Life is against me.,SuicidalDumbasss,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8q4s0l/life_is_against_me/,"Every time anything good happens to me it feels like fate wants to strip everything from me. To the point that I want to give up.

So kind of a convoluted story so won’t go into background. Let’s just say the latest incident is very similar to others in my past.

What just happened started a few weeks ago. I got an internship in the field that I love. Something I’ve been working towards for years. It’s across town and the days I’ve had so far are amazing.

Three days before my internship the bank decides two weeks late is enough to take my car (had trouble in the past and it’s a last strike kind of thing). Transit is not an option because it’s about a three hour bus ride or 25 dollars one way for a taxi/Uber.  So since I was starting my dream job I wasn’t going to let that affect my employment. 

I sold a few things, talked to my landlord about postponing rent, and scrounged up about 1500 dollars. Talked to the bank no go, they won’t negotiate at this point. So I go to plan B, but a used car off Craigslist. I had a mechanic friend come with me and we found an 88 bronco 2 that the only problem was the clutch. I was saved my mechanic friend helped me replace the clutch and the starter and flywheel. Car runs like new. 

The day before I start my new job the car doesn’t start. I have some left and decide between taking a taxi and my girlfriends dad helping I could make it through the week. We get through and other mechanic friend helps me figure out what’s wrong. Figure it’s the flywheel we turn it and it starts but I know it won’t start every time, all the parts shops are closed. 

Bring it to the gas station because it was running on fumes and didn’t want it empty when we try to fix it, figuring if it doesn’t start I have people in town that would help push. Well obviously it doesn’t start. And of course not a single person I know answers their phone. So I am now stuck at the gas station for 7 hours trying to find someone. Finally my elderly mom drives 2 hours to come have me hook it up and we roll start it using her vehicle. I get it home and leave it for the weekend.

Mechanic friend comes back next weekend and we find out originally the parts place gave me the wrong starter. So we replace that and the car starts great,we then test it over the next hour to make sure and it’s fine. 

Now comes to today, I get ready to finally buy some groceries and take my girl out and so I stop to clean the car out. It doesn’t start...

I am now 3 weeks into my internship and I don’t know how much longer my girlfriends dad will help me. And i dont really have money for more taxis and landlord is asking me for rent. Sitting there at the gas station for another 4 hours. All I wanted to do is close the door and let the heat take me. At least then it wouldn’t seem like a suicide. 

I know this situation isn’t all that bad, it’s not the worst one I’ve been in but it is the most recent.

I can’t think of any alternative. Everyone would be better off without me, and the world keeps confirming that. Im going to lose my internship and where I live that would mean I don’t work in the industry ever. 

That’s how life works for me. I get good things only so I feel worse when them and then more get taken away.

Sorry this sound whiny and first worldy, I just wanted to get my frustrations out to people who won’t call the hospital because I want to kill myself, that would definitely mean the end of my internship. 


Edit: tldr good shit happens just to be stripped away in a terrible fashion. Because of this I want to give up."

I've always wanted to work in a big corporation for the first one or two years out of graduating, but seeing that I have no internship for this summer, I was going to try and apply to some fall internships or a fall part\-time job that's cs\-related. For this summer, I'm doing some personal projects, taking classes (late switch from another major to CS), and practicing as much leetcode as possible. 

I think I have a solid understanding of DS/Algorithms, but with a low GPA and not much experience, I'm not even sure I can get an interview for me to demonstrate my competence to the companies. 

Seeing as how recruiting is just around the corner once summer ends, what do you think I should do to add substance to my resume so that I can increase my chances of getting interviews and working at a large corporation? 

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks! "
8q5kv7,22,2018-06-10,Snap!,TheWriterTheCivilian,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8q5kv7/snap/,"I woke up a little bit weird today. I don’t know, but my hands felt like they’d been electrocuted or something, vibrating, giving me this peculiar sensation. It wasn’t painful, but it wasn’t pleasing either. I got up and sat down on my bed, staring at my hands and trying to see whether there’s really something wrong with them. But there wasn’t any. No deformities, marks or the like. They looked okay, but felt really wrong.

Maybe it’d be gone later. But now, school was waiting, and I was almost an hour late. Mr. Gonzales, our professor in Intermediate Algebra, wouldn’t be good to me today again. Well, I didn’t really care. He could scold me the whole day. I wouldn’t give any single f\*ck.

The shower felt good and refreshing, and the breakfast was as heavy as it had always been for the last 17 years. Mom is such a great cook, but not much of a good mother. She works the night shift, comes home at around 5 in the morning, prepares me my breakfast, and sleeps the entire day away, trying to recover her energy for another shift at the hospital. Worst, she’s an emergency room nurse. Just imagine all the stuff going on in there every night during her shift. One time, I was there when this guy was rushed after falling from a 10\-story building. His body looked bent in the most inhumane way possible, something that you’d see in horror movies. Remember Linda Blair from the movie ‘The Exorcist’ when she did that spider walk while coming down the stairs? It was something like that, but much worse with blood spitting out from his torso and visible rib bones coming out from his shirt. It was the freakiest accident I’ve seen in my life. I had to imagine all the funny stuff just to get rid of that haunting image in my head.

But, well, mother is still mother. Though communication with her wasn’t as constant and as stable as any other mother\-son relationships, she still provides, even after that damn bastard of a husband left her for another b\*tch. I saw my mom crying every night during those days. Those were the painful days for her. And after recovering from her very long solitary confinement due to heartbreak, she spent more of her time at the hospital.

I balled my fists remembering those times when she was crying the hell out of her. That old bastard. I know someday, I’d get back to him. Someday.

The class was already starting when I arrived, and their heads turned to me in unison when I entered. Mr. Gonzales, hands crossed over his chest, one brow up, tilting his head a little, silently asking why I was late.

“Sorry, the traffic’s quite heavy. You could only imagine,” I let out a tired grunt, trying to sound dramatic for him to be convinced. But I was really panting so hard because I ran my way from the hallways.

“How would that be, Mr. Guzman? Your house is just a couple blocks away from here. I didn’t see any built\-up anywhere in your area,” he answered, coughing subtly to sound suave I guess, words peppered with his own flavor of sarcasm. That’s something that really annoys me with the way he speaks. He quickly arranged his tie, smirking, as if he was already winning the situation. I always hate him. He’s a good professor, but he always lacks empathy.

“You see, Mr. Gonzales,” I started, clearing my throat, “with all due respect, I think it’s clear that I made an effort to come to your class today. That alone says something. I could have just ditched this class and proceed to the next, just so you know. But I didn’t. Instead, I still came because I don’t want to miss anything in today’s lesson,” I said, voice somehow a little higher than the usual to stress my point.

They all stared at me after that, maybe not believing how I answered Mr. Gonzales.

“I see, Mr. Guzman,” he took a deep breath, “okay, just take your seat,” something in his words felt a little bit off. I was actually expecting he’d take my talking back to his office, but it seemed that he just wanted to shrug it off. Or did he really? I wasn’t really sure.

Quietly, I took my seat and got my notebook, ready to scribble down anything useful from today’s class.

“Hey, what a scene,” Mike whispered from my left, leaning towards me, grinning like a silly kid, eyes happily mocking what I did just seconds ago. Mike is this annoying irregular student who likes to follow me around. He’s a year ahead of me, but he needs to take this class for compliance’s sake. I couldn’t really quite recall when we started talking, but he became somehow the only person who I always eat at the cafeteria with.

“Well, he was getting into my nerves,” I whispered back while opening the cap of my pen. Indeed, Mr. Gonzales was getting into me. I was seconds away to sacrificing this subject had he retorted on my last words earlier. Yet, he didn’t.

“But, beware, that lion’s not over yet. You know him. He doesn’t let go of this kind of things so easily,” he answered, leaning back to his seat and concentrating back to the lesson. He was noisily tapping his pen on his desk, creating this repetitive and irritating noise that really gets me.

I shook my head. Silly. Mr. Gonzales would never stoop so low fighting a student over simple stuff. He maybe right down annoying and a complete pain in the ass, but as a professor, his reputation always comes first.

I sighed and darted my eyes to the board. He was talking about quadratic graphs. Damn, I never liked numbers. But, still, I tried to understand what was being presented. It is always hard to force yourself in learning something you’re not interested with in the first place. But school life is a jungle. It’s eat or be eaten.

I took a deep breath and stared at the window. I was sitting beside it actually, and when you try to peer down, you can already see the road below. Shading our class from the outside was this old, scrawny tree that I wasn’t really quite sure the name of. It has always been there since I was still a freshman, standing tall, leaves swaying in the chilly wind of November, rustling as they brushed one another. I closed my eyes and tried to concentrate on the sound of the leaves. It was relaxing, and I was starting to feel sleepy again.

Suddenly, I opened my eyes wide when I felt electricity ran down my hands. It was there for a couple of seconds then disappeared. Then, it went back unexpectedly. This time it hurt, like something slapped my hand so hard. I fell from my chair after that, and everyone looked at me in surprise, gasping, wondering what just happened.

“Sorry,” was all I could say then everyone broke into laughter.

Mr. Gonzales’s face turned sour even more, and I knew I heard him saying something.

“Still causing a scene,” then sighed, shaking his head in disbelief. He turned his back and went back to his lesson, babbling about dilations of parabolas now.

“You’re making a lot of scenes today, James,” Mike said, grinning.

But I didn’t answer him. I went back to my seat and composed myself.

What’s happening with my hands today? I asked myself. I think I need to go to the hospital later.

Minutes passed, and the thought of going to the hospital to have my hands checked drifted away. Again, the lesson went very dragging, and surely I didn’t understand anything about parabolas and quadratic graphs. The hell with them. I was already prepared to flunk this subject anyway. My hopes were not that high. If I were to fail this class, I wouldn't really care.

The tree outside made this very comforting sound again with its leaves rustling with the wind. I stared at it for a good amount of seconds, and gazed on a very weird looking twig hanging loose from it. The twig swayed as the wind passed by, but it wasn’t enough to shake him off from the tree. While concentrating on that one particular twig, I accidentally snapped my pen in half unknowingly. The snapping sound startled me and pulled me back to reality. I didn’t even know that I was holding my pen while in that sleepy trance earlier. As my pen unexpectedly broke in half, so was that twig.

It too broke in half, silently falling from the tree.

“Hey, dude, what’s happening to you today?” Mike asked me after seeing me snapping my pen in half. I got startled by his voice. He looked concerned though while staring at my broken pen.

“I’m not really sure. I was just looking outside the window. I didn’t even know I was holding this,” then I held the pieces of the pen before me, wondering as to how much force would be needed to break this plastic material.

But that twig though. It snapped spontaneously with my pen. Was it just a coincidence?

“Well, I don’t have an extra pen here. But, I think,” then he scavenged inside his backpack, carefully looking for something with his left hand. Finally, he got what he was looking for, an old\-looking pencil.

“Well, that will do,” I thanked him after receiving the pencil and went back to the lesson again.

This time, I wasn’t really sure what Mr. Gonzales was talking about. I was just staring at him, opening his mouth with words which I didn’t really understand, or had the care to even understand. I was staring at him, thinking why this type of a person even became a professor?

I was rolling the pencil in my right hand as I continued to look at Mr. Gonzales, thinking if he even had a life after work. I bet he’s a loser who doesn’t even have any friends who he could socialize to save his failing existence as a decent human being.

I felt another flow of electricity in my hands, but this time, it wasn’t painful. It was running in these soothing and relaxing vibrations. And as I was feeling these strange electric\-like vibrations, I concentrated on Mr. Gonzales’ thin structure, angular and tall. Concentrating on it as the memories of that man from the emergency room played in my head, body bent in the freakiest way possible.

Slowly, I held the pencil in my hands and in a quick motion, I broke it in half.

Snap!

The sound of the broken pencil echoed inside my head, that thin and sharp snapping sound, and so were the screams of my classmates as Mr. Gonzales’s body suddenly and without any cause or whatsoever split in half, throwing blood to those who were sitting on the front row. His split body made a loud thud as it hit the floor. His face was left aghast as his mouth opened wide, puking a good amount of blood. He was coughing hard as blood flowed from him, and seconds passed, he breathed his last.

The panic caused everyone to run out of the room, horrified, faces pale as they screamed for what had just happened inside the classroom.

Mike pulled me out from the room with him, and I willingly obliged. He was also crapping his pants now in complete terror while I was just blankly staring at the lifeless body of our professor who minutes ago was teaching his students about quadratic graphs and parabolas. His eyes were still wide open when we left the classroom, those lifeless eyes that had seen life just minutes ago.

Some police officers interviewed our class after hours of being debriefed by other teachers. We told them what happened. Some were even crying while sharing their side of the story. But not Natasha Go. She was in shock. After all, she bathed in the blood of our now dead professor. It happened right in front of her. She was advised to go and see a psychologist or something.

“You sure?” one old, police guy asked me. Inside this small cubicle in the faculty office, I and Mike were being interviewed. We were the last ones to be interviewed. I wasn’t really sure why. “Boy, no one just split in half like that out of nothing.” He coughed a little after that, and he smelled like cigarettes and booze mixed together.

“I guess that would happen sometimes,” I said. I was not really expecting that to come out from my mouth, but it did.

“Are you joking with me now, kid?” his voice turned serious, and I saw Mike gulped, scared of thw sudden change in my behavior. He pulled my hand as if telling me not to further make the situation more awkward than it already was.

My hand felt electric again, vibrating smoothly, satisfyingly.

“I’ll show you,” I said calmly as I stood and looked for a pencil inside the cubicle we were in. Luckily, I found one.

I got the pencil and held it in front of him with each of my hand at both ends.

“Hey, James. Stop joking now,” Mike nervously pleaded for me to stop, chuckling nervously as he did. But I just stared at him. I thought of that twig that broke itself in half as I was staring at it earlier; then thought of Mr. Gonzales’s slim figure as it split in half, spitting blood everywhere. I closed my eyes and heard the rustling of the leaves from outside the faculty, the snapping sound of that twig that silently fell to the ground.

“Stop this nonsense,” the police officer demanded, reaching to grab the pencil from my hands. But before he could even do that, I opened my eyes and concentrate on Mike’s fatty neck.

It’s sweaty and trembling, and I just saw how it moved as I he gulped another amount of saliva out of sheer terror. What was he afraid of?

The pencil snapped in half, and right before our eyes, so was Mike’s neck. We heard a loud snap from the inside of that fatty, sweaty neck of his before blood flowed from his eyes, nose and mouth. He fell on the floor violently gargling, shaking for his life. I looked down on him as he looked at me with much fear in his eyes.

Finally, he stopped shaking, eyes slowly closing.

The officer was nailed to where he was standing, but was already aiming his gun at me. I saw how his hands shook in terror, not believing what he just witnessed. I turned to him and then pointed to Mike’s corpse on the floor.

“See? They do,” I slowly said, words dragged in triviality.

“Don’t move!” he shouted, voice cracking. “I need someone here!” he turned his head to call for help, but I guess that was a mistake he didn’t see ahead.

On my right was another pencil, quietly lying on a wooden table. In a blink of an eye, I grabbed the pencil and quickly snapped it in half. I saw how he turned and saw me doing that, eyes widened in fear.

Snap!

His head came rolling down the floor as another member of the faculty approached. It was Mrs. Reyes, hurrying her way when the officer called out. It wasn’t long when she realized what was sprawling on the floor, and then shrieked loudly as she saw the two severed heads on the floor. She didn't notice me and hurriedly ran towards the door , shouting for help.

I followed her before she could even open the door leading to the other department.

“Mrs. Reyes!” I cried out and she quickly turned to see me, crying and in agony. “Help…help!”

She immediately left the door when she heard me calling and ran to my aid, trying to put her floppy arms around me.

“What happened there, James? What just happened?” she asked as we were approaching the door. I was clinging to her as well, wild thoughts running inside my head.

“I’m not really sure, Ma’am, they just…they just,” I didn’t continue what I was going to say as I ran to the nearest table, grabbing anything that I could break in half. The first thing I got was a wooden ruler and immediately I faced her, holding the ruler in front of her.

She was now breathing harder than before, and was perplexed at what I just did.

“This is what happened there, Ma’am”

“James, what? What are you doing?” she said, voice trailing, nervousness trickling in her guts. She backed off and tried to reach the door once more, maybe sensing something bad would happen.

But before she could even open it, I broke the ruler in front of her.

Snap!

The wooden ruler fell on the floor, split in half.

And she too fell on the floor, bent in the most unnatural way possible, feet reaching the back of her head as her eyes darted the ceiling, lifeless they could ever be. The blood that oozed from her was the most crimson blood I’ve seen, devouring the white tiles of the cold floor.

Then I heard people shouting from the outside, demanding for the door to be opened.

I noticed that the door was actually locked. Maybe that’s why they’d been calling out for us. There were maybe about three of them. I recognized their voices.

Mr. Yu, our Sociology professor.

Miss Lindy as we call her, the intern from the other college.

And mother.

“James! Can you hear me?” It was my mother’s voice, sounding so worried. “I just arrived. Your dean called me. Please open the door. I want to know you’re okay. And..”

She stopped.

“James?” another voice called out. It was a man’s voice. It was very unfamiliar at first but then it didn’t take that much of a time until I realized its owner.

“Son, it’s your dad. Your mom called me. She’s worried. I’m worried too,” he said softly under that bristly voice of his.

I sighed, then started to breathe heavily.

Why in the world would he be here? What kind of guts does he have to even sound concern for me? After everything that he did to mother and I? Leaving us to live on our own! My eyes widened in anger as I slowly approached the door.

“I didn’t wake up well today,” I answered and then approached the same table where I got that wooden ruler from earlier. Looking for something I could again use, I rummaged into the table’s side drawers.  
The drawer revealed to me something that would be very, very useful at this glorious moment.

A box of untouched and unsharpened pencils.

I grinned widely from ear to ear as I got the box out, and then opened it to get some of those precious drawing sticks.

“I woke up really weird today,” I breathed out those words, teeth gritting in unexplainable bliss.

Finally, one by one, I broke the pencils in half.

I heard screams from the outside. I even heard mom screaming and running away from what she was now witnessing outside. Perhaps, people splitting in half, bathing in their own blood.

I thought of her hard as I heard her shrieking voice. I bet she’s still on her nursing uniform, running away from the sight.

A good cook, but again, in this situation, not a good mother.

I snap the last pencil that I have.

Snap!

Then I heard silence.

I smiled.

I closed my eyes and heard that comforting rustles of leaves again as quietly electricity ran around my hands…soothing and oddly satisfying.

8q7hv9,7,2018-06-11,Is it really difficult to move from a junior level to a mid level software engineer?,anohanaa_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8q7hv9/is_it_really_difficult_to_move_from_a_junior/,"After completing masters in computer science, I joined a big company as a Junior Software Engineer in CA. This is my first full time job right after college. However, I had internship experiences previously in reputed companies.


After a month of my joining, there was another junior guy hired in my team. During my first year, I came to know juniors in my company are promoted after their one year. However things were pretty different in my case. At the time of my annual review, the other junior guy got promoted (who joined after me) while I didn't. This was quite surprising as I was confident about the work I did. During my review, my manager went over things that I should be working on to get a promotion. My manager is NOT a PROGRAMMER. I realized my manager gets idea about my work from a senior engineer, the senior engineer I don't work with. All this was new to me as this was my first job. Based on feedback, I took my work more seriously and I started working harder, sometimes late nights and also on some weekends. 


Second year as junior SWE, my responsibilities increased and I loved what I work. During this year, another junior was hired in my team. In my second review, my manager didn't appreciate the work I did rather he highlighted on other small things and asked me to focused on it. I was so pissed off, I didn't get why was he telling me about his (new) expectations in my final review?? (his expectations changed over time). In my 1-1 meetings, he used to say "" I'm doing a great job and I should continue working like this"" (during these meetings, he also mentioned that he has put my promotion request to his seniors and it's in process) and now at the time of final review, he DITCHED me and tells me to work on other things to get promoted. I was so disappointed after knowing that I didn't get the credit nor promotion for my work that I deserve. 


It's been three years at this company and I have my review in few days. Recently, I learnt that the second junior engineer in my team who joined a year after me is most likely getting a promotion. This person isn't serious about work nor has done anything out of the box. I am not jealous with this but I feel whatever happened with me was unfair. I like the company but I feel belittled and under payed. With all this, I've lost confidence in myself. I don't know what to do. And so, I really need some suggestions from you all. 

a. I started at 70k and my salary today is 73k. If I get promotion this year, I feel my manager may not give enough raise(not more than 5k) . What should I do? How shall I negotiate? 

b. Is 78k-80k salary decent enough for someone with 3+ years of experience in socal? 

c. Is this kind of behavior normal in other companies too?

8q8rar,1,2018-06-11,[Cover Letter] Folks please! A Geophysicist here... I would mainly need some English corrections but any idea is warmly welcomed.,Demacles,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/8q8rar/cover_letter_folks_please_a_geophysicist_here_i/,"Dear Ms. -------,

I am writing to you in regard to the recent job position as Junior Geophysicist at your company. Since the --------- is one of the world leader companies in its sector, I like to keep up with your activities and I consider you a preferential option in my current job opportunities search and my career development.

The first point of the job offer which attracted my attention was the match between the skills and competences required and my formal background as after I hold a degree in Physics I decided to do a Master in Applied Geophysics. The main topics of this master focused in the geophysical exploration methods, specially in seismic and geoelectrical methods, both theory and practice, ranging from scientific and mathematical principles to graphical display of the results and its interpretation, including survey planning and other logistical issues.

I have gained valuable expertise in an internship done in Italy and for the past months I have been working as research assistant at a physics centre in Spain and my contract will soon expire. These experiences have complemented my insight into the working world and have given me teamwork skills, technical capabilities and planning capacities, among other things.

Furthermore, even though my primary motivation to apply for this job lies in the responsibilities to achieve, it is also important the location of the company. My experiences abroad have always been positive and enriching, so I feel inclined to live in ------ and I would not have any problem with changing residence.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application, I would welcome the opportunity to attend a telematic interview to discuss my potential contributions to your company and I am available for a face-to-face meeting if it seem interesting to us.

Sincerely,"

I have just completed my 1st year in chemical engg. from a state govt. college in northern india. The thing is that my interests lie primarily in mathematics and computer science. I didn't get a rank good enough to get CS stream so I am stuck with Chemical. Right now, in the end semester holidays, I am searching desperately for valuable advice as to what I should do now. I am good at basic programming and great at maths. I know Java and C (very basic) and have done a bit of Data structures and Algorithms. I am interested in Data Science, AI, Machine Learning, Cryptography, and Android/iOS programming. I am aware of all these terms but I don't know where to start. I have seen a gazillion YouTube videos and reddit posts.

My first concern is how will I get an internship, get a job in CS, AND get a Masters in CS in India/ abroad?
 And what languages should I learn ? Should I learn Python, R or more? Doesn't data science need some statistics? 
What should a beginner like me do on Github?
What maths topics should I have command over? Where can I study them?
Should I start with competitive coding websites like SPOJ, Hackerrank etc. and how to level up fast ? 
How to do something that will earn Mr certificates, internships, and recommendations that will make my LinkedIn/ Angellist profile hot like lava? 

I have the enthusiasm and focus. 

Please guide me in this dark and dangerous forest . I am completely overwhelmed with confusion and worry. 

P.S.- Please add links of websites and names of books, and whatever courses or places or people related that will be beneficial for me and people like me. Thank you for reading!!!"

I have learned so much getting into the workplace for the first time. I'm a software engineer at a mid sized production plant. I deal a lot with computers and mainly the quality aspect and error proofing. 

I get paid really well and I get a good amount of hours. And I truly appreciate the opportunity to get my feet wet so to speak. But some days I feel......unimportant. like I'm just taking up office space at a cubicle. There are periods that have gone for HOURS where I do literally nothing. I browse reddit and other sites at my desk. 

My ""boss"" (the guy that supervises my internship and tells me what to do) is new to his position as a boss (was less than a week into it when I started.) He doesnt always come in when I do and he only sees me a couple days of the work week. He usually has a few tasks for me that are often busy work (I'm completely fine with busy work) and then he says ""find something to do"" or he just tells me to chill.

Should I be feeling like a burden like this? Or is this the norm for interns? I have had days where I dont stop working and other days where I feel like I shouldn't have even come in because it's a waste of their time to pay me to come in. They want me every day of the week however and sometimes weekends although that's never happened.

* I have an [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). in mathematics from a good school. I worked as a college instructor for years after grad school.
* I've worked as a Senior Data Scientist / Machine Learning Researcher at a few startups for the past four years. My tasks there included visualization/analysis, designing/building/testing machine learning forecasting algorithms in Python/Tensorflow, and optimization of those algorithms (Bayesian optimization). I did some impressive applied work there, but it's not public.
* I left this Data Science job last year. I took some time off, traveled, thought about next steps. I decided I'd like to focus on software development now, as opposed to research / machine learning.
* Once I realized I wanted to do dev work, I spent some time practicing 'technical interview' skills on LeetCode. As it turns out, no jobs I've applied to have tested these types of skills at all.
* From my own personal learning, I know HTML / CSS / Javascript / etc. at a basic level. I've built some small things on my personal website. I've done the official React tutorial, but I don't have any hands\-on experience with Node, Angular, or any javascript frameworks. I did a small amount of work with PHP / Symfony at my first tech job, so I'm familiar with MVC frameworks, broadly speaking.
* I've made it to the final round of interviews for a few jobs. One (more data science\-y) fell through because I told them I wasn't interested in working primarily with marketing data and they realized that would be the main focus. The other, their priorities changed over the (very long) interview process. They made it clear that it was not based on my skills, but they decided they now were focusing away from back\-end work. I figured they were sugar\-coating the response, but some of the people I interviewed with sent extra emails to me the week after the rejection to apologize and make this clear.
* Others failed during the first few steps with the companies saying they were looking for engineers with more product\-focused engineers with web dev experience.
* I first applied to \~15 jobs a few months ago, started getting a few interviews, and I stopped applying to more while interviewing (I was optimistic they would go well). The interview processes took a few months, only to ultimately end with rejections. Last week I starting applying to more, about 15 so far.
* I haven't been applying to internships or listings with low salary offerings. I've been finding job listings on AngelList and HackerNews.
* I'm located in Montreal but I'm also open to remote work (and I have experience working remotely).
* I'm used to job searches going very easily (apply to one job, get that one job). I'm finding this one more difficult.

Anyone have any advice? Some possible approaches I can think of:

* Be patient, just keep searching for the right fit. I would be an attractive candidate in the right niche.
* Work on building some small web app using React / Angular / Vue / etc. If so, what to focus on and how long to spend on this? Does this 'move the needle'? Would anyone care about some small 'portfolio' app that nobody uses?
* Lower my standards and apply for internships, accepting a low salary with the idea of jumping ship soon after.
* INSERT YOUR ADVICE HERE

Thanks!"

I'm almost finished with my CS degree, but I feel like I'm going down a career path that is suboptimal or isn't going to use my full potential. I'm an average student, 3.2 GPA at a great school with a very respectable CS program, and everyone and their mother always told me I'd get a good job out of college. There are two problems in my career plan that are making me very worried though.    

First, I found out I despise programming if it's too open-ended or if I'm not given clear directions. I've discovered that I'm not very good at it in general, even though I got decent grades in tough classes. I just don't enjoy it, and I feel like I'm never doing a very good job. Maybe I'm just not cut out to be a developer or a software engineer. The issue with that is I feel like I'm in too deep and there's no point in changing majors without it being a massive waste of money. I have no plans of changing degrees, and I only need 7 more classes to graduate.    

Second, I had an entry level IT job handed to me by my girlfriend's mother (head of HR department) at a small company; she said it would be great on a resume; said it would be easy and flexible with my schedule, etc. It was all of those things, but it didn't feel like it was even remotely applicable to my degree. I didn't think much of it because it was just a little entry level job and I figured I could use it to show I can work with others, along with the two other retail jobs I had before it. Fast forward a couple of years and I get essentially handed a paid internship as a Network Engineer at a rather large company for the summer, since they liked to see that I had past experience in IT at another business. The job is also IT, and just doesn't feel like it's very applicable to my degree. It's been decent so far, the people are great here and the pay is quite good as far as internships go, and the company has very low turnover, but I can't help but feel like I'm doing something wrong with my professional life.    

I feel like I'm inevitably steering myself down a suboptimal path that isn't what my degree is meant for. I feel like I'm wasting my potential. I searched all over this subreddit for advice on this topic but didn't really find anything. I'm hoping someone can help me make sense of all this. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I have no idea what to do for my career.    

TLDR; Going into senior year at Uni for CS, worked an easy IT job for two years and now in a Network Engineer internship. Internship has been enjoyable with decent pay but I'm worried I'm not using my degree the way it's meant to be used. Feel like I'm going down the wrong career path. I'd greatly appreciate any advice."

I have a question about the process of getting an internship.
I took a more non-traditional path. I was never very organized and had a poor academic past. I Turned things around later in life by switching degrees. I've been doing well and will be getting a Bs in CS soon. 

Now that I am close to finishing. I want to get an internship but I'm someone who didn't much guidance about academic life and or the finer points of getting ahead. I am most concerned about not doing things in the right time frame. How do yo figure out when to apply, are there deadlines and schedules similar to a school semester? Is there an optimal time? Also is it common to get in touch with someone before applying?

I really want to get my foot in the door with an internship at a place that does things in engineering, rather than a startup where I might be doing web development. I know getting an internship at a place like NVIDIA or Sony or IBM is likely very competitive, but I just don't want to hurt my chances by getting simple things wrong like scheduling that have hurt me in the past.
 
Much thanks for any advice."

One is a role at my university with a connection I picked up at a 2015 internship. Civil Servant position where my connect has come in as a director and is trying to transform the garbage environment into something that is commensurate with current enterprise industry caliber. Effectively a “startup” environment. Salary range is 55-70 + whatever an academic role comes with (pension I think..). I have the choice of Full Stack Application Developer or Dev Ops, same salary range. I am confident I can pull the upper end of the range, as I’m skilled and well liked by her.

Other is a no-interview, automatic offer for Software Developer I at a large private enterprise that spun off a Fortune 500 a few years ago. Interned at this place last year on their front-end UI team and am currently interning on their Cloud Platform dev ops team. This company is going through a lot of change as the new CEO is pruning and trying to drive a more tight and successful business. As a result, there were at least one round(s) of layoffs as well as the VP of engineering spontaneously leaving for a CTO position elsewhere. My old manager ended up being part of the lay offs and my old team as reorganized. Still, there are a lot of brilliant engineers here. Salary would be 68-78 + 8k sign on. Not sure where I would be placed here, could be any team dev ops / CRM / many other teams.

My connection is willing to get me in and working soon after my summer at this company ends, a full 2 semesters before I even graduate. The company I’m currently interning at is going to wait until my grad date. But is forgoing any interviewing, which is nice to be honest. 

If I go with the first option, should I go dev ops? I’m interning dev ops right now and think it’s really fascinating and way way more secure a job path than just a generalist web developer. But I’m not nearly as confident with the space as I am with front end, which I am self taught with since I was in high school. My connection is willing to overlook my lack of dev ops know how as they barely even have any dev ops to begin with as they are starting from the ground up on antiquated tech. So I’d learn as I become the subject matter expert there.

Thoughts? Thank you!

We suggested to hold for a few days so we can look over the lease more thoroughly, but the landlord refused and engaged in pressure tactics to keep us. Unfortunately, it worked. One of my housemates checked out the apartment and we signed. Upon further inspection of the apartment, we noticed that the apartment is actually a 2br with an office that is 7 feet by 7 feet, way too small for anyone to live in. It also doesn't have a closet or windows.

The broker was bragging throughout of how he's got many reviews and experience. This seems to be a lease and not a regular sublet. I believe the Broker simply advertised the house for the landlord. Do we have any action here?

We need a place to live for the summer and are worried that the 7x7 room might be unsafe (earthquake and fire standards?) My housemates don't mind living there if we can get a rent adjustment. 

We'll be contacting the tenants union tomorrow for advice as well. Has anyone faced something like this or heard about this happening to someone before?"

I was also apart of a network infrastructure upgrade where I racked  panels and switches and ran cables between them. I'm going back to the  same company for my last internship in September.   
 

I'm a bit worried now on which direction I should take. I was initially  studying for my CCENT but one of my school mates told me dont bother  because Networking is going away with automation along with System  Admins.   
 

So which bolds the question, I dont want to waste my time and effort  anymore, I want to be involved in the hottest market right now which has  en entry point with some certification and isn't going to be automated.  I still want to go and get my CCNA because I enjoyed what I was  learning but I have to think long term.  
 

I know you guys have more experience and knowledge in this field and any  guidance will be appreciated. Currently I' am studying for the A\+  because I have an associates.  
 

Getting an undergrad is also out of the question for me. I want to make  money and be involved in the hottest trend. Everywhere I go people are  telling me it depends on what I want to do, and enjoy and it doesn't  matter as long as its IT and pays well. First world problem  "

One thing that I can say that makes me stand out is the love for computer science, but my parents had other things in mind for me. My parents want me to become an industrial engineer like my older brother and dad. They say that Computer Science is a competitive field, and I know that which is why I'm trying to prep myself by doing projects over the summer. Anyways,  they want me to become like my dad and older brother because industrial engineering is in demand and they don't want me fighting for a job in CS, but I hate being homogenized and having no say for my life.


I was raised in a Christian household, so my mom would pull out the 10 commandments to reinstate that I had to obey her and all that garbage. I spoke with my local church community, one of the members said just to obey and follow. I'm not really devout on this Christianity thing as I was sort of forced into it at a young age. Yet it angers me that this religion is conflicting with my choices in life. Which wants me to separate from Christianity.


Anyways, my mom, who is a housewife, would also bring up my cousins who majored in computer science, one of them who graduated from UCR and the other who is entering Arizona State University. And she goes on this rant about how the cousin from UCR doesn't have a job and that he relies on my aunt for a minimum wage job. She sniggers whenever she talks about them, but I know my cousins aren't doing the best in the CS field as they haven't worked on projects and participating in open-source projects which can be the deal breaker in most jobs. So it isn't fair to compare me to them. My parents have expectations of my siblings with a 6 figure salary.  Whenever we go out to eat she will always try to demotivate me by talking about the future and putting me in the worst scenario. Like how my older brother would be driving an Akira compared to me trying a Kia(Idk she's weird). 


Personally, I think I have fairground going into CS, I am taking AP CSP senior year and trying to self learn Java to gain some competitive edge to the masses of applicants who just want to major in CS because they know how to play LoL or some other mainstream game(which is not an optimal excuse for throwing your competition into already competitive field) and I also plan on applying to the Google summer internship for highschool seniors next year. I want to revolutionize the world through software, but my parents want me to go easy and make CS just a hobby. This destroys my motivation to program and makes me wonder if they are right."

Then the dream scenario for about a years time or so. There are a few points I’m unclear on and, as the vast majority of this subs community is further down the road of entrepreneurship than me, I wonder if you have any advice that in hindsight you’d like to have been able to give your younger self.

p.s I’ve tried to make this post sound as least self-congratulatory as possible but somehow it still manages to come off that way. Please don’t think I’m being arrogant.

So, right now:
I’ve just completed the second year of a social science degree at one of the best universities in the UK, and overall, I’m predicted a strong grade at the end. Right now, I’m working a 6-month, full-time marketing internship at a start-up to increase overall commercial awareness, as that’s something completely lacking from my academic studies. 

Next up:
I’ve got this idea for a type of social media platform which I intend to make a reality once finished at university. There are loads of talks and workshops where I live for people wanting to start their own enterprise and so I’ve been to a few at Google Campus a well as the university’s innovation lab - focussing mainly on branding, management, marketing and the fuzzy topic of start-up culture. 

Point 1 – 
as part of my degree programme, I can take a module/course from any other London university (provided they accept). 

Q) Which area of study would be of most use to somebody in my position? I’m thinking along the lines of ‘organisational behaviour’ but maybe something more in the realm of ‘digital innovation and management’ would be better, or perhaps simply ‘finance’… 
I just don’t know. All seem useful. 

Point 2 – 
I’ve been advised that it would be a good idea to get experience working at a social tech company like Facebook, YouTube or Google etc. particularly because winning over investors with zero experience is virtually impossible. 

Q) Do you think heading into one of these massive companies for a while would be the best direction to take? Would working somewhere smaller where responsibly is more varied be of greater value? 

If you were in my place where would you go to seek advice? 
I really appreciate any input you've got. "

I am interested in getting a software engineering internship the summer of 2019. 

I already did an internship while in high school, but it was illegal, I got the interview 1 week after school ended the same summer I did the internship, and there were no technical interview questions. Some people I talked to said the company is shady.


Anyways, I want a legit, legal paid software engineering internship this upcoming summer. When would be the best time to look and apply? How ambiguous are the applications in general?

I would prefer to intern at a Silicon Valley tech company but am open to interning anywhere in the USA. Google, apple, Microsoft, and the big name companies would be dope to intern at, but I am totally cool in interning at  medium companies and start-ups.

I know the last company I interned at was shady (even though I had a hella fun time there) and want to broaden my horizons the right way. I want to do a legit internship this time. I remember I would watch a ton of movies in my last internship inside my cubicle and no one gave a shit. I want to experience the real deal from here on out. 

Appreciate the advice!

All that just to lead into my questions. My resume is going to be mainly projects, as I have no work experience.

1) Class projects that everyone does are out.

2) what about more ""capstone"" like projects? I could do whatever I wanted as long as I used some of the things from class. Examples of two:

A) guess this song Android app. Pulls info from online top 100. Async calls, plays a received audio file, randomizes possible answers.

B) Java desktop application. Coffee Roasting database manager. Interactive JavaFX GUI, saves information to cloud AWS database instance. Used the MVC design paradigm(at least as best I understood it at the time).

These are projects I came up with based on the class, but are unique and not in a textbook or something.

3) Projects utilizing useful technology that have relatively thorough tutorials online. Example: Java Spring shopping cart. It's a robust application of the Spring framework, which I've read is useful and widely used. But it is a tutorial, not a personalized project.

What would you think of a student listing these projects on their resume?"

It's a part-time position that I have been at for almost exactly two years. I recently started at a paid internship, getting around 20-30 hours per week, at the beginning of June and plan to stay at the job I'm quitting until about mid- to late-July. I know two-weeks is the norm for quitting a job but there are two caveats that make me think I should possibly give a longer notice.

The first is that the job has a monthly schedule that comes out a couple weeks ahead of time which they will start working on about now. If I gave them the notice now, or within the next week or so, then they will be able to schedule accordingly without me for the last two weeks of July. And actually, now that I mention it, does two-weeks mean two calendar weeks or two work weeks?

The second is that I am taking my paid vacation with the job for the first week in July, the 1st through the 7th. So if I give two weeks and want to be done by the July 21st, I will need to give my two weeks while on vacation or on the first day, July 9th, that I come back from vacation.

The position is only part time but we run with a skeleton crew and I'm not concerned with them telling me to just go ahead and be done with the position when I give my notice since it does take a while to train a replacement. But I do like the job and my coworkers so I want to be as decent to them as possible when I quit.

I believe once I'd transfer, I'd be able to get a nice job at one of the big N tech companies.

The reason I want to drop out is because I believe I can be successful in creating my own app/business, and because I hate school. I've been programming consistently for 8 years and have had a software engineering internship for the past 2 years. I think I have the knowledge and experience to create a ""real"" app/business. I'm already working on a few side projects and there's many more ideas that I want to pursue. 

The only reason I see a need for school is to meet people and to get a degree for a higher paying job, but if I'm too busy to meet people and start my own business anyway, then there's no reason to be at college.

It just seems like a lot of work for little to no return.

Do you know anyone who dropped out to pursue an idea for an app or business idea?

Any advice? I'm not sure what to do."

How did you all get started?,Prodsynth,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8qlv89/considering_pursuing_a_career_in_it_how_did_you/,"Greetings all, 24 year old recent college grad here looking for advice and hoping to eventually to get my feet wet in the IT field. Currently, I have a BA in Sociology but have no intention of pursuing a career in that field. My indecisiveness in choosing a major is what led me to pursue my degree. As of late I've been asking around and it seems that many of my friends and acquaintances enjoy their IT jobs. The only experience I have that's even remotely related to the field is the handful of PC's that I've successfully assembled for myself and my friends, and the followup support that I've given them afterwards. I understand that some of those things may apply in the field but I do think that I'm comparatively *okay* in regards to my computer literacy, and am absolutely willing to do what it takes to further increase my knowledge base.Aside from my not\-so\-robust technical experience, I've been working in customer service as a sales associate for three years and counting, which I believe has allowed me to make great strides in my interpersonal and communication skills.

In addition to the question posted in the title I'm also wondering if anyone else started out in a situation similar to mine, and whether or not a post\-college internship is as effective since I neglected to take one during my time at school. Thank you for taking the time to read this!"

But I obviously don’t want to reject a job offer without a backup plan.
How do I express interest in the position, but also let my supervisor know that I’m still going to be actively searching for other full time opportunities? He hasn’t brought up contracts or offer letters yet, he just gave me a week to think about it before discussing further at our 1-1.

I've recently been afforded the opportunity to take a leadership role in our dev team. Boss is getting promoted, so he needs someone to start overseeing things while he is spending more and more time away from the office being involved in more stuff. This means a minor promotion for me, while still needing to keep up on my projects/research.

I have a few years of developer experience, mostly as a contractor/independent developer. I've been at my company for just under a year. I was in the military for 8 years, where I had a couple of years experience managing teams (between 4 and 20 people at different times)... And I was a terrible boss. I do NOT want to repeat those mistakes. I've learned a lot since then, made my apologies where required from back then, but I'm feeling a bit like a fish out of water with this opportunity because I know just how bad I was before.

So what books or experience or resources have you all found to be effective in learning about managing software teams? We have a couple interns, a couple full time guys, a couple who aren't geographically located, and myself. 

Any pointers in the right direction?"

I was wondering if anyone had any resources they suggest using to learn (I've gone through a few DataCamp and Rosalind resources) and recommendations on how I should practice (I've been using Idle, but have seen Python ran on Terminal and Spyder(?) on YouTube tutorials).
DataCamp has been helpful in getting me familiar with Python syntax but I feel like I retain more of the information when working with Rosalind. Unfortunately a lot of the Rosalind exercises are getting a bit difficult for me to understand now, but I'm optimistic I'll get better.

My end goal is to work outside of Toronto with a Software Engineering job with better real earnings (NYC, Bay Area, Seattle, etc). California would be nice, looks fun there.

Even though I got good high school grades (96&amp;#37;, great supplementary), I didn't get UWaterloo or UofT (because of how competitive CS is nowadays) so now I'm at a school that has a fourth\-year internship program (Instead of Coop terms). I would maybe be able to land Canadian 4\-month internships for my first and second year summers, though after my third year, I'd engage into a 16 (sometimes 12) month internship that proceeds until my fourth year.

I don't think I can get american internships after my first/second year, though I'm trying for the Google Practicum and Microsoft explorer. Though I don't know if it's worth sacrificing my internship year over applying for an american internship after my third year, because of the significantly greater quantity of experience. I know that it will be difficult getting internships after fourth academic year because most companies are looking for students actively perusing a degree; I'll have my degree after my fourth academic year. I don't know how valuable a bay area internship is considered and if sacrificing my internship year is worth it. I was thinking about maybe american companies would consider the experience a quality \&gt; quantity sort of thing, or vice versa.

What should I do after third year? Internship year or apply for american internships?

Can I even get an american internship considering my minimal experience, or is it only for coop programs with coop terms during the fourth year?

How do I make myself competitive for these internships and prepare for them?"

I am a PhD student who is in his fourth year of Computer Science PhD. I have completely lost my motivation and have not been making progress for quite some time. It has taken a huge toll on my life physically and emotionally and I have come to the conclusion it's in my best interest to drop out. I am planning to look for a software engineering job.

My only experience in the industry is a software engineering internship that I did last summer (not one of the Big 4, but close enough). I do have a couple of programming projects that I have on my resume from a couple of years ago, but none from the last year (My PhD work is in CS theory).

To be clear, I have not dropped out yet, my funding was recently renewed for one more year. I have not burnt any bridges with my supervisor or the department. My supervisor still believes in my but he is not able to spend a lot of time with me because he is very busy. At this point, I just want to cut my losses and restart my life. Putting in very long hours and being constantly stressed without any tangible progress or results is making me depressed and suicidal and hence this decision.

 
My questions are

1) How can I express this information in my resume in a positive manner? I'm just afraid that the ~3.5 yrs spent in grad school and not finishing will send my resume straight to the trashcan, especially since my PhD work was mostly theoretical and the competition is so fierce. 

2) Is there anyone else who is/was in the same boat? I would love to hear about your experiences."

8qoy82,65,2018-06-12,Odd Things at the Lighthouse,lightkeeperharper,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8qoy82/odd_things_at_the_lighthouse/,"Reading similar entries from people detailing the strange happenings at their own places of work inspired me to start an account and share some of my own experiences in my own offbeat occupation. I’m sure you’ve read about some, including Evelyn in the lonely radio tower with the creepy birds. As for me? I’m a lighthouse keeper and yeah, I know, it’s a generally obsolete position but for some reason, the owner and people living nearby find it still to be a requirement. I don’t exactly know why but I would assume it has something to do with the strange things that happen around here. And hey, it gives me something to do and a place to live so who am I to complain?

I do have trouble determining whether or not I’m going crazy sometimes, though. Most things I’ve grown accustomed to, such as the three ghosts that wander around and the lone orca that remains in the bay even when the others are off doing orca things. I’ve learned how to distinguish the sounds of my house-mate, if that’s what he would be called, from creaks caused by the wind or scratching on the porch from Bartok’s little batty claws. Bartok is a flying fox, by the way. He’s super cute and loves it when I leave fruit out for him.

I’ve even gotten used to the evil deer that I swear wants me dead for some reason. By ‘gotten used to’, I mean that I’ve developed the routine of checking the surroundings through every window before stepping outside and I always have my keys ready when I have to go to the actual lighthouse tower. When I see her, I wait half an hour and then check again. This means that sometimes I prepare for my duties and attempt them hours before I’m required to do them.

All in all, it’s a pretty neat place and job, I have to admit. Sure, it can be lonely, just like that radio station I’ve read about, but I’ve long been used to being on my own and if I ever find myself craving human interaction, I just have to go to Andrew’s door and be reminded of how much I can’t stand most people. Andrew is my sort-of housemate or neighbor. The keeper’s house is actually a duplex with separate entrances. It was originally set up this way so that there were living quarters for a keeper and their family, along with an assistant and their own family. Now, the assistant, Andrew, is more or less here so his parents don’t have to have him under their personal roof.

Honestly, it didn’t take very long for me to become acclimated to those things. I think I struggled the most with Andrew and his party-boy antics and least with the bat that has taken up residence in the rafters on the porch. Did I mention how adorable he is? At least I think it’s a he. How can you tell? Seriously, if you don’t know what a flying fox looks like, go look up videos on YouTube and let your heart melt. Also, invisible internet gold star to anyone who knows where I got his name from without having to Google it.

I’ve been here for two months and the really strange things didn’t start happening until recently. I think I should clarify that a bit. Strange things seemed to happen almost immediately upon my arrival but didn’t freak me out as much as the ship that appeared yesterday.

The forecast was sunny with a few clouds, a beautiful day. Around eleven in the morning, I was awoken by a phone call from a local boat tour company. The woman calling, Barbara, sweet lady, apologized for waking me up and asked if I knew anything about the storm they saw rolling in while they were out with the morning whale watching group. I groggily rubbed my eyes and told her no but I would look into it and give her a call back with what I could find out. She thanked me and I hung up the phone.

Part of my job is to stay up during the dark hours to monitor the lighthouse in case anything happens, if I need to change out a bulb or see anyone in any type of danger or anything strange enough that warrants a call to the local authorities. That being said, waking up before noon isn’t something I’m used to or enjoy in the slightest. I’m typically a horrible grouch when woken up without warning. Although I guess being woken up, there really isn’t much that can be done as for a warning. Either way, I knew that there was no way I would be able to start making phone calls before I at least had a few sips of coffee.

As I made my way down the stairs and into the small kitchen to start brewing a pot of brain juice, I looked out of the windows as I passed them. There was one facing the way, directly in front of me as I got to the bottom of the stairs, and I saw that there really was a thick, dark cloud looming on the horizon. I sighed and continued my way-too-early shuffle into the kitchen.

Once my mug was halfway gone, I grabbed the list of phone numbers off of my fridge and began making calls. First, I called the nearest weather station which confirmed that there was no storm expected for today. When I told them that I could see the storm cloud from where I was, they brushed me off and said that they weren’t picking up anything on their radar.

Great, I thought, they think I’m full of shit. I ended the call with the man who honestly sounded like an idiotic intern and dialed the number for the local coast guard station which was relatively closer than the weather station. They also said that they weren’t expecting a storm. However, they agreed that they already had a few people call in about it and they were preparing to take calls by anyone caught unawares in the water. I was just glad that they admitted to knowing it existed, despite both of us being told it didn’t exist.

I had one more call to make before notifying my boss, the lighthouse owner, of the non-existent but plainly impending storm. That was to Barbara. I let her know what I had found out and advised her that if her company was planning on taking any more groups out, they might want to reconsider. Not only did I think it looked like it could be a bad one if it hit, but the Coast Guard was also preferring people stay on land for now. She thanked me and promised to send some cookies. I looked down at my stomach and the small amount of weight I had put on recently and told her that wasn’t necessary.

The owner’s wife answered the phone and quickly handed it off to her husband. She never seemed very interested in the goings-on of the lighthouse and honestly, I’ve always gotten the impression that she thinks it’s a waste of time. I can’t blame her. The only people that seem adamant about keeping this thing going with an actual on-site keeper are the locals and I know she was born in a big city further inland. The owner, a man who insists I call him Brian as opposed to Mr. Insert-last-name-which-I’m-not-going-to-do-for-privacy.

He sounded jolly until I told him about the storm that didn’t show up on any radar. His typically Santa-like demeanor changed to one more solemn and he sounded almost robotic as he went down the list of things for me to do before the storm hit. I needed to check the lens, the bulb, the backup generator, turn on the beacon, make sure the door was locked up and lastly, check on Andrew. I would have preferred replacing every bulb and cleaning every glass pane in the damn tower rather than deal with Andrew. But the boss’s orders are the boss’s orders and I wanted to keep my job. If I was lucky, Andrew would have stayed at his girlfriend’s house and I wouldn’t have to deal with him at all.

I went through my duties and before returning to my own home, I walked up the steps that led to Andrew’s door on our shared porch and knocked. No answer. I pressed my ear to the door but heard no movement. I knocked louder and again, listened through the wood-looking-fiberglass door. There was still no sound coming from inside. Sighing, I pulled a ring of keys out of the front pocket of my hoodie and flipped to the one labeled ‘ASS FD’. I chuckled to myself thinking that the label matched the current occupant to a T.

The moment I got the door open, the stench of stale beer and cigarettes wafted into my face. I scrunched up my nose and turned my head to take a deep breath of the outside air before continuing.

“Andrew?! Are you here? Your dad wanted me to check on you,” I called out to the bachelor pad.

“Hrmmf,” I heard from the kitchen. I rolled my eyes and let out an annoyed groan. I tucked the keys back into my pocket and entered the house, deliberately leaving the front door wide open so it could help air out the smell of lazy testosterone and poor decisions. When I got to the entryway of the kitchen, I looked around it to assess the situation. Andrew was on his stomach on the floor, obviously having slept there, with a can of beer making a puddle on the floor just inches from his outstretched hand. An ashtray was overloaded with cigarette butts and empty cans littered the counter and table, along with a few half-crushed in various spots on the floor.

“Fight with Mia again?” I asked him, crouching down to help him up.

Although he refused to move, he at least spoke, “Go away, Harpy.”

“It’s Harper,” I corrected him. Harpy was his version of a not-so-fond nickname for me, the person appointed to be caretaker of not only the lighthouse where his father exiled him but also the caretaker of him. At least, that’s how he’s always seen it. Me? I see myself as more of an annoyed neighbor who keeps him from drowning in his own vomit as opposed to being his jailer.

“Go away,” he reiterated, his mouth struggling to move against the floor.

“After seeing you like this? I don’t think so. Come on, let’s at least get you up and on a couch. There’s a storm coming in and with any luck, maybe the window will break while you sleep in the living room and put you out of your misery,” I said. It’s no secret that we don’t really like each other. Maybe I was being harsh, but sometimes you have to break a few eggs to get the parent-funded brat to get off the kitchen floor.

“You’re a bitch,” he said. This time, though, he at least started to push himself up with his hands planted on the floor. I looped an arm under his armpit and helped him get to a kneeling position. Then I stood and offered him a hand.

“Maybe I’m a bitch but you’re the one passed out on this nasty floor. When was the last time you mopped, anyway? With something other than beer?” I asked relatively calmly but didn’t bother to hide the disgusted expression my face involuntarily made.

“Fuck. Off,” he spat, emphasizing each word. He batted my hand away and I shrugged as he gripped the edge of the nearby table for support. He glared at me once he was on his feet. I waved two fingers at him with a tight, very annoyed grin, and then I walked out the door, letting it slam behind me.

Out over the water, the storm clouds looked threateningly closer that I remembered seeing them only a few minutes before. I was distracted, looking at the sky, when I tripped over a brick that hadn’t been on the porch before. My chin slammed into the wood and I landed with my wrist bent in an odd position under my ribs. I propped myself up with my elbow and laid there for a second, examining the inside of my mouth with my tongue. I found a small chip in one of my teeth and cursed under my breath. Looking ahead of me, I saw a slimy little critter perched on the railing near my door. I glared at the dark four-legged thing as it tilted its head and looked at me with beady little eyes.

“You okay?” Andrew’s voice came from his doorway behind me.

“Fucking Sal!” I shouted in a burst of frustration aimed more at the salamander that was still observing me than the man-child checking out the loud noise of my body hitting the wooden planks of the porch. For the record, Sal isn’t the salamander but that’s where he got his name. Sal is a ghost, a pesky one at that. He likes to pull pranks and be a general nuisance all while leaving his calling card of a live salamander every time. I have no idea where the hell he gets them or why he does it. If you’ve read Harry Potter, just imagine that Sal is similar to Peeves. He’s an ass, a relatively harmless one, but a complete ass nonetheless.

“Damn, you can still talk,” was Andrew’s response. I heard the door close before I got back to my feet.

“Shoo,” I waved a hand near the amphibian as I opened my own door. I was ready to relax with a movie and another cup of coffee but not more than ten minutes later, there was a knock on my door.

“What now?” I grumbled to myself while I got up and answered it. I raised an eyebrow when I saw something entirely unexpected. Another salamander, a dead bird, hell, even the ghost of the little old lady that likes to bring my attention to problems around the lighthouse, I could handle. What I wasn’t sure how to handle was what was at my door: a more awake looking and apologetic Andrew with two mugs of steaming coffee in his hands.

He gave a sheepish smile and offered me a cup. I hesitantly took it and held it under my nose, looking at the dark liquid and giving it a deep inhale.

“What did you put in it?” I asked him.

Andrew rolled his eyes, “Nothing. At least not this time. I wanted to say sorry.”

“Why?” I asked him incredulously. It was rare that he ever had anything nice to say or went out of his way for anyone. In the short time I had known him so far, he preferred to make it clear how much he disliked my presence instead of being a good neighbor and appreciating the times I dragged him up the stairs and got him into his house when he was too drunk to manage steps.

“Well, from what I’ve seen you don’t have any friends and just because you were hired to look after me-”

“I was hired to look after the lighthouse. You’re just an add-on that I didn’t know about before,” I interrupted him.

He frowned and opened his mouth up to continue but I caught a glimpse of something behind him and held a hand up to silence him. Seeing my confused expression, he turned around and followed my gaze. I took a step out onto the porch, standing beside him, and we both stared at the new addition to the scene. Out in the bay water was a ship floating under the stormy mass. Lightning flashed and I felt like nature did it on purpose right at that moment. I handed Andrew the mug of coffee back and ran inside to grab my keys.

“What are you doing?” He asked.

“I can get a better look at that thing from the tower,” I told him as I shut my front door and began hopping down the steps.

“You should stay here and call it in,” he called after me. I ignored him, my curiosity piqued. Sure, it’s procedure to call in any ship or boat that was stationary for too long or looked out of place but I couldn’t be sure yet that this one was either of those.

Only a moment later, I heard rapid footsteps approaching me from behind and glanced over my shoulder to see Andrew catching up. He silently followed me to the door and then up the stairs once I unlocked it. I grabbed a set of binoculars that we stored in the tower and stood close enough to the glass that there wasn’t even an inch between it and the field glasses.

“Let me see,” Andrew nudged my shoulder within a few seconds.

“Dude, chill,” I said harshly. He reminded me of an obnoxious younger sibling. “It looks like it’s just sitting there with the, what is it called, the bow, I think, facing us.”

“Do you mean the front of it? Then yes, it’s the bow. How do you not know that?” Andrew responded.

“I didn’t exactly grow up on the coast riding yachts, okay?” I spat back at him, taking a moment to pull my face away from the glass and glare at him. He snatched the binoculars from my hand and began to look for himself.

“What the fuck?” He said.

“What? What is it?” I asked, nervously.

“It’s made of wood. Ships that large aren’t made of wood anymore. I think it’s a Spanish Galleon or something,” Andrew said, looking me in the eyes.

“Is that bad?” I asked, my anxiety officially setting in just from his furrowed brow and the glint of worry in his expression.

“We need to get inside. Now,” he commanded.

“We are inside,” I replied.

“No, dumbass, we need to get in the house. Move, now!” Andrew dropped the binoculars on the shelf as he pushed me towards the stairs. I jogged down them as quickly as I could, being careful not to lose my balance but also trying to stay in front of my annoying companion. I locked the door once we were outside while Andrew bounced on the balls of his feet. The instant I began to pull the key out of the lock, Andrew grabbed my arm and pulled me in the direction of our house.

Halfway up the timbered boardwalk that served as a pathway from the living structure to the actual lighthouse, thunder boomed venomously overhead. Now, I love thunder and it instills a sense of comfort usually but this thunderclap sent a bolt of unbridled, inherent fear through my entire being. My breath hitched and I paused, looking up at the sky. Above us, the bright and sunny day had been overtaken by clouds so thick and dark that if I didn’t know what time it really was, I would have thought night was almost in full swing.

“Let’s go!” Andrew hollered and yanked my arm again. I looked back at him and caught the panic in his eyes. I followed without a retort and we bounded up the steps and into my side of the duplex. He shut and locked the door before leaning against and it taking a few deep breaths.

“What the hell has you so freaked?” I asked, after catching my own breath. I really needed to get in shape.

“We have to call this in,” he said, then quickly added, “And not to the coast guard.”

“What? Then who do we call it in to?” I asked him, flabbergasted. If it was such a big deal, shouldn’t the proper authorities know?

“There’s a number on your call sheet for the office that handles this, it’s at the bottom. Call that number. Tell them that there’s an unauthorized wooden ship anchored in the bay with the bow facing land. Make sure you tell them that it’s made of wood. I’ll call my dad while you do that,” he commanded. I still don’t know what was weirder about that moment, the ship that seemed to come out of nowhere in a matter of ten or fewer minutes or the fact that Andrew was for once seeming to be a responsible, and insanely freaked out, semblance of an adult.

I just nodded in response and left him in the living room while I made the call in my kitchen. The number on the sheet was at the bottom, in red font unlike the rest of the page that was printed in black. Instead of a normal title of the department or business I was calling, it was only labeled ‘Emergency Events’. The phone rang twice before being picked up by a man who didn’t give his name or the name of where I was calling.

Unsure of what exactly to say and having no idea if this should was the correct contact, despite what Andrew directed, I spoke hesitantly, “Uh, yeah, I’m Harper and I’m the keeper of a lighthouse.”

“Harper, what’s the event?” His response was short and unemotional.

“There’s a wooden ship floating in the bay, facing the land,” I continued, still hesitant.

“Is it anchored or stranded?” The man asked.

“It looked like it was anchored. It’s not a little boat, either,” I answered.

“Shit. Okay, thank you, Harper. Please remain inside with all doors and windows shut and locked tight. We advise you to also cover the windows and refrain from looking outside if at all possible. If you have anyone with you, please request that they stay indoors as well and it would be a good idea to play music or anything with audio as loud as you can,” he told me. I was about to ask about the odd audio suggestion but he hung up before I could.

“You have an awful lot of action movies for a chick,” Andrew said when I walked back into the living room. He was bent over looking at the shelves of movies I had.

“What can I say, I don’t like most chick-flicks,” I shrugged while beginning to ascend the stairs. I needed to check and make sure that all of the windows were locked up tight and it wouldn’t hurt to get at least one more glance outside before the storm actually started to hit. My heart dropped when I saw a black dorsal fin rise out of the water in the distance.

I returned downstairs and asked Andrew, “You think the whale will be okay?”

“Whale?” He looked at me with a confused expression. I lifted the curtain and pointed through the window to where my ocean friend was meandering.

“Oh, him, yeah he’ll be fine. He’s been through some shit,” Andrew shrugged it off and moved my arm so the curtain would fall back to be closed.

“Oh yeah? Like what?” I asked him, curious about the aquatic creature. As pathetic as it sounds, that whale is probably my closest friend. But that’s a story for another day.

“Just stuff,” Andrew gave a half-shrug and held up a movie: Terminator. I nodded and he put the DVD into the player.

“I also have Netflix, you know,” I told him after I plopped my butt onto the couch. My arm bounced against the arm of the seat and I winced in pain, having forgotten until that moment that I had fallen on it pretty hard.

“Yeah, but Terminator,” he answered with a goofy hand gesture that mimicked an explosion. I let out a sort of laughing snort.

Andrew stayed the entire afternoon, evening, and night. At first, I kept mentally questioning why but once the really freaky shit started happening, I was glad to have some sort of company, even if it was someone who typically acted like a spoiled punk that I could hardly stand to exchange words with.

It was just after eight in the evening and Andrew was complaining that I only had wine and no beer in my house when an unusual sound began. It was difficult to hear over the pounding rain and thunder but after it happened a few times in rapid succession, I knew it was something separate. It almost sounded like heavy hail or small rocks hitting the ground. Initially, I was confused as to why it sounded like it wasn’t hitting the house at all and was going to take a peek out of the window but Andrew cautioned me not to.

“Why not? What’s making that sound?” I asked him. He obviously knew more than I did which wasn’t a surprise at all seeing as he grew up in this area. What was beginning to frustrate me to no end was that he was refusing to explain.

“Trust me, you don’t want to know,” was all he managed and probably all he wanted to say before the sounds picked up and added the roof and exterior walls to the assault. I sat, frozen on the couch, watching the covered window for any sign of what might be causing the noise. If it had only been hail, Andrew wouldn’t have told me not to look, right? What if he was just trying to freak me out and all of this was a crazy prank on the new girl? My blood began to boil as I considered the possibility that everyone was in on this joke. Did they bribe the person I talked to at the weather station?

“Okay, enough is enough. What the fuck is going on?” I demanded, standing up and trying to make myself seem as imposing as possible. Andrew paused the movie and jumped to his feet then took a few steps to stand face to face with me. Well, more like face-to-chest. I’m really not all that tall. He set his jaw and stared into my eyes until I began to feel rather unnerved. I tried to hold my composure and strength but found myself taking a step back and running into the couch with my heels, which in turn caused me to just fall back down on my butt. At least I felt on the soft couch and not the porch again.

“Fine,” Andrew said, the single word sounding sharper than half of the knives in my kitchen. I stood back up and he gestured for me to follow him up the stairs.

When you go up my stairs, there is a sort of balcony type landing to the right which houses a large bookshelf and floor-to-ceiling window. He led me to the window and drew back the thick blackout curtain a sliver, then pointed for me to look out of the inch-or-so-wide gap. I looked out and on the other side of the glass, the world was dark, making it difficult to determine shapes of anything. Lightning flashed across the sky, illuminating our surroundings, then thunder boomed within seconds. With the light, though, I was able to see something not only covering the property but the ocean, as well. There were dozens, maybe even hundreds of twister-like formations, swirling and moving around, hovering above ground and water. My first thought was honestly that they were a bunch of dust devils but my mind quickly pointed out how much sense that didn’t make.

I looked up at Andrew who was looking above my head at the weird twirling things, then I looked back out of the window. Just then, one grew taller and something small hit the window about knee-level with me. I jumped and Andrew closed the curtain, being sure that there was no space left open.

“What are those things?” I asked him. He sighed and began descending the stairs without answering. I tried again while I followed him, “Andrew, answer me!”

He picked up the remote but gave me a look before pressing play, “No idea.”

I dropped the issue and tried to tune out the barrage of what I could only assume were small pebbles against the house. When the movie we had been watching ended, I leaned over the opposite end of the couch to look at the shelves while Andrew stood, trying to pick one out from the top.

In the minutes of silence, I realized everything outside had been quiet for a while. Without really thinking anything of it, I bounced to my knees and parted the curtain next to me with my fingers. Andrew wasn’t quick enough to stop me and I can be certain that I will never do that again. When the lighthouse beacon swept over the yard, I saw something slithering amongst the grass. I’m not sure slithering is even the right word.

It had slimy looking almost transparent appendages like that of a jellyfish that it used to crawl along the grass. Instead of the domed gelatinous head that they’re supposed to have, it had one looked as if it was elongated several feet. A faint orange light pulsed from somewhere inside the goopy looking shape and with a few more rotations of the light, I was able to make out what looked like the tips of antlers sticking out of the very top of it. The orange glow, however, revealed the insides of it where solid shapes seemed to float about as if in languid water or some sort of liquid soap. It took some focusing for me to make out the bottom of the antlers inside the odd shape and then another moment to distinguish the form of a small human skull being sloshed around with each movement.

I didn’t realize I had screamed until Andrew was standing over me, pulling me away from the window and shutting it again. The noise rang in my head and ears as if it was the remnants of a lingering nightmare.

“Dammit, Harper, don’t you ever keep just let things go?” He growled at me. I sat in shock, not moving or speaking for a few seconds.

Finally, I was able to stutter out, “H-hu-human skull.”

Andrew sighed and turned back to start the DVD he had decided on.

“What the actual fuck?!” I yelled when he didn’t say anything. Determined to understand it. I looked out of the window again. I know, how stupid can I be, right?

The jellyfish-like creature was at the bottom of the stairs to the porch now and I gasped, letting the curtain fall closed once again.

“For fuck’s sake,” Andrew rolled his eyes and physically picked me up off of the couch and put me in the oversized chair he had been seated in. He commanded with a finger in my face, “Now fucking stay.”

I nodded silently. There was no way I could concentrate on the movie, though. I knew that thing was right outside the house, probably on the porch even. What frightened me the most is that I couldn’t hear it. The dust devils or tiny twisters or whatever the hell they were at least made noise but this thing was completely quiet even when the thunder wasn’t rumbling. At one point, Andrew even peeked out of the curtain and told me that it was still outside.

We stayed up all night watching movie after movie until I ended up passing out in the comfy chair. When I woke up, I swore that I would never do that again, though, as I had been curled up and now my legs had not only forgotten how to unbend and work but they felt as if they were hardly even attached to my body.

I managed to grab my phone off of the floor where it must have fallen in my sleep and I saw that it was only 10:28 AM. Why the hell was I up so early? I groaned and looked at the also stirring Andrew on the couch.

“What time-” he began to say but was interrupted by an extremely loud creaking groan from outside. I jumped to my feet, a bit unsuccessfully and had to steady myself on the chair. Andrew bolted up to a seated position and we both looked at each other.

“What was that?” I asked him. He peeked out of the window and then threw the curtain back, revealing sunshine that was pretty blinding to my eyes. After blinking and rubbing them a few times, I focused outside and saw the ship still in the distance.

“There,” Andrew pointed as if I hadn’t already figured it out.

“Thanks, Captain Obvious,” I retorted and crossed the room. I knelt on the edge of the couch and braced myself with my hands against the windowpane while Andrew shifted to give me room as we both watched.

The ship was cracking from some unseen weight or pressure. It was difficult to tell at first, due to its position, but when the bow rose up, it was tilted just enough to see the stern doing the same. The entire thing, sails, mast, rigging, hull, all of it, was being folded in two. We sat there, staring at this thing in transfixed amazement and terror as it crunched and screamed, wood snapping and splintering into the water around it. I’m not sure how long it took but we stayed there until we saw the last tip of the mast disappear below the water’s surface like something had pulled it down carefully.

“Okay, now what the hell was that?” I asked Andrew once it had completely vanished.

“Uh, I honestly can’t say I’ve seen that before,” he answered.

“Well, you’re a huge help,” I said.

“Whatever. I need a beer. And more sleep,” he stretched and stood up. Without another word, he left my side of the house and went to his own.

I haven’t been able to go back to sleep. I’m too confused and honestly freaked out. Maybe a jellyfish monster wouldn’t scare most of you, in fact, I’m sure it probably wouldn’t, but there was just something about it that terrified me to my core. It was almost like a primal fear took hold of my gut and said ‘hey, idiot, this thing is ba-a-a-ad news so leave it alone’. It’s getting late, though, and I know that the lack of sleep is going to make for an extremely long night. I have to go to the lighthouse and check on everything, including turning it on for the night hours.

I think I might see about talking to my buddy, the orca, for a little while, so long as the deer hasn’t returned. When I turned off the beacon earlier, that demonic hell-spawn of Bambi charged me. I was barely able to get the door to the tower closed quick enough. I have no idea why she hates me but I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if “deer kills lighthouse keeper” is front page news one day. There are still some really odd things that happen around here that I’ll have to share in the coming days.

Oh, and I did find out what was being thrown at the house: shells. They’re all over the porch and boardwalk and ground outside. What really gets me, though, is that they look like snail shells."

I'm an incoming freshman, intending on Haas with Econ as a backup. My IB credit will hopefully place me out of all the UC requirements, so I only have the Breadths left to fulfil; ECON 1 should also be placed out of. Let me know if this is an OK schedule for first semester\-\- any advice, or things you would change are welcome!

Math 16A\-\- taking the relatively easy math route, since I heard that it doesn't matter for Haas admissions, nor for internships

UGBA C5\-\- interested in entrepreneurship, only 2 units though.

UGBA 10\-\- almost full, so will probably have to pick something else

UGBA 39AC\-\- the grade dist looks nice but 4 places left, so will have to pick something else as well, as it's almost full.

ASTRON C13\-\- genuinely interested in the topic \+ nice grades (PhysSci breadth too)

Ideally, I would take something like SLAVIC50 instead of 39AC but the former is full as well. Any advice on what I can substitute the almost\-full 39AC and 10 with?

I know that this post reeks of freshman ambition, but it is what it is.

Thank you!"

I graduated from college recently and was able to get an internship at a really big tech company.

This company is located in numerous places in US (and in other countries).

The department I am interning is small and the HR manager told me that if I do end up getting a full time job I will be relocated to different place.

When my internship is done, does companies usually offer a full time job?

If they do offer me a full time job, do I have to go through technical interview?

8qpx20,1,2018-06-13,Has anyone else found temping to be kind of humbling?,lazinessepitome,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8qpx20/has_anyone_else_found_temping_to_be_kind_of/,"I guess for me it's been sorta eye-opening being able to temp at a law office. It feels like I'm a high school or college intern a little. Actually, it feels like I'm lower down the totem pole than that. 

I can't tell if I'm not getting enough work because I haven't been fully trained, my supervisors don't trust me yet, or they just figured, eh that person is only here temporarily. It's been quite humbling to walk around to my supervisors at the office and ask for work a couple times a day, when most of the time they don't give me work. 

Quite honestly, I was a little surprised because I've been used to getting decent amounts of work as an intern and a volunteer in some of my past experiences. I guess I just need to lower my expectations. I'm thinking maybe my supervisors are too busy to train me or don't think I'm well trained enough to do more. Granted, it's only been two days at the same place but I'm scared that my supervisors won't give me more work and that I'll be left twiddling my thumbs for most of the day.

It honestly kind of sucks to be the new person, especially a new temp. Like I walked over to two of my supervisors' desks to ask them if they needed help with anything, but hadn't noticed that another one of my supervisors was chatting with the two people and I felt so awkward. I totally was like I'll come back later, I was just asking if you guys needed help. I guess my timing was a little off but I got a weird vibe from the girl I interrupted. At that moment I felt like I really didn't belong.

Anyone have any good experiences as a temp somewhere and/or advice on fitting in better with coworkers? 

Quite honestly, I'm thinking I'd rather intern than temp somewhere (for the future anyway)."
8qqw5t,6,2018-06-13,"I'm bored really quickly, what do I do ?",DownloadPow,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/8qqw5t/im_bored_really_quickly_what_do_i_do/,"Hey ! 

I'm 20M, and I get bored really quickly about things I do. I got my Bac ( A\-level, basically high school degree to get to Uni ) in IT, it sucked. I went to business and languages ( it was 90&amp;#37; languages, 10&amp;#37; business, accounting etc.. ), I loved the English and Economics courses, but I hated the way it was taught. It was like a giant future unemployed people factory ( Universities in France suck, unless you go to a private school, which cost a lot ). And I found the translations, grammar studies etc.. really really boring pretty quickly.

I worked for a year and a half at McDonald's, for a few months at 2 different supermarkets, and I found it really repetitive.

After 2 years in business and languages, I was supposed to study abroad in Sheffield, but one night ( a month and a half before leaving ) I decided to spend the money to get my motorcycle licence, because I figured I only wanted to go to Sheffield to kind of test myself, and travel and speak English, and that there are lots of other things I like.

I had a few weeks to find something to study this year. I thought about sports studies, biology ( biology is one of the only thing I've always liked, but I'd like to live really comfortably, and retire as early as possible to travel the world, get into other hobbies and discover more things, in France biology is definitely not a money\-making field ).

Eventually I found a private school where I learnt ( this year ) a bit of programming, webdesign and webmarketing.

I got my internship in a broker's company as a webmarketing assistant, and I'm finding it boring, I do SEO all day long, and it's far from what I want to do with my life.

I like creating things, programming an hour or two, moving on to doing a bit of SEO, writing articles, then doing a bit of video editing, going to the gym, teaching things ( I taught a thing or two to a few people at the gym, and had some really good talks ), talking to people. I hate doing only one thing at a time, and only one thing in one day. And yet, all the jobs I know of only focus on one thing. And I'm supposed to choose one job and stick to it for the next 40 years. I have a blog project that I'm slowly finishing, and I'm loving the blogging thing. I have a few more professional company ideas ( and writing that makes me feel like I should go with it ). You can talk to me about pretty much anything, I'll find it interesting and chances are, I'll look for more information about it. I've considered pursuing a career as a plane pilot, military, architect, broker, biologist, writer, VFX/GFX artist, vet, firefighter, surgeon, teacher, sports coach, marketing specialist, and I'm forgetting about other job ideas.

I have no official diploma ( I didn't finish my Business and Languages bachelor degree, and the year I spent at the private Web school didn't give me a diploma, I knew about it though, because we're supposed to do the Master's degree at the same school, using what we call "" Alternance "", it's basically sandwich courses, 2 weeks at the company, 1 week at school etc.. and the company pays the school for my master's degree, which is like 15k€/year ). So I don't have a diploma, I can't get a "" real "" job right now, most companies in France give jobs to people who have degrees, experience doesn't do much here.

I can do the Master's degree, but I have only 3 months left to find a company to pay for my studies and hire me, and I'm pretty sure to get mono in 3 or 4 weeks, so I'll be exhausted 24/7 for at least 2 weeks, which is a huge red flag for recruiters. And even if I find a company and get my master's degree, what am I supposed to do afterwards ? What career can I possibly pursue if I get bored after barely a couple of years ?

TL;DR : no official degree ( yet I studied for 3 years after high school ), I get bored of something after a year or two ( except sports in general, but I like to change my workouts everyday ), and I know I can't spend 3 years straight doing the same thing everyday. What do I do ?

Thanks !"

I eventually landed a position as a part time unpaid intern and did that for 7 months while doing my delivery jobs. My schedule was 8a\-12p, then deliver from1p\-9p. Figured it'd be a great way to build my resume and gain experience. 

Eventually I left that job a month ago and have been applying daily again. 3\-6 jobs a day. I'm still having a hard time and I fear that I'm not learning enough on my own and actually losing experience by not practicing as much. I feel more focused on paying my bills than anything right now. 

I recently signed up for UpWork. I'm seeing that a lot of freelancing jobs are asking for WordPress work. I figure that the most important thing I can do for myself is to transition more of my time in front of the computer. 

Would it be worth learning WordPress in order to make some freelancing money until I can get a full time job? Have any recommendations on my situation? I'm feeling pretty discouraged. Also, doesn't help that my coding bootcamp closed down a few months after graduating so I no longer have their ""lifetime career services"" for support. Thanks r/webdev ."

I just completed my sophomore year of University. The only internship I was able to get was an unpaid IT intern (since a family friend owns the company). The company has about 4 employees. It doesn't really seem relevant to what I want to do in the future. Is this internship worth doing? Would it be better to work on side projects to put on my resume?

I don't have internship experience in an engineering field and have only limited experience outside of the classroom. I have worked ever since high school though.

Anyway, I'm pretty far along in talks with a top aerospace company for a job in CA, all the way across the country from my family and friends on the east coast.  My family has always been extremely close and the idea of leaving them behind has made me an anxious wreck.  I honestly don't know what I'd do without them.   I don't know a single person in the state of CA and am not always the best at making new friends.

 I've also always been a very frugal person, and financially I don't see CA as the best place to begin a career (mostly because of the difficulty in putting money away into savings).  I'm interested in systems engineering and design/structural analysis jobs, but probably have a slight preference for structures.  This job is in systems and I'm worried about being stuck in work I don't ""love"" for the rest of my life.

I haven't had any interviews with other companies, but most of the places I have applied are huge companies with thousands of applicants that sometimes take several weeks to get back to prospective employees. I have probably 30 applications in at these other large companies, and most of them are for jobs I'd prefer to the one in CA. About 10 of them I'd call a dream job with dream location.

So what do I do? Is it crazy to turn down a great opportunity with no other offers on the table just because I don't want to move and there might be something better out there? Or do I settle and take the job, only to be left wondering what if? "
8qt97f,291,2018-06-13,We kill killer clowns.,DeanTheDude,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8qt97f/we_kill_killer_clowns/,"A support group for coulrophobics... Who would have thought - in the year 2018 - that this would be a thing? Coulrophobia...Say the word 10 times and it sounds like we’re helplessly afraid of cows, but Coulrophobia - for the fortunate and uninitiated - is the fear of clowns. Bozo, Ronald McDonald, Popov, Crusty...John Wayne Gacy. Corpse-like faces, rapey smiles, fever-nightmare color palettes and phallic balloon animals - yet people will insist that the phobia is a mere result of too many Stephen King novels.

Well, personally – for me – the fear came from childhood trauma after witnessing my Pomeranian, The Dude, get stomped to death by a disgruntled carnie when I was only 7 years old. Clowns to Arnie Washington were the pneumonia induced fever dreams of big purple lips barking at him from beneath his bathroom door. Clowns to Alex Hayes were reminders of the childhood trauma he endured: courtesy to his abusive alcoholic father who’d beat him in order to cope with the circus hustle. We even had matching pill bottles: Haldol, Xanax and a cocktail of antidepressants.

Where do guys like us fit in? Well we went to these groups every Tuesday - high off of our medication - while everyone else pecked each other's hands for the last jelly filled donut. Everyone else’s problems at the support group seemed so trivial to our own. “My brothers tied me to a chair and forced me to watch, ‘IT’ back when I was 8,” said Dylan. “When I was 6 my parents carried me through a haunted house,” said Blair. Then they’d laugh about the chubby Dominican guy who bombed on last night’s episode of, ‘The Voice,’ while they sipped watery coffee.

So while everyone else was mooching free coffee and donuts over their poppy little issues - Alex, Arnie and I were conjuring up this insane plan. We would kill every single Evil Clown we could find on this side of the Bay Area. Why not? We were all strung out college dropouts, each of us boasted our fair share of childhood trauma, all of our names started with an ‘A’ so we had some chemistry... But mostly, we were running out of money to fuel our benzo dependencies. Opportunity was ample and we were all blue-blooded capitalists. The local news was constantly opening up with headlines such as; “GRIEVING PARENTS BLAME THEIR MISSING CHILD ON COLORING BOOK CLOWNS.” The parents were chalked off as either schizoids or paranoid acid users and  the hysteria would settle but we knew the truth.

We saw those headlines as opportunities. It was perfect: the day-dream chance to finally get back at the monsters that caused us to be in such a terrible and paranoid state. The hardware store was our first destination as a group. We pooled in our drug money to buy hammers, chains, sledge hammers and nail guns. Spare the pale and neon shitheels a quick death. It’d be personal and we’d seen enough Tarantino movies to be sensitized to the violence our power fantasies would entail. Little did we know, the horrid and insane world we were about to get ourselves into when we took on our first distressed clients.

* 

Jacob Donovan, 10 years old, disappeared without a trace - in his own bedroom - in a Palo Alto suburb: the kind of place where no one locked their doors. The kind of place where sprinklers are always on despite the harsh California drought. Abe Avenue was the slice of American Pie where we’d kill our first clown.

At that point we’d already splattered lime-green paint on our band van, we’d already spent hours welding nails to our brightly colored weapons, we’d already cut off the sleeves and studded our denim jackets with clown resistant popcorn kernels and we were too far into this thing to wimp out. We were the Xanax Zombies and we’d left our doubts in some garage filled with opioids, psychedelics and cheap band instruments. We were ready.

We met the grieving family at the front door of their peach colored two-story where they described their encounter in verbatim. The father looked on the verge of a panic attack while the mother maintained her composure to describe the story to us. “Jack - my husband - gave Jacob this old coloring book he found in the attic.” She handed it to us. It was a tattered and worn out thing: a candy colored clown was grinning on the cover.

“He went in his room with the crayons… And-” She began to choke on her words. “Well we saw flashing lights beneath his door and heard a demon’s giggling… Good god, something evil was with him. The neighbors think we’re insane.” The mother finally began to break down. Alex gave her a sympathetic back rub while her husband looked at him with dead eyes. “So,” she choked. “We go in the room and Jacob was gone. Just his little ‘cure cancer’ bracelet was left of him.” She clutched the rubber bracelet tightly to her chest. It was an ‘I love boobies,’ bracelet.

We weren’t fools. That look in the mother’s eyes was a read of pure doubt: in herself and in her sanity. The father relaxed on the couch - covering his eyes with his hands - to separate himself from the ridiculousness of the situation. They were praying that a small gang of chain-swinging punk rockers could provide them with the closure they needed. Our price was $1500.

“This money was raised by Jacob’s school,” the father said. “Now I’m not sure how I feel about giving a bunch of strange...popcorn wearing characters this much money - let alone cash that was raised for our missing son - but life's a rollercoaster of chance-taking isn’t it?” We all nodded.  

“Alright,” he sighed. “Go upstairs. Don’t mess with any of his stuff. Kill the clown; summon it - whatever the hell you guys do.” He cursed to himself and kicked his legs back up on the couch. The mother sat beside him. The floor was ours.

* 

The three of us each took a bar of Xanax to shut down our adrenal glands and some beta blockers to steady our heart rates - but we still didn’t go into the thing without any skepticism or worry. 

“So what,” Alex said. “Are we just gonna sit around in this room, playing with ourselves, while we wait for Ronald McDonald to make a McCameo from under Jacob’s race car bed?” Arnie and I ignored him. We were looking around the room for clues.

The boy’s room was untouched. The ceiling fan was still spinning, the soccer-ball blankets were tucked in his bed neatly and all of little Jacob’s baseball gear had been stood up against his dresser. Some parents have a real hard time letting go. I’d never understand this, of course, because I was neutered by a fence post many years ago after a botched penny board trick.

Arnie got up and picked up little Jacob’s tee-ball bat. “Come on man,” I said. “Put that down. You heard the dad.”

He was looking at the small bat with evil in his eyes. “Wouldn’t it be poetic,” he gave the bat a few practice swings. “...If we killed the clown with little Jakey’s baseball bat? Bash the thing’s nose right into its ugly face with its victim’s own bat?” I liked where he was going with that, but we had guidelines to follow. “I prefer my idea,” said Alex. “I’ll just saw his head off with my chain.” He was about to swing his evil whip around before I stopped him: “I’d rather we just do our job…” I said. “Besides - doesn’t this seem a little out there? Like Alex Jones levels of bizzaro? I mean, only a teenage delinquent could come up with shit like this.” The guys ignored me. We waited.

Then the pages of the coloring book started to flip right before our eyes. It was some Harry Potter looking shit, not going to lie - watching that coloring book just open itself up as the pages were blown through by some kind of supernatural wind. We were all speechless. Then the page landed on our guy.

“Color: Fuzzy, The Friendly Clown!” The text on the page read. The image was of an elongated and deformed clown with sharp porcupine-like quills poking from his neck and jagged teeth stabbing through his fat lips. We stared at each other in bewilderment. “HOhO-HeYyY KiDs,” the clown’s mouth started to move on the page. “JUSt gO RiGHt oN aHEaD AnD CoLoR Me iN!”

Our jaws hit the floor. Was this coloring book actually talking to us or had our Xanax been cut with some kind of hallucinogen? We all swallowed our Adam’s apples in unison. We didn’t know what the hell to think. Then Arnie pulled a green crayon out of the box. “Are you guys ready?” He asked.

“Christ,” I said. “Are you nuts? We need to hire a goddamn priest or something man. We’re out of our minds.” Then the clown’s face started to animate on the page. His eyebrows were furrowing down. He was growing impatient. “COmE oN KiDs,” he giggled. “JuST CoLoR mE iN AlReAdY! oH-HoHo!” That did it for Arnie. He just started scribbling away: fueled by bloodthirst.

Then the closet door swung open. All of the Call of Duty posters flew off – blown right towards us through the wind. Arnie tossed me the baseball bat. “You’re going to need a weapon, Aaron.” I took a deep breath. It was hard to maintain my composure. I mean, we were looking right into some kind of strange void. A portal of some kind: into goddamn Clown Narnia.

“Well,” I said. “Who’s going first?” Arnie dove right in. Alex followed. They disappeared just like that. I was hesitant at first. The moaning of lost child souls was not a comforting ambiance but if I were to maintain my role as the leader of this ragtag gang I figured I’d make the same leap my ‘droogs’ did.

* 

I met the guys in what looked like the inside of Tim Burton’s mind. We were standing in a hallway that lead through these crooked green neon doorways, the floor was made up of warped, neon-green checkered tiles and all of it led into an enormous wax purple mouth. I could see Arnie began to sweat at the sight of that thing. I led the pack up the way while Arnie swallowed more Xanax. “Let’s go,” I said. “And don’t take too much of that stuff - you’ll pass out dead on the floor. Stay alert.”

“OH-HoHOheEy!” Fuzzy’s voice echoed from the giant mouth. “CoME oN iN BoYS aND GiRLs, tHeRE’s CaNDY In HeRE!” I tightened my grip around Jacob’s bat and prepared a swing for anything that would come jumping out at me. The offer was tempting but we already had all of the candy we needed and it came in 2 MG bars.

So we danced to Fuzzy’s tune. When we crept through that mouth, our dongs were beginning to work up a decent chub. Well, at least mine was. I’m only assuming Alex and Arnie felt the same based on the sinister expressions that their faces were forming.

“Dudes,” chuckled Alex. “This looks like the Bicycle Dream from Pee Wee's Playhouse.” He wasn’t wrong either. The whole world took on a sinister and nightmarish appearance. The mouth swallowed us into a circus tent of depravity. There were wax-doll puppet acrobats swinging from the Big Top with knives in their hands and the wool on the tent was neon green with pink polka-dots. “Come on out, ‘Fuzzy,’” I said. “We’ve come to fuck you up.” Fuzzy thought I was joking. “Ho-HOoHuh?” It laughed through the sinister little dream labyrinth. “KiLl mE? COmE oN KiDs, YoU wOUlDn’T wAnT tO KiLl FuZzY tHe FrIEnDly CloWn!”

I stared at Alex and Arnie in search for some kind of suggestion. They didn’t have one. “Look,” I shouted at the walls. “Just come out and we’ll make this thing quick. Jacob’s parents miss him.""
  
Fuzzy didn’t answer. Alex nudged me and pointed at the popcorn stand at the end of the room. “Maybe we gotta order some popcorn or something to get him to show himself?” I nodded. I leaned on the food stand. The kernels were blood red and bouncing like Mexican jumping beans in the popper. “Ok,” I said. “I want a large tub of whatever this stuff is and I want it now. Got it?”

Then Fuzzy materialized from some puddle of pink sludge behind the popcorn stand. The clown rose out of the hot muck - a whopping 9 feet of disfigured and color-filled fever nightmare. It opened its big bright green eyes and was surprised with what it saw. “WoAhaH,” it tried to chuckle. “YoU gUyS aRE a LiTtlE tOo OlD To BE iN FuZZy’s PlAYGrOuND!” I shook my head. The naivety was too much to handle and I didn’t have time for its bullshit.  The Xanax was beginning to hit me hard and my eyes were heavy.

“Listen,” I said. “We’re going to kill you. It’s as simple as that. If you tell us what you did with little Jacob, we’ll make it quick and be on our way.” Fuzzy held its belly and began to laugh heavily. The hideous inbred incarnation of Bozo was beginning to get right on top of my last nerve. I looked at Arnie and Alex: wondering if they could ‘believe this guy.’ For once we had our nightmare by the balls. For once we were in control but only we could appreciate it. Fuzzy had no idea of what three dudes - under the influence of anxiety medication - could do.

“Alright,” Alex said. He held his chain out and gave it a few whirls to make our leverage more clear. “We’re going to ask one more time. Where. Is... Jacob?” Then Fuzzy started to make strange digestive noises. It began laughing wildly as a massive lump started to work its way up its pale throat. The clown held a sharp finger up for us to wait while it did this nasty thing.

Then it coughed him right up. A bright red and half-digested child’s corpse came sliding out of Fuzzy’s gaping pointed mouth. Little Jacob fell right at our feet - a bloody and gored 75lb 10 year old fetus. That set the violent scene. Alex was the first to act. He swung his chain around like a cowboy and then wrapped it around Fuzzy’s neck. The nails of the chain dug in. Then - when Fuzzy’s 9 foot stature collapsed at Alex’s pull - Arnie dove right in with his sledgehammer. He landed a good few heavy blows on the monster clown’s joints and left the enormous freak-show writhing and limp. Its pink blood was spraying from its elbows.

Fuzzy ‘The Friendly Clown,’ was a squirming neon worm: now under the mercy of a band of pissed off punk hipsters. “cOMe On,” it tried to beg. It tried to giggle. “YOu KiDs dOn’T WaNT tO HuRT mE!” We had no sympathy. “Go fuzz yourself,” I said. Then I swung the bat right into the clown’s swollen forehead. It was a good swing. Not even Babe Ruth could top the anger and power of that one. The right side of the clown’s deformed and hideous head exploded instantly in a firework of pink-colored gore. 

We all felt it: the relief and the eventual addiction. Cathartic violence. Up close and personal. The kind of action Hollywood is made of, only we’d be the Bruce Willises and the evil clowns would be the Russian extras in tuxedos. Badass.

To finish the job, Alex wrapped his chain around Fuzzy’s limp neck and then ripped it back and forth like he were trying to dry the helliquin’s neck. Once the clown’s head was mostly severed from its rotten spinal cord - Arnie stepped in and grabbed the clown by its bright, blue funk-perm...Then he pulled its half bashed head right off. The force of his pull caught Arbue by surprise, causing him to lose balance. The clown’s pink blood splattered on the neon green walls of Fuzzy’s world: creating a work of morbid art. We carried the crumbled skull out.

* 

We arrived back into the Donovan residence, weary and aching - with Fuzzy’s Pepto-Bismol colored bodily juices dripping all along the late and Little Jacob’s beige carpet. Soon, I knew, we’d have to deliver the terrible news to the child’s distraught parents. When they ask the question, “Where’s our boy?” We will have to stare at each other in a morbid silence… And yet, at the same time: I’d totally been looking forward to the moment where I’d get to dramatically slam the candy colored monster’s bashed-in dome on their coffee table… That pink shit would splatter onto all of the Missing fliers that they’d been printing up, perhaps even in their coffee... And then we’d demand our pay.

* 

Our first day in the field had went swimmingly. It seemed almost too easy. We took the grieving parents’ money, split the cut down to $500 each (although I did most of the heavy lifting - but hey, I’m a generous leader), sold all of our medication to an aspiring soundcloud rapper and then we took to a dive bar to squash our scrotes and contaminate our livers with watery liquors. We didn’t even change or wash up. We were just sat in a corner booth: sipping 40oz mugs of lager, covered in clown’s blood while a heavy Royal Blood song boomed through the bar haze.

The TV news in the corners of the bar were about a big Toy Company which might be holding an odd and unlikely connection to the strange disappearances of young children. The program was brought to us by a desperate local news station, of course, because most American couch potatoes would be too quick to chalk it off as ‘fake sensationalism.’ We drank our beers while the talking heads blundered on about the, ‘Coloring Book Disappearances.’ Then it was onto the next news segment.

We all sat up in the booth and leaned in as we took in the caption. “GRIEVING PARENTS CLAIM THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN CLOSURE BY STRANGE, ODDBALL VIGILANTES.” A busty blonde news intern was standing in front of the Donovan household. “Holy shit,” said Alex. “This is about us.” Arnie and I silenced him.

“Yes, Chris,” the reporter said. “I’m standing out here, tonight, in front of the Donovan family’s home. As you can see it’s a very nice neighborhood - it’d seem out of the realm of possibility that anything bad could happen to anyone here… But this happens to be the same neighborhood where, just a week ago, 10 year old Jacob Donovan disappeared without a trace.” The camera panned over to a chubby Mexican guy - the reporter shoved the microphone beneath his chin. “We’re here with Omar Lopez, a family friend of the Donovans, who claims that a group of so-called ‘Evil Clown Hunters,’ actually confirmed and avenged the Donovans’ son’s death. Mr. Lopez, what can you tell us about your interaction with these vigilantes? It seems odd.”

“Well it’s undoubtedly odd,” said a Omar. “When Jack - the boy’s father - told me about it earlier, I was just thinking ‘christ, the guy’s actually lost it.’ I’ve been there before when my dog got hit by a...” The reporter interrupted him. “Yeah, but we want to know what made you believe the Donovans’ story.” Omar held up a big burlap sack which was dripping with clown’s blood. “I’m not sure if I can show this on TV,” he chuckled.

“It’ll be fine,” the reporter insisted.

Omar shrugged and then pulled Fuzzy’s decapitated and bludgeoned head out from the bag. The reporter looked repulsed. We were able to hear a couple of camera guys gag and choke. “Yep,” Omar said. “Jack gave me this to speak on his behalf. He trusts me to give it back to him when this interview is done.”

“Can you tell us exactly what we’re looking at?” Asked the reporter. “Well,” Omar said. “It’s pretty self explanatory. It’s a f*cking evil jester’s head. Those weirdos cut it right off and brought it to the Donovans for their payment. If you guys want to zoom in you can see it’s 100% real. It has sharp teeth, a little bit of brain left and an eyeball. Its blood also looks kinda pink, I just realized. Wow that’s kinda freaky.” Omar wiggled the head around for the cameras and then they cut back to the faces of two wild-eyed desk anchors. “Well…” Said one of the anchors. “That was extremely graphic. Sorry to the folks at home.” 

“Uhhh yeah,” the female anchor agreed as she nervously clicked her pen. “Sorry we had to cut there guys… We are unsure, exactly, of what that Palo Alto man was showing. It looked like some kind of extremely realistic horror movie prop.”

“Yeh,” the anchorman said sadly. “Some parents grieve in strange ways. We hope the Donovans will be able to pull through.”

The three of us looked around the table. Shit-eating smiles from all of us. Our first day on the bloody grind. We were still amateurs and yet we’d already earned money and caused hysteria. “So what are we going to do next?” Asked Arnie. “We gonna keep going?” I slammed my bat on the table - for dramatic effect. The light revealed Jacob’s name: engraved on the handle of the bat.    

“All Evil Clowns,” I said. “...Must die.”

Hey there awesome (aspiring) entrepreneur!

When I started this post I thought I was looking for like\-minded entrepreneurs to join a Mastermind group, yet when I started typing, it became something bigger. This post might seem like it has a bit of randomness to it, so I’ve structured it as much as possible without overdoing it.

**Since April I’ve been working full\-time on getting my new business called ‘Purpose Design’ up and running.**

\[Purpose Design = PD from now on.\]

I ‘launched’ PD on June 4th, so officially it’s been out there 1 week. In the last months I’ve learned so many new things which, amongst many other things, enthused me to subtly shift the goal of my business quite some times. The shifting might also be a reason why PD’s website is not exactly what it needs to be, but it’s out there, and I will change it \[or have it changed\] as I go along.

**About Purpose Design**

PD will help businesses and organizations \[is there a difference?\] swiftly change their creative process by facilitating Design Sprints. A Design Sprint is a structured, intensely stimulating, creative process that highlights a business’ biggest problems, generates ideas to solve them and finally focus on, test and learn from one idea. All of this replaces months of traditional work in just 5 days.

Anyone can pick up a Design Sprint book and do it themselves you say? Yes, true. What makes PD unique is our experience with Design \[Industrial Design, Technology Design, UX Design.\] We can take the role of facilitator \[depending on the wishes of the client\] and use our experience to help with prototyping, proposing questions, testing and interviewing. Additionally, once the sprint is done, the client might want to look for an external partner to continue their prototyping/design process. We use our network to find the right partner for them.

**10\-year plan**

Last week I sat down and used the book ‘traction’ to work out the 10\-year plan. This was a great way for me to set a direction for the future of Purpose Design, get clear on my goal while explicitly leaving room to learn and adjust. Using the 10\-year plan, I then created a 3\-year picture, a 1\-year plan and an actionable plan for the next 90 days.

**Next 90 days**

The next 90 days are about structuring Purpose Design and creating exposure and finding leads. I plan to structure PD by breaking down its processes into systems and documenting them so anyone could run PD while I am gone\[Like in the book ‘The E\-Myth Revisited’\]. Exposure and reach is one of the things I personally find hard to do. One way, the not\-so\-hard way, I consider creating exposure is through articles about Design Sprints and Personal Growth topics. The hard part, and this freaks me the fuck out, is cold\- emailing/calling companies. It’s a ‘learn by doing’ experience and I will eventually get to doing it, but it just seems like such an annoying thing to deal with as the ‘recipient’.

\[Sidenote: I’ve successfully reached out to people I know from past experiences like internships and meetings. I ask them about their experience and tell them what I specifically like from our shared experience. Same formula got me a response from the founder of a successful, awesome design agency. What I’m saying is, this emailing tactic works for me to get to talking, but is that a sustainable model to grow my business? It seems rather unethical\] **How would you suggest I go about reaching out?**

**Looking for a business partner**

The 10\-year plan for my business is my larger than life goal and helped me realize I want a business partner. For our business to become the leader in its field, I think its employees should be open\-minded, planet\-loving, personal growth enthusiasts with an affinity for design. My ideal business partner is all those things and is great at the things I’m not, like reaching out, sales, finance. The way I see it now, is that we will be working together on the business development and we will work ‘on' our business, not ‘in’ it. Besides all that, the biggest, most important thing I’d love to see is a never\-ending enthusiasm to learn and try new things \[like a 30\-hour workweek for a full salary for our future employees.\]

**My second question is as follows:**

I live and work in The Netherlands and it seems like having a business partner that you can physically meet with has a huge advantage. Where would you say I can meet someone like the description I gave above? There are probably some ways to stimulate lady luck \[that sounds more perverted than it should\] and would love to hear your thoughts on this.

**Mastermind group**

I’ve read a ton of personal and business growth books the last months (Besides actually, you know…. doing stuff ) . I’m currently reading ‘You are a badass at making money’ and it gets me hyped every time I read it. I’ve just gotten to chapter 9 and love the idea of having ‘high\-vibe’ friends and a group of Masterminds to share ideas with and to learn from.

After ‘listening’ to me blabber for the last 5 minutes, **would you be interested in setting up a weekly/biweekly meeting?**

**Random pieces of information about me**

I have a master’s degree in Industrial Design, am quite resourceful and get really hyped by trying out business strategies, reading personal and business growth books such as ‘The subtle art of not giving a fuck’, ‘You are a badass at making money’, ‘The 4\-hour workweek’, ‘Traction’ and ‘Getting Things Done’. My biggest energy boost I get from advising others. For some reason I am a knowledge sponge and I just love to share those ideas as well as gaining perspective by talking with people.

My weakness is my comfort zone. For 27 years I’ve ‘floated’ by and my biggest pitfall is that I have considered asking for help as ‘bothering others’. Not completely the same, yet also not very different: reaching out, cold emailing and cold calling freaks me the fuck out. There are these moments of clarity where I consider reaching out to a business a great idea. After all, it seems like a great way for me to be able to start helping other companies. And then the scariness takes back over.

The last three months have been mind opening and horizon expanding. For the first time I am sticking to my self\-made schedule, am doing almost anything I can to burst my comfort zone bubble and grow it bigger \[which is working\] and I believe I’ve never loved working on my own thing more than I do now. The hype is real.

I am just getting started in the business development and would love to talk with like\-minded, differently skilled people to grow my business.

**Thank you**

If you got all this way down here, know that I think you are amazing and I would love to read your ideas, thoughts, experience. Seriously… don’t hesitate to DM me or respond to this post.

TL;DR: Newly started entrepreneur is looking for like\-minded, personal \- and business \- growth focused individuals for a mastermind group and a potential business partner, as well as advice on getting his first gigs.

I learned how to program in college but it was mainly geared toward astro/physics data collection and analysis.

Quick summary of some of my college experience:

Used the Astronomer Language IDL combined with Emacs, Linux shell for image processing and data analysis.
I took an intro class to Python for engineers. Coded a Tetris game for the final project
Took a Data Structures and Algorithms course for CS Majors. First time using Java, learned it the first week before HW was due
Spent 8 months writing code in C++ for detector calibration and data analysis during an internship at CERN.

I suffered a pretty bad burnout after graduation. Most physics majors I knew went to grad school but I didn't think I could handle it at the time. 
I was diagnosed with ADHD shortly after and needed time to recover and develop good habits. Because of this, I have a 2 year gap without any work experience aside from tutoring.

However, recently, I've gotten serious about getting into the software development industry. I spent a lot of time taking online courses and doing various coding projects to improve my marketable skills.

I've been working on various game development projects with Unity Game Engine and C#. I went to Game Jam 2017 and 2018 and now I am currently working on some small VR projects.
Last summer I learned Android Programming (Android Studio and Xamarin) to work on an app idea. I have a functioning prototype that shows the location and time of several local events in the city, filtered by day and activity. 
The app development project provided me with great learning experience on how to implement different API's and also how to define and structure my classes and functions to be easily improved when new features are added.
I took a course called Software Engineering Essentials in which I learned about the software development life cycle, agile &amp; scrum, unit testing, OOP, version control etc. This course was incredibly helpful to learn about the widespread skills and practices used in the industry.  

I took another course called Clean Code. Mainly a class geared toward how best to structure, organize and refactor code. In my experience, most physicists write code that works and nothing beyond that. This course opened my mind and helped me learn to write more readable code.
I've been applying everything I've learned in those online courses to my personal projects in order to develop coding practices that I can hopefully extend to a future software development job.

Last September, I started a QA Test position at a research company, but the job involved little programming experience. Even though it was fairly stable and comfortable, I did not see myself progressing towards a career and the job was in a fairly rural area. 
I decided to leave my job in June, move into the city, and spend the summer applying to various software related positions. 

I've since edited my resume to mostly highlight my programming experience. However, I could still use some advice. How should I best present myself in the resume and cover letter? What should I focus on and what should I exclude?

I know that some employers/hiring managers are looking for very specific criteria and experience. They might not take a 2nd look at my resume if I don't meet their qualifications (don't have a CS degree, X years experience using esoteric program, etc).
I've already proven it to myself that I can pick up and learn whatever skills I need to (&lt;= astrophysics) for the job. How do I prove it to a potential employer? Maybe in this regard, certain positions/companies are better than others. Maybe there are certain positions I should be targeting more than others and ignoring some completely? Another possible tactic is to start somewhere in Test or Support, and move up within the company. 

TL:DR Astronomy and Physics grad with coding experience looking to start a career in the software industry. How do I best present myself to potential employers?

8qwqc2,1,2018-06-13,Am I dumb? Transfer Plan.,changeasianhairmaybe,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8qwqc2/am_i_dumb_transfer_plan/,"Hi guys,

I was recently admitted to UC Berkeley for L&amp;S CS oos, and you can imagine I am in doubts over the price. My EFC is very low, so the loan amount is terrifying. However, I have enough scholarships to lower the COA for the first year down to about 50k. I have heard it's much easier to find scholarships once you are on campus for the first year. This 50k number is worst case scenario for me if none of my scholarships work out, and I am doing my best right now by applying to as many scholarships as I can. 

With all of my AP credits, I know I would be able to graduate from Berkeley in 3 years so that cuts the total COA down a little and through many alumni at Berkeley I have heard about the amazing opportunities available. I am absolutely in love with the campus and feel like I will thrive there. I am not worried about the stigmas of falling behind in Berkeley as my life experiences up to now have prepared me to do well in such an environment. I would be more than happy to stay at Berkeley for my undergraduate years as long as my finances permit. 

Currently, I am doing a prestigious research program in one of my state schools and this program is absolutely wonderful for any CS major. By the end, we expect to have results that can be implemented across the university and this project is done under the guidance of one of the leading professors for CS here. I am also being trained in business/economics on the side by a company that I plan to intern with throughout the school year. 

To get in-state after a year, my father is prepared to move to California to establish residency. However, I don't want to completely rely on this method as I am not a fan of continuing to place financial burdens on my family. If finances don't work out, I hope to be an accomplished enough candidate that is able to transfer to a private school of a similar tier to Berkeley. While I feel my resume is already very good, I am determined to be even more accomplished by the end of my freshman year so that transfer is an option. 

Am I dumb for going through with this plan or should I stay in my local state school which is nowhere near the level of UC Berkeley for CS? "

I started an internship where I eventually wish to work, but I’m having difficulty communicating to my peers and supervisors. It’s because of my shyness but also my lack of knowledge in the topics they’re talking about.

I‘m interested in engineering, but sometimes I don’t even know where to start in learning about some of these topics my peers and supervisors talk about.

For example:

One of my projects was to program a motor. I read the developer’s guide and familiarized myself with the specific programming language for that motor, but I couldn’t initially understand what to do. I wasn’t familiar with terms like “torque,” “throttle”, etc. They talked about these things like they were common knowledge, and I was so confused. I had to research about these topics myself, but I don’t have a formal and concrete understanding of the definitions. 

I’ve never been a robotics club. I play video games, but I’m not too familiar with computers, especially on things such as operating systems, networks, etc. I don’t know too much about cars. I essentially have the minimum knowledge taught to me in a classroom.

I just finished my freshman year with a 4.0 average. My professors and fellow students think I’m the most intelligent in the bunch, but I feel like a fish out of water. I feel like I’m drowning in a sea of information that I barely understand. If anything, I’m reinforced of how little I know every single day.

I guess it’s because I’ve taken little initiative in learning things outside of school. My peers who have worse grades outshine me simply by having input or asking thought provoking questions. Can you guys give me advice? Thanks. "

* I'm a student majoring in Software Engineering with about 1.5\-2 years left before I'll graduate.
   * My current GPA is \~3.65
   * I've competed in some hackathons, but I don't have a personal project that I've built, yet.
* About three weeks ago I started a Summer internship as an Application Developer at an insurance company. They are a pretty large name, with an incredibly large IT department, and they follow many Agile principles.
   * This is my first internship, but as I list below, I have some AppDev experience at another company.
* I am still working for my former employer where I have been developing software for them for about three months.
   * My experience at my former company has been very exciting and challenging, because I have been able to build two project from the ground up, which I very much enjoyed.

Over the past week or so, while getting more and more exposure to the project that my team focuses on, I have been coming to the realization that the work that my team does is not very interesting to me, and in some cases the tasks are fairly trivial. One of the reasons that I wanted to take this internship was so I could get exposure to working on a development team and learn more about industry norms relating to AppDev.

My goal once I'm done with school is to work for a company where I have the opportunity to work on exciting projects (this could be working for a large tech company, or simply for a company that is developing exciting software or solving exciting problems).

**My dilemma is this**: 

If I stay with this insurance company after the internship is over (while still in school), at the end of my graduation, will large tech companies look at me as a joke? Will they see that I worked for this insurance company and think that my skills are lesser than other applicants *because* of the industry that I was working in?

As an alternative, would I be better off going back to my former employer as a developer (at the end of the internship), where I'll have more chances to work on challenging programs and build more software from the ground up?

Any other feedback is welcomed, and please let me know if there's other information that would be helpful to answer the question."

8qy8sr,7,2018-06-13,Thinking about dropping out of vet school....,confused_vet,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/8qy8sr/thinking_about_dropping_out_of_vet_school/,"Hi redditors,

I recently finished my 2nd year of veterinary school. I am not failing, in fact I'm doing quite well. I don't currently have any debt either but I will if I continue. I am seriously considering leaving and have been for the past year or so (started having doubts last summer, decided to tough it out for another year). When I decided to go for this career I was 20, and nearly 6 years later I have changed and matured a lot and have lost (or have realized that I never had) my passion for vet med. While I enjoy working at a vet hospital to a degree (1.5y experience prior to vet school and now currently working at a vet hospital over the summer), every day I think to myself how miserable I will probably be if I have to do this for the rest of my life. I love dogs and think they're cute, and I do like to see animals get proper care and help them be healthy, but it doesn't ignite a fire in me or bring me a sense of satisfaction. I am relieved at the end of the day when I get to go home and do something else.

In the past year I have done some soul\-searching and I have realized I am a more artistic and social person than I used to be, and I think I've really suppressed my true self by forcing myself to go into the sciences. I switched to pre\-vet in my 2nd year of undergrad (I'm seeing a trend here!) because I was unhappy in economics and wanted to work with animals. I'm really good at academics, essays, and interviews, and got into vet school the first time I applied. First year was very challenging, but I felt accomplished because I pulled a 4.0 and seemed to be good at vet med. However, I think after completing my second year and realizing just how much work and debt goes into this career, and how little financial return you get when you graduate, it just doesn't seem worth it to me anymore. We always say ""we don't do it for the money"", and now, I hate to admit it but being a veterinarian is not financially or emotionally rewarding enough for me. I hate the idea of potentially being injured every time I examine a patient, the long hours, the lack of gratitude from clients....

Although it seems I am pretty sure of my decision here, I still am having trouble committing to it. It's extra difficult for me because I'm pretty good at my job as a vet assistant and I'm pretty good at vet school (grade\-wise, at least). So it's not like I'm incompetent or failing. I am also worried about the social stigma of being a drop\-out, and of my parents being disappointed in me. However, I want to do something that makes me happy and fulfilled. I don't want to be 35\-40 and regretting my choices when I was 25, when I was young and single and still had the freedom to do something else.

I think I want to pursue something like PR, Marketing, social media management, event management, etc. I love working with people to create something that provides an experience for other people or for a company. I love photography (pets, portraits, events, fashion), makeup, travel, and other creatively\-minded things, and I'd love to find a career that could help me combine those. However, given that my past experience involves nearly only vet\-med related jobs, internships, etc., I'm really not sure where to even begin. 

Any advice, personal anecdotes, or anything you have that might be useful to me would be appreciated. I am pretty terrified of this whole situation and it would be a huge leap for me if I decided to leave. I've never been a failure or a quitter before, and I know if I were born in my parents' generation this would never be a possibility. But as a millennial, I want to do what I love, not do something to support what I love. Of course I still love animals, especially dogs, but I think that owning my own dogs would be enough. I don't think I need to be surrounded by them every day to be happy. 

Thoughts!?!? I'm honestly filled with self\-loathing for even considering this, but after a year of having second thoughts every day...I think I need to face this head\-on. "
8qyf07,0,2018-06-13,My life from my senior year to adulthood.,doc_gramer,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8qyf07/my_life_from_my_senior_year_to_adulthood/," This story opens up with me, a youthful and optimistic guy who was ready for his senior year... *Was*... The first few weeks were great, I had a internship with my school and even worked at a radio station. My friends were treating me nice and we would all hang out during the weekends.

 Then after working one of my football radio games I got on discord and talked to a really nice girl who I will only reference as Nya. We both had common interests and talked for hours on end until it was time for the both of us to go to bed. I knew we didn’t live too far apart because we must of seen each other at a speech and debate competition. However I will talk about her later...

 October 6th, 2017... At about 3:00 am that morning my grandfather passed away. I was heat broken because we were very close and he was one of my favorite people in this world. When we were moving stuff from his nursing home people would ask if he found a better place closer to me, however I had to break the news. I saw smiles fade to frowns in a matter of moments. When I got back home my father asked if I could get everybody drinks after I felt a little better. I went to the local gas station and saw one of my dad’s workers at his nursing home there and she asked how my grandfather was doing... I looked down at the floor and shook my head as tears started to fall telling her the news. She then stopped and told me to pass along the message to my father to stay home with family he was needed there.

 The next few days were hell. I didn’t see my A+ class because I didn’t want to depress the class. My boss at both jobs told me to go home early because I couldn’t hold it together at work. Then I met a girl on Snapchat and for the sake of privacy I won’t give out her name. We got along and we were both going though similar situations, I would take her to school every morning and would even buy her lunch because she treated me better then most of my friends... *some of the time*... However all my friends told me that she was bad news and I shouldn’t get so close to her because she was unstable. I ignores them thinking she was perfectly fine and kept her close to me.

 At this point in the relationship she started taking control of me asking who contacts are in my phone and most importantly who this Nya was. She also made me have sex with her on a weekly basis and even got to the point where I got fired from my job at the radio station for not showing up because I spent time with her. I was perfectly fine with it because she had me under control and wouldn’t let me be me.

 Then one day she made me sleep with her and smoke more weed after I lied to my father about going to a friend’s house. I couldn’t take it after that and stood up for my self and we had a big fight about all of her lies and how she had been taking advantage of me. A week later she dumped me...

 After a few weeks Nya and I started getting closer to a point where her friend Salty said I should ask her out. I agree and did that, Nya then said yes and we sent letters confessing our love for each other. We even planned for prom, along with seeing each other for the first time, and even about me moving out near her. It was almost like my life was falling in place...

 February 15th, 2018... I was doing my morning ritual at tech school when my ex girlfriend’s best friend came to my room with news, my ex claimed I raped and hit her. I couldn’t hold it together and had to go to the counselor’s office, when I went I stood at the door until the student was done and she then told me to come in. After she went though her speech about her duty to warn I told her everything as I broke down in her office. The counselor then called my father into the office and when he walked in I almost knocked him over in a hug, he had to take me home after the counselor explaining everything to him.

 The day came when I had to talk to detectives about the situation and they let me go because witnesses told stories that matched mine about my ex taking advantage of me. All the way Nya was in support and made sure I made it out of that situation. Nya was there and made sure that I walked across that stage instead of walking into prison.

 Today I live in a new town, work a management job at GameStop, and Nya is still by my side. I know I didn’t go to my grandfather’s funeral but Nya told me that she will graciously come with me to visit him one last time. Without Nya, I don’t even know where I would be now."

I really am only aware of top cpu/gpu but not much else. Please help me redditors. I'm looking for advice with stuff like when/where to buy parts (e.g. wait to buy gpu a new one coming out or something) and how to tell whether non cpu/gpu parts are good/compatible.

Giving example builds/parts would really be helpful!

8qymql,6,2018-06-13,When should I start trying to intern?,BeefThunderSteak,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8qymql/when_should_i_start_trying_to_intern/,I've only finished my first semester so far and I'm not sure when it would be a good idea to start trying to intern somewhere. How well do you need to be able to program? How much is generally needed for a good position after graduating?
8qyox8,1,2018-06-13,When/Where did y'all learn to write more elegant code?,NotTidoJackson,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8qyox8/whenwhere_did_yall_learn_to_write_more_elegant/,"Sorry if this belongs in another sub like r/learnprogramming or something. It doesn't feel instructional, so I was hesitant to put it there. Basically, here's my dilemma.

I'm starting my summer internship soon, and I'm nervous because I still feel like, while I'm a pretty decent programmer, I'm not as ""elegant"" as I should be. What I mean is, I do pretty well in my CS classes at school because I understand most things, and assignments and stuff that I turn in functionally works. However, when I look at my friends' work, they complete the same assignment in 50-100 fewer lines than me. It goes beyond doing stuff like implementing a recursive vs. iterative solution or something. I'm not sure if it's one thing I'm missing out on, but I feel like I should be writing more sophisticated code, not just stuff that works.

I'm even kind of hesitant to put a couple of my smaller independent projects on Github, because I feel like down the road some hiring team will look at it and see that I took 15 lines to do something that could've been done with 3 using some shorthand thing that I didn't know about, and it'll reflect poorly on me.

I guess my question would be, is this something that comes over time, or something that needs to be actively worked on? 

If it's the latter, how should I try and get better? Would a good way be doing a better job of keeping up with various Java updates or something, and trying to implement some new syntactical change they made? Is there a book? How did you do it?

If it's the former, do y'all think the company that I'm interning for expects me to write more sophisticated code at this point, or will they work with me on that?"
8qysfa,4,2018-06-13,Is it recommended to come back for a second internship?,actolia,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8qysfa/is_it_recommended_to_come_back_for_a_second/,"I am in a software engineering coop program with 5 internships. I did my first three internships at three different places in different context (full stack web vs native C++/C# app, big company vs vs med vs startup).

I'm still not entirely sure what I want to do exactly later specifically, so I like to go to different places to try new stuff.

However, some people recommended me that, if I liked a company, I should try doing a second internship for them to see different challenges in the same context.

I previously asked to my colleagues at said company, if they would've done that, out of curiosity (not my bosses, but people with a cs background). Most of them had only three internship, but they all said that they regret coming back to a company more than one time, even tho they liked it and that they would like for me to come back.

So what's the best approach in that? Is it worth coming back for multiple internships at the same company?"
8qytjy,1,2018-06-13,I need to make a life changing decision,ladyelectricity,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8qytjy/i_need_to_make_a_life_changing_decision/,"So I recently finished my master’s degree and the company I was doing my internship with offered me a full time position in something related to my masters but is not it. Also, they gave me a low salary (15k below market), despite all of my negotiation efforts. I accepted it because at the time I did not have any other offers and I was getting nervous. This company that I currently work for is in the financial industry and there is not much innovation being done there, which is what I really like, but apparently you can climb the ladder fast.
Two weeks after I accepted it, I got an offer from a car manufacturer for a six figures salary, for something that is sort of like a dream job to me. I say ‘sort of’ because the job sounds really amazing but I have never actually done anything like that before so I do not know if I am going to love it or hate it, but they are obviously innovating every day and its more my thing. 
Now, you would say this is a pretty straight forward decision but here are the problems:
1) The new job is in the north of US and I live in Florida. I would have to move and leave behind many things like my group of friends and familiarity. 
2) I have been in a serious relationship for 3 years now. He cant move because his clients are here and his sons are here (they are not my children btw). Now this is where it gets tricky, I love him very much, I haven’t had this kind of connection with anyone before or a relationship like this, so I told him I would stay if he wanted to have a family with me. (Having a family is above my career in my priority’s list). To what he replied that he PROBABLY does not want anymore kids because he is 55 years old and he wont be able to retire, and what does the kid is going to think about having a dad that old etc.... Then other days he comes home saying that he has been reading about having a kid at this age and all the pros and cons etc... 
so he is obviously thinking about it but this is not the kind of thing you can ‘push’ on someone.
(Im 30 yo.... in case you are wondering) 

There are other problems in the relationship too, that are way too long to write about and im sure you are about to quit reading... congrats for making it this far btw. 

So im inclined to taking the job, the thing is that it really scares me to be alone in a city all over again (i moved here alone 10 years ago), and I am even more scared of breaking up with him and start to date again... (i had some horrible experiences).

So, fellow redditor, what are your thoughts about this? What should I do? 
Should I risk it and stay here to see if he might change his mind and wants to have kids?
Or should I go away and start a new life... even though im scared shitless about doing that? 

Thank you for making it this far on the post btw... looking forward to reading your thoughts :)"

But yeah, some background about myself: I consider myself to be a rather decent programmer, and have done well in all of the CS courses I've taken so far here at UCI. I do enjoy programming in general, but I haven't spent much time outside of academic to build personal projects and be involved in relevant extracurricular. Perhaps I am not as passionate as others where I want to program during my free time or maybe I'm just not driven enough. As a result, I have spent the previous summer working on non CS related jobs with a rather weak resume. Recently I have been reflecting on where I am compared to my peers and the future I want to head toward. I realized that if I want to get a job by the time I graduate, I need internships to gain relevant experience and to strengthen my resume. Unfortunately, summer has already begun and I have already missed many internship opportunities, so it seems like I will be spending another summer without any internships. 

So far, I have created a plan I want to follow over the summer. I plan on focusing on a personal project, tackling leetcodes, and signing up for online courses to learn some of the skill that college courses don't teach such as web development. My goal is to get prepared before Fall quarter so that I can begin applying for internships when school starts. 

Overall, I'm just worried that I am too far behind since next year is my last chance to get an internship and I heard that without an internship many companies will not consider hiring you after graduation. I'd like to know if any of you were/are in the same boat as me, or if you have any advice or guidance to give me I'd appreciate it very much. Thanks for reading my mess!"
8r0yf1,1,2018-06-14,What am I doing wrong and how can I fix it?,Chillbro8aggins,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8r0yf1/what_am_i_doing_wrong_and_how_can_i_fix_it/,"Background: I graduated college in 2016 with a degree in Operations Management and have been looking for a career ever since. I have worked random jobs in between then and now like warehouse work and now working as a receptionist at a hospital. I understand that these haven't given me extremely relevant experience towards a career in what I believe I would enjoy doing. In the past year Ive sent out countless applications (even to entry level jobs) and heard nothing back or got rejected. Not even an interview. 

I am very passionate about Emergency Management, Ive got certifications, volunteer experience, solid knowledge about it but no actual job experience. I feel almost like its a catch 22 of needing job experience to get a job, but cant get experience without  first getting a job. I even know the local county Emergency Management Director and have spoken with him multiple times about the open position with his office. I applied for it before the job posting closed April 27, and I haven't heard anything other than an email saying I was qualified for it on June 1st. Since then its been no phone calls, no emails, nothing. I don't know if I should email the Director and ask for some kind of an update or just leave it alone.

Aside from my main passion, I love business also. I'm heavily interested in doing something with finance, being a business analyst, or possibly consulting. When I search for these jobs I have no idea how to recognize a company that is solid or one that is some pyramid scheme. I also don't know anyone in these areas that I could reach out to. Ive tried searching for entry\-level jobs in these areas but usually come up short so far. 

At this point Im desperate to get a job and get out of the environment Im in now. I hate my current job and feel undervalued and treated with no respect. During college I screwed up big time and didn't  network, pursue internships, or put much effort into the job situation. A large part of this was because I was dealing with a major family situation that was ongoing for almost a decade. But also it was my own ignorance and laziness in my free time. Im 26 and I do regret the lazy mistakes I made during college but it cant be too late to find a successful career. I apply constantly, but hear nothing, I network with whoever I can and still nothing, and I get any experience outside of full\-time job experience that I can. I guess my questions now are how can I recover my situation and get myself into a career? Should I be focusing on one or two specific careers or just get a better job and try to lead it into a career? Any advice or questions are appreciated. Thanks for the long read. "
8r0yiw,3719,2018-06-14,"RAM is an abbreviation, not a command...",SargoDarya,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8r0yiw/ram_is_an_abbreviation_not_a_command/,"This happened at the beginning of my career when I was doing an internship in a PC building and support shop around 13 years ago.

Usually, the way it worked at the shop was, a customer comes in, tells us what he needs and then we would order the components, build the PC and hand it off to the customer. Occasionally though, we also had customers which took the matter into their own hands so we just ordered the components and sold them separately to the customer so he can build it himself.

In came a guy we sold some hardware 2-3 days ago and complains that he inserted everything and plugged everything in but the PC doesn't boot up. We tell him we're going to look at it and if we find something we'll call him and give him a quote. Sure enough, he left and we went to investigate.

After having plugged everything in, we try to power on the machine. Nothing. Our first guess was that he forgot to attach the power pins of the case or the PSU wasn't properly wired up. While the wiring looked a little bit wild, it seemed to be properly connected so that was a dead end.

While looking through the wiring, something else caught my eyes though. There were dents on the RAM sticks edge. 'lo and behold, it seems like the customer had trouble getting the RAM sticks in so he used a hammer to make it fit. 

You know the little notch RAM sticks usually have so you can only insert them one way? Well, apparently the customer didn't and he made it fit the other way around and in that process, broke his mainboard too.

In the end we ordered a new mainboard and 2 new RAM sticks for the customer and installed it for him. He was more than happy to have it working finally. Still baffled though how you can manage to wire up a full PC and then be dumb af when it comes to the easy part.

TL;DR: Customer was wondering why his PC didn't boot when he inserted his RAM the wrong way with a hammer."
8r1sjl,4,2018-06-14,"My internship is offering me a full time job, but...",bag531,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8r1sjl/my_internship_is_offering_me_a_full_time_job_but/,"I work at a small startup located in Boston working on an emerging technology. The company is about two years old and is about to start its Series A funding. We have about 10 full time employees and another 6-7 interns. Recently I got tipped off by one of my coworkers that my company will be offering me a full time job within the next week, something along the lines of ""Lead Operations Engineer"" according to coworker. 

I'm a student in a joint bachelors/masters program attending my final semester of school in the Fall, this position would begin after that (though I'd still be working part time during the semester). I really like this company - the team is great and we're working on something important, with big success on the horizon. However, I'm somewhat unsure about the offer I'm going to get from them. 
    
Over the past year of working here, I've mostly been on my own, which is what one would expect from a small startup, but I worry that I'm falling behind my peers. I sort of just work on what needs to get done and have to learn everything myself. Again, that's not a bad thing, but people I know working at more established companies have to go through long training periods where they learn all the best practices and then have mentors once they get on their team. In my situation, I do have a couple senior engineers I can ask for help, but they mostly leave me to do my own work. I don't mind this situation, but I don't want to fall behind and feel like an idiot when I eventually start a new job.

Because of these worries, I've been applying to other places, but most of them are new grad positions. I only got tipped off about my current offer yesterday. The job at my current company would be a much bigger responsibility with more impact. I could use some advice for what to do in this situation if anyone has been in a similar situation before.

Pros:
Will have many important responsibilities
Higher pay than average company (though lower than big N)
My work is going towards something important
Great team

Cons:
Could potentially stunt my growth
I feel under-qualified
Will be on the worse end of work-life balance

All this is in North Carolina, USA. 

My gf (20) got a free laptop from our university via a grant. She lived with her last boyfriend (28) for a few months last winter when her mother moved to a different town for work. He was emotionally abusive and sexually assaulted her multiple times. When she left him, she had to return multiple times for her belongings because he would hide things from her to make her keep coming back. He still has her laptop, and has moved since then so she doesn’t know where he is. He has continually contacted her via new numbers and social media accounts despite her explicit instructions to leave her alone. 

Since then she’s been using an old laptop that constantly deletes her data or crashes during class and is too slow to effectively do what she needs for her internship. Her family can’t afford to buy her a new laptop. 

If we bring a police report for stolen property to the university tech store, they will replace her laptop for $100. She’s worried about filing a police report, because she doesn’t know how she’ll answer if they ask her why she left it with him or why she waited six months before reporting it. 

We know that ex-bf is separated from his wife and child because he abused her, and it is in his separation agreement that he injured her eye so badly she had to get shots in her eyeball. I’m assuming if that’s in the legal record she will have an easier time explaining to police that he is an abuser that she had trouble facing. 

What are her options here? He’s violent, so I’m reluctant to try and get her laptop back in person. She’s worried about going to the police to get it back via the tech store, and she cannot afford a new laptop without the grant money. "

They both pay the same, have the same duration and work conditions (full time for 2.5 months) and both start on the 1st of July but:

\- Position A is working with C# on the backend of a web application, on an open source codebase, with the possibility of continuing with the company during my 4th year as part time. There is also the prospect of rewriting the codebase in Python and JS.

\- Position B is working fullstack on a web application with python\+django and a frontend tech stack. I'm presuming (not sure yet) on a closed source codebase, and apparently with no continuation with the company. I'm still not really sure about all the details.

My questions are:

\- What would be the better position for career building, I'm presuming it's position A since my work would be open source?

\- Can I ask company B for a higher pay, or is that a no no for an internship?

\- I have been offered A yesterday but I still need to gather more information about B, how much time can you usually take before you reply to an offer?

I'm in Portugal, if that affects the job culture."

It was saying to myself bs excuses, like"" you have been working all day, you need to rest now, so postpone the meeting again, you have an internship going on so enough with the freelancing bullshit.

The guy was cool enough, I showed him some examples, and told him I've been doing this for a while which is true.

I didn't try to oversell anything,  just told some facts(Although I should work on my service offers a little more)

He seemed to be well connected and offered me 3 projects at once.

I gave him my price and he didnt argue it.

I know someone who works at TechCorp (not real name). One day I sent him a message asking for a referral. He was more than willing to help out. He said that his team at TechCorp uses language X (I want to keep details slim) but there are few that use some other languages. I told him I did all of my school assignments (graduated 3 yrs ago) in X but have only used it sparingly in a professional setting. He said that's fine, they just hired 3 or 4 people on their team to use X and the new hires didn't have any X experience. He said that his team was done hiring but there are two other teams looking to hire: one for a senior developer in X and the other for a Node developer. I said I have no experience using Node and haven't used X very recently but I am more than willing to learn. He said that should be fine so I applied with his referral.

After an HR screen, a take home assignment (in X), and an essay about myself (essentially a cover letter), I did a video conference with my contact's team. They asked me a bunch of questions about my experience and background. There was a guy who seemed pretty unimpressed and gave stand-offish vibes but overall, it went well. Later, I got a call from the recruiter who asked how the call went. I said it pretty well but that it felt like they were looking for someone with different background. She said not worry about it and that the team thought I should come onsite.

A bit later I did the onsite. The first interview was with a team that uses X. I felt like I did pretty well but they were looking for someone more experienced and with more knowledge of X. We went out for an uneventful lunch next. After lunch, I met with a team that uses Node. They gave me a problem and they said to not worry about finishing it ontime because no one ever does. It was a tricky problem but I was able to think and talk through it with them. I described an algorithm that I believed would work and walked though a couple of examples using it. Then I started implementing it in Node. I'm not really familiar with Node but I have used Javascript in school and in an internship. They were super helpful when I wasn't familiar how to do something in Node. I was able to implement the solution in about 5-10 mins while talking through my thought process with them. Honestly, it could not have gone better. The team seemed impressed and said they had never seen anyone approach the problem that way before let alone finish it. We had extra time and we were able to chat and I felt like they were a fun group. It sounded like some of the team didn't have a background in Node either and had learned it for the position. Anyway, there were a couple of additional interviews that day where I talked about my background and my previous experiences.

Overall, I felt like I aced it. Everyone seemed excited about having me around and I felt like I really hit it off with the Node team.

I was called the next day and told that there was a team that was interested in me and they would like to go out to lunch and talk about the team. We scheduled it a couple days later.

I went to the lunch and met with the whole team (there were some people I hadn't met at the onsite). It was a lot of fun. They asked me about my experience, my hobbies and a bit about what I'm working on currently. I was asked how much frontend work I do and I said none at all. (I realize now I should have said that I have done it before in school and in an internship). During the lunch they told me some more about their team and I was more sold the more they talked. One thing that really sold me was that they work from home half of the time.

I got a call almost a week later. The recruiter asked how the lunch with the team went. I said it was great and I enjoyed it a lot. She said ""It sounds like the team isn't quite what you were looking for."" At this point, I was thinking ""What is she talking about?"" I told her ""Actually, I thought it was a great match. I loved getting to know the team and I think I would be a great team to work on!"" She continued to say something about me being a better match for a different position and that they wanted to wait for a position in X to open up to consider me for. She said that they would know more in a few weeks. That was pretty much the end of it.

I was completely shocked. It seemed like such a great team and it seemed like they wanted me too. I remember at the lunch the team using phrases like ""when you're here..."" and ""you're gonna like it here"". Meanwhile, my contact had reached out and asked if I heard back. I told him they got back to me and it seems like I wasn't what they were looking for. He looked into it and said and the team really wanted to hire me but a manager has veto power and he decided that I wasn't a good fit since I didn't know Node. My contact appologized profusely saying how stupid it is that they wasted my time and that he had told them at the beginning that I have Node experience.

Right now I am so annoyed and frustrated. They had my resume and I told them multiple times that I didn't know Node and yet they continued with the process. Worst of all, I had met with that manager at the onsite and at the lunch with the team. Why did they do the lunch if I didn't have the qualifications?!

I'm also annoyed at myself because whenever they asked me if I have experience in Node, I always said no. I realize now that I shouldn't have sold myself short and have said something like, ""I have worked with Javascript in the past, and I'm willing dive back in."" (For some reason my brain didn't make the connection with frontend Javascript and Node.) It's also frustrating because it would probably just take a couple of weeks to learn Node enough to start being productive. I'm sure the start date would be at least 2 weeks away. I could be up to speed by the time I started anyway.

I just wish I could talk with them and explain. Honestly, I would rather be on the Node team I had talked with and got excited for, than some X position that might open up. I don't want to go through another interview if a position does open up because I already went through the whole process. (and technically passed!)

Is there some way I could explain to them that I'm willing to learn and that I do have some experience in Javascript so the transition wouldn't be that hard?

Edit: Okay, taking a step back, I can see I am being silly. I'll just move on and chalk this up to the usual unfair interview bureaucracy. I likely don't know the real reason anyway."
8r6ngs,13,2018-06-14,So I’m on my final year of school. In seek of some guidance. A Computer Science Business major,Kiljaboy,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/8r6ngs/so_im_on_my_final_year_of_school_in_seek_of_some/,"I’m going into my final year of college. In the spring I’ll be receiving a bachelor of science in computer science business with a minor in mathematics. I’m writing to this subreddit to see what kind of opportunities really are for my major in the world. I’ve taken a few computer science classes that focus purely around java and some other coding languages have been shown to us such as SQL and python, but I’m not too confident in my coding abilities since my major is kind of split between the business and computer science schools.

I’ve received and passed all of my classes with not much trouble but as a combined major graduate I’m not too sure what kinds of things in computer science I’ll be getting into. I’ve always been a closeted gamer and computer guy and all my close friends know but if you met me you probably wouldn’t think I was pursuing computer science as a 4 year student athlete.

I’ve thought about graduate school but I’m not even sure what I would study there. MBA? MS? Can you guys help? My advisors have been okay but I feel my major is really niche and I feel like I’m in need of more guidance. So hello REDDIT!

Edit: I’ve also had two semi relevant internships. One with a tech start up that is no longer a business and one with a law firm as a bus boy basically."
8r7cxr,3,2018-06-14,Seeking advice from a class of '07 graduate following a career gone off the rails,throwies11,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8r7cxr/seeking_advice_from_a_class_of_07_graduate/,"Hi, I'm a graduate from UIC class of 2007. Bear with me, this is gonna be a long post. First, some basic info about me.

* graduated with a BA degree in a Art concentration
* 36, Hispanic male, single
* underemployed for three years
* started work as software engineer senior year, in 2007

I may have career experience, but my career has fallen off the rails.

**Professional background and current situation**

I have held jobs at 5 different companies, and then since 2015 I have not been able to find any full-time work. They're all in web dev, aside from two short contract stints with indie game studios.

When I graduated I had no clue on the best strategy for finding work. Career centers were not very helpful to people of my major concentration. I was in the front lines of higher education, the first generation in my immediate family to seek white-collar jobs. I assumed that no big tech company was going to consider me with an Art degree so I hit up Craigslist for local small startups and mom &amp; Pop places. Over time, I got myself stuck in that loop of small companies.

I have little money in the bank and live at home with my mom. My life has been a shit show ever since that fateful day I got laid off and I was never able to get any full-time job offers anymore.

**Undergrad background/course work**

That concentration is ""New Media"", basically a grab bag of anything to do with computers in the creation of art. It was very new at the time, and not very coherent. You can see how serious it is by the [digital painting featured in their dept's home page.](http://artandarthistory.uic.edu/bfa-new-media) 

Anyways, I took a few web dev classes from that major, some 200 level CS courses, and web development is what I got into as a career. Relevant classes include: Smart Art (basically art with microcontrollers), Intro to Computer Graphics, Discrete Math with Data Structures, two Object-Oriented Programming classes.

Why didn't I minor or double major with CS? Well, by the time I started, I was approaching 150 credit hours, and I wouldn't be able to take Pell grants after that. Since 90% of my tuition is paid by Pell grants and didn't want to take on huge loans, I decided to cut my losses and just get the Art degree.

**My goals**

I want to become more survivable with my software skills, and round it out with a legit CS, CE or EE education. And dive into a specialty that's smaller than web dev but much easier for job security once you get credentials in it. Other computing fields that interest me are computer graphics, and embedded programming. Ideally I'd like to pair it up with the space exploration industry.

Although I was never a hot shot with interviews, I still was able to get some kind of offer in a few months. That is until three years ago. Bootcamps are destroying the market for web dev jobs against self-taught people, with the ""make 6 figures"" meme and arms race to learn more frameworks quickly. 

My years of service to other companies can't carry me to job offer victories anymore. Not even with practicing new skills, and not even at big companies where they tend to hire generalists. Ironically, it's a lot easier to get your foot in the door with big companies as a junior/intern than as a mid-level programmer.

For those reasons I want to hit the big reset button and do my career the more structured way.

A few people are telling me, if you already have software work experience, going back to college would be a waste of time. But I dunno about that. They're not exactly in my shoes. Just blindly dropping my resume (in various different formats and styles) to big companies like JPL and Intel are not giving me any results. 

**Making choices**

I'm starting to search for graduate programs, first two choices I can think of are I can go to my alma mater, or DePaul for a CS Masters, or go downstate to UIUC. I'm open to other big colleges that have a fair footing for internships attracting NASA/JPL. 

I need a game plan moving forward. So here's the main question to ask, **What first steps should I make with my current background, and education, if I want to work at the places I mentioned? What choices for grad school would be best for me?**

Obviously one of the most important things shorter term is finding some kind of a job. Also, is it possible to live on campus, borrow loans and just get by on a work-study job for the interim? That way I don't have to worry about rent or utilities. I'd like to start this fall, but I think that will make things a lot tougher to do as it's mid-June already."

For context, my school offers mandatory internship semesters (four months) that count as a credit toward your degree but I did not receive a job the first time around and messed up the original course plan that I was supposed to be following.

Option #1:
I was told that this would extend my program a full extra year (five years total) because of various reasons. This would mean that I would be taking an easy course load (3-4 course/semester) and be able to major BUT not graduate on time, pay more tuition, pay more rent, etc.

Option #2:
I was just recently given a second option where I could graduate on time by taking an extra summer semester and much heavier course loads BUT I would not be able to major.

I am having trouble figuring out what option is best and was hoping to hear others opinions on the matter.

However, today, I just got an email that gave me a conditional transfer acceptance, which basically means I have a guaranteed transfer after one year to any major **that isn’t CS or engineering.** So it really boils down to either:

* UGA CS, try to transfer to GT in the competitive transfer pool
* GT, but probably a math major or something. Will do a CS minor there but idk

My dad (an experienced developer at a very big hardware oriented tech company) is saying I should leave it and just go to UGA as CS, and try to transfer the hard way into CS. However, I’ve been reading this sub for a while and I see a lot of math majors getting developer jobs. I am also interested in machine learning and AI in general, so I feel like math would be very interesting for me anyways.

* Will I still have the same opportunities as a math major at GT than a CS major there?
* Will I be able to land internships as a math major there?

I am Computer Science major rising junior. Right now I am working at a huge corporate (not in IT industry) for the summer internship. I got into this company through a program on campus. When I was looking for things to do for the summer I was really clear that I wanted to do technical work. I wanted to do coding related work specifically. I was also assured by the program director that I would be involved in technical work. 

However, things didn't turn out well. Three weeks in the job I am doing nothing technical related. First of all, it is a big corporation so everything needs authorization. I was assigned to do something and two weeks later I still don't have the authorization. All the projects assigned to us were poorly prepared. I personally have the perception that they just throw us some work that was stacked in the warehouse for a long time. It is unnecessary work but well it's good somebody can do it. 

I talked to my family about this issue. I am the only (future) engineer in the family. They tend to think that I should accept doing some office work because big chances I will be doing them in my future career too. However, it's not that I am unwilling to do office work. I am very concerned that I am not learning anything technical aspect in this summer. Right after this summer, it will be recruiting season for the junior -&gt; senior summer internship, which is very critical. All my friends are doing coding work during their internship now/ personally. I am really trying to squeeze my time after work doing some algorithm problems. I just don't see the point that why should I spend my time at the office learning nothing that's beneficial to me. 

On the side note, I also hate the purpose of the work I am assigned. I think it's just fake big corporate work. It doesn't pay well. The company doesn't pay us. School gives us stipend. I also feel cheated by the program director. So a lot of mixed feelings. I hope some experienced engineers can give me some advice. Thanks so much!!
==================================================================================
Update:
Thanks everybody replied took their time and gave out patient and honest advice. I read through each one of them carefully. 
I decided to stick it out the job, at least for some time, under the influence of all y'all reasoning and conversations with some of my friends.
I do want to clarify that a lot of the reply is focusing on the point that these clerical work is unavoidable in the future and being an engineer doesn't mean I won't have to deal with them in the future. I totally agree with that. All my bosses are doing administrative task all day and they all used to be engineers. 
However, my stress is more about future recruitment for a software engineer job. Say companies like Google/Microsoft comes in to recruit in this Fall. I am worried about I will not be prepared for that. Because companies like those really just care about the technical experience/skills on my resume. By the time, I would have a weaker resume/performance compared to my peers. I hope you guys understand that.
Again, thanks everyone!"

I started out as a student at Penn State University Park pursuing Aerospace Engineering. After my summer and fall semester, however, my Asperger's made it impossible to live on campus and I almost could not function.

Since I was at main campus, however, I was able to spend my spring semester at Penn State Lehigh Valley, of which is a commuter campus and is only 5 minutes away (If you get accepted to main campus PSU allows you to take courses at a branch for just one semester). I was able to come home and actually function properly as a human being, I brought my GPA back up, and I learned that this style of college was probably right for me.

I filled out and sent transfer applications to DeSales U, Kutztown U of PA, and Muhlenburg College. I'm sort of committed to Kutztown but when I went to campus the second time I get a horrible gut feeling and did not like the atmosphere. Muhlenburg is actually most likely a no go since I couldn't get my supplemental paperwork in before their deadline. So I was thinking for me that DeSales is my better option.

DeSales has a good value in general, it's very close by and I feel comfortable on campus, the computer science degree is a 5 year BS/MS program, but it's not as highly ranked as PSU (DeSales is in the top 30% of comp sci schools in the country and that's it really). The one thing I was excited about was their option to make it focused on game programming because I really like that stuff.

I guess the main reason for posting this is because I want to know whether I'm screwed, or I'm in an okay/decent position, or not too screwed for choosing DeSales University for CS. I figured I could put my PSU attendance and GPA on my resume. I've also already talked to a company nearby about an internship. They couldn't offer me it since I was a freshman, but they said I had good grades and looked like a good candidate for an internship so I'll try and do that too.

Well; I get in and go through the mandated training which kept me pretty busy and then my manager was out for the rest of the week so I didn’t meet her until the following week. When she got back, she didn’t really set up any time to meet with me or get anything organized until I asked her what I should be doing. I was assigned one project which I finished fairly quickly and I haven’t gotten anything since despite asking. I’ve even been left out of all department meetings (that the other interns went to) because she forgot to forward me the invite. 

I feel very in the dark and I definitely have had to push to get any sort of work here. It’s upsetting as I chose this internship because in my interview they talked about how I’d be pretty busy and would have to be on my toes. Seems like all the other interns have cool projects they’re working on, and my manager rarely even speaks to me.

I’m just at a lost of what to do, and how to proceed. I’m getting paid to sit here and look like I’m doing something, even though I don’t have anything to do. I’ve expressed interest in doing things several times, and just seem to be forgotten about. Has anyone had a similar experience/any advice on how to continue on? "

`Next i`

Any help with the light yellow boxes and keeping their format should be enough help for me to get the numbers.

Edit: I've had a few edits to the code, `CopyOrigin:=xlFormatFromLeftOrAbove`, I've tried to look up a few ways to add rows and columns but none truly show me how to keep the format.  I tried adding something like `Column(i +1).PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteFormats` but that gave me an error. Now that I look at it again its probably because i is an As Long not an integer.  Should I add a new variable, set it as an integer and then set that integer to a number I'm trying to format from?

This is a long one, I'm sorry...

I feel stuck, and would love advice.

About me, I'm 42, married, without children &amp; I live in Southern California. I have a Master's in Film and a BA in Theater, more about these later.

I currently work as a sort of project manager for a cruise line overseeing public space refurbishment, tracking budgets, comparing pricing for furniture and reviewing plans.

My work history:

Prior to this job, I worked as a project manager/sort of designer for trade show booths/museum exhibits. I personally project managed the installation of the Art of Bugatti Exhibit, which means I was involved in every way, though not responsible for the design, etc. I did enjoy this sort of work to some degree...but it was very stressful. Project Management doesn't exactly come natural to me, but I did a decent job. I left the company because the pay wasn't very good and they demanded 12+ hour days, 6-7 days a week...which I just wasn't willing to do.

Previous to that, I worked in Architecture from 1998-2008 as a CAD drafter. I ended up in this field because out of high school, I swore of school. My parents convinced me to go to trade school, where I went and became a certified in Machine Drafting Technology, which included AutoCAD...which I took to naturally (I have always been able to pick up and learn/master software very easily). I hated being in Architecture...or perhaps I should say I hated my role in architecture. CAD became boring to me very quickly and was not challenging, and I began to despise architecture as a whole. I didn't feel I had any room to advance, either...as not long after I became involved in the field, the AIA changed the rules of certification, requiring a degree in order to become a certified architect, rather than degree or equivalent work experience. Regardless, I'm not sure I would have gone after it...architects are a strange breed of artist engineers who are absolutely dedicated to their craft, and again, this was not me. I continued on doing this work, however, because the pay was so good, especially when I was in my early twenties, right up until 2008. When the economic crash happened, the architecture industry was hit particularly hard, as all construction loans froze. Layoffs swept through the industry, particularly in Boston, where I lived at the time, and I found myself out.

Education:

So here's where perhaps who I really am and what I should really be doing emerges. I went back to college at the age of 20, spending two years at Community College, then transferring up to University (I'm a CU alum, for what it's worth). I really hit my stride in University...there were so many unique and interesting classes...I loved it. I jumped around, from a weather forecasting class that I loved, to an acting class I enjoyed, to mythology, to Egyptian hieroglyphics, to Native American Religious Traditions, to Graphic Novels (where I wrote and drew pages for my own)...it was an educational buffet...right up until I had to choose a major. I probably should have created my own major, but I didn't. Instead, I chose theater, not necessarily because I loved it, but because I liked my acting classes and thought that maybe one day I would become a movie actor. The more I learned about theater, the less interested in it I became...I didn't feel like I was an actor. I did enjoy critical analysis, fiction writing, Shakespeare...and I also worked in the Scene Shop building sets. I learned carpentry and metal working skills there. While I didn't love theater, and was happy to not return to it post graduation, I did feel as though it was closer to who I am than anything else I'd found up until then. 

Fast forward to 2009. I looked at my layoff as an opportunity to make some big changes...I didn't want to find a way back to architecture, and that wasn't really an option anyways, fully certified architects were my competition for the most basic architecture jobs. So, I started looking around at other careers...and finally, I decided I'd take a wild shot one of my life's loves, film. I got accepted at American University's Film MA program. I loved it there...I had designs on being a writer director and almost every class I took I fully enjoyed. Specifically, I loved photography, script writing, &amp; directing. I did find that I got frustrated with the slowness of other peoples sets. On my set, as director, I moved quickly, never had a day longer than 8 hours. On others, everything seemed to move slowly, often taking 12 hours or more. After graduation, I moved out to LA in order to break into the industry.

In LA, I found it hard to get any traction...at the age of 37, I tried a no pay internship, but I needed to work to live, so had to give it up after a month, and started temping...which led to project management, to where I am today.

So, to sum up, my work career has consisted of doing something I don't like in order to survive. My educational career has consisted of discovering things I love that don't necessarily translate into money making. I've associated work with misery for some time.

My question is, how do I even try to find what I really should be doing? I've read a million career books...and I always find myself feeling lost after reading them, doing the exercises. I've been to two different career counselors and felt both were pushing some sort of agenda, rather than really trying to help me. I suspect I'm not meant for traditional jobs, but I'm not sure what else to do at this point, especially given the financial responsibilities that come from being 42, having tons of student loan debt &amp; having a small family.

Any advice? Is there hope for me?

Appreciate it any and all."

Thoughts on Exam:
- Wish I would have made a better score, but a pass is a pass, right?
- I had focused on memorizing ram pins and sockets but had ZERO questions about them haha
- People kept saying that I would have a ton of printer questions but I would say that I only had maybe 10 out of the 82 that were printer related. I mainly had Hardware Troubleshooting questions and network questions (Memorize those ports!!!)
- I had two PBQ's and they weren't too tough, but I think I got one right and the other one partially correct.
- Overall the questions were worded very vaguely and had multiple correct answers but required you to pick the ""Best"" ""First step"" or ""Most Likely"" option. 

Study material: 

1.Professor Messer's Videos/Study Guide/Practice Exams
- I felt his videos definitely helped me understand the material and was fairly easy to digest. The online book/Study Guide with Skillpipe was a good resource that went through a mountain of info and linked to videos after each chapter to go over what you read.
- I used his practice test PDF's and would recommend them, but I did not think they were structured, nor worded like the actual test.

2.Pocket Prep
- This helped me a lot and I like that they let you focus your test on specific topics instead of mixing them all together. Also, the UI was smooth to use.

3.Crucial Exams
- I took all of their practice tests until I was getting 90% on them and utilized their flashcards as well as their exercises.


A little bit about me and my technical experience:
- No degree
- I was lucky to find my way into this industry a couple years ago with my experience as a Cable Technician for Time Warner Cable. A company gave me an intern job making similar pay to come in as a Help Desk Intern. I have since then moved into a role at a smaller company as a Help Desk Specialist. My boss made it one of my yearly goals to get the A+ Cert (he also paid for the training and the test) 
- I found this subreddit and constantly looked through every post that had anything to do with 901 and read through others success stories with various study materials and tools. If I ever felt drained from taking a practice test or reading for hours, then I would wander into this subreddit and leave feeling much more positive and like I had others to relate to.

I would appreciate any tips for prepping myself for the 902. I am considering trying out Certblaster or TotalSims (Any other recommendations are welcome!) Thanks!

Please advise...",brotherazrael,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8rcxkp/i_got_an_employee_referral_turns_out_the_job/,"So, my mom cleans houses for a living and one of the people whose house she cleans took pity on her and me and said he would help me get a job at their place of employment. He is a director of Information technology at a medium sized (~100 people) accounting/investment company in NYC. I was concerned with this because I have no experience in accounting/investment. I have 2 years of experience is in environmental services industry, data analysis and statistics, so it’s still pretty valuable. He assured me that it would not be an issue, so I thought, why not, sure help me get a job at your company? Maybe they’ll give me a good offer for a data analyst job, I thought. Well, today I got an offer for a 6 month internship (full time during the summer, part time 3x a week in the fall). The pay is $15/hr which is lower than what I’m making now. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m quite disappointed because he said HR was writing up a job position for me, and it turned out to be an internship. Not to be ungrateful or anything, but I’m not looking for internships, I’m looking for a well-paying job/career in data analytics/statistics and I thought this guy (director/my mom’s contact) could help me break into the industry, but it turned out to be a low paying internship. Anyways, so I told her (HR person) that I’m currently making more and that I want at least $23-$25 per hour. She said she’ll speak with her manager and the director of the department and get back to me next week.  
 
&amp;nbsp;

Right now I’m working for the past 2 years as a long term intern/co-op/consultant in an environmental company in northern NJ doing data analysis of injury and environmental data. I’m making $18/hr, with flexible hours (usually I work 7:30AM-3:30PM), the company is 2 miles from my parents’ house, so it’s about a 5 minute drive, or 30 minute walk on nice summer days like today. My boss is moving into a new position with the company and training me on her current job duties and it looks like I’ll be supporting her role in the near future, why else take the time to train me on her job duties? The salary for her role is around $65k-70k, but since I’m not as experienced as she is, I’m expecting $55k-60k and benefits. 

&amp;nbsp;

On the other hand, the accounting/investment company is an hour commute from my parent’s house, depending on NJ transit, which is sometimes late and unpredictable, don’t know about NYC subways though. Nevertheless, I can’t accept anything less than what I’m making now. It’s not that I’m an ungrateful millennial…I’m self-interested and care about moving forward in life, not moving backwards into shitty internship positions. Unless, they can match the potential $55k and benefits that I might get at my 1st job, then I probably won’t accept their offer. I kind of feel bad though when I think about rejecting the offer and his help of finding me a job at the company. Thoughts? Please advise...

8rd0c3,1,2018-06-15,Internship negative criticism,itaZAM,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8rd0c3/internship_negative_criticism/,"Hello all, this happened today and I feel still in shock as if I was heartbroken.. 

So, I'm in my early twenties and doing an internship in a scientific field in a research center. 

The project I'm working on is admittedly complex and the solution is unknown. And the agreement is: I advance the project during the internship and if all goes well( project gets to a good point) then they'll keep me in order to complete my degree while working for them. 
I've been working for one month and a half and one third of time passed. 

My mentor is not my direct manager but he's the one following me technically: let's name him John. 

The technology used by this research center was completely unknown to me and both John and my manager knew it and therefore foreseen 20% of John's time as training and mentoring for me, John himself said during the interview that best case scenario it will take me 2 months of training to get used to the environment. 

It's my first ""real"" job and I was so excited at the beginning... 
The first 3 weeks John came to my office twice a day to teach me things and give me exercises to do, everything smooth and fine so far. He kept saying each time ""I know I'm giving you a lot of information each time I come to see you but time is little and we need to get fast to a point where you can work at your own and advance the real project"". 

The database of the company is a big mess and the technology I'm using doesn't have any resources online therefore I chat with John on Skype when I have a question, sometimes even for brainstorming. 

2 weeks ago I found a table on the database with a strange property and I asked John what it was. He answered he didn't know and asked me to investigate. 
As there are no documentation on this database, it took me half day of joining and filtering just to find out that it's a non coherent obsolete property. After telling him, he told me it took him 5 minutes to realise that but that was good training for me and that next time it will take me less time, I have to keep working hard. 

Last week John came to see me in my office only twice and one day, I thought I found a solution and I tried to explaining him by chat what I just discovered instead of thinking it through and writing a proper email (I then realised it was not working and said sorry). He then wrote an email to me and my manager saying that from now on I have to write my questions/thoughts by email and to keep chat only for small fast questions. 

I didn't really understand why he ccd my manager as he could have simply said ""I don't have time to understand your brainstorming on Skype, do it yourself then come up with your questions by email""... 

Finally, we come to today.. 
After lunch he asked me to speak with him privately: he stated that I am sometimes too slow, I keep digging too much and obstinate myself on something while I have to straight realise what is useful and what isn't. He also said that sometimes I ask questions multiple times ( today I asked him a question that he already answered 2 weeks ago, on the difference between two databases that I never used).  
He continued by saying that the two months left are too little and it's unlikely to have a concrete project to show at the end and therefore if that's the case than they won't be able to keep me later. 

When I asked what am I supposed to do if this is nearly impossible, he straight away denied saying so and tried to guide the perspectives in a more optimistic way: I have to do my best and come up with a solution that himself didn't find.. 

I felt too much criticised, I know criticism matures a person but I feel it was too harsh. Was he trying implicitly to motivate?  Was he trying to tell me I'm not worth keeping? 

I took that criticism personally and my life will probably suck for the next 2 months. 

Thank you a lot for who reeds this and gives me his point of view. Don't hesitate to ask clarifications..

I am currently working full time at a computer science company developing websites using frameworks like Struts, Liferay, and Hybris. (I have been using Struts Backend and Database Changes for the most part) I am fortunate to earn this internship as young as I have since I started when I was a Junior in high school doing QA. However, I have since been able to start doing actual programming for the company and for the client.

With this ""Promotion"" came a raise to $12/hr. Now, I am grateful that I have this internship and this opportunity to get this experience (with pay), however I am doing the work of actual developers.

Now I understand that I don't have a degree, and I probably take way longer to do some tasks, and maybe not the most efficiently.(Even though we do code reviews) However, I am curious if the job I'm doing warrants a higher pay and if I should bother asking, or if I should just keep my current position and get as much experience as I can.

Any help is much appreciated.

Edit:

TL;DR

I have a programming internship developing projects for clients for $12/hr. Is it worth me asking for a raise, or should I just be fortunate for having an internship this young. (Starting college in fall)"

Our assets consists of many information such as serial #, asset #, manufacturer name, model, etc.. The way we put our assets in the system currently is to enter each of those information manually from an Excel spreadsheet. What we wanna do is to automate this task such that we can just upload the spreadsheet and have Insight check the data and look for duplicates that already exist in the inventory and replace them with the new data in the spreadsheet.

I messed around Insight a little bit and came across Automation which is something that sounds like it could do what i'm trying to do. Has anyone worked with Insight Asset Management and JIRA before? Is this goal achievable? 

Please note that I cannot use another program, we can only use these two programs for our asset managements.

I wanted to hand in my graduation internship today. Before checking it one last time I wanted to update all fields by the F9 command key. It is a large document (docx 81 pages 42 mb) so MS Word got kinda stuck. I closed Word a opent the file again. Guess what, everything is gone except my front page. The size of my file is still 42 mb and if i look at the properties I can see that it still contains al the words, pages etc. If I go in navigation mode in MS Word I can see that all the headers still exist. The word count is at 30 words (all from my front page) and I can't type anything. I think only my front page is visible because it is section 1 and the rest of my file is section 2. MS Word is also very buggy when I try to do something in the file. So concluding, it seems everything still exist but is invisible. Word has never let me down in the past and always worked great.

I tried recovering the file with the program easeus (which I had to buy for 80 euros). If I try to open that asd-file it asks me in which coding. Whatever I choose Word is not responding after that. If somebody could help me I would be very grateful :).

8refwb,8,2018-06-15,Advice for beginner with no past experience but decent resume,BakedPhresh,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8refwb/advice_for_beginner_with_no_past_experience_but/,"I've always thought IT might be a good career path for me, and recently narrowed it down to networking. 

I came to think I might enjoy this because I've always had an interest in computers and tech, and been a more than averagely savvy user. But I wouldn't consider myself a ""nerd"" or ""geek"" type who has years and years of detailed study under my belt.

I'm 24, and if I take 15 credits next semester, then 12 credits and a 10 week internship the next semester, I can graduate with a BS Information Systems degree from a state school May 2019. 

Relevant past experience: cable technician contractor for TWC in North Carolina. But I was working under these guys who were taking a portion of my pay for every job, so I decided to come home and finish up my school.

I have an AA degree in Business. 3.0 GPA for that and currently a 3.0 in my undergrad studies. Hopefully I will get that up by the time I graduate, but I can say that I worked 20-46 hours all the time I have been studying. 

Currently I am a management intern with Walgreens. It's not terrible, but I don't feel challenged enough and I hate the scheduling. ""clopen"" is a thing now and that's rough.

I don't mind putting in up to 55-60 hours during peak times, but I'd prefer to work 40-50.

Family life is important to me so I prefer set schedules and time to see the kids. I'm wiling to make certain sacrifices for the right income level, or a pathway there. I'd like to be earning $120k within 20 years. 

But how is the networking industry? I'd like to be some sort of ""IT Manager"" later in my career. 

I'm INTJ type on the meyers briggs if that helps anyone. 

My tech skills are basic. I've replaced the HDD in my laptop with SSD, know basic soldering. Have tools. Basic html and css, played with Javascript, even built some different things but forget most of it know. I remember the basics of how the languages worked. I could pick it all up again with study. 

40 hrs at walgreens and all the irrelevant college courses are taking my time away from studying, but I'd like to first get my A+, then work on CCENT/CCNA.

But any advice on how the industry of networking is and if it sounds like I could find something to work with my wants or no. I know every job has its negatives and I'm willing to make sacrifices for certain things like pathway to promotion, challenging work that I enjoy on some level, salary and benefits, paid time off, etc. 

I'd like to make $43k out of school (for my area), and $75k within 5 years. Hopefully that $75k job would lead into higher levels. I've been looking at Verizon lately, maybe that would be a good fit for me? 

This is long already, but any help is appreciated. Thanks for reading. "

I don't really like being a software engineer.  I've had internships at large companies, startups, mid-size.  I just don't like how isolating the work is and it doesn't match my personality.  I'm ok at it and could probably do it but I really want to be a PM.  I love the whole product development phase, going from an idea, to designs, to code and I want to be involved in all of it.  I paid my way through college by doing freelance UI/UX work so I have that skillset as well.  I know most PM's start out as engineers then get an MBA or transition internally, but I think with my experience I'd be prepared to handle the role.  The thing is there's barely any new grad PM jobs and they all go to the kids who double-majored in Business and Computer Science, have a 4.0, and previously interned at Goldman/McKinsey.

Would it be easier to just go the engineer route and work up to the position or keep applying hoping a company will take a chance on me?"

I'm 34 y.o. male living in Maryland. Tons of jobs here around MD/DC/VA, but yet I can't seem to get a decent one. My professional experience is in sales, management and some IT tech support. I went back to school back in 2010 and got my Bachelor of Science in Information Systems from University of Maryland, College Park which constantly ranks as one of the best state universities for business. Their business school programs are actually competitive to get into. I received a scholarship and graduated with $0 debt. While in school, however, I did not do any internships, but rather worked for my family business (small retail store), which, in hindsight, is probably my biggest mistake. Also, the Information Systems degree I got is more business-oriented and offered only a few courses in Visual Basic and SQL.

Fast forward to now and I still haven't had a real career working for a big company with benefits, opportunities for advancement, etc. All my job experience is either in retail sales and my current job is a general manager/project manager for a renovation/remodeling company. I hate my job. I drive 500-600 miles every week using my own vehicle, I get no benefits, not even EZ Pass for road/tunnel tolls. In fact, I am employed as a contractor which means I pay higher taxes as well. I work for a greedy boss who takes 60% of the project money while constantly looking for the cheapest possible contractor to do the actual work. Cheapest usually means lowest quality as well, which is why he expect me to deal with the inevitable problems that arise. Some days are very stressful and I find myself in ""I'm done with this"" mindset quite often. I do have bills, however, and quitting without something else lined up is scary. So I calm myself down and keep going. No bonuses, no benefits, not opportunities for advancement. I have no opportunities to receive bonuses (except $100 for each good review which is a joke), no performance reviews, not even an ocassional ""good job"".

My passion has always been IT, and I have been thinking about obtaining a certificate in Cyber Security which a local university offers. It's only 12 credits and costs around $10k. I could be done in a year while studying part time and continue with master's if I want to (which is additional 2 years part-time). The problem with that is that I don't know if that will make me more attractive to potential employers. I have applied to about 40-50 positions over the past year, and I haven't heard back from any of them except for an occasional phone interview. I heard back from Solar City to be their sales rep and stand around Home Depot offering solar panels to people which is a joke...

Ideally, I would like to be a project manager for an IT or cyber security company. I am not really into programming myself and have struggled with even basic computer science classes. I am good, however, with people and managing them. I just don't know what to do in order to put my foot in the door. I don't really want to start off as a tech support, because I have a few years experience in that and I am getting old to start out att he very lowest tier. Ideally, I guess I would like to be an associate to a project manager and just learn how to become one eventually.

Sorry for a long post. Any ideas or input would be appreciated."

Unfortunately due to changing majors and not having a couple prereqs done, I am a little behind the average CS track. So basically I have two options:

Graduate in 3 years and 4 months (7 semesters) with a summer internship (granted I am able to get one)

or

Graduate in 2 years and 4 months (5 semesters) with no internship

I think the best option would be the first one, graduating with an internship. I would obviously like to graduate a year sooner, but I know the importance of getting some experience before graduating. I would love to hear opinions for others who may have been in the same situation.

Throughout my college years, I have been actively applying (At least 100+) to Internships/Co-ops that's related to my field (Manufacturing, Operation research, supply chain, etc). However, I have only received one interview, and the rest of them are either no response or denials.

Unsurprisingly, all said no (Most of them said that they wanted to hire interns with prior internship experience....)

The only work experience that I have throughout my college years is that I started an online retail business on Amazon in late 2016 (I was able to do just a little over 30k in sales my first year, little over 100k in sales in 2017, and on track to do 200k in sales this year). I understand that my retail business experience have nothing to do with my major. I put that experience down on my resume because I thought that most recruiters wanted to see self-driven people or entrepreneurs, but I still get denials/no callbacks.

My initial plan was to get a Co-op this Fall and next Spring just so I can get some experience in the real world, and push back my graduation by a year. But it just seems less and less likely now considering at the amount of rejections... I even considered maybe taking off my business from my resume, but then my resume would just be empty because I have no other projects/experience to show.

I am lost, confused, and don't know what to do. I even tried to look into business/management internships/co-ops, but all of them wanted business/related degrees.

So pretty much, what can/should I do to get recruiters hire me? And also, how hard will it be for me to get job offers right after graduation without experience in my major? Thanks so much"

8ri47r,2,2018-06-16,"If she cuddled and held hands with me, does she like me?",throwymcthrowboat,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8ri47r/if_she_cuddled_and_held_hands_with_me_does_she/,"(This is kinda long and confusing, sorry! I know, my grammar sucks) TLDR at the bottom
Sounds like a middle schoolers post. I know, but we're both in our early 20s.

So here's the story. I've been somewhat interested in this girl since high school. We hang out quite often within our friend group and get along very well. We're both sarcastic and tease each other a lot.

Just a few months ago, we've started getting closer. Our friend group had a small bonfire and after a few drinks and the night was getting late and cold, the girl I'm in to, another girl, and I cuddled up with a blanket and our legs were intertwined. All I thought at that time was ""this is great! Two girls cuddling around me.""

A few months later, we were all together for winter break so we all got together again and we were watching a movie. I was sitting next to her and got bold and started playing footsie with her and she responded well with it. Eventually we were fully cuddling with her head on her shoulder and when I tried to get her to hold my hand, she slightly shook her head to say no. I was disappointing but it kind of made sense since we were with friends and we aren't dating.

Leading up to this point, it sounds like I have great chances with her right? Well I'm kind of a straightforward guy and I bluntly asked her the day afterward by text if the cuddling meant anything, but she just replied with a firm no and that she thought I was a great guy but it didn't mean anything. 

Disappointing, but I've had rejections before and knew that if a girl wasn't interested then that's that. Respect her wishes...

Fast forward to summer break. Again some of us got together and we decided to stay over at a friends place. We all got somewhat tipsy/drunk and I was flirting with her a little but we had a lot of skin to skin contact and the mood was pretty good. At one point people started to go to bed but I lightly convinced her to stay and talk with me and another friend. She came back and sat on the same couch as me with a blanket covering us both. As we were settling my hand accidentally (really!) touched her hand and she grabbed it. We held hands as me, her, and the other friend talked for a while until the friend went to sleep. At that point she started to get up but I convinced her to stay and talk some more. We talked and eventually started cuddling while still holding hands. Somehow we ended up spooning and I was rubbing her arms and legs. She didn't say or do anything against and it didn't seem like she was uncomfortable (She isn't a shy person so she would've stopped me if she didn't like it). I took this as a sign that I could go further but I was stopped at a certain point. I understood and we just kept talking. Eventually we were both so tired so she went to sleep elsewhere (Since we both didn't want the others to know), however, just before she left I asked for a good night kiss on the cheek and she did (nice!)

The morning afterwards, everything went back to normal. We had fun and all and we all went home. 

From then to the present I've been so confused. The whole thing with cuddling, holding hands, and kiss on the cheek makes me think she's into me....

However, I'm currently off doing an internship and can't hang out with her for a little bit so I've been trying to hold a snap streak with her and get talking with her more and she replies to my snaps/texts but it usually ends with her stoping the reply and conversation dying (although my conversations aren't super exciting, just small talk). This makes me think that she really isn't into me. 

Another thing is that I'm thinking she just wants us to stay as friends? Or maybe doesn't want to get in a relationship? or maybe she doesn't want to be in a long distance relationship (Since we both go out of state)?

All these thoughts are going through my mind at 1:30 AM and the past few days. 

Am I overthinking things and she is into me? Or my other thoughts correct and she isn't into me or doesn't want a relationship? Someone help me sort this out. 

TLDR: Me like girl. Cuddled with girl and asked if she likes me = no. Later cuddle, hug, hold hands, and get a kiss on the cheek with girl. Now confused and needing internet strangers advice."

I haven't completed my bachelor's yet, but I am not without education. I took an IT vocational program where I obtained a certificate of completion for the program itself. Aside from college level business communications and IT courses, the program offered specialized tracks to students. My track was the data analytics track where students studied data analytics using tools like Excel, MySQL, Tableau, and intro to Python for 6 months through a separate organization that was partnered with this IT program . After those 6 months, along with the IT certificate, I also received certification of completions for MySQL, Tableau, and Python through this separate organization. 

After the program I went on to gain an internship as an HR Data Analyst for 6 months and then a 2 month contract extension, totaling my experience to 8 months in the field. I just accepted a job offer as a finance and accounting analyst that I plan to stay on for about 6 months to bring my experience to over a year in the field.

I have more than some college education/credits, but haven't completed because of a lack of financing. This is where my question comes in. As I'm 25 nearing 26 there is a sense of urgency to get my shit completely together before I'm 30. So I'm wondering if I could succeed in the field of data analytics with the following hypothetical qualifications. Keep in mind that each scenario literally describes a path I'm considering taking, but simply don't have enough direction, experience, or knowledge to predict the best outcome. That's why I'm asking for help.

1. Associate of Science in related field with current Certs and cert's from University of San Francisco in both SQL and R programming while working

2. Current Certs and pursue Univ. of SF certs in SQL and R programming while working

3. Obtain Bachelor's in Communications (because it's one of the degrees that I can literally obtain within a year and it'll be nice to have a ""formal"" education) with current Certs and pursue univ. of SF certs in aforementioned fields

4. (Most time consuming and expensive option, least favorite) Work and save up to put myself through college and obtain a B.S. in Statistics

I would honestly prefer 1 or 3, but I need to know if I would have a good chance of being hired or considered with those certain qualifications. Would I be ""set"" and good? Also, please keep in mind my work experience in the field. I literally don't know what to do and can't make any moves towards anything without being well informed. Any insight, advice, and or general guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

I am going to uni to study CS in Central Europe, and I am applying for internships this summer (and would also like to work during the year). A few days ago, I went to a job interview for an internship where I would mainly use React and Redux. I have experience with React, but not with Redux, but they said they are absolutely okay with that and that they would be open to train me on the job. 

There were about 20 of us on the interviews, and \~10 of us would progress to the next stage where we would be assigned a small project in react and after that \~5 would get the internship. Now this internship wasn't very well paid in comparison to some other offers, but I liked that the company uses lots of different technologies and also languages like Haskell and F# for some projects, which I like. 

On the interview, we took an ""aptitude"" test (there was no programming at all in fact). I have managed to get 30/30 points, which made my result the best in the history of the company (at least that's what I was told). Then, we had some stupid group assignment, in which I performed well, as we solved the problem and I left in good spirits after talking to some of the employees about the technologies they use. I liked the company a lot, and even though the pay was pretty low (even by the standards of my country), I thought that I would take it, if only for a few months and hopefully they would give me a pay raise or a part-time offer if I performed well enough.

Unfortunately, I was told in an email that I was rejected. Afterwards, when I called them, they told me that they were very impressed, but they thought that an ""ambitious and capable person like me"" should aim higher and I wasn't really the right fit. I basically told them to cut the bullshit, but they wouldn't tell me the exact reason. Note that I really thought I was the best in my group by far, and I am not saying this out of arrogance, I really did have the best results and the best portfolio (although not impressive by any means, but most of the others didn't even have a grasp on working with Git). 

Therefore, I am extremely confused as to why I was rejected, as I still think I was the best possible fit for the job (as in pretty decent for a student, but a bit too green for a junior developer role. It's a real shame, because I can't really understand why they thought I wasn't good enough in comparison to some other people there."

Will it and how much will it hurt my chances of getting into grad school?,tammyqiu,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8rkaam/horrible_experience_working_with_a_grad_student/,"Five months ago, I started working with a Masters student at my dream school. It was an intense project that was more like a startup than a research project and I had devoted a lot of my time working on it despite not getting paid. The grad student I was working for was very harsh from the beginning, but would also be very friendly (such as taking me and another intern out for dinner or to rock climbing). Our relationship got really bad when I took a call from a center we were planning a collaboration with during the weekend without her. I took the call thinking it was in the best interests of the project because the people from the center seemed agitated that we kept on rescheduling the call. The call went well but when I updated her on it she completely blew up, sending me very harsh and borderline disrespectful messages over Slack at 1AM two days in a row. I saw the mistake that I had made and I owned up to it but I don't believe that her response was warranted either. 

Later that week she informed me that I needed to be at the lab 15 hours/week even though she already knew I was working fulltime elsewhere for the summer. At that point, it no longer made sense for me to stay on the research project, given the toxic environment as well as the issue of timing. When I told her that I would like to leave and that I had reassured her new summer interns (who dislike and are absolutely terrified of her) that I would be available to support them, she completely blew up on me again, insisting that I was being inappropriate for talking to HER interns (""I don't believe that you genuinely care about people you just me""), arrogant because of how I was standing with the them (arms crossed) and unprofessional because of my salutation to an email I sent to the intern mailing group (""Hi all""). I've seen her be rude to people during meetings and she's told me herself that she does not have good relationships with other people in the group, with others finding her ""difficult to approach."" All of this is fine because I have quit; however she told me that she would never recommend me to anyone and that she was going to email the current professor with whom I have started working to arrange a call to tell her everything about me and her experiences working with me. 

Although I did make mistakes during this internship, I have owned up to all of them. I think our working styles just didn't mesh well because she is extremely micromanaging, but now it seems like she's on a rampage to obstruct my career. How should I even respond to something like this? It makes me feel terrible that she has such a distorted view of me but she is no longer willing to listen to me. "

I'm lucky enough to have intern offers from Splunk, LinkedIn and Cisco Meraki. Currently trying really hard to decide which one to take. Which one would you choose and why? Any input is appreciated.

Edit: All three positions are frontend engineering. This is gonna be my last internship before I graduate so I'm looking for internship can potentially help me land a decent full-time job in the near future. These three companies seem equally good to me. But I don't know anyone who has interned there so wish to learn more.

I know college admissions can sometimes be unpredictable, but I wanted to know what you guys think my chances are for a the schools that I'm interested in. I don't mind going to a state school, but only if I can get a scholarship and attend the honors college (but idk if i would achieve those). 

Jsyk this long post has personal info, stats, gpa explanation, recs, essay ideas, factors in college selection, and then the actual list of colleges...

Personal info:

* 17 y/o female
* Indian American
* Both parents went to college
* Won't qualify for financial aid
* from PA
* No legacy/other affiliations
* Future prospects: biomedical engineer, research, doctor

Stats:

* predicted GPA (4.4 W, 3.6 UW)
* SAT 1500 (i'm retaking in aug and expect at least a 1550 superscore) 
* No SAT Subject scores yet (hoping to get at least 750 in chem, bio m, and math 2, but there's only october left so idk)
* Varsity tennis captain
* Research for 5 years (college/univ/hospital)
* Placed at state science fair, won awards and money (for 3 years)
* Founder and president of HOSA (health occupations students of america - healthcare club)
* Made it to nationals for FBLA and HOSA
* Writing: blog, published online, scholastic writing award
* Publishing a middle reader book this summer (think Magic Tree House) &amp; donating profits to charity
* Annual book drive to donate books to impoverished children for Christmas
* President of Youth Association (25+ teens volunteer)
* Volunteered in India
* Random stuff (taught elementary school kids, national honors society, national spanish exam, etc.)

GPA Explanation: 

* 9th - poor grades (struggled with the transition from middle school i was really naive)
* 10th - really good grades
* 11th - poor grades (went through mental health struggles, rising trend towards the end)
* 12th - expecting good grades

Recs: 

* AP Chem: I got a low grade in that class, but I worked hard, and my teacher likes me. 
* AP Psych: I did really well in that class and knew the teacher for two years, and we've had some really nice discussions. 
* Guidance Counselor: I've spoken to her a lot, but it's hard to tell what she thinks of me (could be fake positivity idk). 

Essays: 

* Struggling and accomplishing to publish my book
* Funny anecdotes and life lessons about living with a genius brother
* How my mental health affected me and how i grew to learn from it/accept it
* Dealing with a big failure i had but bouncing back from it
* How much i respect my father -- how he changed my life multiple times -- how his upbringing was so vastly different from mine
* How living in America separated from all of my relatives distanced me from my culture and changed many customs (but how i still appreciate it)

----i haven't really given this much thought, and i know these essays aren't the best and pretty generic, but here's what i thought of in 5 min----

To me, important things in a college are

* location and area around the college (i would prefer a city)
* whether it has a track for my major (bme/neuro) &amp; a good program
* good internship opportunities
* research for undergrads
* study abroad + travelling programs
* class sizes (400+ kids is too much, which is why it would be better to go to an honors college for a state school)
* good support system + guidance counselors, flexibility of schedule
* ""chillness"" in the college atmosphere if that makes sense
* class size (dont want 400 people in a class which is why honors college if state school)
* good teachers + club + activities selection. 

This is a super long list and obviously, some things matter more than others. I'm flexible and not really opposed to any college. I would prefer staying on the east coast, TX, or CA. 

So here's a list of colleges I was considering (for BME/neuro) in no particular order.

* Boston University
* Northeastern
* Johns Hopkins
* Penn State
* Rutgers
* Georgetown
* UVA
* Emory
* Case Western
* UMD
* UConn
* UNC 
* NYU
* Georgia Tech
* Tufts
* Rice
* Columbia
* Cornell
* UCLA
* UCSD
* Berkeley
* UT Austin

So in this list, what colleges are realistic, and are there any more I should consider (or ones on this list I *shouldn't* consider)? Thank you :)

8rnphh,5,2018-06-16,Is it time to leave?,Akforce,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8rnphh/is_it_time_to_leave/,"Hi all,

This is a bit of a rant so the TL;DR is: My company and team relationships are solid, the work is interesting, but pay is weak relative to other offers, and part of the tech stack is horrendous... Should I accept offers from similar companies for more cash, but less company certainty?

A bit of background about me and my company. I have worked as an embedded software engineer for a mid sized company for the past year, and I joined straight out of school. Prior to starting I had 3 internships, but they were not necessarily relevant to my current career aspirations. My current team writes hard real-time software (C++) on VxWorks that acts as a hardware abstraction layer(HAL) for application software. Our team is high performing, all future hardware is centered around our project, and I have a very solid relationship with everyone on my team, including my manager, as well as the electrical/mechanical groups. Work is hardly ever boring, I thoroughly enjoy working on the technical problems we face, I'm given a chance to grow into the career I want, and I receive good performance reviews. Vacation time is above average, and I almost never work weekends.

Unfortunately there are some catches... First, part of our tech stack is horrendous. 10 years ago there was a push to rewrite our entire code base, everything from app code to the HAL, in a framework that is a sadist software architects wet dream. I'm talking about IBM's Rhapsody. I won't get into the details of why Rhapsody is such a bother, but I will say that anytime any of us has to touch code that sits in Rhapsody we spend significantly more time fighting the framework than solving the real technical problem. A large portion of our current code (maybe 40-50&amp;#37;) sits there, and a rework wouldn't be possible for another 1-2 years. Second, there is a serious lack in documentation, so much so that if a more senior engineer were to leave it could take months to recover the knowledge they acquired. Third and last, although the pay is not low for my area, I could be making much more working for a different company.

A few companies with interesting work have approached me over the past month or so, and I'm having trouble deciding whether I should meet with them and whether it would be wise to either use their offers as leverage for a raise, or simply leave my current company. The decreased commute (decreased from 1 hour to 10 minutes each way) is almost attractive enough by iteself to convince me, but I also have the opportunity to move closer to my current work if need be in the next year. What really sways me towards leaving is the possibility for a significant pay bump, sometimes upwards of 50&amp;#37;, without including total evaluation with company stock and other employee benefits. I received my first raise 6 months after starting, and have my (late) mid year review next month. This would seem like a good point to bring up money and use other offers as leverage, but I'm worried that it may be too soon to start using other offers as means to increase salary, and it might alter the good relationship I have with my manger now.

I truly do value my team and my manager, and I believe in our product(s) as well. This is why it's hard for me to justify leaving the company, but the issues I mentioned are something that are always on the back of my mind. I know that ""#EmployeesShouldn'tBeLoyalToCompanies"", but I am loyal to my team. The uncertainty that the team cohesion I have now will not be present in a new company is also holding me back from leaving.

Am I justified in my concerns, or does the grass always seem $greener$ on the other side?"

8royjm,1,2018-06-17,Pursue 4 year engineering degree or 2 year associate engineering technology degree?,Oysterbubble,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8royjm/pursue_4_year_engineering_degree_or_2_year/,"I'm currently 27 years old and already have a degree that I hate in economics. I spent 6 years getting it because I never knew what I wanted to do in school and ended up settling on that. 

I have a job working in a retail bank that doesn't put my degree to use. It was only supposed to be temporary and I thought some banking knowledge would help me apply for jobs within the bank. I applied for a credit analyst position because I've always been good with numbers and at math and I figured this would be something I'd enjoy doing, but I realized I barely retained any knowledge from school. In fact, most of the classes I remember taking barely pertained to data analysis. On top of that, I hate working for a bank and working in a department like that, I'm not sure I'd even be happy.

Anyway, back towards the talk about which degree I should pursue. During school, I had considered doing engineering, but my school didn't have an engineering program. I would have to transfer. I heavily contemplated, but I ended up getting a job on campus which cut the cost of tuition drastically which led me to stay at that same school. I ended up hopping between majors which led me to where I am now. 

Again, back to the degree. I want to feel proud of myself and get a career where I'll feel successful and people would realize that I can amount to something which is why I want to do the four year program. After learning more about it, it's sounding like it would be closer to five years if I were to get a MECOP internship, which is the goal if I go this route. A few reasons why I'm hesitant to go this route. 

1. The cost. I'm already in debt from my first degree. I would only be able to pay a portion up front and the rest would have to be loans since I think I'm limited to how much grant money I can get.
2. The time. Another five years of school seems overwhelming. I'd be done around 32-33. I think I'll feel really old. On top of that, five years of balancing school and work. The first two years I can do at a community college. I've looked into it and I have a lot of prereqs done including all of my math courses (math was my minor and I wanted to do engineering previously so I had picked the courses I read about that would pertain to engineering.) So the first two years would only be part time and I think I could manage it, but the remaining years are stressing me out. I'm guessing MECOP is extremely competitive so if I don't get a paid internship, I don't know if I can balance school and work full time. 
3. From what I read, a bachelor's degree puts you in like a planning/project management position. One of the teachers I talked to said she makes the plans, the techs do the hands on work, and she writes a report and sends it up the latter. I'm not sure if I just wanna write reports...

As for the engineering technology degree. It's only two years. At my local community college, it starts in winter and is six consecutive terms (we have 3 month terms here) which means I'd graduate 2 years from now if I start in winter. The cost would also be lower since its less time. But the upfront cost would be more. It looks like an average of 17 credit hours per term which will be difficult to handle this soon. I would need a new job where I could work in the evening. There would still be a cost and I'm worried about how much I'd be making because I'd have to pay for potential loans for this new degree, if I can even get financial aid for an associates, on top of what I already owe. I'm also worried about if I'll regret not pursuing something more and ""settling"" for a lesser career.

I know this is a wall of text, but I hope someone actually reads through it and can help me out even a little bit. Family and friends haven't really helped me much.

And before I forget to mention. I'm considering either civil or mechanical engineering. Those are the two I think I would enjoy the most. "

I just completed my third year in a PhD program, and I feel like I'm being screwed by my department. A good friend of mine who is not a lawyer advised that I should seek legal advice, as I may have a case for violation of the ADA/discrimination. Before I launch into the story of what happened, this is in NJ at a public state university that receives both federal and state funding. At the school I serve both a student and employee role (I teach for the department), and we have a graduate student union that has participated in arbitration for our salaries, if that's relevant. 

Somewhere around the end of February, my PI decided he was not satisfied with the progress I was making in my program. I pointed out that a major contributing factor was a massive breach of contract by him and the university, as he was forcing me to teach 30-40 hours a week, despite my contract stating I should only be teaching a maximum of 15 hours a week. He dismissed my claim, even though I had evidence to the contrary, claimed he also had issues with my attitude, and decided to escalate this to the department head. Prior to this, I had never received any official notification from the department of unsatisfactory performance or anything, and had completed all of the laid out academic requirements for my degree.

We participated in an arbitration meeting with the department head, and agreed upon changes that we would try to make to rectify the situation, and a month passed without further incident, and receiving positive feedback about my work from my boss. Around the third week of March, we scheduled a follow up meeting with the department head, myself, my boss, and the program coordinator to reevaluate where things stood between my PI and I.

The week before this meeting happened, I disclosed to my PI that I had been dealing with significant mental health issues for a long time and that I had gone to see a mental health professional, who diagnosed me with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. In the opinion of my mental health professional, these had both been through on by three years spent in an abysmal work environment with my PI, though I did not actually tell my PI this part, I just simply left it at I was diagnosed with the major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. At first, my professor seemed to be empathetic, telling me that I could take all the time I needed to get better and he was very glad to hear that I was getting help. He did not, however, notify me of anyone at the university I should talk to, or any further steps I needed to take after disclosing a mental health diagnosis. 

Around this time, I also applied for a summer internship on the suggestion of my therapist, who thought that this internship would be beneficial for my mental health. During the follow up meeting mentioned above, I informed my professor, the department head, and the department coordinator about my application for the internship, and mentioned that I was doing so as part of my attempt to improve his mental health status, and that this course of action was recommended by his therapist. The department head was furious that I wanted to take an internship, however my boss did not raise any objections. 

The rest of March and most of April went by, and I had continued to receive very positive feedback from my boss regarding my disposition and the progress I was making on my work. Around the third week of April, I was offered and accepted the internship and informed my PI that he would accept it, as I was not under contract or paid by the university during the summer months. My PI pointedly ignored me for a week, before I forced a conversation after my contract for the 2018-2019 academic year was randomly withdrawn without and notification as to why. This led to a conversation wherein my PI ultimately removed me from his lab, suggesting that it was disrespectful and selfish for me to have taken the internship, and claimed that despite giving nothing but positive feedback in our weekly discussions for the last two months, that nothing had changed. The conversation ended after I questioned him about my mental health and my efforts to get better, and he threw it back in my face, effectively saying I was a drain on his mental health.

That same day (a Monday) I had a meeting with the department head and the department coordinator, who said that I needed to find a new advisor and pressured me to make a decision right then, despite only having found out about my dismissal from my lab two hours earlier. At this time I also confirmed that they were aware of my mental health diagnosis, and they confirmed that they did indeed know. I asked for some time to make a decision, and they told me that I needed to make a decision by Wednesday, citing department deadlines.

Unhappy with the way this was all being handled, I instead went to the dean of the graduate school with my complaints about the way I was being treated. I explained everything that had happened up to this point to him, including the mental health diagnosis and the breach of contract. He told me that all proceedings in this matter would be halted until he had a chance to speak with the department. Thursday went by with nothing happening, and then Friday, even though the department said I simply had to find a new advisor that same week, I was issued a notice of dismissal from the program entirely. When I questioned the dean, I found out that the department justified my dismissal through several statements that were outright lies about things I said or did, and I have documented evidence refuting them. I immediately initiated the process to appeal the decision after this.

My question then is this: the university seems to be dragging their feet with the appeal process, as I submitted the appeal over a month ago and there still has not been a decision made. From several conversations I have had, I am not entirely optimistic of a positive outcome. I was considering contacting a lawyer, but I am unsure if that would be worth it, or if I would even have a case. Thank you to anyone who decides to read all this, and who may have any advice."

I just graduated my Masters and will be starting out as an SDE in Seattle at a company I also interned in during my Summer last year.

My question is this: there were always certain things in my office work, that I never really bothered to understand, because I was in general; feeling lost (no prior job experience)
For example when I saw some ancient technologies like Pro*C. I always shut off my brain thinking that I will never be able to pick these large technogies up simply because there was too little time for that(I'm the stereotypical get hyped about new language/framework and work on it type of guy) . I was able to convince my Manger to let me work on a fresh project requiring a different perspective but that convincing was much easier for me as an intern. Interns are in general already treated as liabilities IMHO; but as an actual part of the cog now, I can't do that anymore.

I don't want to keep running around aimlessly for the first 1 month like I did during my internship.

Any tips on how to start better? How do I build reputation? Any specific aspects I should focus on? "

I'm hoping to take EECS 281 in the Winter so (hopefully) I can get a CS internship in the summer. However, this means I'll need to take EECS 280 and a combinatorics course in the Fall: either EECS 203 or MATH 465. With that, I was curious if it were feasible for me to take MATH 465 (which counts towards the math minor) in lieu of EECS 203 without previously having taken MATH 217, which is listed as an advisory prerequisite for 465 on the LSA course guide.

For context, I've already taken AP Calculus AB/BC and received a 5 on both exams.

If any CS/Math majors could chime in, that would be much appreciated. Thanks!"

I haven't completed my bachelor's yet, but I am not without education. I took an IT vocational program where I obtained a certificate of completion for the program itself. Aside from college level business communications and IT courses, the program offered specialized tracks to students. My track was the data analytics track where students studied data analytics using tools like Excel, MySQL, Tableau, and intro to Python for 6 months through a separate organization that was partnered with this IT program . After those 6 months, along with the IT certificate, I also received certification of completions for MySQL, Tableau, and Python through this separate organization.

After the program I went on to gain an internship as an HR Data Analyst for 6 months and then a 2 month contract extension, totaling my experience to 8 months in the field. I just accepted a job offer as a finance and accounting analyst that I plan to stay on for about 6 months to bring my experience to over a year in the field.

I have more than some college education/credits, but haven't completed because of a lack of financing. This is where my question comes in. As I'm 25 nearing 26 there is a sense of urgency to get my shit completely together before I'm 30. So I'm wondering if I could succeed in the field of data analytics with the following hypothetical qualifications. Keep in mind that each scenario literally describes a path I'm considering taking, but simply don't have enough direction, experience, or knowledge to predict the best outcome. That's why I'm asking for help.

1. Associate of Science in related field with current Certs and cert's from University of San Francisco in both SQL and R programming while working
2. Current Certs and pursue Univ. of SF certs in SQL and R programming while working
3. Obtain Bachelor's in Communications (because it's one of the degrees that I can literally obtain within a year and it'll be nice to have a ""formal"" education) with current Certs and pursue univ. of SF certs in aforementioned fields
4. (Most time consuming and expensive option, least favorite) Work and save up to put myself through college and obtain a B.S. in Statistics

I would honestly prefer 1 or 3, but I need to know if I would have a good chance of being hired or considered with those certain qualifications. Would I be ""set"" and good? Also, please keep in mind my work experience in the field. I literally don't know what to do and can't make any moves towards anything without being well informed. Any insight, advice, and or general guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

I'm a rising senior (girl, white). My high school is public but extremely competitive to get into, and is considered one of the top schools in my state. Middle income. 

Major: CS, political science

SAT: 1520

Essays: I'm a pretty strong writer, so I think they'll be pretty good. 

Recs: Quite strong. I am a good student, and the teachers who I have asked know me very well. 

GPA: My school doesn't calculate my GPA, but I calculated it to be 3.9 (not sure if I did it right). I've gotten straight A's, with the exception of a B in physics this year. My school also doesn't do APs. Our top level is ""advanced,"" and I've always taken advanced classes. 

EC's: Class president

Captain of FRC robotics team (we've been to worlds every year I've been on the team)

NHS and highest honors designation at my school

Competitive fencer and youth coach at my fencing club (some of the coaching is volunteer and some is paid. I also help out my coach with paperwork, cleaning the gym, etc.)

Docent at a local history museum (internship)

Counselor at a summer camp for inner-city kids (volunteer position)

Legislative intern for a state senator (doing some really cool stuff in this role, it's most likely going to be what I write about for my essays)

Varsity math team

HiMCM and M3C competitions (made it to the final round of HiMCM, past the second triage round of M3C)

Grade, school, regional, and state representative on student advisory council 

Part-time job for a local clothing start-up (paid position)

First place at school, regional, and state science fairs, fourth place at Intel ISEF 2018. (My research was in an intersection of both polisci and cs, the avenues I want to study in college.)

Apps for good 

I want to study both computer science, ideally with a focus on cybersecurity, and political science; I think the biggest weakness of my application is the ""B"" in junior year (I know colleges don't like to see downward trends.) My list so far: 

Safety: WPI, UMass Lowell 

Match: GW, Stevens, Northeastern 

Reach: Harvard, Brown, Tufts 

Is this reasonable? How strong do you think my chances are for these schools, and is there anything I should be doing senior year to improve my chances or compensate for the physics grade?

I'm currently interning in a small strategy consulting boutique before graduating.

It's a very interesting job and I love the variety and the challenges.

The hours can be a bit taxing with at least 11 hours a day expected for an intern, but I was ready for that and I can manage.

But at the end of each week (I've been here for a month) my manager makes a debrief of the week with me. Most of the time it's positive and my performances keep getting better, but I get reminded each week : ""if you don't grow faster, we will have to talk about ending your internship next week"".

The first time I thought it was pressure, the second time I started believing I was doing badly. Now I'm just lost, this feels like useless stress to add up on an already taxing job.

I used to do a lot of sports, now I barely get 3 hours a week for triathlon training. I know it'll get better eventually, but I don't like the perspective of working my ass off for 0 satisfaction from my superiors.

I tried to talk about it with the other interns, they seem to dodge the subject a lot.

Do you guys have any opinion? Is it normal behaviour on interns or should I start worrying?

Edit : For full transparency, I went to se my boss and explained how I felt about the situation. As in all situations, there are to sides to a coin. It seems I have been underperforming in some aspects and that they tried to imply in some of our conversations that I wasn't doing it the right way. I didn't catch on it, so they started putting pressure on me to force me to understand. Even if I feel this wasn't the best method I can see where they were going...

Thanks for all the advice"

Just wanted to mention that in case that has any effect on any suggestions anyone recommends.

I really want to get an internship with a big n company. I know a lot of people say to start small and then shoot big but I see a lot of time that sophomores do land internships with these big companies and I want to be able to do the same. That being said, I was wondering what I should be working on this summer to increase my chances in doing so.

In case anyone was wondering, I want to be employed as a software engineer.

Here's my resume and GitHub profile if necessary:

* [Github](https://github.com/khalilhijazi)

I just don't know what to do over the summer. Like I hear people say pick any side project and work on it but like that's not entirely true. I should at least do something that fits what I'm applying for. Idk I'm just lost. Any suggestions on what I should do to at least stand a shot at big n companies next summer would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
8rv7b3,7,2018-06-17,[Long]Burden of supporting parents?,kiwioush,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8rv7b3/longburden_of_supporting_parents/,"I'm starting to have to think about dealing with supporting my parents, and who better to ask than Asianparentstories. There are a few wrinkles in my story that I think are fairly unique and I wanted your opinion on it. Sorry this is long and rambly.

This revolves around my mom. My dad was never in the picture; he was a huge Chinese businessman who went to jail for fraud and cheated on my mom. 

My main issue here is that for 18 years, she was literally a terrible mother to me and my sister. She's the definition of a bad parent, as I'm sure you're all plenty aware, being on APS. Physical abuse, mental abuse, constant nagging, disapproval, LITERAL INABILITY to admit she was wrong, narcissist, inability to listen to children, actual anger management issues, lack of respect for us, told us on multiple occasions that we shouldn't have been born etc.

That's just the raising experience; she never cleaned, didn't hold a job for 18 years, was the worst cook, really did pretty much nothing except nag us, feed us shit food, and drive us to school and extracurriculars. She literally spent the rest of her time reading Chinese news or watching Chinese comedy shows 24/7. Everything was funded by my dad, who gave us a stipend of what I think was roughly $120,000 a year(sure doesn't feel like that in pricey SGV). 

I find it very hard to forgive her. She literally had nothing, almost nothing to do for 18 years, except be a good mother and raise us two, and she couldn't do that. I have severe anxiety, addictive personality, slight bipolar, and a massive host of other issues that are a large detriment to my life. My sister is similarly fucked up, and I'm trying to do what I can to combat that. I had undiagnosed ADHD in high school, and despite pleading with her to get it sorted, she never did, and I only got it diagnosed this year. I had a terrible GPA throughout high school and the first 3 semesters for college due to that, and I think I could have easily gotten into an Ivy-tier college instead of a good public, and had a good GPA now if she literally just did that. My life would be so much easier. I have an unbelieveable amount of complaints with her, as I'm sure everyone else does with their parents here. She has also not managed to change at all in the 20 years of her parenting. The only thing she does less of now is physical abuse, because A. I'm at uni, and B. because I can just physically overpower her. My sister is still subject to it because she still lives with her.

This brings me to my problem. She's 51. She has no hard skills. No friends. No job. No savings. My dad will likely not be supporting her within 3-5 years. She has literally nothing except me and my sister, and she's latched onto that. She literally tried to get me to sign a contract with her to pay her $1M to pay her back for raising her. I asked reddit and it's literally unenforceable, so that's fine (also $1M to do fucking what??? What did you do???). But the point is, she has nothing.

I'm now 20. I'm a rising junior, wanna go into finance, I think I have a decently good shot of landing a good banking or equity research gig, and I can feel the balance of power shifting. She's held on control and used her power over me by hanging the sword of ""I have money and you need to rely on me"" for so long. But I'm so close I can taste it. I have my first real paid internship, and if everything goes the way I hope it will for the next couple of months, I'll land an internship for the next summer, and I'll make 15-20 grand then easily. After that a full time job should hopefully pay 130k+.

Money won't be a massive issue, but I will have to pay more than 25&amp;#37; of my after tax income to support her. I find it galling that I have to literally give her anything when she literally subtracted value from my life by being there. My dad provided the money, not her. If after 14-15 or so I was given the money instead, I'm actually pretty sure I could have done a better job(it's hard to overstate how incompetent she is). Not to mention if she was actually a good person, and was a good parent. 

Yet again, she is my mom. 90&amp;#37; of me is just saying cut her off after my sister gets old enough to escape and leave her to her fate, but 10&amp;#37; pities her. She's come through for me on some occasions that I'm very grateful for, such as bailing me out after I lost a large sum of money, and finding me my first internship (it wasn't legit, but it was a great stepping stone and looks good on my resume). There are other instances that are not coming to mind right now as well. 

I've also not been the greatest son. Not the worst by a long shot, but not the best. 

She's had a rough life as well otherwise. She was adopted, and grew up fairly poor in China. She worked very hard to get into a good uni in China, and met my dad, who treated her poorly and cheated on her. She gets none of his money, even though they got together before he made it big(a lot of this was due to poor decision making on her part though). 

But yet again, just because she had unfortunate circumstances does not give her an excuse to pass her problems onto me and my sister. Even though I had my parents, you bet your ass I am going to give my kids the most loving and supportive environment I can. 

So there's my story, and my thoughts on the issue. Any help or feedback or advice, or really anything would be greatly appreciated. What do I do? What approach should I take? Thanks a lot in advance for reading. "

I want to upgrade my laptop and begin using it at my current internship this summer so I'm familiar with it come fall semester. 

I know I could probably get by with a so-so machine around $500 and be fine, but I'd like to have a nice looking, great performing laptop I enjoy using every day. So I made my budget around $1,500 (excited about getting into McCombs, lemme splurge for once haha). 

Couple of requirements I'd like:
-PC
-Keyboard works well for excel
-Not bulky/heavy

The hp spectre x360 15'' has my eye right now, but is the fold flat touchscreen feature gimmicky? Or has anyone enjoyed using a feature like that for note taking / in-class use? I'm also pretty savvy with excel and like to use keyboard only shortcuts, so the fact that the 15'' includes a number pad is enticing over the 13''

-Also, is there a good spot I should go to buy a laptop to take advantage of any UT student discounts?

8rvg7q,4,2018-06-17,Looking for perspective on if a PhD is for me,asking_for__a_friend,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8rvg7q/looking_for_perspective_on_if_a_phd_is_for_me/,"Hey,

I'm currently in the summer going into my senior year and I've got a big question in front of me that I've wanted some outside perspective on- whether or not getting a PhD is right for me. Without saying too much about my summer work I work at one of {Facebook, Google} as a Software Engineering Intern in the Bay Area. After seeing the work the PhDs (AI/ML) do at my company and on my team- I think it would be really cool to do the type of work that they do (model building and complex analytical problems as opposed to the standard software development tasks). When it comes to my work, I care mostly about getting to work on challenging and complex problems, as well as making a living that will allow for me to one day provide for my family- have a nice house with kids and yearly vacations, etc. Furthermore, I'm actually a fan of school and I love learning technical things especially pertaining to data science and deep learning so I feel like I'm not in a rush to leave school given how much there is there to learn and I enjoy it. In terms of my intellectual fit for a PhD- I would love to do it and can definitely see myself doing it on an interest level.

The other thing is that I'm not too big a fan of the Bay Area and would prefer to live in Chicago/NYC- where I feel the career opportunities aren't the same as in tech and would probably require a move into Finance/Trading to make comparable compensation. I think I'd be happier doing data science work and think that the PhD is route to go there as it opens up doors to work in either a lab in industry or as a quant at a trading firm. I feel like if I went the PhD route I'd want to be able to get into quant finance (which would allow me to work in Chicago/NYC while making good money and while working on ML/data science problems) or at an AI lab in industry (possibly in NYC where I could make good money at one of the big tech company labs there). 

My concern with attempting to get a PhD is not knowing whether I could get into a ""top"" school that would open the doors that I'd want opened if I was doing a PhD (I've read online that especially finance companies weigh the prestige of your school heavily). I would want to be at one of {Stanford, MIT, Berkley, CMU} and maybe something in the next tier {Toronto, UIUC, Cornell, NYU} to study deep learning- which would be a very competitive thing and I'm not sure about the feasibility of getting in from undergrad like I would want to. But when it comes to the actual work, I think the work that PhDs do from what I've seen, developing amazing technologies like duplex, autonomous cars, algorithmic trading algorithms, etc, would make me much happier than the kind of work I'm doing now in my internship, which is worth a lot to me. If I knew I would get into a great school like those, I would no doubt want to go that route because even if the pay was the same- I'd just be so much more interested in the work. It's tough for me to pursue both because I'd have to accept a full time offer at the end of this summer/ early fall which is well before any admissions decisions from graduate schools and I don't want to be on the outside of everything looking in. I'm a strong student at a top 5ish/10 CS school but don't have much research experience (only 2 semesters worth of machine learning related research) which means I might have a shot at one of those programs but it would be very tough considering how competitive they are. So I'm really conflicted and I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: I would love to get a PhD but am not sure how to balance the need of chasing/accepting a full time offer (which I would need if I couldn't get into a PhD program and would be my 2nd choice) which I would need to decide on well before I know if I got into a PhD program."

Its actually the first time I have done so and am quickly learning alot.

The company is a large health insurance provider so I do think their name will look good but am more curious about the title and experience itself. Is writing queries considered a database developer or would it be something else?

So I was following the guidelines mentioned in [this](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-4-modern-face-recognition-with-deep-learning-c3cffc121d78) article. But instead of going through exactly with what he had said, I instead went to FDDB websited, browsed the [results](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/results.html) page and found that an algorithm called SFD performs the best possible. I went to GitHub and I found the [official source code](https://github.com/sfzhang15/SFD). So what he has done was build his own neural network which is a version of the very popular [VGG 16](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/) neural network. My plan was to use his model in my code ( I don't intend to plagiarize his code) and see if I can make the thing work. But what I am kind of confused about is whether this is legal or not and whether there might be any issues in doing such a thing."
8rx3y2,1,2018-06-18,Currently employed as a data scientist but am worried because my statistics skills are deteriorating. What should I be doing to find a new role? [x-post from /r/datascience],dsnextsteps,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8rx3y2/currently_employed_as_a_data_scientist_but_am/,"I've been employed for almost two and a half years.  Graduated undergrad in 2014 and finished a Master's in Statistics from a top West Coast university in 2016.  I was the person my peers would go to for help with statistics questions and sometimes still get hit up by old friends to help them out.  I didn't do a thesis for various university bureaucratic reasons I'd prefer not to get into, and an internship I did between years turned out to have no data analysis component at all.  My undergrad was similar.  I'd take an internship or a research position where I was told I'd be doing interesting data analysis work.  Then once I got there it would turn out that I'd have no mentorship or that actually I'd be doing some other task that requires coding but no zero statistics, but has some vague data-related component.  Because of this I have very good technical skills in SQL, Python, and R, but not much experience applying them to solve analysis or machine learning problems.

My dilemma is I've had two data scientist positions at medium-sized companies where I've done very little analysis.  The first one was sold to me as an analysis/engineer position, but I did one analysis in the full year and a month I was there and the rest was focused on data quality control.  I was laid off because they claimed to not have any data analysis work available for me.  My current position is awesome except for the actual work.  I've been there for 18 months and I've just done exploratory analysis and dashboarding, with zero statistics.  My current company has cool ML work, but a conversation with my boss indicated that he thinks it's a giant waste of time that doesn't help the business.  He won't let me take on ML work, even though it's one area where I have a ton of interest.

I'm at the end of my rope and want to do more meaty and quantitative work than what I'm currently doing, which to be blunt, bores the living shit out of me.  I'm a statistician by trade who has done no statistics in two and a half years years.  However job hunting has been quite difficult.  There don't seem to be many modeling focused positions even when I look for other job titles like ""Applied Scientist"".  I've been heavily targeting particular companies I want to work at and getting referrals, but have been rejected at the resume stage many for junior-level roles where I'd be doing modeling.  I've had my resume looked over by a bunch of people and none of them see anything wrong with it.  Because of my lack of professional statistics experience, my resume focuses on my ability to work with a diverse variety of professionals, gathering requirements, and presenting deliverables in a way that's useful for them.  Essentially all of the soft skills I'd expect to use in a more standard data scientist position.

Based on what I've indicated here, what kinds of positions should I be looking for?  Should I be targeting positions where I'm doing modeling and predictive analytics positions, or is my lack of experience in those areas going to fuck me over?  If I shouldn't be targeting those roles yet, what kind of roles should I be targeting to get there?  I'm currently targeting large companies because I feel like the bureaucracy will allow me to get experience precisely in what I get hired to do, rather than getting sidetracked with things like ""Oh I'm a senior person you do data please do this data task that has no analysis or statistical component.""

Additionally, how can I convince recruiters that I should be hired to do explanatory or predictive modeling work?  I'm in touch with a recruiter at a large tech company who tried to sell me a Data Scientist position that turned out would be all A/B testing and dashboarding, which would be my personal hell as a career.  When I asked him about potentially taking on a meatier role building models he said I should be looking at more basic positions that are similar to the A/B testing one.  I've had back-and-forths on LinkedIn with recruiters for some other positions that are advertised as Data Scientist positions, but when I ask how much of the role involves pipelining and wrangling for tasks other than doing data analysis, I almost always find out that they're doing a bait-and-switch and it's actually a 100&amp;#37; engineering role.

I'm quickly approaching the three year mark where junior careers usually end and feel completely stagnant and like I have nothing to show for it.  I have job security where I am now but if circumstances change, it's going to be far more difficult to continue on an upward career path than it is now.

If it helps I'm in the Greater Seattle Area.  There are some Meetups that look potentially nice but they're all sponsored by boot camps and the last time I went to a talk at one of them, it was basically a pitch for why you should give them money.  I have contacts at many large companies in the area, and those contacts can vouch for my enthusiasm and skill around statistics."

I have doing my classes, researching IT ABC's, and been doing tons of research. Currently a IS major at University of

Colorado: Colorado Springs. This post is long and has many questions because I have a shotgun blast of questions/concerns.

I am currently taking a summer Java class and will be trying to do my own independent coding (python). However, if I like programming and am good at it I will transfer to a full CS degree.

Though math and science are not my strengths (which will probably destroy my GPA), but that’s why I do not want to do a CS degree. It primarily the programming, the higher end programming in Junior and Senior years.

I do not want to get to my Junior year just so I drop out and do something else (Plus I do not really want to be a full time developer/coder).

I went with IS because what attracts me more is the IT field such as Sysadmin, but primarily the Network admin/engineer fields.

However, it has been somewhat discouraging because I want to do the best for me in my career choice. I have been hearing heavy mix opinions about the MIS, IS, and CIS programs in general.

Some people say it’s a great degree to go into, however other people just call it a trash/useless degree. I have read some Network Engineer/ IT shops do not ever consider IS as a ""IT"" degree.

This is concerning to me, because I do not want to handicap myself when in the job field. I have also heard that Universities have start getting rid of these programs due to poor placements. My college has some internships for IS, mainly IT management and some IT security, though it is a lot more focused on CS internships (could just be the Colorado Springs area though, though tbh it does seem like a small IS dept.).

Also, with more software-oriented IT is becoming, will it be worth it to still do an IS degree in a ever increasing CS world?

https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/business-major/1392104-is-computer-information-systems-good.html 

(check out this goal orientedgoals guy, he has some strong opinions. It a little older, but this is just one of the many I have read on many different forums. Many people in other reddits such as r/sysadmin had a lot of people saying they regret doing a IS degree.)

Just from what I have been reading it is somewhat discouraging, sigh it seems like an IT degree would have been nice but there are no schools nearby that offer it (except for CTU).

IS seems to business to my liking too, I would prefer more technical classes.

with this type of degree being so mixed and polarized from everyone is just seems like it better to get a liberal arts degree or no degree than an IS degree XD.

However I will preserve depending on what happens in this summer, either I will do a IS/CS minor or a CS degree (prob a 10&amp;#37; chance but we will see). 

Thank you for taking your time and reviewing my post. I may be over analyzing things, but its my future so I want the best for me.

Here some additional unrelated questions (I have so many).

1. I know Network Engineering will not be dying in the future, but I always see stories/articles that say ""Networking is dying because of SDN/Automation."" However, I think the more appropriate question is will Network Engineering be ""declining"" slowly in the future? The admin I work with says it won’t be if you adapt, but will networking jobs be declining within the decades?

2. I have been exploring all my options, one is a ""Computer Security"" degree. I won’t major in this because I think it’s too new, and some new program that U of Colorado is doing. This one is just my curiosity http://innovation.uccs.edu/b-i-csecurity-program-sample/ it’s just seems like a mash of business + programming classes. Though what do you guys think, I know one of my CS friends was interested in this, and I heard people getting placed into internship with this degree. "

I can't live my life, forced to do daily hours of prayers at the mosque, forced to memorize the quran, forced to read  islamic books (not the happy moderate ones), etc.

I study engineering, but I want to escape and continue my studies abroad. During Highschool I was a complete idiot and blindly followed whatever my parents said, so I sat for only one A level exam (there is an international version of it that you can take in the middle east), because these were the requirements for universities in my country.

Unfortunately, one A level pretty much doesn't qualify me to study any where else, as virtually all countries in Europe and US demand at least 3 A levels. I tried to apply to study in Germany because it's free to study in public universities, but I today I got a mail that I was rejected for that very reason, even though my grades were very high. I'm not even allowed to study for an extra foundation year, they simply told me to finish my Bachelor and apply for masters.

There are private universities in Germany that would accept me, but they cost a lot of money (even as little as 3000 euros per year, is too much for me). I don't have any money and my parents don't have much savings, besides they won't help anyway.

Now I'm devastated because the hope of studying in Germany was the only thing keeping me going

It's summer time and now my parents see that I have some free time, they will choke me with religion even more. I applied for internships and summer jobs, in an attempt to at least be away from the house as much as I can, but it's been 2 weeks and I still haven't gotten any replies.

Please! Please somebody tell me what to do! I'm very hard working and would do anything to get out. I can't stay here for any longer. My parents are very suspicious of me now, and I don't think I have much time before some evidence against me comes up and they know that I left Islam.

I have diddly squat this summer in terms of actual internships. Would taking an internship with a local company where the language involved is SQL be helpful? I am not that interested in doing data analytics and it seems like I will be some dumb code monkey. I guess it is better than nothing, but there are other things I could be doing that aren't resume worthy but seem better to me. What are your opinions?

I’m about to start my 4th year as a CS major at Georgia Tech, and right now I am lucky enough to have promised referrals to Facebook, Amazon, Snapchat, and LinkedIn. 

My background is mostly in mobile dev (Swift, Obj C), and I’m skilled with Java and Python, decent with C, and mediocre in all things webdev. 

Anyway, when I’m going around looking at job descriptions for all these software engineer internships, I always notice they usually list some skills I don’t have. I.e JavaScript, SQL, PHP, C++, Perl, etc. 

I consider myself to be a good programmer and I am very good at problem solving. If anything I have strong resilience and persistence when working on class projects. But I feel like I have no chance at these companies if I don’t have these skills. 

This brings me to a predicament when trying to prepare for potential future interviews. Do I spend my time learning all these skills? How do I choose which ones to focus on? Should I instead just focus on CTCI/LeetCode/HackerRank problems to prepare?

I haven’t worked on any personal projects in a long time. I’ve been more focused on learning (school) than making projects. All in all, I need some direction how I should spend my time. Does anyone have any advice for me so that I can land some of these jobs?"

8s2lyl,0,2018-06-18,Grad student of '07 seeking advice following a career that's gone off the rails,throwies11,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/8s2lyl/grad_student_of_07_seeking_advice_following_a/,"I have years of experience as a software developer, mostly self-taught. But I feel ""trapped"" in a cycle of bad jobs/experience/skills. Worse, I have been under-employed for three years and living in poverty (I moved in with my mom years ago so I don't have to worry about rent). Returning to college for a proper CS education has become one of my desired solutions and OMSCS seems to have good cost-benefit tradeoffs. 

First, some basic info about me.

* UIC graduate, class of '07
* graduated in Art in a New Media concentration
* 36, male, single
* underemployed for three years
* started work as software (web) engineer senior year
* experienced with a variety of programming (web, graphics, gaming)

When I was in college I transferred from Architecture to Art sophomore year. I still didn't know what I wanted to do creative-wise, but then I got the itch to program after a intro to web development class. 

I then got approval from the CS dept. to take some 200 level CS courses, and web development is what I got into as a career. Relevant classes include: Smart Art (basically art with microcontrollers), Intro to Computer Graphics, Discrete Math with Data Structures, two Object-Oriented Programming classes.

To explain why I didn't minor or double major with CS, by the time I started getting into those classes, I was approaching 150 credit hours, and I wouldn't be able to take Pell grants after that. Since 90% of my tuition is paid by Pell grants and didn't want to take on huge loans, I decided to cut my losses and just get the Art degree.

Well, it seems like my bad decision making and limited job searching methods did a number on my career. 

I assumed that the big reputable software companies would never hire someone with an art degree so I started out by applying to small businesses and startups. After getting burned out by companies that are often very small, disorganized and offer little in terms of career growth, I felt trapped in this cycle. Although I sometimes get interviews for bigger companies now, I don't cut the mustard. I think it's more likely because they are much harsher on experienced programmers than they are to interns and entry-level people.

Several people have described me as someone who is repeating their first years of experience over and over again. I am stuck in a remedial cycle and want to fix that. Web agency work is rife- it's fine for junior work but tech skills won't transfer well to top companies. 

I've also noticed a trend- the only companies willing to hire me are low-paying companies that are desperate to hire anyone. Not even AVERAGE companies want to give me offers.

So I want to round out my skill set with a legitimate CS education. Stories about students interning and co-op working in firms like Intel and JPL inspire me. I want to contribute to the space industry in particular, working on software or firmware for them.

**The summary: I am self-taught, have ten years of software experience but having difficulty convincing good companies to hire me. I want to go back to school to get credentials to find intern / entry level work at good tech firms. Basically I want to redeem myself and be more of a clean slate.** 

For me OMSCS looks like a great investment in terms of cost-benefit as well as time because I am really broke and need a place to work and live in. To complicate matters, I need a place to stay since my mom's planning to move back to her home country later this year. I can't live with her indefinitely

Now for my questions:

Given my background, how should I prepare to be accepted at OMSCS? Is OMSCS even a great option for my situation?

Since OMSCS is online, how do I take advantage of networking opportunities to find good jobs as I am finishing my course?

It's too late to get into fall 2018 admission but what criteria would I be judged on when the window opens for the next semester?

What kinds of companies can I expect to get hired if I apply myself well? Is working in large aerospace or hardware firms plausible with this education?"

I don't know how I got myself into this. It was for a hookah lounge. I had the ""interview"" and at the end he said you did see the post saying it's a 2 week intern period? I said okay thats fine, (I didn't see it it was in a hidden spot). He said it was 2 weeks no pay and so I became iffy, but he said I would keep tips. So I didn't want to work, but he ended up making it sound good and texted me and I said to myself I would try it. I was barely getting tips but I was working. I found out he was an alcoholic and has episodes where he's drunk for at-least 3-4 days out of the week. He told me to take shots with him one day when the lounge was slow and so I did, he sent me off to the back room to the bed once I got too intoxicated and I fell asleep. He kept asking me questions about my sexual experiences and with women. I told him when I met him I was in a 3 year relationship. When the lounge closed he came to the back room and told me to scoot over on the bed, So I did thinking he just wanted to lay down? He told me to turn his way and he started kissing me, I think I was confused and somewhat scared, so i started to go along with it and then i jumped up and was trying to leave, and he kept pulling me (like very hard) to get closer and putting my hands in areas I didn't want them to be. I kept trying to leave and he kept pulling me, I was feeling so bad that I just did that and cheated on my boyfriend like that, but I just wanted it to be a new day and keep it moving and try to make money. He was telling me if you feel any guilt then don't come back and work here, it's going to be nights where we get drunk like this you need to be able to handle this.. were going to make alot of money, I want you to come to my condo in Miami and have threesomes etc, telling me he has info on my boyfriend that he's not faithful (he doesn't know anything about him)

I wasn't planning on coming back the next day ( or I wasn't sure, i had mixed feelings like maybe I can go back and just work and make money) but he called me and he explained he was drunk and sorry and we are going to put it behind us. The next week he gets drunk again and we aren't alone and he keeps feeling on me and trying to take my dress down. He also sat me on his lap and would NOT let go of me. I had to call my only coworker to tell her to come because he wouldn't let me go and he eventually did. I was somewhat laughing, and pushing him off at me (because I felt uncomfortable and wanted to diffuse the situation.) He was also trying to fight guys. When he sobered up the guys were telling him they didn't owe them an apology they he owed me an apology.

So fast forward to the past 2 weeks. It's been about a month now, and he didnt pay me anything but $30. I kind of was just working and thinking I was going to see a check soon. Today was the day we were supposed to go over the numbers and card tips and get my money, (and i was going to quit working there because I cant deal with an aggressive, alcoholic boss) but this is the start of his alcohol binge and he started telling me how I'm fake, I let other people warp me (because they told me to make sure im not working for free) and how I can leave, I kept asking him numerous times to pay me and he would not and he would send it on cashapp before midnight (That was when my bill was due), and to get out. He was downing a bottle of wine and eventually I realized it's my time to get out before he starts trying to get aggressive with me, and also realized he probably just wanted to use this as an excuse to not pay me.

As it became around 11:30 I was blowing his phone up for my money, and he told me come to the lounge he will give me $200 (Im owed way more.), then he switched it to he'll cashapp me. I waited 5 minutes and told him I can come up there with my brother because I don't feel comfortable going alone he's drunk, and he sent me a picture of him firing a gun. This is the last straw for me and he can keep the money. But I don't want him to be able to treat people like this. I was the ""naive 20 year old"" (his words) but I wouldn't want someone to go through this. Do you guys think he would be charged with anything If I go to the place? He's doesn't record cash transactions because hes trying to avoid taxes, and I didn't have any papers coming into the job, so I think this whole business is under the table.

I just don't want him to be able to treat anothergirl like this, because I realize I can easily be replaced by someone else and they will be done the same way.

I posted this on r/chanceme, but that sub doesn't see a lot of action so I figured I'd post it here as well. Hope that's okay!

I'm a rising senior (girl, white). My high school is public but extremely competitive to get into, and is considered one of the top schools in my state. Middle income.

Major: CS, political science

SAT: 1520

Essays: I'm a pretty strong writer, so I think they'll be pretty good.

Recs: Quite strong. I am a good student, and the teachers who I have asked know me very well.

GPA: My school doesn't calculate my GPA, but I calculated it to be 3.9 (not sure if I did it right). I've gotten straight A's, with the exception of a B in physics this year. My school also doesn't do APs. Our top level is ""advanced,"" and I've always taken advanced classes.

EC's: Class president

Captain of FRC robotics team (we've been to worlds every year I've been on the team)

NHS and highest honors designation at my school

Competitive fencer and youth coach at my fencing club (some of the coaching is volunteer and some is paid. I also help out my coach with paperwork, cleaning the gym, etc.)

Docent at a local history museum (internship)

Counselor at a summer camp for inner-city kids (volunteer position)

Legislative intern for a state senator (doing some really cool stuff in this role, it's most likely going to be what I write about for my essays)

Varsity math team

HiMCM and M3C competitions (made it to the final round of HiMCM, past the second triage round of M3C)

Grade, school, regional, and state representative on student advisory council

Part-time job for a local clothing start-up (paid position)

First place at school, regional, and state science fairs, fourth place at Intel ISEF 2018. (My research was in an intersection of both polisci and cs, the avenues I want to study in college.)

Apps for good

I want to study both computer science, ideally with a focus on cybersecurity, and political science; I think the biggest weakness of my application is the ""B"" in junior year (I know colleges don't like to see downward trends.) My list so far:

Safety: WPI, UMass Lowell

Match: GW, Stevens, Northeastern

Reach: Harvard, Brown, Tufts

Is this reasonable? How strong do you think my chances are for these schools, and is there anything I should be doing senior year to improve my chances or compensate for the physics grade?

Thank you so much for your help!"

This is kind of a hail mary, as I've never been to this board before and I'm not even sure I can explain what I'm asking well, but here goes.

So basically, I'm an EE intern working at a company that builds CNC machines. The project I'm on, there are two physical emergency stops already wired and working. If it helps, they're wired in series from a 24V power supply to the first switch, to the second switch, to the contactor (relay), back to the power supply. 

There are also two software switches: one built into the program gui, and one on a pendant that also controls the machine. It's a physical button on the pendant, but basically, when pressed, the internal circuit is broken and the program recognizes the loss of voltage and soft stops everything. The pendant has a separate 5V power supply for I guess general power, and a 12V power supply wired to the two wires for the pendant Estop (blueblack/orangeblack). 

Here's the [pendant manual](https://picclick.com/HEDSS-6-AXIS-CNC-Pendant-100-MPG-JOG-261853344399.html#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=5) if it helps. 

What I've been told to do (try) is to make the software switches break the same circuit that the physical ones do: to trip the contactor so everything is physically powered down (except the PC), instead of just stopping everything via the program.

I've been trying to think my way through this, but I can't seem to come up with a solution that would basically allow me to add the software switches in series to the same circuit as the physical Estops. I've taken all of my gen eds, but none of my major courses yet (like circuits or control systems), so I'm hoping there's some easy solution that I'm just not aware of. That said, the previous EE graduate couldn't figure it out either, so I dunno.

Regardless, thanks in advance if anyone has any suggestions. "
8s3sru,1,2018-06-18,Two Paths to Take: Nursing or Programming,RiceSpecial,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8s3sru/two_paths_to_take_nursing_or_programming/,"Hello reddit. I am in need of some advice. I've recently been accepted into a 2 year nursing program at a nearby community college. I spent about 1 and a half years taking prerequisites for both the 2 year and the 4 year nursing programs so that by the time I finish the 2 year program, I can jump straight into the Bachelors of Science in Nursing program right away. I did this because I wanted to get a job sooner and work while I'm getting my BSN. I chose nursing mainly because of its job security. I used to work as a medical assistant for a year and learned a lot about the field during that time. When I first started, I went out of my way for each and every patient and loved to see their happiness and satisfaction. As time passed, my enthusiasm began to fade and the excitement I used to have disappeared. I still took care of the patients as best as I could and I never neglected my responsibilities. However, the amount of paperwork, workplace drama, and everyday problems with difficult patients began to drive me away from the field. I could feel myself growing colder and apathetic. It scared me and I was afraid of  who I might become if I continued on in this field. I didn't want to admit it then but this is the truth. I don't want to be a ""bad"" nurse.

My back up plan is Computer Science. Earlier this year, I transferred over to a local University and declared my major. I did not enroll in classes yet. I wanted something to fall back on if I got rejected from the nursing schools I applied to. I did not choose Computer Science because of the money (nursing is probably better in terms of money due to its job stability) or any other similar reasons and I'm fully well-aware of the difficulty of getting programming internships and jobs. I chose it because I like coding. I find it relaxing and fun. There's something really cool about putting a bunch of letters, numbers, and symbols together to make a working program. I love to create my own solutions to problems and I try to never looks at other peoples' code when I'm lost. I'm mostly self-taught using online courses or any books I can find. I currently have a solid understanding of Python and Java (I can probably pick up C# easily too). 

A few days ago, I was at the new student nursing orientation where they explained about classes, clinicals, and just overall everything nursing school related. While I was there, I had a very odd feeling in my stomach. It was like I got lost while driving to a destination but I'm not exactly sure if I'm lost so I just keep pressing on. It didn't feel.... right. I was overjoyed when I received my acceptance letter but the feeling quickly died off as doubt began to fill my mind. I hate myself for thinking this way because I've spent the past two years trying to achieve this goal. My friends and family are very proud of me because I will soon have a solid career in a rather difficult but rewarding field. I'm also slightly afraid of pursing Computer Science as I'm not exactly confident that I'll be able to secure a position after college. I'm turning 23 later this year and most of my friends already graduated or are graduating soon. I know I'm not supposed to compare myself to others but I Just can't stand the feeling of being behind. I want to make something out of myself. I want to make my parents proud and myself happy. I don't know why it's so hard for me to choose. I love helping others but I don't know if I could pursue it as a long-term career. I love to code but I am unsure about it's job security.

Thank you in advance for all your advice."

I know a fair bit about Android programming. I've also done web programming. 5 years ago I programmed a website that price matched against Wal-Mart. The website isn't up anymore, but here is a video of what it was: ""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4XXW4c6j-g"". I've taken a whole year of CS classes at BYU, I'm familiar with Data Structures and that kind of thing. 
So, I just wanted to ask the community what they thought. Do you think I have enough experience to make some money this summer? What are some opportunities I should be looking out for? I appreciate any advice :)

Thanks!"

I'm a computer science premajor at my university, I need two more classes before I can apply to get into the major and I expect to graduate in Spring 2020. I already have a general associates degree (but I've realized its worth nothing). I tried securing an internship/job for this summer but things kept falling short. It's pretty discouraging. I've applied to a lot of places but only ever heard back from about 4 or 5 people. Only one of which I was able to make it to the interview process. 

Right now my biggest project is this [website](https://brystephor.github.io/Crypto/blogs) and I need to update my online portfolio (current one is outdated and garbage looking). I'm constantly tweaking my resume and always trying to make it look nice with a clean UX/UI feel that isn't just times new roman, black and white/boring to look at. What should I be doing over the summer so I can have a strong application when internships open up again in Fall? What is it that recruiters and HR looks for when judging a comp sci student for an internship?

Thanks in advance."

2013: Graduated highschool in May 2013 and went to a Uni in California for a BFA in Digital Arts in September 2013.

Year (1) 2013 - 2014: Stayed at said Uni

Year (2) 2014: Stayed at said Uni

Year (3) 2015: Stayed at said Uni

Year (4) 2016 : Dropped out in January 2016 due to mental health reason. Stayed at home doing odd jobs here and there but basically doing nothing.

Year (5): 2017: More of the same but then went to London in August 2018 for a 6 months diploma program to get certified in my field. Finished in end of December 2018.

2018: Came back home to India mid February 2019. Worked on my skills further to improve my portfolio for 3 months. Now applying to colleges in Canada as a citizen of India.

I was going through a rough time during Uni in California after my freshmen year emotionally and mentally and my grades and performance dropped significantly in the 3 semesters I was there after that with 11 F of FW out of 16 courses in my last 3 semesters. The time I stayed at home after dropping out I did some freelancing work. I have a few letters of recommendations from students who's films I worked on online and a paid job I took after those. 

I am applying for a computer science diploma program in Canadian colleges and would rather not show my California Uni transcripts to them but there isn't really an essay section or any other area where I can explain my 5 year gap. Just section where I can upload transcripts and other stuff. Right now they'll just see my high school transcript, my certification diploma, and my TOEFL Scores. They'll see the gap in dates and god knows they'll think.

Like I mention above I wasn't in very good mental health and regrettably did do some damage to my life and future but am so much better now and trying to make something of myself. Computer science is a field that highly compliments my current set of skills (Visual Effects) and I really want to learn it in Vancouver surrounded by major Visual Effects studios where I can intern in while studying.

My worry: 

Will the colleges see that 5 year gap and the only qualification being high school graduation with a 6 months course diploma and think that I am not a serious/reliable student or whatever and reject my application? Will I face troubles getting a student visa even if I do get accepted?

Thank you so much for reading through this! I'd really appreciate any any advice or help with this!"

Idk what I did so wrong, I mean I was lacking some direction and I guess wasn't that motivated to network and kill it (although I did try hard) and so I have a very mediocre internship. I had a 3.9 GPA, solid ECs, so this just sucks. I'm so embarassed, not even gonna put it on my linkedin until I have to. I was so so so close to getting another pretty good internship, like made it to the final round, was constantly told by the recruiter that I'm getting very positive feedback after each interview, was asked my thoughts about the internship after being interviewed by everyone, and even asked a start date. Then in like May they said that they're going with someone else. I was so crushed, and I can't still can't stop feeling so sad about it. It's not just the internship, it's also that the city it was based in is my favorite in the world and I have so much cousins and family there so I would have a home to go to instead of coming back to a lonely dark studio with no AC. I miss them so much. I even have so many friends there and I don't know anyone in this city that I'm in. It's far from my home. There's only one other female in my office. Also my internship is not good for my skill set, I feel like I was deceived. It's soooo damn technical and I just don't know how to do this shit, so I'm just confused af all day. I can't keep bothering my manager but I'm just so lost. This was work is mind numbingly boring and confusing and just makes me question everything. Then finally when works ends I come home to my studio. All the other interns are local so they get to go back home to their houses. There is just no joy in my day. So I have a horrible routine and on top of that can't get over that rejection, and feel sad about no prestigious. I don't know how I'm going to get through this.....The heat in my apt is so bad that I feel so fatigued and have barely been eating. I mean one thing is that I had a goal to improve basketball so maybe I can work on that, and also try to put myself in a better position for full time recruiting. I just don't know, this past weekend, I didn't leave my apartment once. I'm just really going through it, should I see someone?  I'm in Chicago btw"

My twenties are over, I don't want sugar coated ""follow your heart, it will all work out"" suggestions anymore.

**Here's the job history - not including college and before since I don't include that on my resume:**

--Job 1: Right out of college, I worked in the restaurant industry in a new city for two years while also doing internships, retail jobs and unpaid assistant work to try my hand at a creative field. Due to funds and two-years of being around thousands of other people just like me who were decades older and no farther in their 'dream', I decided to go back to my college town after a brief three-month stint of unemployment while in my hometown due to family matters.  

--Job 2: (Client Services &amp; Admin) I got my first salaried job after about a month of looking and accepted after interviewing twice with three different departments of a large corporate company. I was offered all three positions but chose the one with a team I really respected and felt I connected with on a personal level and because the role was more client-focused instead of sales-focused. The company was great - it had continuing ed resources, motivated &amp; intelligent staff, a large outfitted office, and a variety of departments that offered a lot of career potential. I made great connections. I used my free time, manager approved, to interview people from other departments so I could make connections and I worked with their community service department on top of that. I had great reviews and studied informally with their head ops manager with higher level employees so I could learn more advanced tools. At three months, I was given the opp to interview for a specialized position with one of their CMS tools - providing support for internal staff - but was advised not to apply by my team's VP and my other mentors since I was still so new and hadn't proven myself. Shortly after, our department restructured and then restructured again almost immediately after. Our teams were juggled, jobs were changed, and I was suddenly in a lessened role with a group of strangers (VP to associate level) who were all suddenly doing more work of a lesser level than they were used to. Needless to say, my entire team quit within six months because most internal roles were suddenly frozen and we were expected to see the restructure through with no increase in pay but a tremendous increase in hours. It got pretty ugly and chaotic, but I left on good terms with a seemingly great group of references and mentors. 

--Job 3: (Business Dev &amp; Admin) I got a business dev job within a week via a reputable recruiter a colleague had suggested. I interviewed three times - once with the recruiter and twice with the company. It felt polished and thoughtful, my future boss was charismatic and the job seemed more focused on social good than my previous job. On top of that, despite having a piss poor website, the company was in a great building and was the pet project of a well-established company run by a motivated and effervescent CEO. I'd be using what I'd learned in my previous job to help shape their organization and provide more thoughtful client support as well as doing some sales - but I felt that the product which made sense in my interviews was worth the sale. Needless, it wasn't and I was a fool for being tricked. My boss was fired within three weeks of me starting though she was paid in some bizarre way as a consultant because the CEO felt bad and I was left with no department but myself and drawers full of exercise equipment and no client or sales history and a product that was great in a pitch but had no practical application. The stress of that job ended up with me in the hospital which was cool after one too many late nights and Saturdays in the office (thought things like that were jokes, but they're not). I left after three months, staying on only to complete a fundraiser with a third party company that I enjoyed working with. I cited health problems as my reason because I didn't want to screw over the company because I do think they meant well, they just were a hateful bunch who got paid well to sell nothing and sabotaged each other's products - it was a confusing place. During this time, I applied for a handful of open positions back at job #2 but nothing got past a second interview. 

--Job 4 (Operations &amp; Admin): My latest job - I thought this was my holy grail. I was connected with the CEO via a mentor from job #2. It was a new company with a lot of potential and tied into everything I'd been doing at all my other jobs. It seemed like a great fit on paper, and I'd be employee number one - learning how a company gets built from the ground up and hopefully making a positive impact on that growth. I didn't jump right away. I interviewed with the CEO across the span of a few weeks - meeting people we'd be contracting, learning various plans for the company, going over whether or not we could work well together. I did all of this while still at #3, on weekends and evenings when I wasn't fixing some mistake at the old job. Point is, I tried to make sure I was making a good decision and I figured if I was ever going to try something like this, it would be in my twenties when I still had the energy and few responsibilities. I started a day after leaving #3 which was fine because it was exciting. It was rough in reality, which I expected. I wore a lot of hats, took on a lot of stress, and at my three-month review was told I had no ego and was a yes-man because my boss liked arguing more than deliberating and I'm the exact opposite. We had a lot of crossed wires, a lot of emotion, but the company had business and I had a paycheck and it was a unique way to live for almost two years. I have a lot of feelings about that boss, but I don't know how many of them are actually helpful. Essentially, a few months shy of my two year anniversary with no benefits and no pay increase, I was called in for a meeting. My boss seemed happy which was not normal and had only ever coincided with cool updates on the business, so I was excited. We had new employees and had just moved two 'exec's to unpaid contract work, so I was thinking this was a promotion - increased responsibility, increased pay. But it wasn't - my boss wanted me to stay but I'd have to be a truck driver for an unknown amount of time until they could get more funding figured out. The new employees, they weren't staying. So, I asked for three days and quit the following morning. All of the employees were fired or quit over the next six months. While my boss wrote letters for me saying I was laid off, I wasn't paid a severance like the others because I screwed myself by technically quitting. I moved back to my hometown because I had nowhere else to go. In the past year, my previous role has been brought back and filled.


**My Red Flags:**

--I've lived in three different cities in ten years and the longest job I've had has been for just shy of two years. I moved to my current area for job prospects. It is incredibly far from my hometown (hours by plane) - the question of why I moved so far from family has come up which is why I bring it up. I was an English major. 

--While I come off as poised and dependable (from peer/manager reviews), I have also been told I'm ""quiet and meek"". 

--I'm a pushover. I hate to admit this, but I think it's become obvious. If someone says that I'll be valuable and help them, I try to make it work until it can't anymore and I'm left with no other options and the other person has gotten their low-level support. 

--I don't upsell myself. I'm terrible at it. I'm good at interviewing and conversation, but not lying. I feel uncomfortable with my job history and it shows. 

--I have good references but I haven't spoken to them in a year because I'm embarrassed. I know I need to get over this, but they all are related to job #4's boss and I feel ashamed at not finding something new after being consistently employed for so long. 

**Where I don't know how to proceed:**

--Obviously, I am doing something wrong. Am I not asking the right questions in interviews? Am I not sticking through the bumps long enough? Am I not leaving soon enough? Am I picking mentors terribly? Now, that I'm in a new city, I want to make sure I'm building a foundation that won't implode. My college's career counseling services left a lot to be desired, so I'm hoping you all can help!

She told him that he could come crash at her place.  While there, he began hitting on her and it became clear that that was really why he came over (he drove over and obviously had the keys to his car) and that he was drunk and still drinking what he brought. She rejected his advances a couple of times and he eventually dropped it. When she left for work he was asleep in his car in her driveway. 

She said she was never scared of him, that she has dealt with drunk people before.  She said that she doesn't want him to get in trouble. She doesn't want me to do anything because he asked her to not tell people that he came over drunk.  She also said that she thinks he has texted on of my interns late at night before too.

I feel like he truly has a problem. What are my options for firing with cause since it is an out of work issue?  What are my responsibilities to him since he obviously has a problem?

 I am a 22 year old male college student who is set to graduate in May of 2019.

I have had a tumultuous college experience to say the least. I entered four years ago as an Engineering major, and after several major changes, found myself at my college’s Nursing School. I believed that I wanted to work in healthcare, saw that Nursing was in-demand and have relatively high job security, and went with it.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I was forced to leave the Nursing school after one year, only being 8 months away from graduation. I won’t be able to be readmitted into the Nursing school I attended.

Now, I am in a position where I still must graduate from my University, (I have already paid for four years of education and can graduate in less than a year) however, my degree will be a basic Health degree with virtually nothing special about it. My new degree does require an internship at the end of it, but I’m unsure as of yet how to best make use of that.

My question for you, r/jobs, is this: How can I get my foot in the door for a healthcare-related job? I have searched local job listings in my area for several weeks now and I see that almost everything requires a certification or clinical experience (I do have 6 months of clinical experience from my Nursing degree, but I didn’t complete it, so I don’t know if employers will respect that).

I have seen many opportunities to further my education and get a better job, such as in Healthcare Administration, HIM, Various med techs (Rad Tech, Ultrasound Tech, Sonography, etc.), but I can’t make up my mind as to what path is worth it and what I could be competitive with while only have a very basic Health degree.

Should I go a different route? My main concern is getting a stable job. If I cannot get one in the healthcare field, I am open to going somewhere else to get a different education. I just want to be able to work and not be stuck unqualified and unable to find work in a year’s time.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

TL;DR: I want to get my foot in the door with a healthcare-related job. What are some of my options, and are they feasible even if all I have is a simple BS in Health?"

I am an engineering intern working at a small electronics manufacturing company. I am tasked with finding a way to customize a configuration of Windows that is preloaded with our necessary software / drivers and can be quickly and conveniently installed on our machines. We have approximately 20 Windows 7 Professional based POS computers that are of interest right now. A future solution for other computers with different hardware / software may also be needed later.

From what I have learned up to this point, I have determined that making an AutoUnattend.xml file and using Windows 7 AIK to rapidly deploy fresh installations of windows is the ideal solution, versus simply cloning the harddrive of one of the computers. 
I am currently testing my “autounattend.xml” using the latest VirtualBox 

Since I am studying EE and not IT, I had to google for information.

I followed this tutorial:
[Windows 7 64-bit Unattended Install with WAIK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYg9yHXD0WM&amp;t=135s)

**Primary Problem:**

8s9lkj,17,2018-06-19,How do you guys manage getting manager approval to give someone a license or change someone's permissions?,mixolydiA97,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8s9lkj/how_do_you_guys_manage_getting_manager_approval/,"I just want to see if other people have a similar situation and have any advice. I'm doing an IT internship and they told me to look for things to improve. I'd like to improve the way we deal with approvals.

Whenever a user wants a license for software or wants to be added to an AD group, their manager has to be cc'd and asked for approval. This is a bit tedious because sometimes people won't cc their managers when they make the ticket so someone from IT has to cc them. Then, we also have to wait for the manager. I usually get impatient and message them on Slack. Then if they respond there, I have to screenshot their message and add it to the ticket. 

We use Google for email stuff so I was looking into actions or a form where managers could review the license being asked for or the new permissions a user will have. Then they could press yes or no, which would reply with a generic confirmation/denial of approval to our ticketing system. Another option is doing it through Slack since people seem to respond better to those notifications.

Does something like this exist? What setups do you guys have? Thank you."

Which we did. 

I got a call back from them 2 weeks ago and was scheduled for an interview, the position was almost like a continuation for my senior design project, same software, same requirements and on top of that, the position involved using SCADA software, which I already had an experience with from a previous internship. 

Before the interview, I knew this was the chance of my life, the company was in my town, they pay well and have good benefits, so I prepared A LOT for the interview. I will also add that the senior design project manager was also there in the interview, along with the hiring manager, so I knew I had to make sure I was on top of explaining the senior design project that we did for them.

I go to the interview, and both guys were extremely nice and professorial, the project manager asks me to explain what I did on the project to the other person, I explained from A to Z, I spoke about my role as well as the whole team role, I would add that during senior design I was able to successfully develop a script that will automate a very long and complex process, this script will save hours and hours of manual work for the next team, and it came out to be about 1000 lines of code, I was rally proud of it. 

I explained all that, answered all their technical and behavioral questions, many answers I have made impressed the interviewers, they admitted that. And overall the position seemed to be at exact match to all my skills and experience and I felt they were very happy with me.

They had even told me that they were only interviewing fresh graduates, so I knew I had an advantage over other students with my experience in senior design and knowledge about SCADA from my internship, non of those are taught in school.

The very next day I get an automatic rejection email !!! That's it, no fuckin feedback or anything, which made me extremely disappointed, I'm usually very hard on myself and always underestimate myself, that interview was one of the few ones where I actually felt that I did a great job, I was at my peak and I couldn't think of any reason (aside from being a little nervous during the interview) that could impact me in a negative way.

I have spoken with my senior design mentor (who is a professor at my school) after the interview and he was disappointed and shocked as the company told him they were very impressed with our results, he told me that the company could've only interviewed with us because they had to meet a certain number of interviews and they could have already had someone in mind that they wanted to hire but they had to meet the number criteria. 

Sorry for the rant but this whole process is making me very stressed out, and it doesn't help that I get no feedback from rejections so I could improve myself. I would appreciate any thoughts/comments/advice on that matter."

Pass the garbage work to others",bi_tri_quad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8scg30/pursue_fun_meaningful_and_challenging_work_pass/,"I'm a ""junior programmer"" that's worked full time for about two years now. I've been with the same company in that time, and have a had couple of internships during college. By no means am I a seasoned veteran. Feel free to disagree with me. I hope people find this interesting and a change of pace from the typical ""how do I get a job"" posts. For those that already have a job and are just starting out, this might be for you.

Programmers starting out of college usually don't know much. It's probably common for many junior programmers to start off doing easy tasks and ramp up as quickly as possible. Leave the tough tasks for the senior and principal engineers, and do the easy, support jobs. I've been there. Just don't get comfortable being there, regardless of your age or title.

There's interesting and challenging work out there that are worthy of your time and effort. Pursue that even if you don't think you're an expert. Take ownership of it. Implement it yourself. Be responsible for it from end-to-end. Present and demonstrate your work. And then do more and profit, literally.

Don't get satisfied doing busy, easy, support work. If you can, avoid the easy work as much as possible. The easy work never gets paid well.

Not everyone can be the ADC of their team. I get that. You gotta have support units, tanks, etc. Someone has to sack up and play Mercy because everyone wants to just be Widowmaker or a ""Pro Genji"" (sorry if I'm not to up date with my Overwatch references). Don't ever be a full time support though. You'll never be rewarded for it properly.

I have an analogy that I've shared with some of my close friends and it's that everyone appreciates the dude that takes out the trash but no one is impressed by it. To explain what I mean, imagine the following scenario. There is trash in the house. The trash has been piling up inside the house, and it absolutely needs to be taken out the house. SOMEONE (jeez I wonder who) has to do it. However, taking out the trash is messy, smelly, and absolutely no one wants to do it. If you're the poor soul that is tasked with taking out the trash, everyone will say ""Awesome! Thanks for taking out the trash! It was getting really messy in here."" But there won't be a single person that says ""Holy mackerel! How were you able to take out the trash? What kind of technical complexity was involved because I don't think anyone else could have done it. It just boggles my mind."""

I've signed up for free mock interview practice with [pramp.com](https://pramp.com) and he saw an e-mail Pramp sent me while we were screen sharing (We're long distance right now. He has a hard time making friends so he's alone right now in California, but I'm interning in Toronto with all my friends). Also, after work, sometimes I stay behind and do practice questions with the other intern (he's a guy). This also makes my boyfriend upset. He said he was going to visit me for July 4 long weekend, but now he's saying if I do interviews with other boys he will refund his plane ticket.

What should I do? Am I being a bad girlfriend? Should I just not do mock interviews so I don't piss him off? Our relationship to me is more important to me than a job offer at Facebook. When I'm sad he always brings me chicken shawarma and I can see us having a real future together."

After I improved my skills I managed to get transferred to the IT department where I learned a bit of Java as well.

I've taken Calculus 1-3 Diff. EQ, plus a few other 500 level courses, I'm taken linear algebra now, and I've also learned how to use MATLAB /OCTAVE, but not once in those courses have I said to myself ""I love this stuff."" Sure, I did (and am doing) decent in my math classes, but I am not passionate about math. What made me major in math initially was the pressure from my family, as well the stigma and fear of getting a ""useless"" degree. Nonetheless, I’ll be going into my junior year and I’ve came to realize that if I hate my major now, then what is there to expect in the future for math?

What lead me to the realization that I like English, was how much enjoyment I was getting from proof reading a friend’s paper, but I’ve come to realize that I enjoyed that sort of stuff way before that.  English was what I excelled at in high school. I took English 1-honors English 4 in school and I excelled in all of them. In college I took the required ENG 101-102 as well as speech 101, and I found that I enjoyed doing that much more then I did my math courses. Also, I’ve been doing a little freelance editing for papers, as well as writing my own novel in my spare time. I don’t find myself thinking about math, but reading, writing and helping others with papers… I tend to do that more often. 

I know that majoring in English could be regrettable, but so could majoring in math and hating it. I know that a lot of people go to college to better their job prospects, but I don’t want to wake up everyday and hate the 9-5 (if that even exists anymore) doing something that’s related to math. I’m 21, and have just gone with the flow for most of my college career. Living with roommates, hitchhiking/ backpacking from state to state (even did it in Europe) and not having a “stable life” is what I’ve done. I want to do journalism, but that wasn’t offered at my school, and English is the closest they’ve got to it, which is fine with me! I’m not afraid to go hungry or go without to chase my dream! I’ve done that my whole childhood, and so far, I’m surviving my young adult years! Hell, I’m doing better then what I should be, and I’m the first one in my family to go to college! This wasn’t supposed to happen, but it’s happening. 

So far, I've been able to pay for schooling on my own, and I've only gone 7k into debt (currently I'm a Junior) and I go to a pricey 4-year state college where the norm is about 15k-25k of debt per semester. I'll be activating my GI bill (only good for a year+housing) for the fall, spring and summer semesters, and it will cover my junior year! Next summer I have the opportunity to work for a company that will pay off a good chunk of my student loans that I currently have, in addition to getting paid to work, so that my senior year I can focus on class and finding internships and not have to worry about my preexisting student loans. Also, I have a renewable scholarship that is about $1,600 a year, as well as a full pell-grant that  is around 3k, so each semester I get $4,600 to put towards school. Classes cost about 7k a year (where they get you is housing, and unrelated fees) so each semester I have to come up with about 2-3k out of pocket. As for renting instead of dorming, it’s cheaper to rent for around $250-300 and month, so I do that. I have $2,600 saved up (I want to put it towards housing for my senior year) . I think I can do this financially! I just have to plan ahead. Also, I take public transport, it cuts down on spending a lot, and work part time. I’ve projected to only go into debt 6-7k for my senior year, but I’ll fill out scholarships, (You’d be surprised how much a bunch of little, $50-$500 scholarships can add up to, as well as just saving up in general!!) 

As for an English major itself, it is about 33 credit hours. I usually take about 18 hrs. and I max out on summer classes. This is doable, but is it all wort it? If it helps to know any, I can handle taking 3 higher level math classes a semester, English can’t be that far off. I would have to go into overdrive, but I know I can do it. 

TL;DR: I’m thinking of switching my major from math to English because I don’t like math and I’m not happy with it, however, I love English and after thinking about what I want form life, I want to see where English will take me. What do you guys think? Is it worth it? "

Recently (last friday) my former boss from my internship during the period I was studying abroad in Germany, contacted me asking if I had interest to give continuation to one of my projects that I started during my internship on the company. I said that I wanted it very much but I would only be able to receive my diploma on August. He said that the company moved him to a new department and that he would give my number to the new boss on my former department on their next meeting. 

So yesterday (Monday) I sent him a friendly message asking how he was and how his weekend was. Also I asked if he had already spoken with the new boss on the other department or if their meeting didn't happened yet. He saw the messages (double blue check) but never replied. 

This job is the best chance I have to have success on my career. I'm from a third world country (Brazil) and I really wanna get out of here because this is a very bad and corrupt country (also bad economy). Not only this, but I loved working for this company, they really treated me well during my internship. Also I had a good evaluation and received compliment for my work from the company. So I was really confident about getting this job.

Now I can't even sleep thinking on how I messed things up this time with my anxiety sending those messages instead of waiting for him to reply me. 

Do you guys think I still have a chance?

tl;dr: Former boss from internship contacted me wanting me to work on a old project after my graduation, but I was to anxious and sent him messages instead of waiting for him to reply."

My first task is to learn the Spring framework, specifically, Spring MVC, REST, and Security. As a personal project, my manager told me to create a Spring Web Application to model a very basic version of a online library catalog where users can login, browse a catalog of books, and check them out. Though for the past like 7ish days I've been trying my best to learn the Spring material that my manager suggested, I feel overwhelmed by the amount of material I need to cover and feel like I am unable to understand the material as well as I wish/could and the application feels like such a big project to accomplish all by myself with no real guidance. 

The guidance problem is stemming from the fact that my manager has probably been in the office maybe, at best, 6 days of the 12 days since I've started work. I've requested and asked several times if I could be added onto their team's Slack but was told that he would have to ask someone first (It's been at least 5 days and I still have been yet to be included in a Slack while other interns have had joined a team Slack since their first few days). My manager is seemingly always busy and told me to email him if I ever have any questions and that he would respond within 1 day but that hasn't been the case with my emails. We've talked a few days ago about creating a functional and database design for the application but he has yet, since then, replied or been available for the most part. 

So, I'm currently going to work everyday, trying my best to learn all the Spring topics my manager suggested and making very little progress each day trying to make my own Spring Web Application. Though I admit, I could probably take the initiative with my manager much more but I'm just finding that very difficult when he's out of the office for plenty of days since I started interning and he won't/isn't able to add me to the team Slack so that the both of us have a more direct way of communicating. 

I know one other engineer in my vicinity that also works on this tech stack and I was thinking of just introducing myself to him and trying to see if I could shadow him or ask if he would be okay to kind of mentor me on Spring framework here and there. So, what do you guys think? Am I going about this the wrong way? What should I do to improve my situation?

Thanks!

Edit: I would ask other interns for help / talk to them about Spring but they're tasked to learn different technologies (more front-end like HTML,CSS,JS, REACT).

TLDR: I feel overwhelmed by what I was tasked to learn. Manager seems very busy, isn't very receptive, and often out of the office. What should I do to improve my own situation?"

Despite being on leave, I applied to junior-year internships and am now in the midst of one. Although I'm the same age as my peers, I feel really behind in both coursework and job experience because I failed to obtain meaningful internships when I was depressed. Everyone here is not only so experienced but also simply better at the work. I'm really doubting whether I belong in this role or even in this industry, a doubt that's partially fueled by my budding interest in another field.

So, these are about rates in my country.

I got an job offer for 70k from a startup. I'll be working on React and .NET Core which I love. The offer is lower than I expected.  My colleagues (my batch mates ) who got job offers accepted offers for around 90k-110k as an average. Many went around 110k. I got same experience (6 months internship) as them all. I was interviewed at many places (around 10) couldn't done well in some of them. Ghosted from 2,3 companies which I thought I aced the interviews.

Even though salaries of our graduates are around 90-110k others general fresh graduates get around only 40-60. Our salary is higher because of the difficulty of entrance exams for our degree program and recognition from the industry.

Now I'm having problems deciding whether I should accept the job offer or not. Because, I feel like I worth more. But as our studies are completing at the end of the month (and most of my friends got jobs already) I feel like looking for another jobs will be bit waste of time as I already have a job offer which can be started from next month. I think I can live with the salary (as I still live with my parents), but as my friends got more (one of my best friends got around 175k), this looks bad to accept the salary for 70k range.

What should I do? any advice/helps would be appreciated.

Every hour that a new set of METARs roll in (maybe just for my state, possibly larger or smaller areas), it will webscrape them as plain text, and then interpret the data into a map for each value: temperature, wind, etc.. Each airport will act as a node for all its information where a gradient/mesh is then generated to allow smooth transitions of values from one node to the next.

In addition, I didn't know what I wanted to switch to. So I stuck it out and graduated, but now I have this horrible feeling of disdain from the field I'm supposed to be entering. I had a bad hand of professors and got caught up in poor choices of friendship, and it made me hate my higher education experience as a whole. I managed to keep my head up by diving into club activities, which is why there are so many on my resume.

Recently I’ve been polishing up on my C++ knowledge (reading Stroustrup books and trying to do all my LeetCoding in it). I have a CS degree and used C++, Java, and Python pretty heavily in college, but all my work experience has been exclusively with JS.

I’m hoping to find a new job working with something more back-end/systems oriented (hopefully C++ although I’m still a noob with the language, as I’ve never really applied it to a large project outside of college). I might also be interested in something with Java or Python or another language all together. Basically just not building JS apps. However, all the non-JS jobs I find are usually asking for 2-3+ years of experience with said language. I’m also not really a recent grad anymore (graduated in May 2017) so I’m not sure if I’d be a valid candidate for those ”new-grad” jobs either.

TL;DR: Does anyone have advice for someone with no professional non-JS experience to land a non-JS job? How can I make my JS-exclusive resume look more attractive for a C++ (or other language) job application?"

I was really lost the year before, unsure of what to pursue, wasting my days and pondering what should I do in the future. Took me awhile before I got back on my feet, decided to start taking action and go back to working towards my goal to become a trader. I took up many finance modules in university (ones I wouldn’t have taken before), started doing my own trading again and eventually took up this internship, a way of getting my first step into the finance industry. 

However, it didn’t really start well. Got scolded really badly in my first few 2 weeks because I honestly couldn’t keep up with the pace and was still learning everything from scratch, from the products we do, to the way we do our paperwork etc. At times, there’s some product that a client wants to trade and I’ve never seen it before or some financial lingo that I can’t seem to find much information about on the internet. Usually I would find a free time and ask my seniors about it which they mostly helped me with it. But there was once where my colleague replied along the lines of the question being too stupid and what is there to ask even. This really set me back and from then on, I’m a bit unsure of what questions to ask. 

Currently in my 4th week now, I think I’ve improved in terms of speed and catching up with all the paperwork but still really lacking in fundamental knowledge and not being seated near enough to my colleague (can’t get in their way) sometimes makes it’s a little difficult for me to catch special instructions and orders that the clients want and that’s when I may get scolded. 

I know this is probably another hurdle that I’ve to cross in life, but it just gets really tiring and demoralizing at times even though I try to remind myself that “nothing worth it comes easy”. I won’t give up so easily but just want to know how current interns or seniors in the industry are coping/have coped with this before so I can learn from some of your experiences. Feel free to share your experiences! 

Also, I’m just wondering if anyone has any recommendations for books/notes on options, futures for me to start reading or any materials that may help me perform better. I’ll be really grateful and excited to see what you guys have to share!

There is a transformer substation with a dike around it that captures rainwater and possible oil leaks from the transformer. I need to design a pumping process that will evacuate the fluid from the dike.

The fluid will be pumped into a tote just beside the substation (the substation is surrounded by chain link fence, the tote will be outside of it). The tote will be manually checked by someone else so all I really need to do is pick the right system to pump out the rainwater/oil. (If there is any oil it will be a minimal amount)

The dike is 17' x 27' and 3"" deep. There is a small square hole outside of the fence still connected to the dike where the pump will go. That hole is 30"" x 30"" and 21"" deep.

I have never designed anything like this so I am not sure where to start or how to decide which pump/motor will be best. I was looking at this [Pitbull Pump](http://pitbullpumps.com/products/submersible-pumps/) as a coworker recommended it. The only downside is it also requires compressed air. But I am pretty sure it turns on and off automatically when the dike fills up. Obviously we will only need to pump after it rains, so we don't need a continuous pump.

Any help will be greatly appreciated. Let me know if I'm forgetting any key information."

I got a part time job during school coding that was ok at best, mildly depressing at worst. I felt like I wasn’t really getting anything done and just kind of existed there. Then my last summer I got an internship at amazon, and it was easily the worst summer of my life. I was isolated, didn’t mix with the culture, wasn’t really productive at all (a mix of depression and not having enough guidance and not enjoying the project I was on (it was very monotonous)). It got to the point where I went out to my car during lunch to cry. I saved some money and I’ve been traveling but I need to find a job for fall and I just don’t think I can code another line. It brings up what was probably the worst time in my life. Should I just bolster my degree as a sign of my ability to learn and work hard?

I’m going to be a senior at a fairly respected Uni next year in Los Angeles. I’ll be graduating with a BA in Economics and a minor in computer science, probably with a Gpa around 3.4. My highest math will be Calc 2, potentially diff equations. 

I’m going to be moving to San Fran next year, living basically rent free because my sister is letting me move into a spare bedroom in their house (lucky, I know). I have zero internships or computer related work experience. I’ve worked as a landscaper for my brothers business and a lifeguard at my highschool pool for two years.

I’ve taken a few courses on Udemy, a c# masterclass and a monogame introduction. I’m comfortable with C#, up through lambda expressions and have made a tic tac toe clone from scratch, if that counts for anything. I’d eventually like to work in the gamedev field.

How hard will it be for me to find a job next year? Any advice? Do I need a significant amount of self teaching/ leetcode? I’m pretty new, so any input at all would be great."

My gpa is 3.0 right now but I'm confident these classes will pull it to a 3.05 at least. 

The biggest problem of mine is I don't have any internship experience, all I have is a position of Lead Instructor at a summer STEM education camp, and a position as a grader for a graduate level Logic Design class. I realize this isn't ideal for applying for entry level jobs.

I'm mostly looking for entry level embedded systems stuff but honestly I'll take anything. As for improving my chances, I have conflicting advice. Some say I should focus on independent projects I do in my free time, while others say I should look for intern or volunteer roles in embedded systems. My question relates to the later: how do I find volunteer roles in embedded systems? I've tried job search engines but can't really find anything relating to that. To be honest,   I'm not quite sure what to do, any advice would be great.

[Long],The4thJames,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8sn8m1/long_term_air_bnb_saturated_in_mold_owner_keeps/,"I moved to Mayland for an internship about a month ago and since then I've been plagued by mold allergies. After the first week of itching and allergy symptoms I found the mold hidden under the trashcan in the room in the fluffy carpet and the padding underneath. At that point I got in contact with the host (currently living in California) and the person helping him here to run it about the issue. During the following period they have been incredibly slow to respond and the owner has been furious with me for claiming there is mold. Since then I've tried to remedy the problem my self but the padding under the carpet is so saturated with mold that it's proven ineffective. About a week ago the lady helping the owner brought in a handyman to look at the carpet and he agreed with me that it was mold. Since then I've contacted air bnb and they have been unhelpful so far. Today I got an email stating that the owner had brought in a contractor to look at the carpet and determined that it wasn't mold and also claims that the carpet was then cleaned and the foam underneath sterilized. I know that this is blatantly a lie because the person they actually brought in agreed with me about the mold and there is a significant amount of heavy furniture in the room including a massive metal thing to store paperwork in and none of it or my stuff has moved. Also I've lived in a moldy place before and I know I'm allergic to it and I am now covered in rashes from it since it has gotten worse. I have another place lined up for the remainder of my internship but considering all these people have put me through I am wondering if I can get them unlisted from airbnb or report them to some govenment health body. I doubt I can get my money back at this point.

The experience has been great, I have obtained experience on several different products from desktop OS's to servers, firewalls, networking, Office 365 etc etc. That being said its a ton of work, and its stressful. I'm talking day in day out just back to back tickets and phone calls, combined with staffing levels on the help desk that are needless to say not ideal. We have hired NOBODY since I came on, unless you count a couple unpaid interns. Its ridiculous, and embarrassing as people have left but they are not replaced. But, that also seems to be the way of many MSP's. I can list a few more negatives like how we've onboarded a few new clients that have terrible environments, or how our documentation kind of sucks, but the point is I want to move on. With every new point in my career however I admit I feel a bit of unconfident. I feel like there is always ""more"" experience to gain before moving onto the next position. I wanted to start writing my resume yesterday but I'm unsure if I want to put a few more months in before jumping ship.

I guess my question, as is in the title, is if it would be worth heading on over to either a better MSP position or perhaps internal I.T with the experience I have now (6 months in this MSP + several years of ISP tech support + few months as an intern on a help desk). I have an educational background in I.T and a few expired certs (e.g. A+, CCNA) but not sure if the time is right to make another move."

I don't feel ready to go through all the nonsense to *possibly* get an internship, I'd rather just build up my skills and portfolio instead.",cscqthwy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8snxtd/are_internships_really_that_important_i_dont_feel/,"I have my last shot at a ""real"" internship next summer. Currently only have a teaching position under my belt. Problem is, I'm only just now (this summer onwards) learning how to make real-world applications. I am quite ambitious and want to learn about a lot of stuff. I have a lot of cool ideas for stuff I want to try to build, but I have a long way to go before I can actually build any of these.

I recently talked to someone who interned at a BigN and he essentially told me that I should just half-ass a couple of quick/easy projects so I can say I did them, and then focus on studying CTCI/Leetcode.

But like...what's the point of studying algorithms if I don't even feel like I can make anything? And why would I want to build side projects for the sake of putting them on my resume and nothing else? It feels like the priorities are wrong in that mindset, but supposedly that's more correct than how I want to do it. I think he was also probably more content with his skill level than I am now.

I'd rather go at my own pace and actually become confident in my ability to make stuff before applying to internships/jobs. I want to build projects that I'm passionate about, rather than fake my way into what would likely be an uninteresting internship. Isn't that ultimately better for when I'm applying for a full-time position anyways? Or does the lack of an internship outweigh any benefits that more skills and completed projects would have?

And yes, I know that projects and interview prep are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Thing is, I can stick with my portfolio of just class projects, and start grinding Leetcode right now. I can then apply for a generic software engineering internship, and *maybe* hear back from them. But, I'd rather work in a more specialized internship, in a specialization that interests me. By the time I have enough experience to confidently apply for such a position though, it'd probably be past the point where I can be selective, at that point I'm lucky to get anything.

I've heard that if you graduate without an internship, it can be a major red flag for companies. Should I really be putting internships above building a portfolio of projects that interest me, which could potentially pave my way to *jobs* that interest me?"

So I work a 35 - 40 hours paid internship at my University NYU where I work on a variety of CS projects on a weekly basis.

I am also concurrently working with a professor at the same UNI where I remotely write python code to scrape financial historical data for company and cryptocurrencies and analyze them for her. These projects average at 5 - 10 hours per week.

I am also studying LeetCode and Cracking the Coding Interview. I am only spending like 5 - 10 hours per week on the Algorithm questions.

I am not really going for the big 4 or big 8 or big whatever. I just want a decent CS job at NYC after I graduate where I could make like 70 - 80k at least before tax and without bonus. Is that doable? My GPA is like a 3.7 and I'm finishing up my Bachelors for CS real soon. 

I apologize if I sound like I am bragging or if this sub is getting tired of these questions. I am too scared to lurk here, it always gets me depressed. 

So yeah, my question is, should I do anything else this summer to help achieve my goal?

After getting turned down from a couple internships, I came across a minimum wage part-time job at an ice cream chain that we will call ""FrozenRock"" Creamery in North Carolina. This is a franchise location owned by an individual who owns two other locations as well.

Interacting with the owner after being hired, I have noticed multiple red flags. Some of the red flags:

1. I completed my generic hiring paperwork and turned it in within three days as specified. It has been multiple weeks and still has not been processed so I am not in the payroll system. As a result, I am keeping track of all my hours on my phone and having to write them down or text them to a manager.
2. I have been there for two pay periods. The first pay period I was paid in straight cash and given a check stub where where Social Security and Medicare was taken out, but neither federal nor state income tax was taken out. The second pay period I was given a check with the same tax information taken/not taken out.

2a) The owner takes all tips each day and then distributes them on payday in cash (I do not know if this count is accurate or how it is distributed). This second pay period, I have heard from managers that the ""draw"" was low so he is not giving us tips. Is this allowed? Additionally, the managers are encouraging us to argue against it saying our part-time crew member tips have no impact on the ""draw"" so it is unfair of him to do so.

2b) The first pay period I was shorted 50 minutes of working. I reached out to the managers and they said talk to the owner. I have reached out multiple times and have gotten no response. I have only seen him in person twice. Once to interview me and once to hand me my pay in an envelope. This second pay period, the owner is out of town on vacation and none of the managers know how long he will be gone or where he is at. This pay period I was shorted 6 hours 15 minutes. When I told the manager at the store how much I was shorted, he felt bad for me and pulled out $56 from the safe to try and compensate for the missing pay and just said to call it ""tips.""

2c) I am not the only one to be shorted. A guy that was there my first week on the job quit for being shorted on his paychecks. Today in our employee GroupMe an employer who has been there for over a year commented ""Everyone is upset about this dude, so it's not just you. I busy my a\*\* and I get paid half of it. \[Owner\] promised me full time hours while we hiring, he hasn't done that."" Therefore, I need to speak up to address what is happening to me and help stop this pattern that is going on to multiple employees.

Having been shorted 6 hours and 55 minutes was mainly what pushed me over the edge and I quit today with advice from a manager to do so (third red flag). After announcing I had quit another manager who had been there for 7 years texted me, ""I'm sorry that happened. At the end of the day, I can only do so much. I'll def miss ya!""

I am waiting for information on when the owner will get back from vacation to have a face to face meeting about this; what recommendations do you have for that confrontation conversation about this blatant pattern of issues for pay periods to get my missing hours pay? Additionally, is it worthwhile to notify the franchise corporate or some other group of these issues facing employees under this owner? Thank you for your assistance with this question and helping me not make a mistake like this when I work my way up to being a manager or owner!

Tl;dr Across two pay checks, I have been shorted 6 hours 55 minutes making me quit. What advice do you have for talking with the owner to get my pay? Also, is the owner allowed to withhold tips from the crew members due to the store draw being low when tips do not affect the store's draw?"

8sp3kb,2,2018-06-21,I feel incredibly stupid and I need work advice...,CafeBustelo12,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8sp3kb/i_feel_incredibly_stupid_and_i_need_work_advice/,"I’m not gonna disclose everything. So for purposes I have changed names or omitted names, including my own. Just call me ""Sandy"".  


So, I’ve had quite a bit of interactions and experiences with this establishment and before I consider what I might do after the end of my next shift I want to make sure I’m not overreacting to how management is run. But I work at a an establishment- more specifically a hospitality type establishment.   


This place is not far from where I reside. I am getting my degree in hospitality so having known about this place I figured I might give it a try and apply for an internship there. I initially emailed the manager who deals with events to see if I would get a response (either a yes or no). So I got no response, knowing I live near the place I drove there (on my way to another place ) with my printed resume and went to the front desk and explained my situation to the girl who was about my age, I saw her go to an office with the resume, so it got delivered in one form or another.  


About a couple days after, the events manager emailed me back asking a little about why I wanted an internship. So another thing, in my program we have to complete two internships, and before deciding that this was one of the places I wanted to possibly intern at, I looked at other areas but I decided I wanted to try this place first because what they did there interested me and the fact they do events and have a restaurant was also really great. I looked on the website to see who I would send my email to and it gave me the biography of this woman- who by the way listed she got her degree in the same degree I had at the same school I currently go to, so I explained to her politely my situation and thanked her for getting back to me, and left my contact info once again.   


Radio silence, there was no response. So at this point I assumed, okay not the right fit. I continued my search for an internship, and then one day out of the blue I get two email notifications from the manager. One was an email chain between her and I believe the banquet captain and the jist of the conversation was-   


EMAIL:

Manager (attaches my resume): I don’t know can’t you use her somewhere?   


Banquet Captain(maybe?): Possibly, is this her resume?  


I’m not sure if I was supposed to see their chain but I did, and then after that email chain she sent an email reply attached to that chain that simply said from her (the events manager)- “Sandy, send your resume!”.  


Even though I sent her my resume from the initial email, she had a hard copy of it when I dropped by in person and another copy from the email chain, I thought it was weird she needed it but I sent my resume to her once again.  


About a day later, I get an email response from said manager-   


“Sandy I already told you that you are not the right fit for this, you just don’t have the experience we are looking for.”  


I didn’t reply, I was confused.   


But,  


Okay.  


1.) You didn’t tell me no. You kept me on radio silence, if that’s your way of saying no, you may want to you know just say “no”.  


2.) If you didn’t want me to send you an email then why’d you ask me yet again to send me the resume?  


After that experience, I brushed it off. I tried and I put myself out there and it didn’t work. I eventually found an internship, and I enjoyed it.   


Fast forward a year later, and I needed a summer job. Of course because I’m so smart (or lack there of) I see that the same place has a few positions open and I apply for one. It may be a part time job for the summer, but it could look good on my resume and I’m not going to let one bad experience with the events manager stop me. I mean one manager can't affect the whole place.   


So I get an interview with a different manager there (there are several managers there for different divisions). I had my interview with him and he seemed very different from the other interactions I had with this management previously. He hired me on the spot, I guess they needed people to fill their summer positions.   


I had two shadow shifts (divided into four hours each) and from those I feel like they determine if you are a good fit. Surprisingly I was, and in those times it was not indicated I had done anything wrong or I was given anything else besides constructive feedback by the other young girl who I was shadowing on some things or skills I needed to keep in mind. Fair, if there are protocols or a way I should address customers I think it’s okay to know or make me aware of things I needed to do/ improve on.   


This was a part time job, this isn’t my career. But I wanted to be able to somewhat find a positive in this, and I wanted to do my job right. Besides the two four hour shadow shifts (one of which I had to observe and do nothing), my only other formal training was an “orientation”, basically me finding out a little more about the company and filling out paperwork.  


I was surprised to learn that the manager who hired me had left due to getting a better opportunity. Which again is fair, if you have something offered to you that works better for you, I say go for it. I was sad because he was genuinely a nice guy and he knew how to deal with any and all types of situations. But, sometimes when you need to move on, you need to move on.  


I went into my shifts, and sometimes the night before at the last minute they would ask me if I would be available to work tomorrow. I usually could, but they never indicated to me I’d be on call. In fact, I was told by one of the assistant managers, that ""on call"" was a voluntary thing you do. I never voluntarily specified I wanted to be ""on call"". Every time I would do a shift, I incorporated what I learned in my shadow shifts and what I was taught, and if a customer asked me a question that I did not have the answer to I would get my immediate supervisor (who awesome btw) because I’m not going to give the wrong information to a customer because they are there to enjoy the place not to be duped.   


Besides my immediate supervisor and the two people I somewhat got along with, no one was very nice. In the hospitality industry there are some days where things will get busy and people get stressed but even on the days it was not busy it seemed cliquey and even though I’m here to work and not make friends there are times I felt like I annoyed people. So I just kept to myself in my area until I absolutely needed to ask a question or needed additional help.   


In addition, on days where there are big events or busy weekends. We would get told last minute about everything, and even though you really can’t predict one weekend from the next, if it’s a holiday weekend like Father’s Day or graduation or Memorial Day, a pre-information meeting the night before with the staff would be helpful and you can follow up with everyone in the morning. Because otherwise information will get lost in the mix.  


This past Saturday, I had been assigned to open up. I was never trained how to open up, luckily I managed to know a few things. The co-owner who is also the general manager was up there at the front desk with me, and as I was opening up she told me a few things about the procedure.   


I continued to open up and immediately noticed customers coming in, I was taught in my training by the young girl and my immediate supervisor how to greet guests. So I greeted customers, and got them started on their tastings. After doing that the GM approached me and told me I addressed them wrong and gave me the proper way of addressing them. Okay, fair point, I mean if the co-owner/GM is telling me that that is the way to do things, it’s the way and I guess I was told differently at the time, that’s my mistake. I apologize and continue to greet and help people. At one point near the middle of the day, I greet people the correct way and get them started with their visit and my GM witnessed this and she yelled at me saying-   


“OKAY YOUR JOB IS TO GREET THE GUESTS YOU CANT JUST STAND THERE SILENT”  


I wasn’t, she saw me loudly and cheerfully greet people. So I apologize once again. Throughout the day she comes to check up on me, and every time she tells me what I need to do and that what I was doing was not right even though that’s how I was taught. I figured she was just stressed because it was a busy weekend because at one point she seemed to be somewhat nicer to me.   


This past Sunday came, and it was Fathers Day (btw happy belated Father’s Day everyone), and there was an event going on while the winery was still open. I was not told or made aware of, but I guess the night before someone at the front desk was told to take apart tickets for the event by the events staff, but since the day before it was so busy and there is only two registers the line gets long very fast and we needed to serve customers.   


So the GM yelled at me, saying- “These aren’t taken apart yet?!!” And I reply with an apology and I continue to take them apart. I think she saw how stressed she made me and she calmed down a bit. A task for the events interns and staff should not be delegated to the front desk and register and if they tasks that needed to be done, you may not want to pile it on last minute.   


Apparently, the event had listed inaccurate information which is supposed to be handled by the events manager (same girl who I had that email thing with), and customers were obviously stressed that they got told wrong information on the website that was supposed to be handled by the events manager and her staff. So we got yelled at a few times by customers who were given wrong information, I personally don’t mind dealing with tough customers, I just apologize and ask them if I can help. If you spent money on an event and got told wrong information- wouldn't you be a little mad too?  


Anyways, the GM is notified about this fiasco and she doesn’t say or do anything she just stands there at the bar and deflects the issue towards someone else. She yells at me again and turns back to her phone and I go back to the front desk to assist my co-worker and my immediate supervisor.   


We finally resolve all issues having to do with the event going on and continue business as usual. We had a few tough customers, but it got resolved.   


While the line had about 30 people in it, who also were picking up these wine box subscriptions, the wait got to be a lot, and the manager on the floor had to get someone on an IPad to get another portion of the line. The GM yelled at us once again, that the phone was ringing and we needed to answer it, even though there was clearly a ton of people in line waiting to be checked out. The phone did not belong to any one of us.   


The musician who was playing earlier that day (I was not made aware he was playing at the event) called to see if he left a black stand, and I checked with our managers to see if they retrieved it, I ran into the GM and asked her about it and she told me “yeah it’s in my office” in a matter of fact tone. I reply thanking her and tell her he is on his way somewhere and  that was miscommunicated on my part, and she got panicked asking if he will be here. I told her I must have not heard him or asked him correctly and apologized and called him back. I told her he was and she calmed down and joked “don’t scare me like that again Sandy!”, that was the first time I saw her genuinely not be annoyed by cluelessness. She was standing with the girl I shadowed in her office and as I left she said something under her breath and the girl laughed.  


Im not going to assume it was about me. But looking at context it gave me a strong feeling it was. Before the end of my shift, I found out two important things- when someone was talking about the initial manager who hired me, someone else replied- oh yeah people come in and out of here all the time, suggesting there’s a high turnover rate. In addition, the events manager who I had my exchange with over email and the same one who caused a majority of problems during the Father’s Day event is also the owners daughter which made me understand why she wasn’t held accountable for basically the things she was responsible for.  


But, I ended those shifts and I honestly feel miserable at this summer part time job. It’s not the hours, it’s not the customers I’m okay with that. It’s the way management is organized and how as a new person you are left in the dark up until the last minute. The upper epsilon of management deflects all of this disorganization back on there employees,  and nepotism reeks the air in this place. I try my best everyday and I genuinely want to improve. I also try to look at the positives and while I have total of two friends there who I don’t want to leave, overall this place is a mess and I keep telling myself it will get better and that it’s not a career but it’s a summer job.   


The only reason there’s business and possibly good reviews is due to two things- it’s the only kind of hospitality establishment in the region that has a restaurant, events, and tasting bar and there’s no competition and that the main things they do cater to- wine and wine tastings are pretty good. I am just stupid for thinking that maybe this time around working for this business I wouldn’t have any deep fundamental issues with management, the customers I deal with are okay. I mean customers will be customers, it’s the highest levels of management that make me stressed.  


I will give this job another try during my next shift because maybe it is a me issue. But, if things do not change I think I will have to quit, I feel pathetic because I proactively asked questions and try to be polite to my co workers but it’s just not worth the stress anymore.  


So should I go in for another shift with an open mind? Or should I write my two weeks notice?   


If I do end up quitting, how would I preface my two weeks notice? I can't simply say ""Hey, everything sucks- deuces y'all!""...  


Anyways, thank you for reading this novel long series. I just needed to vent to a bunch of strangers on the internet and I figured since you are an outside opinion I may get a new perspective on this whole situation. Thank you.

Thing is i'm sort of at a loss on what exactly i should have on it. I know the basics and have read numerous guides but my situation is a little bit different.

* I'm currently a student and will graduate in two semesters with a bachelors in economics.

* I have not had an official job since Feb 2017. Prior to that i had been working as a parts delivery for advance auto parts for 2 years. Prior to that job i was working at UPS.

* I made the mistake a long time ago of choosing a business degree path over computer science/programming. I'm quite proficient in it and picked it up when i was 13 writing scripts for emulator game servers - I've come a long way since then with it. I figured i already knew programming why would i have to major in it? As it turns out, that was a mistake.  

* For the past 17 months I've made money by doing web/graphic design and coding. My big issue is if that is something i should include in my resume. I'm worried having a 17 month unemployed status on my resume will be a big factor. 

* Unfortunately most of the money I've made has been writing cheat software for numerous games, not sure how advantageous that is for me to share.

* I have a certificate in java from my community college i went too about 2 years ago. I don't know if that holds any weight but i took the course over the summer.


* My grades in school aren't the best, i'm scraping by with a 2.3 GPA which is why i was wondering how important would it be to mention my proficiency in comp science.

* Ideally i'd like to work in the business sector, that's why i chose that over programming. But i'm worried my poor grades will hold be back against other candidates. 


I just need a little bit of direction so i can start with writing this resume. Should i just stick to the econ side and not even mention my background/experience in programming? After all it is what i'm majoring in. How do i explain the gap in my unemployment?"

My cousin who works at united health recently said they're opening up internships soon for the coming fall season. The internships are for students majoring in computer science and i was thinking about applying since i have 1 semester left. The official title i suppose is ""tech development"".

I am a CS major and I'd like to apply, but i am really not the most proficient at all. I can do the work, but i need a book besides me or i do it at a much slower pace. I'm worried I'll walk into an interview or a scenario where i won't beable to look at my references to get a grip on things.  


So my question is what exactly is the job/daily task of a CS intern for a company like United? I tried searching google first but got no hits on that of a specific thing. I was hoping to get the job just for the experience and kind of ""fake it till i know it"" deal. And i know that sounds bad, but that's why id rather ask first before making a tool of myself. "

8ssokn,62,2018-06-21,Engineering coding crash course for incoming freshman students,fiveguy,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/8ssokn/engineering_coding_crash_course_for_incoming/,"Hello from the CS world! I'm a programmer and giving a crash course for my daughter and her high school classmates who are entering freshman engineering. **From an engineer's perspective, what would you cover?**

The students are a bit spooked by the thought of learning ""programming"" as part of their fall semester. My natural response (as a parent of one of them) is to throw them to the wolves and let their (excellent) engineering faculty do what they will do. However, as a programmer dad, I offered to show them some basics before they head to school, mostly to alleviate their anxiety, and they are very interested (in other words, I can't back out now!).

These are all kids who are bright - all are going straight to multivariable calculus first semester. However, none of them took any programming classes in high school (though could have). 

I have an Arduino with bunches of peripherals/sensors which I used with my younger kid for a school project. I know they have a group ""robotics"" project first semester, which is more than likely an Arduino-like platform, so it seems like a good choice here. I figure covering basics of variable typing, declaring a function, and using a library to interact with a sensor or two will give them enough basics to put them more at ease.

**My question for engineers is whether there's anything engineering-specific you'd recommend, whether language features or industry style.**

For instance, whenever I mentor CS interns or junior developers, I focus heavily on *style*, particularly writing self-documenting code, with descriptive variable and function names, and favoring short functions to keep the code readable. However, that may not be best for a different discipline.

Background: I’m a college student studying Information Systems who managed to get an internship in the IT department’s R&amp;D team for a moderately sized company. I’ve been tasked with working with Microsoft’s HoloLens and Microsoft’s Project Gesture Service to find an application for those two techs in our company. On my third day in (I have been here about 3 weeks now) I was told I would be finding a use for those two techs and creating working demo apps for those usages. I thought that this would be an already difficult task given my lack of programming experience beyond one intro to Python Course I took in school but my boss reassured me I could ask my team of full time staff for help. For the last 2 and a half weeks I’ve been researching how to impliment these techs into a use and have gotten a solid idea for the applications I want to make.

Unfortunately this is where the issues and my stress really came to light as it really dawned on me what I would have to do to get this job done since I have zero programming knowledge of C#, zero underdtanding of JSON, zero understanding of Unity, and no idea how to create an application of any kind let a lone one for augmented reality. I’ve begun struggling to figure out how I’m going to program and create these applications whatsoever. 
When I applied for the job I explictly stated I had limited programming knowledge in python and although I explained the projects I had done in that class I learned it in, those were all guided and were pretty much holding my hand the entire time. Now I have no clue what to do. I’m unsure why I was hired for this position when there must have been other applicants with the experience necessary for this job.

I’ve told other people in the office not on my team about how unsure I am about this and they’ve told me to clarify with my manager regarding my tasks but I have continuously asked to make sure what I’m supposed to be doing and it was exactly what I thought.

I’m not sure if or how to tell my boss I can’t do this but there’s absoluely no feasable way for me to singlehandedly create two working applications in a month with full documentstion with this level of experience. What should I do? Any advice would be appreciated."

I've just done so many different things in this internship and touched so many different fields. The company I'm with is short manned, so they're getting rid of me to find someone who is more experienced and can take some responsibility from our current sysadmin/dept head, but this also means I had a TON of responsibilities during my internship, taking care of (mostly smaller) things all over the place. What do you guys think?

I haven't uploaded a resume because it's only in its beginning stages and not nearly ready to be randomized to upload. I don't even have a first draft yet. If this is against the rules let me know."
8sui5y,0,2018-06-21,Are recruiters really that bad?,FoxtrotCrashJack,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/8sui5y/are_recruiters_really_that_bad/,"Hi. I'm writing this because as an international student on this subreddit and also other pages or forums I have visited related to engineering seem to have like a negative stigma against recruiters, or as if they were looking for jobs but all they could find/get were calls from several recruiters. Now I do not know why it is a bad thing or might not look as much for others, but aren't recruiters people hire to hire people for other companies and avoid the hassle of finding the candidates? Couldn't those recruiters end up getting that job you are looking for or is that a wrong way of seeing it? I am just saying cause I too have been applying to some jobs and while it seems that you never get answers back, the only ones I do have voicemails or emails are from a couple of recruiters; like AeroTek and The Select Group. Are those bad options or letting them find a position that might suit me is bad? Last month the closer I was to a job was with these recruiters that set me up an interview with some Caterpillar workers and it went really, unfortunately my timing with my visa and paperwork was just not working for them and me so it was a silent no between parties when that was discussed. The same recruiter kept calling to look for other positions and asked for some references too while ""she was going to look for other opening"", might as well have my references in check. It took me a while to contact my old supervisors from my previous internship to get those references so I just ended up just ""ignoring"" that recruiter. As I kept on looking for other jobs in Glassdoor, Indeed Linkedin, I ended up getting again some calls from recruiters, should I keep ignoring them and just apply individual to each position? What are the pros and cons of recruiters? Is the stigma against them for something? If as an international student once I get my visa I only have like a 2 month period to find a job, should really be looking into them as an option to stay working in the country? "
8suqjf,1,2018-06-21,"Without an internship, will it be hopeless? (grad student / switching careers)",andy_d0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8suqjf/without_an_internship_will_it_be_hopeless_grad/,"I did most of my program part time till it came to the point that I had to make a choice.  I thought about getting an internship but personal / health reasons came up while I was working through finishing the program that I just found it difficult to spend time preparing for interviewing as well.

I now find myself at the end of my program. My final class is structured in a way where it's sort of like an internship as you work with other companies on a project. The issue is that it's not officially an internship and the process isn't going smoothly where it may be that not a lot will get done by the end of the summer. I'm not happy about this but I can't drop the class.

In regards to experience, I worked at a bank doing what some would probably label as data engineering. I liked the work but I liked writing code more than dealing with databases. I fear that without an internship I have still pigeon holed myself into that type of role.

I've also thought about whether I should try for a fall internship at the tech companies even though I have graduated. I'm not sure if I'll just get ignored, though. 

tl;dr - I'm done this summer without an internship. Previous work has similarities to data engineering but I want more of a software engineering role. Not sure if it'll be far more difficult now without an internship."
8suyu1,1,2018-06-21,[Work] Should I quit this job?,iseta,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8suyu1/work_should_i_quit_this_job/,"Let’s start by saying that I’m Brazilian and therefore I earn by the month’s work, not week nor hour. Sooo, here’s my story and I do believe it’s a long one, bear with me. I began working with Unity as a hobby three years ago, had a small experience but pretty competent to work on small projects. A few months later, I found an internship where I live which sounded pretty ideal: Working with Unity for educational apps which are not really games but I wanted the experience anyway. In my town, it’s pretty hard to find any job with Unity, we mostly have programming and help desk jobs for anyone in this field and that’s all. Okay, I got the internship and everything is kinda dandy, worked on nine apps along my two years (which is the maximum time) and they seemed to enjoy how I work. The thing with this internship was: I had really really really long times where there wasn’t nothing for me to do. But I guess the worse is yet to come. My internship was at it’s end and they really wanted to keep me working there which is, you know, great, but hence it’s a big corporation I’d still have to go through their selection process which was open for the minimum time: One week. Another guy signed up for the position. He got it. 
I still had a month left in my internship and it was pretty devastating, I was almost in tears everyday working there with that dude working by my side and even as an intern I still had to train him on some stuff (Bear in mind that internship is merely a title here in Brazil, you just do whatever a normal worker would have to do in less time.)
It was a soul crushing experience but then, on my last week, my boss called me to his desk, said he had a temporary spot for me that would last a month to two years. It’s been two months and I’m still here, working full-time, getting a reasonable salary. But they don’t fucking trust me anymore. They don’t have anything for me to do. Everyday feels like a wasted day. I feel like a fucking dumbass complaining about this because I’m getting my pay every month without doing a lot but I’m qualified, I’ve studied, and they trust him way more than me. It’s frustrating and there are days when I want to cry and curse everyone out loud.

TL;DR: They hired someone better than me and don’t trust my skills anymore, even though I’m fully capable."
8sv18q,52,2018-06-21,[USA-IA] My dorm room was broken into and robbed and I'm being charged for it,L_A_S_A_G_N_A,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8sv18q/usaia_my_dorm_room_was_broken_into_and_robbed_and/,"I'm attending school in Iowa and I am being charged for damages to my door and the door frame after my neighbor forced my door open by slamming into it and using a knife to pry the latch open, this did so much damage to the door that you could just push on it. It happened multiple times, one time he broke in and I was in my loft bed, he climbed up the ladder and asked why I was there, saying he thought I had class at that time. Each time something happened or something went missing, I reported it. I also found some of my items in his room, I should also mention, I was in his room because his roommate was one of my friends so I would hang out in there, where I saw some of my stuff on this guys desk. I reported every instance to the hall director, the dean, security and every RA that I could find, they all just said to tell them if something else happened. Not once did they do anything to stop this, no surveillance, no punishment for this guy, nothing. I am missing hundreds of dollars worth of items that I still have not replaced and I know for a fact he took them. But the issue is, he was expelled because he was caught smoking in the bathroom, and when security searched his room, they found knives and bb guns (which he used to shoot holes in the walls, which we are also being charged for). He also got in a fight the next day and they immediately booted him from the school. He also passed away a few weeks ago in an accident. He basically went insane the last few weeks of our January term. The only contact I have had with him since is some messages he sent me and my girlfriend saying rude things, before blocking us. The last few days I have been talking to the president of Resident Life, and I tell him the reasons I should not be charged are:

\- I did not do the damage, I was not in my room when he broke my door, and he came in multiple other times

\- I told every authority figure I could think of, even at one point mentioning it to the police when I gave the report on the fight in our dorm

\- I could not have been responsible, for I went home every weekend, giving this guy plenty of time to break in, and he was usually the only person to stay in the dorm (our dorm is segmented into pods, so our pod was empty).

The president of resident life said they will charge me no matter what, and his reasons were:

\- The dorm director told him I was given the option to move out by our dorm director, BUT he gave me this option at the beginning of the first semester when I mentioned that sometimes there is a lot of noise and often I am kept up until 4AM. He did not give me the option to move out during any of the drama with the thief. Whenever I told him about something this guy did, he just told me to tell him if something else happened, which I would do, and he would say the same thing.

\- The door is fireproof and thus very expensive and they need someone to charge.

He ended our conversation saying that next year, I should come to him or someone of authority if something like this happened so I can avoid charges, which is exactly what I did but I was not given help.

I don't believe they think I did the damage because everyone knows I kind of kept to myself and just studied or played video games (which I now cannot do because of the theft), and was always gone from campus, yet they insist I must pay. I am in the process of contacting the Dorm Director to tell him what he told the president of Res Life was untrue.

I haven't been able to register for this coming year yet because of the hold on my account from the fines, and I won't be able to pay off this fine before next semester as my funds are pretty much cleared out from this year and I need to raise money to pay my student loans off, while balancing the costs of food and other things required to survive. I will soon have an unpaid internship in NYC that I cannot cancel and after that the summer will be basically over, leaving no time to earn money.

I know this is a really long  wall of text but I'm so stressed out and it's been such a terrible first year of school because of all this drama.

And yes, I locked my door every single day, made sure to as I have always been very protective of my stuff.

I would so much appreciate any advice anybody can give, I am stuck right now and I really can't pay these fines. (500 for the door, and possibly more because of the BB gun holes in the walls of our pod, although I probably won't be charged for the holes because they know it was him.

Tl;dr I was robbed, my dorm room door was broken and the school is trying to charge

Edit: I am seeing the Dean again tomorrow, as well as filling out a Crime Victim Compensation Application

8svlkz,1,2018-06-21,Employer Provided Housing Under Construction (NYC),justnerming,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8svlkz/employer_provided_housing_under_construction_nyc/,"First time poster, on mobile, wall of text etc. 

I work for a non-profit in New York City that provides me housing in one of their buildings as part of my compensation. I do not pay rent/utilities and have a lower salary to reflect the lack of living costs. I am exempt and salaried. My job often requires late night or weekend work, so I’m usually quite happy with the apartment. Living in the apartment is a requirement of remaining in the job. 

Although there are plenty of maintenance and other issues that occasionally happen (as I would expect in most tenant/landlord relationships) My patience has hit a wall with one issue in particular. 

The non-profit is in the middle of a multi-year process of working on the building I live in. The construction occurs over the summer months. Last summer, the non-profit moved me into a different building to facilitate the construction work taking place on my floor. They hired movers and provided boxes. Although not an easy moving process it was significantly easier than it could have been. 

This year, I was told in January that they were hoping that I would live in the building during the construction as my floor would not be affected. This was confirmed to me around late March/early April when the non-profit’s construction liaison told me the water would probably be shut off several times, but with plenty of advance notice. And that was the only planned disruption to my apartment. 

At the end of May, the nonprofit said that the repairs required the shut down of the fire safety systems and I would not be able to sleep in the building starting the second week of June. I would be provided a temporary and furnished apartment while retaining access to my usual living space. They anticipated this arrangement would last until the end of July. In the same email I was offered “help” to move my belongings the third of a mile to the other apartment. I later learned they essentially wanted to use interns to help move my things about a third of a mile to this new apartment without a car. 

Speaking with my live in partner, we decided that we would sleep in this new apartment (being not quite ready to die by an unannounced fire) but generally spend our time in our regular apartment. That way we didn’t need to move anything large and we could still enjoy our stuff. 

Today I got a call from the office that planned the renovation to let me know that I would no longer be able to use the water in my usual apartment. Apparently their construction work required cutting a water pipe and any draining water will leak somewhere in the building causing damage. I asked the office if they would then be able to have my belongings moved since the building is even less occupiable than it was before. Over the phone, they were hesitant to promise anything (naturally) and talked about finding temporary furniture to be approximations of what we own. 

All of these issues will occur again next year when the building is under construction again.  Although they’ve said already that they’ll probably just move me at the beginning of the construction next year. 

I’ve never understood my legal options to deal with their lackluster performance as a landlord and my issues as a resident. To be honest I don’t even know if I’m technically a tenant with rights due to the employment factor. There is no formal lease. The closest document I’ve found to addressing any relocation issues stated that employees that need to be relocated will be worked with to “reduce the inconvenience” which is as comforting as sandpaper. 

As an employee living in employer provided housing, what rights do I have and what obligations can I hold my employer to?

TLDR: Employer provided apartment is under construction and Employer states that they’ll temporarily provide me a furnished apartment but not move any of my stuff. There is no lease with my employer and any expectations are written in a employee manual. Is my situation covered by landlord tenant law?"
8svqs6,1,2018-06-21,Graduating in November. A few options on how to spend my free time before then.,Polyphase29,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8svqs6/graduating_in_november_a_few_options_on_how_to/,"I'm finishing a Masters degree in CS in November (it's really a glorified Bachelors in a way, as I had no prior experience in CS before entering). While I've learned a lot from the program, I've been working full time while completing my coursework and feel that I still have a lot of work to do before I'm ready to actually enter the field. As a result, my employer is letting me work part time (2 days a week instead of 5) until I graduate.
 
Now, the majority of my coursework and coding has been done in Java. I feel comfortable with the language, but I also feel as though my hand has been held a lot of the way. My GPA is currently a 3.6 and I expect to bump it up with my remaining classes. That said, I want to find the best way to utilize my time before I graduate.
 
I spoke to my boss, and he said that they would be willing to let me work with our .NET developers the two days I am in until I graduate to get some experience. I'm very grateful about this as I think it could be a good opportunity. However, upon talking to our lead developer, he made it seem like it would be extremely difficult for me as I'm still very new, have minimal experience with C#, and no experience with .NET.
 
What would be the best route for me before November? I hate to turn down an opportunity to get some actual work experience, but if I'm just going to spend time struggling to learn .NET/C# instead of becoming a better overall programmer with Java, I feel like it might be a mistake. If I don't take this ""pseudo internship"" opportunity, I would spend my free time building up a few projects for a portfolio and basically try to build confidence.
 
TL;DR - graduating in November. Going to work part time instead of full time these remaining months. Would it be better for me to focus on and improve what I already know or get real world experience that could ultimately be a huge struggle with no payoff?"
8swnhp,2,2018-06-21,What do long hours usually mean? What do you recommend if I prefer a better quality of life?,Chieve,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8swnhp/what_do_long_hours_usually_mean_what_do_you/,"So i was thinking about applying to a new job. However I read on glass door it's high stress and long hours and that ""if you want a 9-5 job and be off 2 days a week, this isn't the job for you"" there is also no work from home policy.

I want a 9-5 job and weekend. I have no problem staying late or using my weekends but if this is a normal thing... I'm not sure. 

Apparently they reward hard work but I feel like that's forced on you if it's high stress with dead lines. Apparently the community is great too because the long hours make everyone ""like family"" so the culture is great

I am currently an intern in the city which is a 2.5 hour train ride one way. I actually love my job currently, and I will find out soon if it will become full time, but the only reason I'm leaving is due to the commute.

However where I intern, it's much more relaxed, so as long as I work hard and a problem comes up, I just have to communicate it to management. I can leave at 6 (I get in at 10) and I have my weekends. Also the culture here is great, I mean we all play games together and even sometimes play video games after work hours.

I work in NYC, so I feel like even though the commute sucks, I can still take advtange of the city (and arrive home late...) but it is 5 hours out of my day which means I have to wake up early get home late, and only have 2-3 hours to do what ever I want before I should go to sleep. Additionally most chores are held off until the weekend. Also I am allowed to work from home if I need or want. I mean we have several people who show up a few days every other week... But they live in California 

I also think my pay will be a few thousand dollars more if I just make my internship a full time job. 

What are your thoughts?

I love everything about the job, people, and culture except the commute. 

The thing with this other place that I may get a job is that the hours might suck... "
8swpyg,1,2018-06-21,Does GPA really matter?,gettingoverit6311,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8swpyg/does_gpa_really_matter/,"So I landed an internship with a midsize federal agency last summer at a 3.8 gpa. Don’t ask me how I just got a call one day with the offer. I’ve been with them for a year in two days but with a full time course load, a 5 year old and 32 hour work weeks I am in my second to last semester standing at a 3.45. Side note I’m a mom to a 5 y/o, yup had her when I was 16 don’t judge please. So it’s been pretty tough especially with mom guilt. 

With all the pressure to graduate from my job I stacked four courses this summer and will take my last four this fall. I hope to finish my B.S. in accounting in December. (I’m constantly asked when my graduation date is) But I just bombed my cost accounting summer course with my first C and am now concerned. I still have intermediate part 1, accounting information systems and finance to finish.  I’m aiming for Bs in all 3 but honestly at this point idk. 

They have a 3.0 or higher requirement but what if I don’t get converted to a full time employee at the end of the year. Will any accounting firms consider me? Any other federal agencies? Where did you and your 3.0 gpa end up at? Are you happy? How’s the pay? 

I’m just worried because there have been a lot of office politics lately. An intern graduated last October it took them 4-5 months to convert her and get her office hence she’s Asian. Another coworker graduated in may it hasn’t even been a month and all his conversation has gone through and he’s already in an office, and yes he’s white. My concern comes from the fact I am Hispanic and also a mom. They’ve let me bring my daughter to their bring your kid to work day and always ask me about her. But you just never know what if I don’t get the permanent position at the end. "
8swrha,359,2018-06-21,Pizza Boy Blues,goldvine_throwaway,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8swrha/pizza_boy_blues/,"No one gave me a heads up about that  house, or the jerkwho lived there before I moved in. Although to be fair, I probably would have moved in anyway. The rent was right, and the location was good. Still, it might have been nice to know. I think it was Shakespeare who said , “The good that we do is oft interred with our bones, but the prank phone calls that assholes make live after them.” Well, maybe not exactly, but something pretty close to that. 

I moved into the spacious house down on Old Bridge Road  a couple of months ago, on a cold April morning, and the first person I met was my next door neighbor, a man a few years older than me named Tony. 

“Cold morning, huh neighbor,” he said, and then he helpfully mimicked shivering to further drive the point home. We were standing on our respective porches and Tony was grinning at me, ruddy faced and bundled up head to foot in Land’s End and LL Bean gear. 

“Uh, yeah, sure is I guess.” For most of my adult life I’ve lived and worked in the city, and so the phenomenon of having a grown man come up to me and grin at me and just start talking was...novel. Novel and a little uncomfortable.

He stuck out his hand. I stared at it. 

“I’m Tony,” he said, “your new neighbor. Put ‘er there.” And so I did. 

The first sign I had that something a little fishy was going on in my new hood came a few weeks later. It was a little after midnight and I was up bingeing on The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt  when I heard the slightly irritating putter of a motor scooter go past my house for what I realized was the third or fourth time. I looked out my window, and saw a guy in a white denim jacket with something airbrushed in blue and pink on the back, wearing a big red helmet and scooting down the road past my house on a red scooter. He got to the end of the block, turned around, and scooted back the other way. 

I was sort of enthralled by the stupidity of it all, so I watched for a few minutes as he toodled to the end of the street, did a U-Turn, and went back the other way. Past a certain point, though, entertaining stupidity turns into Worrisome Behavior and I started to get concerned he might be some kind of creep, stalking a woman in the neighborhood or looking for a pet to steal or something. I had no reason to believe that whatever he was doing involved me. I don’t really have enemies--I’m the kind of dude who likes to binge watch Kimmy Schmidt at midnight. No angry former lovers. No current lovers. I just moved into the neighborhood so there haven’t been any disputes with the neighbors--Tony, for example, seemed to like me just fine. I was absolutely sure that whatever on God’s green earth was going on had nothing at all to do with me.

That was when the driver stopped right in front of my house, looked up and saw me in the window. He immediately dismounted his scooter, extended his right arm high in the air with his middle finger very theatrically raised, and flipped me off for a solid minute before remounting his scooter and puttering off into the vasty night.

“The fuck?” I thought. I shrugged. I did what anyone would do in my situation--finished up Season 2 of Kimmy Schmidt and went to bed.

A couple of weeks later, I heard the unmistakable, whiny, dismal drone of a scooter going back and forth outside my window again. This time I had just managed to doze off. After the first incident, I had been having a little trouble sleeping. Although I was enough of a grownup not to be unduly unnerved by the antics of someone who I assumed must be some kind of disconsolate jackass, I had been noticeably physically tenser around bedtime. I would spend a long time tossing and turning and clenching my jaws and grinding my teeth and alternating between feeling scared and foolish and angry. 

The whine of the little red scooter startled me awake.

I bustled over to my bedroom window and threw it open like Scrooge on Christmas morning,. I yelled out into the night,  “What do you want????” I had no sooner opened the window than the rider came to a stop at the curb in front of my house, dismounted his scooter, and looked up at me. Directly at me. There was now no room for doubt that this was deeply personal for him. 

He was wearing the same stupid white denim jacket and the same stupid helmet. He stood with his arms crossed like some kind of badass movie villain and stared up at my window through his visor.

“Oh! So now you’re home, huh asshole? Now you fuckin’ answer when someone has a delivery for you,” he yelled.

“What are you even talking about? What delivery, moron?”

I was vaguely aware that some lights had started to turn on up and down the street, including Tony’s bedroom light. I couldn’t count exactly how many people I was waking up making a splashy, late night scene with a schmuck on a scooter, and to be honest I  didn’t want to know. I just wanted this to be over.

“Pizza delivery, shitbird!” He yelled back and gestured to his scooter which I noticed, for the first time, was tricked out with a basket that was stacked with pizza boxes. One, two, three, four, five. Five boxes  I counted.

“I didn’t order any pizzas! You’re confused.” I clenched my jaw tight and choked back something about how he was possibly stupid, too; or insane.

“I’m not confused, you stupid asshole, and you’re gonna be sorry!”

“You’re deeply confused. I’m shutting my window. Go away.” I shut my window. He kept staring up. Same stupid denim jacket. Same stupid helmet. Was he going to flip me off again?

Of course he flipped me off again. He flipped me off and yelled something although I couldn’t hear what he was yelling because I had already turned an old Nirvana/Pixies playlist up on Spotify, and was hunting around for a Xanax so I could get back to sleep. This was all getting seriously out of hand.

The next morning, I realized just how out of hand it was getting when I took a step onto my front porch and stepped on a gooey, grease-soaked pizza box. To be more accurate, I stepped on a pile of five gooey, greasy, rotten smelling pizza boxes. My foot went through the soggy boxes and, before I was able to jerk it up, my left cappuccino colored Cole Haan loafer was slimy from pizza grease, melted cheese, and what I realized with immediate distaste was a generous helping of anchovies. The smell hit me so hard I almost puked up my chocolate peanut butter protein shake. “I’m gonna kill that little fucking jackass, whoever he is,” I yelled at no one in particular. 

Even though I wasn’t yelling at anybody in particular, someone answered. 

“Looks like you’re having a bit of trouble,” said Tony.

I looked at him. He frowned solicitously. My old pal Tony.

“Yes, Tony,” I said through gritted teeth, “I’m having a bit of trouble.”

“Yep,” he said. 

“Yep,” I agreed and nodded curtly and stepped back inside to change my shoes and my pants.

Work sucked. I was wearing my second favorite pair of shoes and wrinkled khakis and I was convinced that the noisome grease-and-stinkfish concoction had somehow permeated my clothes and clung to me after I changed. This made social interactions awkward and I realized, as I walked past two of our interns and they wrinkled their noses and whispered something to each other and giggled that my mantra of “It’s all in your head, bro” just wasn’t reassuring me anymore. 

At a few minutes before 3 in the afternoon I suddenly felt weak in the legs and clammy. A convulsive mix of anxiety, embarrassment, and the phantom stench drove me into the bathroom where I puked up the Trader Joe’s Banh Mi bowl I’d eaten for lunch. When I said I was going home a little early I don’t think I was imagining the relief on the faces of everyone in our small, poorly ventilated office.

At about 6, there was a knock on my door.

I was upstairs at the time, sipping ginger ale and languidly scrolling through Facebook. I’d made the mistake of making several posts about my mysterious nocturnal pizza boy tormentor, and was now in the position of having to deal with lighthearted jibes from asshole friends, one of whom had dubbed my new bete noir “Ghostrider” and kept asking me when we could expect the big reveal where he yanked off his scooter helmet and revealed a flaming, shrieking skull beneath. The jokes had been mildly amusing at first, but I wasn’t in a laughing mood anymore.

So there was this knock on my door.

I felt my jaw tense up. I felt the muscles in my arms go hard. I”m a mild mannered guy but I keep in shape and I wasn’t scared of some skinny little dipshit in a spray painted denim jacket--I’d played high school lacrosse! I grabbed the first weapon I saw, which was a green and blue plaid umbrella from the umbrella stand in the corner of my bedroom. I rammed it against the palm of my hand like it was a club. I muttered, “Alright, motherfucker” and stormed down my steps and flung open my front door and came within a split second of braining Tony with my umbrella. 

Tony was holding a bottle of Bulleit bourbon and looked apologetic.

“I think maybe I should tell you something about the guy who used to live here,” he said, “because I think the kid who keeps bothering you might actually be looking for him and not you.”

I shrugged. I nodded. I invited him in.

I got us two tumblers and Tony poured the drinks. And then Tony told me the tale of Trevor Fitzgerald. 

“Trevor Fitzgerald, to paraphrase the Big Lebowski,” Tony began, “was almost certainly the biggest asshole to ever live in this particular burb; which places him high on the list of biggest assholes worldwide.”

Trevor Fitzgerald had been an abrasive, pompous-yet-crass  young lawyer who had moved in on a freezing cold day in December or January and quickly become the scourge of the neighborhood. Trevor found myriad ways--both grand and petty--to torment his neighbors. He revved the already loud engine of his jet black Porsche Cayenne (vanity plate:LAWGOD”) much too loudly and for for much too long at every opportunity. He threatened to sue neighbors who didn’t keep their lawns acceptably pristine. Despite being a (very) single man, and an avowed New Atheist, he put up such an enormous, garish, and overly illuminated Santa Claus around Christmas time that his neighbors had to threaten HIM with legal action. He said he “Just thought it was funny to bust balls a little.”

But the relevant Trevor Fitzgerald story, the “salient point” as T Fitzgerald Esquire himself might have put it, was the time he got the pizza boy killed.

Apparently, and unsurprisingly, one of Trevor’s great passions in life was fucking with people by making prank phone calls. For example, he once “swatted” (got the SWAT team to show up at the house of) some other young executive-level asshole two suburbs over who had pissed him off in his Call of Duty campaign. Late one night, a clearly besotted Trevor had spent almost 30 minutes regaling an increasingly nervous, clammily uncomfortable Tony with \*that\* story. 

“Every time that son of a bitch talked to me, I needed a shower right after,” Tony said.

The worst thing Trevor did, though, was get a pizza boy killed. 

On a dark and stormy night, Trevor had pranked another online gaming bro by sending him five large anchovy pizzas. This other guy, from what Tony could piece together, had been bragging all week during their gaming sessions about this woman he was going to be banging and so Trevor, being a real sweetheart, decided to fuck with him a little in the pettiest, laziest, least original way possible. 

Trevor gave very specific instructions to the order taker, saying “Look, I’m a little hard of hearing and I’ve had issues getting pizzas before so please, please, make as much of a racquet as you need to and do NOT stop until I open the door, okay?” The order taker took all of this in good faith and gave the delivery boy the instructions before he left. 

Anthony said, “So this poor kid, Charles I think? Or Chuck? Something like that. He gets on his scooter and he toodles over to this guy’s condo and he rings the bell and doesn’t get an answer. So then he yells ‘Hey I got your pizza!’ and maybe hears like a muffled voice telling him to go away or something. But he thinks this guy is hard of hearing and really wants his pizza so he leans on the doorbell. Understand that this whole story is just Trevor hypothesizing to me later about how it might have gone down. And as he’s telling me this story about how he imagines the kid’s delivery went, he’s laughing so hard he’s about to cry, even though he knows the kid ended up dying. I could have punched him right in the goddamn mouth.”

“I don’t understand how the prank got him killed though? Did the guy shoot him or something, mistake him for an intruder?”

“I’m getting to that. So finally the guy comes to the door, and this is the part Trevor thinks is funniest because his coitus had just gotten interrupted and so he’s obviously horny and sweaty and furious. Calls the kid every name in the book, tells him he got pranked and to get the fuck out.

But see the kid’s pizza parlor has a policy that if you don’t get paid for your pizzas you’re in deep shit. Pizza delivery is a shitty way to make a living--I should know, it’s how I made beer money in college. So the poor kid tries to hold his ground. Says \*somebody\* is gonna have to pay him for the pizza. So that’s when it dawns on this horny asshole who must have pranked him in the first place, and so he gives the kid Trevor’s name and address and says ‘If anyone owes you money, it’s that cuck,’ and slams the door on him. The rest you can probably guess.”

“It’s a stormy night,” I said, “so the kid is trying to ride his scooter in the driving rain way across town and he’s pissed off, probably super amped up, and somehow or another he gets killed right?”

“Slides off the road in the rain, falls down a steep embankment, lands wrong and breaks his neck. It’s actually pretty hard to kill yourself in a scooter accident. I’d have to say Charles or Chuck or whatever was a pretty unlucky young man.”

“Yeah,” I said. “So maybe he has a brother or a friend or something who still thinks Trevor lives here?”

“That’s my guess. Maybe if you can find some way to safely get the kid who is doing this to come look at your ID or something, prove you’re not Trevor?”

“It’s worth a shot. This is getting out of hand.”

“Yeah well. You seem like a good guy. Good luck to you. This is some creepy bullshit, my friend.”

We polished off our drinks and I locked the door behind Anthony.

========

I had uneasy dreams that night. The same dream, more or less, several times and each time I woke up sweaty and clutching at my sheets and screaming. In the dream, I was a schmucky pizza delivery guy named Chuck. “Schmucky Chucky,” was how the other characters in the dream referred to me. I had a little red scooter and hair that wouldn’t quite stay out of my eyes and I wore this godawful white denim  jacket that I thought was fleek as fuck. I got dispatched with five anchovy pizzas on what turned out to be a crank call, and then, as I was driving furiously to go get my money from the prick who made the prank call I lost control of my silly red scooter in the rain and I felt myself falling off the wet scooter seat and tumbling down the cold, wet embankment and I could feel every piece of broken glass and every piece of gravel until I woke up in a cold sweat. 

Halfway through take four of my dream sequence, right as I was pulling my little red scooter out into the street to go get my money from the son of a bitch who had placed the prank call, I heard a furious pounding on my front door.

“HEY WAKE UP SOMEONE OWES ME MONEY FOR FIVE GODDAMN STINKING ANCHOVY PIZZAS AND I’M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT IT.”

I sat bolt upright in bed, a clammy, sweaty mess. I ran my hands through my hair. 

“HEY TREVOR OPEN THE DOOR MAN. BE A MAN AND COME TO YOUR DOOR AND GIVE ME MY MONEY.”

I had a sudden, ghastly realization: a kid like Chucky (and his name WAS Chucky, I was sure of it now, Schmucky Chucky) wouldn’t have anyone in his life who was devoted enough to get vengeance for him from beyond the grave. Probably plenty of people missed him, a few people cried, but nobody was going to don the delivery boy’s uniform and search for justice for him.

The last thing in the world I wanted to do was go open the door, because I suddenly knew what I was going to find there. But I wanted this to end. More than that, I wanted that poor sad-sack to be able to find some peace, if that was possible. So I shrugged. I forced myself to stand up. I made my legs carry me over to my dresser, where I willed trembling hands to pick up my wallet. And then I made the trip down the stairs and to my front door where Chuck was still howling threats and imprecations.

I was pretty glad I’d stopped by the ATM earlier in the week, because if at all possible I wanted to give that poor bastard his money.

I took a deep breath and threw my front door open. I noticed that a driving rain was falling, and that all the streetlights had gone out rendering the night outside my front door a bright black void. I saw a white denim jacket with a Chinese dragon airbrushed on it, but the jacket had seen better days. It was torn and ripped and burnt and through the tears I could see patches of abraded, necrotizing flesh drooping off of bones that jutted and angled in weird directions because they were broken. Chuck’s head was hanging straight down and to the left. He was shivering. His helmet was off. I dreaded what I’d see when he turned around.

“Chuck…” I said softly but that was all I got out before he spun around and drove a scalding hot pizza that smelled of stale grease and rotten fish right into my face. It was like one of those scenes out of an old movie where the lovable rascal hits the pompous douchebag in the face with a pie--only this was a garbage pie and the “lovable rascal” was a bloodthirsty revenant.

“YOU OWE ME 77 dollars and 18 cents ASSHOLE plus I want a TIP for once.”

The shambling, reanimated remains of Schmucky Chucky were incredibly strong. Between the smell of his rotting flesh and the stench of the grease and fish I was struggling not to get sick when he tossed me casually to the ground and jumped on top of me, pinning my shoulders down with his bony, jagged knees.

“I’m not Trevor I’m not Trevor,” I was yelling, spitting out pizza grease and rancid cheese between syllables.

The cheese was dripping on my face, burning and blinding me, and I could barely get my hands up high enough to claw it desperately off my face, away from my nose and eyes. 

“Bullshit! I’m sick of being fooled, bro. I don’t give a shit who you are, all I know is I need my fucking money before I can go back. I’m not gonna have the old man who owns the place yell at me again because our stupid incompetent fucking Debbie answering the phone let herself get pranked….”

“I”ll pay but you have to let me get my wallet.”

“No more tricks,” he yelled, punching down hard and hitting me right in the middle of the chest. I felt the breath swoosh out of my lungs and saw stars. For several seconds I couldn’t talk, couldn’t catch my breath.

“Not so much to say now, huh,” he said, eyeing my kitchen. I saw his eyes fixate on my knife rack. Both eyes were grotesquely bloodshot and his right eye was mostly drooping by its stalk down from the socket, but he seemed to see just fine and a big, goofy grin played upon his face when he saw my big, black handled butcher knife. The grin was almost endearing. But I knew there was nothing endearing about Chuck’s plans for me.

Flesh dropped down from his face like melted cheese as he grinned at me. 

He shoved off from on top of me, kicked me once hard in the ribs, and then as I doubled over, still breathless, he staggered toward my kitchen. I felt close to blacking out, and had to gasp in several harsh lungs full of breath just to try to yell at him. What came out was a hoarse, raspy whisper, “Hey Chuck, here’s my wallet.” I took the wallet I’d grabbed from my dresser and threw it feebly between his feet.

He glared down at it dubiously.

“Open it up. Take what you need,” I wheezed, “I wanna make it right.”

He reached down. “There’d better be enough money in here for 5 16 inch pies AND A TIP,” he bellowed and I realized, with a gut wrenching spasm, that his blood and guts were dripping onto my kitchen floor now as his body decomposed in front of me.

Chucky opened the wallet, and took out 4 20 dollar bills and a 10. “I’m taking a fucking 13 dollar tip, asshole, for all the aggravation you caused me.”

“Take it. Just leave me alone.”

Then he looked down at my driver’s license, surprised, and remarked, “Hey, you’re not Trevor. You’re just some guy. Well fuck you, I’m taking the money anyway. Somebody’s gotta pay for these pizzas so I can rest.” 

“Sure,” I wheezed, “okay that’s fine. I wanna be fair to you.”

“Yeah, fair’s fair,” he muttered, cramming the money into his jacket pocket. He looked with some measure of disgust at the pizza pie congealing on the floor next to me, and then out the door toward his scooter. 

“Hey, uh, I have to be honest bro it took me a minute or two to get all the way over here and I’m not too sure those pizzas are so good anymore. You don’t really want them do you?”

“Nah,” I said, “I just want you to get what’s fair for you and for us both to move on.”

“Yeah that’s cool,” he said, “that’s cool.” His voice was getting weaker and the skin on his face was beginning to droop like the cheese on top of a hot slice of pizza being pulled from a pie. I was in a pretty big hurry for him to leave.

By now most of whatever energy was animating him seemed to have drained from his body, and he ambled to the door much more slowly than he had burst in. Finally he was out on my porch and I shut the door behind him with a sigh of relief. I heard him sigh, too, and a few minutes later when I finally heard his dumb little scooter start up for the last time I cleaned up the pizza on my floor and went to bed."

Also, I have some previous coding experience with C, so this isn't *too* foreign to me.

for my internship, I'm analyzing OT data for the previous year across every shift and position. The goal is to justify making staffing changes within departments to reduce OT wage with a full time position at straight time.

Currently the staffing data has the date, shift, hours, position, name of the person, and if the OT was mandatory. I have almost 15,000 rows of information, so trying to analyze this by hand would be absurd. That's why I'm posting this. 

I'd like this program or script or whatever you want to call it to look at the data and show savings if we add a forklift driver on 2nd shift, based off of what days we needed an OT shift. I'm lost at how I could do this, and what I would do when a shift didn't need OT and how that should be formatted.

Any ideas are appreciated. I'd be happy with links to helpful sites or videos and anything else you think would be helpful. ALSO I'm using Excel 2010 because companies are so quick to change, if that matters. 

Thanks!"
8sx2kh,34,2018-06-21,The new intern is trying to have me fired,moonbabyandy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8sx2kh/the_new_intern_is_trying_to_have_me_fired/,"I'm only posting here because my job insisted I get some help. I think they meant in the form of therapy, but I'd like to be received in a place where I won't be dismissed due to a perceived disconnect from reality.

I do not enjoy physical touch or intimacy in any capacity, which is why meeting Joseph was such a bizarre experience for me. He was the newest intern at the company I worked at. The company at which I had, in fact, just recently been an intern. He ran up to me flustered, frantically wiping the sweat pressed hair from his forehead and extending it absent mindedly to grip my forearm. To feel his touch against my skin the first time we met nearly sent me into a spiral. As his fingers made his way down my arm, all I could think of was millions of bacteria swimming through the canyons of his fingerprints. His too-friendly smile illuminated years of cigarette stains in the rivets of his teeth as he confidently sputtered out his first words to me.

""Hi, I'm Joseph, here to fulfill *all* of your needs.""

It was the type of thing you could tell he had been mulling over since the night before -- a greeting he spent hours rehearsing that could only be delivered  by someone who had spent years sheltered by suburbia with no concept of boundaries. Even though he had the bravado of a fresh trust fund college grad, everything about him seemed dirty. The entire moment was uncomfortable and corny.  He hesitated, then winced as he registered the energy buzzing throughout my body.

""Oh, you don't like that very much, do you?"" he said with a sickly smile with which I've grown all too familiar.

Days later, I began developing a light rash on parts of my skin that Joseph came into contact with. And again every day after, until my coworkers began cracking jokes about how I resembled a blanched tomato and needed to remember sunscreen when I went outside during the day. Dozens of sloppy pink fingerprints decorated my skin and began to peel and flake over time. The more space I shared with Joseph, the more my body became a landscape of wilted rose petals. I caught him constantly glimpsing at me through my office window, staring just until someone else might see him. Always with that hungry smile splayed across his face. It seemed as though everyday he became a little dirtier -- nails that had become a solid yellow-brown color crowned by a crescent of black, hair now permanently stuck to his cratered forehead -- which only exacerbated my resentment of what he was doing to my body. I continuously asked him for space, only for him to return with some new excuse to be near me. He got away with it because my discomfort around him was equal to the love he received from my other co-workers.

As weeks passed, Joey would slide into my office as others took their lunch breaks to tell me how beautiful I am. He would chide me for my obvious discomfort and constantly reassure me that I should not be afraid of him, and that he was only there to help. He started bringing me flowers, first ones picked from the decorative peony shrubs surrounding our building, then large bouquets of them. Then gifts became eerily specific, each with a casually creepy response as to how he knew I needed it. 
""*I got you this glasses repair kit*,"" he beamed on the day I came to work with contacts because I'd broken a screw on my glasses when waking up.
""*You seemed like you were stressed about something,*"" smiling as he slid me a bottle of perfume I had been trying to find in town for a month.
""*It smelled like it was time,*"" he whispered with a smile more ravenous than ever before as he slid me a box of tampons on the first day of my cycle. The exact brand and size I used. I could no longer stand to be around him. I felt more like a hunted animal with every interaction. So, I did what hunted animals do. I hid.

I spent six extra hours a night toiling away on a contract for one of biggest clients because the after hours at our office were the only time I feel comfortable enough to do so. Everyone in the office thought I was being mean to Joseph. They kept telling me how rude and ridiculous it was that I was blaming him for the condition of my skin and how humiliating it would be to point out his dirtiness as I did not know his circumstances. They called me prudish for my reluctance to accept his flirting and ungrateful for his gifts. I spoke to my supervisor about asking Joseph to give me space, detailing the ways in which he has made me uncomfortable and my worsening skin condition from his unwanted touches. About the oddly specific gifts I was receiving. She informed me that Joseph had, in fact, already contacted her after hearing rumors of me mocking his hygiene, brushing off the last gift as coincidental vengeance for my mockery of him. She said he would no longer be working on projects with me in a tone that let me know she believed this was my fault, suggesting I get counseling for the brash way in which I was acting. She insisted I take my vacation leave now to clear my head and take care of my mental health. 

I had successfully evaded him for one week. After just a few days, the blemishes on my skin began to diminish. By the end of the week, however, my skin was fully clear with only the first four trails of fingertips he had first contacted me with remaining. I wish I could say I was relieved but they had created an extremely delicate veinous system between them. I'd gone to Urgent Care who were unable to diagnose my sypmtoms and referred me to a dermatologist. 

This morning we had a staff meeting at work that I was required to go to regardless of being on vacation. I dreaded seeing Joseph after everything that had happened, but I went anyway. As I entered the conference room I scanned faces only to find my nightmare absent. The meeting passed normally but I continued to feel my lower abdomen itch and burn throughout the time spent in that room without him. As soon as it was over, I rushed to the bathroom. What I found as I lowered my pants made me nearly crash to the ground. Across my stomach, just where my lower abdomen and pelvis bone met, lay an expanse of flaking, pink skin clearly in the shape of an arm and hand. the thumbprint came to rest just below my navel, as though someone had been cradling my hips. I do not remember much besides screaming and then being pulled through the front doors of the office on a stretcher. I could see the gossip in people's mouths forming, something that may have bothered me were it not for the haunting familiar face smiling in the background. A sight which made me once again lose consciousness. 

I have spent one night in the hospital so far. They are looking at my skin symptoms but I can also hear the attendees speaking in hushed tones of a possible psych hold as I fade in and out of sleep. Next to me are a few gifts, mostly candies and small balloons, but hidden amongst them in a small, shot glass sized vase is one peony soft pink. Beside them is a small note written on gold edged stationary which is actually quite beautiful, stamped with some symbol of a peony on fire.

""*I'll find you, always. -J*""

My heart is sinking. I'm not sure what this man has done to my body or how he seemingly knows intimidate details of my life but I'm terrified. Someone please help me.

I'm a recent high school graduate and I plan on studying CS at a highly ranked university. Only problem is that I'm not sure what to be doing right now...CS seems overwhelming in terms of things to be learned/done. Not to mention it's considered the most competitive major at the school I'm going to and I really don't want to get drowned out by the competition.  I'm hoping to get some direction and advice on sources I should be learning from so I can (hopefully) land an internship or have a significant project completed by the end of my freshman year.

For reference I have a solid foundation in C++ and Java. The big thing I keep on seeing from most posts is working on ""personal projects"". I assume these come in the form of mobile apps/websites/games, but....I have no idea where to start? Should I focus on doing more online coursework or learning new material or should I be starting now? Are there tutorials online on how to get some direction when it comes to making a project? Any recommended books or websites for learning android? Should I be learning SQL? 

I know I have a lot of questions....but I'm really motivated to learn a lot this Summer and just want to get as much advice as I can. Thanks :D"

He also explain to me how obtaining a hardware job is super competitive compared to software. This made me ponder with anxiety about switching my degree into Computer Science or not, frankly the idea holds me back that I'm pretty far in my degree and I'm not sure if financial aid will support me if I prolong my graduation if I were to take this option. I would like to know anybody here that has a Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering that struggle to find jobs or not.

While I don't have professional development experience, I'm thinking very seriously about dropping my job, devoting myself to about 6-8 weeks of full time study to get up to a professional level, and then begin applying for entry level web development jobs or internships. Is this remotely realistic, or will employers not even consider me without some kind of development experience first?

Some background : I'm a 25 year old CS grad who's worked for a fairly well known web development company in the greater NYC area as a project manager for the past 6 months. I'm very underpaid, making less than 40k a year. With that said, my job is simple - I'm not a scrum master  - I mostly funnction as gatekeeper of emails between the client and the developers. It's a role I'm  exceedingly unhappy in, but it's still the most valuable thing on my resume, with the next best thing ive got on there being 6 months at a Barnes and Noble as a cashier (as you can see, my credentials are not very marketable). All of the development work at my company is done overseas, so there's no programming or techincal role for me here to transition into.

I graduated with a BA in Comp Sci one year ago and have no internships or major projects to my name. I'm afraid I walked away with my degree being very well versed in CS theory but having very little practical programming experience or skill. I've written very simple programs for homework assignments, but I'm simply not prepared to work at a professional level as a developer yet. Clearly, I need to be studying and developing my skill set in my free time. Unfortunately,  with my full time commitment as a PM, along with 2.5 hours of round trip commute every day,  my typical work day has me leaving home at 8am and returning at 7pm. I can't afford to move closer, due to the aforementioned shit salary and the exorbitant rental prices native to the NYC area.


Thanks for reading."

8sz0cs,9,2018-06-22,Mixed Feelings,rajeshPateljr,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/8sz0cs/mixed_feelings/,"Okay, this is a bit of a complicated emotional rollercoaster, and I may not be able to do it justice by writing about it, but I will try my best. My whole life, I've had mixed feelings about my parents. They say they made a lot of sacrifices for me, and I've seen it first hand. My dad spent a lot of time helping me study. He was there to help me with my studies and he tried his best. My mom was also very motherly, and I suppose she tried to be a good mother by being there at home.

While this is all good, the problem is that they make me feel like shit. Emotionally. Ever since high school they have banked everything on me. And I'll be honest, I really tried my best. I can't say I'm the smartest in the bunch, but I did my best in the hopes of making them proud. It was around senior year that things got a bit sour. While I was applying to college, I wanted to go into economics or political science since I eventually wanted to be a lawyer. But I also had my parent's dreams to worry about. They always scared me, telling me that I won't get anywhere if I go down that route. Eventually they made me pick pre-med, and I wrote my essays without any direction. 

Fast forward a bit, I ended up getting into UCSD. I was ecstatic since UCSD was a great school, but my parents were disappointed. My dad constantly reminded me that I somehow failed. I eventually convinced myself that I did fail, and it sucked. I felt like my whole life I tried to make them proud, but hearing my dad say I failed really stung.

Once I went to college, I tried to figure my life out. It was nice since I didn't have to live in the shadow of my parents. I realized that I somehow missed appreciating life. I know it sounds weird, but up until then I didn't really think about how great life was without people telling me I failed. In college, when I'm away from my parents, I somehow feel relaxed. Its like I can take life one step at a time. 

My problem now is that every time I come home, I feel scared and stressed. It has been 2 years and I don't call me a failure anymore, but my parents always have something to complain about. For example, I started working out and I gained a bit of weight since I started to add meat to my diet. I thought I looked fit, but the second I came home my parents called me ugly and unhealthy because I gained weight. They tell me that I'm immature and that I failed by not getting an internship and so on. The criticism, to some degree, is motivating since I start to prepare for interviews and stuff, but a majority of the times it just stings. Now, I don't know whether to appreciate the sacrifices they made for my academics and dislike them for how they treat me. They say they do it out of love, and tbh they don't show love in a western way. Its their weird asian love, but it is wrapped in so much criticism that I can't fucking find it. Are my parents toxic or are they just normal asian parents? They do a lot for me and I owe them a lot, but idk. I just hate feeling like shit, you know. And beyond them, I don't really have anyone that care about me. I don't have many friends so if I left my parents I would be all alone. Idk if I can be all alone. I'm not sure if life would feel better because of it. This was really just me putting my thoughts on paper. It wasn't mean't to be coherent. Just needed to find a community I could belong in. :)"

I'm an intern this summer. During the day, when I'm at the internship, I'm stressed; at night, when I'm home, I'm depressed. It's worse than being at school, because there I get to be *just* stressed, but here I go through this jarring transition every day.

Not sure what to do now. I quit seeing my therapist because she accused me of not wanting to see her (I didn't mind until she asked me for the 20th time). My psychiatrist thinks I should try thinking positive thoughts. I can't seem to find a good steady solution. It's become a habit to think about all the different ways I could bite it. It's only a fantasy because my parents would never get over my death. I just want to be happy, or more accurately, to stop feeling terrible."

I was wondering if any of the redditors here could provide any insight and advice to help me navigate this process of finding my first job post graduation.

**RELEVANT INFO ABOUT ME:**

* Graduated from a university ranked in the top 10 nationally among public universities
* GPA: 3.04 (far from stellar, but not dismal either)
* Area of Specialization: Machine Learning and Control Systems
* Internship Experience: None in college, some high profile internships in high school
* Projects: Not much in the way of extracurriculars, but a handful of interesting class-related projects, worthy of mention in an interview, etc.
* Low income, first generation college student
* Have held an on campus job to help pay for school and living expenses for the past 3 years. I can continue working at this job until September at which point I will be let go because I am no longer enrolled in the university. Basically, I have until September to find a job or else I am homeless.
* I have not yet sent out many job applications as I have been primarily focused on just graduating. Was planning on sending out a lot over the summer, but then this offer sort of fell in my lap.

I've always wanted to work developing cutting edge technology or in applying said technology in challenging environments. In the past, I've been especially drawn to robotics (ROVs, AUVs, UAVs, etc), but I have found that without an M.S. or extensive experience, it is difficult to break into that field.

**RELEVANT INFO ABOUT THE POSITION:**

I have sent an email requesting additional information about the benefits package and will likely update this section as that information becomes available.

* Initial Contact: Recruiter message via LinkedIn
* Company: large and well established
* Position: Graduate Field Service Engineer
* Position Description: Up to 90&amp;#37; travel for the first year to different corporate offices for training in various aspects of engineering operations. After training, based in one location with less travel working primarily on the electrical control, power generation, and propulsion systems of naval and marine vessels.
* Base Pay: \~$65k
* Signing Bonus: $5k
* Health Benefits: Good, but not exceptional
* Retirement Benefits: Match 50% of first 8% contributed to 401k + Company Retirement Savings Acct
* Vacation: Flexible PTO

**KEY CONCERNS/QUESTIONS:**

* Much of this job seems like technician work rather than engineering work. No one appears to be developing cutting edge technology or applying technology in super ground-breaking ways. That being said, I like the hands-on aspect of this job.
   * Will my core analytical/engineering skills atrophy from disuse in this position?
   * Will the skills developed at this job be easily transferable to a more design-oriented position?Will other companies who are hiring design engineers see the value in this position and the experience gained from it?
   * Or will accepting this position greatly limit my career advancement opportunities outside of field/service roles?
* This job requires extensive travel in the first year.
   * For those who have been in similar positions, did you continuing paying rent for an apartment that you were rarely staying in? Did the company provide corporate housing or cover hotel expenses this whole time? I am considering just putting most of my stuff in storage and living out of hotels or whatever housing is provided (if any, TBD).
* I live in a fairly expensive city in CA and will continue to be based here after the training period. I've been told to always try and negotiate a salary up after an offer is made.
   * Is this salary fair or competitive given the cost of living in my area, the position requirements, and my qualifications?
   * How much room do you think I have to negotiate? If I wanted $70k, what strategies would you suggest to achieve that? What initial counter-offer should I make?
* Would you suggest accepting this offer and the financial security that comes with it now or would you suggest making the gamble that I can find a better position? On the one hand, I am trying to avoid homelessness (3 months away), but on the other hand want to make a smart decision for personal fulfillment and career advancement.
* How bad would it be if I continued to send out applications and did job interviews after accepting this offer?

If any of you have any questions for me, feel free to ask. If you reply, could you include your first job's title and starting salary (in 2018 USD) so I have a basis for comparison.Thank you in advance for any help you can provide!  "

Just finished 1st year of university and I've had a back-end developer internship meanwhile I built some apps as a contractor. Do I focus on cracking the code interview for the big 5 or do I focus other companies, maybe startups?

I don't have as much depth regarding algorithms and data structures as other cs students so for interviews with tricky questions related to graphs, trees, maps, &lt;insert here name&gt; algorithm I would probably have to prepare much harder than others as I've spent my time rather building stuff, playing with databases, web servers, frameworks...a more practical approach to programming so to say.

For some obvious reason, I would feel successful if I would land an internship/placement at a big company, but I have this idea in my head that I wouldn't stay there for long, I would either quit and join a startup, build a startup or just do things to challenge me and let me take the initiative in more aspects.

But, what do I know? Maybe I'll like it there and this urge to do interesting stuff, join startups, build my own SaaS and so will dissappear

I know ds and algorithms are important for anything I would do, but I feel like if I attempted the interviews at big 5, it would be more about preparing specifically for those interviews than learning a bit more about ds/ algorithms.

I have to do statistics for pull out tests and I was so far able to read the excel files into a dictionary and iterate over the keys to plot them by values I defined. Now it gets a bit tricky for me because the only programming knowledge I had before was matlab in college and a bit of c# during an internship. My goal is the following:



We have a dictionary with keys named like: T01, T02, etc. (Testobject 01, Testobject 02, etc.) with the values in columns „seconds“, „milimeter“, „Newton“, „Unnamed: 3“. 




Unnamed: 3 is the number of the cycles corresponding to the other values. It has no unit so I suppose python wasn‘t sure what to do with it. So in „Unnamed: 3“ it looks like: 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,3, 3, 3,....



Now I want to pick out the Newton-Millimeter-Pair according to the cycle number to plot it. I was thinking to use the Key name (like T01) for a new variable and write into T01 the pairs. It would optimally be like this:  I define the number of cycle I want to use: e.g 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and use these to pick out the corresponding Newton-Millimeter-Cycle-Triple. So I then have, if I have 3 Testobjects, 3 different variables named T01 T02 T03 with mm(cycle), N (cycle), cyclenumber as the values. 




I‘ve been looking through a lot of posts on the internet and I‘ve tried around a lot but it feels like I‘m just missing some syntax for the problem."

I'm a rising sophomore who just decided to switch their major from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science. As it stands, I'm very interested in learning about Computer Science but it seems like I'm far behind my peers in terms of  knowledge and experience. Nevertheless, I'm really interested in pursuing a tech internship for next summer. The majority of students in my class are competitive for internships (the CS program is in the top 20 in the country), but it seems like I won't have enough knowledge or experience by then to be competitive if I don't learn anything on my own. I've taken some intro CS classes, but I don't have any projects or a depth of experience in any specific language. On the track that I am on, I'm only going to be able to take the class on Data Structures and Algorithms by the spring semester, and this will be a bit late to apply to internships and interview. What do I have to teach myself in order to be competitive for internships next summer? Would it even be possible for me to get an internship, or should I just focus on building my skills and projects and apply for better opportunities my junior year?"

8t1r6k,17,2018-06-22,Social axiety / depression sob story. Very boring - proceed with caution.,buis_kid21,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/8t1r6k/social_axiety_depression_sob_story_very_boring/,"So for as long as I can remember I have had pretty bad social anxiety. Back in highschool it was bad enough that I was sort of the weird kid, but I was still open enough that I was friends with almost everybody from my year. Nobody really had any problem with me but they all knew I would flair up if I was called upon in class for example. Fast forward 6 years and I am now 24 years old and in the worst state of my entire life. I could not tell you exactly when or how things have gotten to this point but I will tell you where I am.

A short time after I finished highschool my depression became progressively worse and so did my social anxiety. I decided to stop using social media completely (at the time this was pretty much just facebook) because I guess I was feeling overwhelmed socially - idk but I wanted to cut myself off from the world completely, or drop off the radar so to speak. I certainly succeeded because I have not had contact with anybody that I have gone to school with - EVER. I have been to two seperate universities not to mention highschool and I am not in contact with anyone I met these places. Safe to say now that I am trying to get out and meet new people, this has been the single biggest mistake of my life given my age. Social media has also developed significantly since 2012 and I don't use snapchat, Instagram or anything else. I have 350 friends on Facebook, all of which were added prior to 2012. I don't know why but I am completely petrified of social media. Its also the subject of quite a lot of akward exchanges when I tell people no, I dont have snapchat or instagram. Also when they ask me for my facebook profile I just say I dont have one. If they then look me up they will see that I dont have a profile pictire and that my profile says I am a woman with 3 kids (from when it was hacked back in highschool).

My anxiety in social situations has also never been worse and I feel uncomfortable in not almost every situation but literally every situation. I do everything in my power to avoid conversation. When I walk around town for example I will stare into my phone even though I am not doing anything productive, just so that I dont have to look up and make eye contact with all the random people on the street. I have even pretended to be on the phone in some instances where I am trying to avoid a certain situation (sounds really dumb I know but its true). I don't even like to look my own parents and relatives in the eye when I talk to them - I kid you not. When I meet people I can see in their face from a mile away that they feel uncomfortable when talking to me. Worse even I feel like some people look at me like there is something off - like they don't completely trust me. I genuinely think my negative mental state has been stained my apperance and the expression of my eyes to the point where I never look genuine in conversation because I am always acting to some degree (unless I am trying to look depressed then it kinda comes naturally).

I currently have 1 month left of an internship that I landed while taking a gap year. I have been here almost a year and I don't know how I lasted this long (its actually because there is a contract). The boss absolutely hates me at this point and so do my co-workers. I try my upmost best to seem happy and be nice but its just not enough when I am unaprochable and just all over the place. I think they are accepting my presence at this point but they try to stay away from me as much as possible. Literally I can go the whole day without anyone making conversation with me. It actually doesn't make me sad so much as it makes me mad because I try to think of it from their perspective. I am quite a bit younger than them and they are all women with the exception of the boss. If they can see I dont talk much they might try to make a little converation, I know I would if I was in their position. But they dont. They only talk with each other and have the time of their lives while I sit in solitude. I think its rude but at the same time I know I brought this all on myself. They obviously think I am super weird which is understandable. The thing is, they are genuinely quite nice people (the boss especially) but I think they have just reached the end of their good will.

Sort of ended this abruptly but thats all I am going to write on my little sob story before it gets too long and boring. Am I not the most disconnected 24 yo human being on planet earth? :,D \*laughing and crying\*"

8t27pj,9,2018-06-22,Taking a gap year and affording college (US)?,poopchute32,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8t27pj/taking_a_gap_year_and_affording_college_us/,"**TL:DR:** Is taking a gap year actually more affordable option to getting my degree in graphic design. **(You could probably answer me by just reading the bold text.)**

I'm a rising senior in high school and I'm realizing that college may be less affordable for me than I've always thought. I've considered taking a gap year work and build up some savings, but I fear that not going directly off to college would make it harder to be accepted into school and/or get scholarships. **First let me list out aspects of my current situation for context:**

* **current gpa:** 3.93
* **current ACT:** 31, 33 superscore (without studying, so I'm hoping to retake to at least a 33 with some prep)
* **state of residence:** Alabama, looking to move to east coast (NYC and surrounding areas)
* **extracurriculars:** choir freshman year; band sophomore year; recycling club (volunteer hours + officer), environmental science/gardening club (potential to be and officer next year), and endangered species club.
   * all done for only one year (switched schools), but i plan to keep up my junior year activities next year
* **intended majors:** graphic/web design, creative marketing
* **finances:** my parents make over 100k, but are terrible with spending.
   * They have practically no savings, esp no college fund.
   * Likelihood of getting need based aid is low.
   * I can't work this summer because dad is injured, and my school doesn't allow me to work during the school year (public boarding school).
* **my top 7 schools:** 
   * State University of New York: New Paltz, Purchase College, or Fashion Institute of Technology
   * City University of New York: Queens College
   * Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU Arts)
   * Savannah College of Art and Design (in Georgia)
   * University of Montevallo (in-state), $19,000/yr or $76,000/4 yrs net price
   * all out-of state schools showed a calculated net price of about $35,000/year or $140,000/4 yrs net price.
      * With most of the schools being value schools, there were very few institutional scholarships available, esp. for an out-of state freshman

As stated above, I want to major in graphic design, but every in-state program I've looked at has been unimpressive. Montevallo is the only one I'm even considering. **I think it's a better investment to spend more on a program that will actually help me be a competitive graduate compared to one that's half the price but doesn't.** The schools I've listed are the best values I've found (price compared to quality student and faculty work, internship opportunities, and located near to a decent job market). Also, I know that graphic design isn't the most lucrative field, but I've genuinely considered other careers and just can't see myself doing much else. I've also considered not even going to college and taking the self-taught, freelance direction, but I've heard that pathway is even harder to make ends meet.

**My options for a gap year:**

* **Taking a year off directly after high school, work full time, live with parents, before taxes:**
   * at absolute minimum wage, 40 hrs/wk for 50 weeks: $14,000
   * at the local $12.89 full-time average, 40 hrs/wk for 50 weeks: $25,780
* **Attending a year or two directly after high school, then taking the year off:**
   * would result in my associates if I went to FIT (more on schools below)
   * would be able to take advantage of freshman scholarships (mostly one-time, outside scholarships that are only available for current high school students to apply to)
   * At some schools, I could take a portion of my courses online.
      * potential to work more while still working towards a degree
      * If done through the school I plan to attend, I won't have to worry about transferring credits
   * If did this in-state and then transferred, it would cut the cost for the year(s) in half
      * risk those credits not being transferred and becoming a waste of time and money
* Of course I also plan to work next summer and as much as possible while in college.
   * Possible paid internships and freelancing as an upperclassman.
* Until I can work, I had the idea of opening an online print-to-demand shop to sell art/graphics prints on the side.
   * I've just started working on building an audience for my art online
   * It's passive income once I get everything set up, and making art is already something I have to do.
   * I'm aware this would only be pocket money in the best case, but it could help.

**My biggest fear is that the money I would earn working for a year would not offset the cost of college enough to make up for the missed opportunities I'd get if I attended right out of high school. What do you guys think? How did it work out for any of you who took a gap year to work?**

Does anyone here have experience with this type of packaging, and can maybe chime in with thoughts/ideas on how to reduce bottle breakage?

Currently, I'm looking at padding the backplate and flight arms of our palletizer, slowing down a few conveyors to prevent cases from bumping into each other as much, and am investigating changes to our case reject system. Our current case reject system punches cases with low fill levels or other mistakes with a high-powered pneumatic piston, and it will be too forceful for the new, thinner bottles.

I’m excited about the co-op and it’s in an industry I would like to get into. The pay is not too bad as well I get a nice sign-on bonus and I estimated that im going to be making around 70-75% of what my starting pay would be as an full-time entry level engineer. I also get full benefits with the co-op. Would it be better to keep the co-op to gain experience and hope to have a higher starting salary once I go full-time?

Also I should mention that I am married and have a baby that are living with me"

A little background about me is I'm a rising sophomore and have really only taken the intro CS classes so the extent of my knowledge stops at writing some Java functions. For the last couple of weeks I've been fiddling around with building a website from scratch and in the process have learned a good amount in html/css but I wouldn't consider myself proficient in either. My question for you all today is if you guys were in my position what are some of the technical skills in terms of learning new things/getting certifications that you would pursue? I'm trying to make the most out of my time here and was wondering if you guys have any specific skills that you wish you could have learned early on in your careers that would end up helping down the road. Thanks, I'm looking forward to reading all your replies."
8t3z1a,0,2018-06-22,Just got my first job in IT. Need help making a big decision,cosmion95,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8t3z1a/just_got_my_first_job_in_it_need_help_making_a/,"     Hello everyone. First of all, I would like to say some stuff about myself so you can understand how I got to where I am now. Please read everything before commenting. I am 23 years old; one year ago I decided to drop out of college and take a course on programming and working in IT. The course took 6 months, and it wasn't the online type, I had to go to a class room and there was a teacher and class mates. I set a goal to get a job in programming by the time next summer comes, and when I started, I barely knew anything about it. I went with Java since I was pretty passionate about mobile apps, I wanted to learn how to make them and I knew Android requires Java. I learned a lot, a lot about programming at home and at ""school"". But the ""school"" not only taught me programming, but also working with databases, version control systems, practical projects, making a correct resume, passing interviews, essentialy getting that first job. 
    Fast forward to the end of the course, I managed to finish it and get my programmer degree, wich is recognized by our Ministry of Education, available in multiple countries; so not just a shady diploma. I was really excited about getting started, it was spring, internships start popping up. I have made a really cool, material designed Android app as my resume, where I said all the stuff I needed, just like a normal resume, but way cooler, especially in the eyes of a mobile developer; or so i thought; I applied for about 5 interships in Android and 4-5 in Java and didn't even receive even 1 call. Not even 1. Hopes started to go down, and I tried to get whatever I could, I was in desperate need of a job. Here is where I am today:

    1. Currently I found a company which does enterprise resource planning, integrated informatics systems, stuff like that, I am not really sure how to translate it to english. It was the only job available as a junior programmer in the city that I live in and I went for it. I passed the interview and got a 3 month test period. Basically I have to develop reports, forms and stuff like that, working with their own software and using their own programming language (which is Java-based but really has nothing to do with it). It does not look like anything else I have seen before. Except for the SQL part, they have a huge database developed over the last 20 years or so in PLSQL. They're also working with Oracle Forms which I have never seen before. The company has some offices in ""my"" city but the headquarters are in a different one. I work with only 2 other elderly people, in their 45-50s, we don't really have anything in common. 
    Here are the downsides: I do not do what I wish to do or what I set out to do, I do not like what I am currently doing, I am forced to spend everyday at the office with these 2 people, 1 of them is the senior programmer from whom I am supposed to learn that new language but who has absolutely no ideea how to teach and explain things to me. 90% of the time I ask him something he does not know how to respond(I'm aware he knows the answer but he just does not know how to talk and make me understand, he just stands there). Sometimes he just jumps from one thing to another in the middle of a discussion(about programming), thing that I will eventualy have to learn but that is in no way related to what we were just talking. This is making things really difficult for me, since I usually ask lots of questions, because I want to understand what every bit of code does. The last downside is that they are forcing me to go back to college, or they would not hire me. Please understand that I was desperate for a job, and I said  I would do everything. But this mentality makes me think the people in charge of this company, which I have not met, are the same as my actual colleagues: how can you possibly work in IT without a college degree?. Don't get me wrong, I have planned to finish college in the future, I know that degree will help me achieve more of what I want, but as a junior programmer? Why would it be mandatory?
    Upside(wish I could say upsides): they really raised the stake with the salary, offering me double than what I initially thought I was gonna get. If I choose to remain here, I would be in a really good financial situation.

    2. We share our offices with another company. That company develops websites and web apps using .net framework, so c#. To my knowledge, c# is not very different than Java. I have met some people there(they're pretty young and the atmosphere between them looks really nice) and I found out they are actually looking for junior devs. I sat down with a guy today while at work, who is in HR at their company. I wanted to get more details about what they do and who they are looking for. He told me the usual, I'd have to learn a lot, study on my own, getting familiar with .net(told him I was ""with"" Java), etc. I asked him what he thinks about college, and what do you know, he said they do not care about that, they just want people they can rely on. The only downside with this is that they offer minimum wage during a 3 month test period.

    Now I am stuck, I do not know what to do and I am seeking the advice of anyone who has the experience to give it. If I decide to stay where I am now, what sort of experience do I gain? When I want to get another job in a field that I like, let's say 2 years later I find an opening for Android developer, I may actually know less about Java and developing Android applications than what I know now. The only experience I seem to get is with SQL and SVNs; how much does that count for when applying for a job as an Android developer?
    The other option is to try with the .net company. I would get a more pleasant office experience, I would do something I like more and it would also help me with future jobs. Yes I have to learn .net but choosing the other one means I have to learn another language anyway, but used only within that company. The salary difference is significant, 2:1, and making the right decision is crucial. I would have another option, which is WAIT AND SEE. It is less likely, but maybe I'll find a Java/Android job opening in my city. Chances are really slim though as it's a pretty small city and I have not seen anything like that since I started job hunting. By the way, I live in Romania.
    I'm looking forward to your answers and I wish you have a wonderful day!"

8t4mrg,1,2018-06-22,Computer Science field fucking sucks.,mythrowawayalty,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8t4mrg/computer_science_field_fucking_sucks/,"I feel like I have made a huge mistake going into computers. At first I thought it was a dream come true. I love computers I think they are so cool. Every time I learned a new concept or solved a new puzzle is was so exciting and restored my faith in my decision to go into computers. But now... everything as changed... when I graduated I got a job straight out of college at the all mighty Apple Inc as a Site Reliability Engineer! I was so excited and my friends and family were(are) so proud! I remember my dad was brought to tears when I finally succeeded. I am the first in my family to graduate collage with a bachelors and although I get unconditional love and support from my dad he has no idea what I went through to get where I am today and really has no idea what the field is like. (He still doesn’t know what an internship is lol). The job at Apple was not what I expected at all. There is no on-boarding  process and you are basically just left on your own to figure everything out. You can ask questions but people might criticize you for it and probably won’t answer your question. My peers and superiors yell at each other and at me on a daily basis. I’ve called HR about this extreme behavior and to put it frankly they don’t give a fuck. HR has not gotten back to me or resolved the issue and I have reached out multiple times. My actual job consists of a ton of operational work. I do the same thing every day (which is extremely Apple specific) and I am SOOOOO BORED OMG. I hate going to work to do the same freaking thing over and over dude. Not to mention my schedule. My work schedule rotates every week where I am constantly working nights/days/weekends. My sleep and sanity are total shit now. I hate my life. I have been at Apple for 1 year so far and I already. I have told my family I want to kill myself. They think I’m joking or exaggerating but I’m not. I know this job isn’t right for me, so I’ve started applying at other places. I’m getting calls back and interviews so that’s promising but I’ve lost all faith in my abilities. I haven’t spent the last year improving my skills and learning even more about computers. I’ve spent the last year decaying and forgetting everything I’ve learned in college. I’ve spend my weekends studying for my interviews and I just bombed my Facebook interview. They asked me 2 extremely simple questions and I couldnt answer them. The engineer had to guide me into using the correct data structure and even then I struggled. I know I can solve the problems, they arnt even hard. But I don’t have faith I can solve any problem understand the sun on the fly within a small time period. I need time to think and process what my options are. I don’t think I can do it in these interviews. I think I am good at what I do and I can solve these problems but I’m not some god that can come up with the best solution instantly for any given problem. Then even if I make these initial interviews I have to go through 2-3 more! And the last one is always an all day on site interviews where you have to prove yourself to the whole company basically. Why do they make these things so difficult???? My dad can show up at any job site and they will give him the job on the spot (carpenter). He doesn’t even have to have a resume. And I have to go through 3-4 interviews that are all 1hr+ long where they can ask me anything under the sun and if I don’t know the answer then I’m just shit out of luck. I spent hours and hours studying interview questions and reviewing things I learned from college that I’ve forgotten and it doesn’t matter because the interview questions I was asked were totally different then what I studied and I bombed it. The longer I stay at Apple, the more skilled other companies are going to expect me to be and I’m just decaying faster.  My boyfriend and I graduated at the same time. He also got a Computer Science BS but he works for a different company. I am watching him grow and learn and be excited about his choices in life and it’s a huge contrast to the way I feel. I feel embarrassed and ashamed that I can’t get a job somewhere else. I feel like just quitting the whole field (to end my misery) and leaving him and moving in with my dad (to get away from the shame I feel). I know my dad won’t judge me and will love me no matter what. It’s not like my boyfriend puts me down or anything. He says he believes in me and I can do it and this and that. But I don’t think I can do it. We got through college together and now I can’t make the cut :/
Thanks for reading my rant. "

I am fortunate enough to be attending Williams College next year. As of now, I would like to major in Computer Science. Now, this brings me to the core of my post:

Is it necessary to do anything academic or rewarding (in an academic sense) over this summer? 

I feel like I’ve worked my ass off to reach this point summer after summer and of course during the school year. I feel like this summer should just be to enjoy myself, and then next summer start focusing on landing internships and doing extra study (I understand applying for those types of summer positions begins early in the academic year). So far, I’ve been receiving a lot of pressure from my parents to try to take courses, study ahead, or do some type of research or shadowing type thing. So I’m turning to you all to understand whether doing something like that is entirely necessary. I understand that it is definitely helpful and could help me get an edge, but how much will I lose by not doing that?

Any advice would be great!"

I have a few surgeries coming up, an my current insurance plan is really comprehensive and affordable. 

I get paid well and am treated well by my company. This was a job I took in college to make some money, and I planned on leaving after a couple years. I’m four years in and, having recently graduated, now work full time. 

It’s a high end retail job, basically. I worked with customers and get yelled at. I’m micro managed and I’m doing a job that does not correlate at all with my interests or what I went to school for. My day is repetitive, and has no creativity to it, nor do I feel like I get anything out of it anymore. 

Don’t get me wrong — I’m grateful to have a job in the first place, and it’s a pretty decent one. I’ve learned a lot from it. But now I feel stunted. I try to work on projects on my own time, but I’m sort of lost for as to where to go next. After a year or so, I hopefully won’t be dealing with these health issues anymore and won’t need to be so worried about my insurance. 

But in the meantime, I’m not sure what to do while I’m still working here without going even more stir crazy. 

My degree is in film and I want to become a tv/film writer or documentary editor, or just work in media in general. I’ve been applying for related jobs almost every day, but haven’t even gotten a call back for a single one.

Almost every day, I wish I had gotten a degree in something else, like nursing or nutrition, or even biology and applied to med school. I used to want to be a doctor, and am still very much interested in health. And, I realize I value having a steady job and income, which I feel like my film degree will never be able to provide me. But I also can't afford to go back to school.

Of course, I do really like writing and filmmaking. If I could find a job doing those things, I'd be happy. I guess right now, I just feel like that's never going to happen, especially with my current situation. 

I do have an internship with a filmmaker, making short videos for her. I also plan on contacting small, local businesses and offering to make videos for them. I want to create my own films, but feel like I lack a specific niche to make films about. I need to build up my portfolio to get a job, but I feel overwhelmed right now by working full-time for the first time in my life, renting my own apartment, being on my own, etc. -- on top of trying to apply for jobs every day.

Anyone have any advice?"

I'm thinking of either working with non-profits, grabbing an internship, or to do some freelance work to get some more experience as a developer. As of this point I have a lot of projects on my Github but from what I understand in interviews I will need to do coding interviews and take-home projects which doesn't seem that crazy to me depending on what I'm being asked to do.

I'm confident I could find a jr role in the US, however I'd much rather live somewhere else in the world. I want to see whats out there and I want to leave the US. How realistic is it that I could find a position as a Jr developer abroad? Would it be more practical to get settled as one in the US before jumping and if so how long would that take?

It has two front fans, all the thumbscrews, filters are in their place. I’m not 100% sure if the fans work due to the flood, but in the grand scheme of things if they don’t it’s fine; I have plenty of fans back home that I can put to use.

Given that I live far away (Puerto Rico), I was thinking of shipping it to my place. How much would that cost, and do you think the expenses are worth it for a case this old? From what it looks like it still seems like a decent case in spite of its age and the conditions its been in.

I've tried numerous units at various health care systems and to make a long story short I've found that it just isn't for me. I've grown to resent pretty much every aspect of my job and need to make a change. My question is how to go about it? I've been looking at a couple posts on here and I've come up with with a couple options and was curious on your thoughts and if you have any (they'd be greatly appreciated) suggestions. 

1) Coding bootcamp: It would get me out of nursing the quickest however from what I understand isn't exactly the best long term. I read the comparison of two chefs one who studied at a prestigious French cullonary school (getting your CS BS) and able to make anything exceptionally and a French pastry chef who can only make pastries (coding bootcamp). I've also seen on here mixed results as far as getting a job. 

2) BS in CS: Doing some rough calculations it'd be approx $42000 over the course of 4 years going part time but including summers. I plan on taking as many classes as I can (calc, the more basic programming courses) as a community college to save money). My only real concerns with this are the internship required at the 3rd or 4th year and how receptive employers will be to a 35 year old new grad? 

3) MS in CS: I've heard of a couple people doing this but taking the pre reqs to the grad classes concurrently while taking the grad courses. I think this route would make me more attractive to employers since it's a grad degree however my only worry is not having a proper foundation to build the more advanced concepts on. 

Any insight or thoughts would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance. "
8t7mw8,18,2018-06-23,Clean Water Action “internship” Scam (NJ),beautifultuesday,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8t7mw8/clean_water_action_internship_scam_nj/,"Hello Reddit. I’m a college student in NJ and this summer, I took an internship in Montclair NJ that consisted of canvassing (begging)for money for this nonprofit Clean Water Action. There’s a bit of a story  and some math, but overall I need to know what course of action I should take since I know I didn’t get paid nearly enough. 

Story: so there’s 10 days of training (m-f for 2 weeks) and the goal every night is to raise up to 190$. In the employee handbook, it says you keep 52% of what you raise or minimum wage— whichever is the higher amount. Each day there would be some training and then we’d drive to a neighborhood and beg for money door to door. I did everything they asked of me and never made the goal. On day 6 they told me that the “goal” I needed to reach was really more of a minimum and if I couldn’t reach it by day 7 I was out. Day 7 I was out and thank god, this seriously was not an internship by any means. It was a scam.

Math: So the official hours were from 2-10 Monday through Friday even though they always expect us early and have us leave late. 

One and a half weeks is 7 Days of work = 56 hrs. 

Since I didn’t hit the minimum of fundraising goal, I had to get paid minimum wage. 

56 hrs x$8.60 = 481.60$ before taxes.

They paid me $346. Even after taxes that really shouldn’t be legal. 

Side note: please please please do not give to this organization, or work for them. It is basically multi-level marketing disguised as a fun nonprofit. "

So, I have cystic fibrosis, and I've been having pretty frequent lung infections from 2015 to now. I get fevers, take a month of antibiotics, get better, and, after a week or two passes, the fevers come back.

All the tests came with kinda different results. Some had viruses, some had fungi, and all of them had the same pair of bacteria I had for a long time.

I get treated by a fairly large team of doctors, because of my main disease. In a certain point of 2016, a new doctor appeared out of the blue in the team. She was an old lady, somewhere in her 70s. I never liked her too much, because she had a acid personality, and was stubborn like a mule - she would not let anyone say anything if it was not in her consent, even though she had the least amount of graduation of them all, if we put the interns aside.

So, somewere close to february 2017, I was moving to a town 3 hours away from home, to attend to college, and found it better to go to the hospital and get everything checked, as I was taking a round of antibiotics. She was there that day and, contrary to what everyone else was saying, she just exclaimed: ""I'm tired of giving antibiotics to him. Take them all out, and we'll let it grow so we can see what's there"".

She argued and cut every doctor off, and I walked out of there with no medicine at all to take. Fast forward 2 weeks, I went to spend the weekend with my grand aunt, who lived nearby (thank heavens I did that). Saturday morning, I woke up feeling a shortness of breath. 2 hours later, I was in the ICU, in a coma, with a double pneumonia. The doctors simply didn't know what to do, because it had grown so much out of control. It was really a miracle I survived.

Then, after 5 days of 'sleep', I woke up, and spent 2 more weeks at the hospital, in a personal hell. Needles everywhere, all times of day, I was too weak to walk or eat alone, and a bunch of more off topic stuff. It took me months to get back to normal, and I still have trouble breathing, though, and my infections stopped 2 months ago.

Then, some weeks after I got released from the hospital, I went on an appointment, and find her. Of course she denied that I had a pneumonia (because otherwise she would be the one to blame), despite pages of exams saying I had that. I don't remember seeing her after that time.

Now to my point.

Talking to some doctors there, most of them said they find her insane, because she is too much stubborn for everything.

And, I experience some consequences from the episode until today, along with the horrible flashbacks I have from time to time. And the fact that I had to abandon college because by health was not stable enough. (It's still not).

That was always a slight possibility for me, but now I'm even on the waiting line for a transplant, because the episode was what pushed me over that line of needing it.

So, talking to a friend of mine who happens to be a judge, she told me I could sue her for (sorry if I translate anything wrong) medical negligence, physical damage, and psychological damages. And that she might even lose her medical license.

Is that true? And if it is, should I do it? What would that possibly benefit me in? Or is it just an energy sucking rabbit hole that I should stay away from?

TL;DR: Doctor almost killed me for her own stubbornness, and I was wondering if I should or should not sue her for the consequences I'm facing.

Edit: My wonderings are more on the human side of the thing. If that will consume too much of me, in terms of money, energy, and time, and if that would result in a worthwhile thing, such as her not being able to hurt others, or even something as little as a mental closure for me. (Or is that just a wish for revenge?)

I don't know if there is any valid paper trail linking her to it, but I can take my medical files to a perice to find out."

I know these schools are HIGHLY selective. I have been passionate about robotics, AI, programming most of my life and hence, I would like to major in CS. Now, for my stats

GPA (for junior year only) - 3.4 UW (hard courses, APs - Chem and Stats)

SAT - 1580 / 1600

I've done an internship at an AI startup in India (my hometown) for 4 months (through 2 summers) - learning, writing and applying code using programs like python OpenCV, machine learning decisions and predictions, etc.

Service at a school for special children (also in my hometown) - using my knowledge of statistics to help analyze data from the school among other things.

Participated in many international robotics competitions

Won 2  scholarships for Indian classical music (vocal) from my previous school

Marathon runner for the last 6 years - was in cross country team junior year. Our team won gold in a huge event in the region. I participated as an individual before this as my old school didn't have a cross country team.

Clubs - current school - Computer engineering and design club, Mu alpha theta (for first semester), science club

old school - MUN club, Computer club, Debate Club

REASON FOR MY LOW GPA : Firstly, I moved from a local Indian school in India to the American one in junior year. It took me some time to get accustomed to the new school and system (for example, the accent of teachers who were mostly American, use of graphing calculators (which I never had exposure to in my previous school). Also, the grading system and style of teaching were widely different. Not to mention the diversity of the school and social life. This is why I feel my gpa was lower. In my previous school, we didn't have a GPA system, but we were given something called a CGPA at the end of each year. My 10th grade CGPA was 9.4 / 10. Basically, what I am trying to say is, it was extremely hard for me to adapt.

I plan to take subject SATs in Math 2 and chem/physics

My course for 12th grade includes AP calc AB, AP physics C and AP CS A.

If my essays are really good (I have already written a few and got good feedback from school counselor), do I have a chance at these schools? I know its a stretch considering my low GPA but I am passionate for what I want to do."
8t91u9,2,2018-06-23,"Choosing between bootcamp + job, and/or CS degree",sdf2323cxce23ecd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8t91u9/choosing_between_bootcamp_job_andor_cs_degree/,"Hi guys, so I am in a bit of a dilemma and need some advice. First, some background: I am right about to finish my first year of CS at a British online university which is 3 years long studying full-time (or 6 years long doing it part-time).

The problem is that I am already 23 years old, so by the time I finish my degree, assuming everything goes well, I will be 25-26 years old with a degree, yes, but no work experience whatsoever. Not even internships since my uni does not offer one. 

So I looked up some bootcamps in my city and found one which is not very expensive due to having an online option (yes I'm a loner and do everything online lol). It is 9 weeks long and teaches full-stack web development (html/css/js/reactjs/nodejs). What's great about this is that it basically guarantees you a job after completing the course successfully since the school says 100&amp;#37; of their students find work as programmers within 3 months after finishing the bootcamp and they personally help you prepare and find interviews. Obviously they could be lying but I doubt it (checked school reviews). However this is risky since my CS degree would most likely suffer.

So I have 3 options now:

  1. Forget about the bootcamp or a job and just keep studying my CS degree full-time. I'd have my degree paper by 25-26 but who would really hire a 26-year-old graduate without experience when there are lots of 22-year-old kids doing internships, working or starting master's degrees already?

  2. Do the bootcamp and find a job afterwards, while studying part-time. A ""moderate"" option I'd say. It feels like I would just be delaying my degree and taking an unnecessary risk. What if I don't find a job after the bootcamp or I am fired soon after? Since I'll have enrolled for only part-time, I'll have just basically wasted a whole year which I could have spent studying full-time. So now I'm 28 with still no experience. Best case scenario though: full-time work, part-time study, looks ideal.

  3. Do the bootcamp and find a job afterwards, while studying full-time. Seems like the best option since I would get the degree ASAP while also having work experience. But I am not sure how feasible this is. I already have no social life so I can't imagine what else I would need to sacrifice in order to achieve both goals. No sleep? lol.

What's the best path here? Any advice would be much appreciated thank you. I'm in Europe btw if that matters."

First of all, apologies if this is the wrong sub.

As mentioned in the title, I graduated at the end of 2017. I have sent about 100 applications so far, and I work in the warehouse in the meantime to pay the rent. Out of those applications, I had only one interview, after which the manager told me that I was not selected because of my lack of experience.

I have done 2 internships in 3 years so far, which puts me at around 1 year of experience. The problem is, internships are not paid enough in Denmark to manage to get by and pay back my student loan (around 500 euros a month), even with a second job on the weekends.

Since I have not found any junior/graduate positions so far, I figured I need to find a way to still gain experience/skills while searching, but I don't know where to start.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

8tbmv7,2,2018-06-23,"Landlord/roommate stealing money. Privacy invasion concerns. [Mississippi, USA]",legalthrowaway0401,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8tbmv7/landlordroommate_stealing_money_privacy_invasion/,"TLDR: People who I am renting from are coming inti my room without my permission, and have stolen my money. What do I do?

I moved to a small town in Mississippi in late May. I moved into a room and share a house with a family. There was no paperwork for the lease; I just paid for a security deposit and for the first month rent. I do have receipts for these payments.
 
My landlord is also my roommate. Let's call her Mandy. Mandy, her husband, and their two children (age around 3 and 4) live with me. 

The house is very unclean, the air conditioner floods the house with water, and my room has no lock on it. The craigslist ad said the room was private (have screenshots). I picked this place out of desperation.

A few days into me staying there, the family allows for two more children (age 12 and 13) to stay at the house; they are Mandy's cousins. I was unaware that one of these kids, lets call him John, had a known history of stealing money. 

One day, I noticed cash on top of my drawer was missing ($200). The day I noticed, John had already left. I didn't tell anyone about this right away except for my long distance girlfriend. I searched everywhere and retraced my steps and I couldn't find it anywhere. 

In casual/random conversation, Mandy brought up the fact that Josh had a history of stealing money and gave me some ancedotes. I told her that I was missing money from my room. She told me she would contact his parents. Fine.

A few days later, $100 more dollars goes missing from inside my drawer. I don't tell anyone because I can hardly believe it; the family treats me with kindness when we interact face-to-face. Once again, I look for my money, but can't find it. This leads me to believe that Mandy or another family member had stolen from me or has been in my room before.

A few days later, Mandy tells me that Josh's mom said that Josh had $50 on him when he got home. She tells me she suspects its my money. She offers to give me $100 off of next months rent to make up for my missing $200. I tell her I would think about it.

I start to pay more attention to the positions of things in my room. I am absolutely certain that things on and in my drawer are reareanged. My frying pan and some plastic cups I keep in my room go missing. It seems like someone goes through my room to search for money when im away from work (some days I work long hours, and Mandy works from home a lot of the time). I take pictures of the positions of my things before I leave to make sure things are rearranged on a few occassions, and indeed, things do get rearranged.

I tell Mandy that I feel like things in my room are going missing, and I ask her if she had seen my frying pan. She says no.

One night Mandy opens my bedroom  door without knocking, just to make a small complaint. Fair enough, but her opening my bedroom door without my permission is an invasion of privacy and further leads me to believe that I am being lied to. 

I confront Mandy next morning telling her that I do not want her to come in without my approval. She told me she knocked (she didn't, I was three feet away from the door and I was facing it when she opened it). She gets defensive a tells me I was being disrespectful. I make it clear that I do not want anyone opening my bedroom door without my permission while I am gone, or while I am there. She tells me she will just to check if I am home. I explicty tell her not too.

I am in the process of finding a new place. I told Mandy I would be moving out at the end of this month (June 28), and asked if I am going to get my security deposit back. She said she is okay with me moving out, and told me she will give me my security deposit. The craigslist ad said there was a 33% cleaning fee of the deposit despite the fact that the house was filthy the entire time. Whatever.

What should I do about my situation? I want my money back, and I want justice. I feel betrayed and have lost a lot of sleep worrying about my privacy. I have told Mandy about my concerns. I have not filled a police report out of fear of retaliatory measures taken against me (e.g., them accusing me of committing crimes against them or their children). Since they are a family, I feel like people are more likely to believe any lies they tell about me. I am also half-Asian, so I do not look or talk like most people here. Also Mandy has a law degree, but has not yet passed her BAR exam. I am a STEM graduate student intern doing research at a government facility. I have no direct proof that they stole my money, but I have a lot of reasons to believe they did (invasion of privacy, objects moved in my room, they have access to my room anytime i am gone).

More things that happened which may be worth noting:
- Mandy kept harassing me to get out of my room and to go to work when I wasn't feeling well. She said it was so she could have privacy when making business related phone calls. I told my boss I would come in late in late and he was fine with it. She was mad at me for dwelling in my ""private room"".
- One weekend I was told Mandy's husbands family was visiting, so I was told I would need to leave the house. They offered to drop me off downtown, and pick me up late in the afternoon. I said yes just to avoid any trouble.
- It seems like Mandy and the family is slowly moving out. A lot of their personal photos and degrees have been removed from their stands these past few days, and there are bags of clothes in the living room. As of this morning, the shower curtain for the shared bathroom I use is missing. This bathroom has no lock on it. 

Thanks for any advice."

This company has no entries on glassdoor, but I checked other similar ones and lowest salary for software dev seems to vary between 38k and 45k. Should I ask for £45k straight up? Or could that scare them off? Or more, so that they negotiate down to 45?

I'm not sure where to start. I've been in my Graduate program since 2015 as a part-time student. I am studying Counseling in Higher Education. After my first semester, I was able to land a part-time job as a Career Advisor at a college. It worked perfectly with my schedule. I found the job through a network contact at my Graduate program. I held that job until May 2018 when I decided to quit to complete my final year and start the internship. I landed a great Internship at a big university. However, I did not quite figure out how I would supplement my income. I've heard of some people holding down 2-3 jobs while in Graduate school. Before leaving my position, I asked if there was any way that could work with me so I could have a couple of hours a week but they said they needed a 20-hour commitment which I could not do. The internship is approximately 10 hours a week and class time/supervision is 2 1/2 hours.

I started looking for flexible jobs so that I could make money. I applied to and got hired for VIPKid, and posted up my services for Resume writing. The hiring process for VIPKID was quite long. Even though I got approved there are a few trainings I must complete, and I will need to get booked by parents (which can take time). As for the resume writing after 3 people contacted me I was able to land 1 paying customer. I worked with him for a month and received $115. Not everyone is willing to pay that amount. I know that if I promote more, I might be able to get more clients but I am worried that I might not be able to manage all of this while completing my internship

I still have bills to cover, not to mention gas for my car. What do you guys suggest? I am panicking. What advice would you give? How did you stay afloat?"

I don't know how allowed these posts are, but I'm having some difficulty in evaluating my chances to be accepted for a Masters in CS at California schools such as UCLA, UC Irvine, and my top choice UCSD. Any feedback would be appreciated! I'm not the most educated on the subject as I assumed I would go straight into industry, but the San Diego-based company that I'm interning for (and may very well return to after I graduate) likes Masters degrees in its employees. It's been said that they help out the engineers with the price tag if they go, and will give them a pay bump once they finish. I have also always enjoyed school so the whole idea sounds pretty sweet.

Regardless, I am a double major in CS and pure math from a well-known state school. Rising senior. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.951 and 168Q/162V/5 AW on the GRE. Two internships, both in software. Should have three strong letters of recommendation. I have very much enjoyed my systems and communication software engineering roles, so I believe that something along those lines would be my specialization although I have loved the AI classes I have taken in undergrad.

But I have absolutely no research experience. Zilch. Never made it a priority. And from my brief searching on the subject that sounds like a key part of the application. So, what would you guys recommend? I don't really like the idea of squeezing in research during the Fall semester just for resume padding, but if it is that necessary I will consider.

I want some input and advice from people after you read all of this. 

I am bad at making solid long term plans when it comes to obtaining work and holding a job. For the rest of 2018, I want these to be my highest goals and I want to achieve them.

To show you that I mean what I say, here's my progress (and my failures along the way) for the past year and a half (2017-2018). It's not much, but I have met most of my personal goals but have failed most of my professional ones. Listed at the end are a few ideas for what I could do to become independent from my parents.

\---

Jan-Feb 2017: I was a job virgin (so to speak), obese, scabby, acne-ridden, never had an intimate relationship, lost my friends, living at home with parents who resented and regretted having me, and I wanted to die. Here is what I did about it.

March 2017 - I started working out for 30 mins a day. I started applying for jobs and saw my family physician.

April 2017 - I used my parents' health insurance to find a therapist and get a prescription for Prozac. I have taken my medication every day, and done my therapy exercises before therapy without fail until recently, when my therapist said I am no longer depressed. I bought medicated soap for the acne and scabs. I got my first job interview and did badly. I stopped picking my skin.

May 2017 - I started a diet of fruit, veggies, nuts, and cheese (to stop myself from eating ice cream all the time - seriously, yes, I used to do that). No juice, only milk and/or water. I got another job interview, which I also failed. \*\*\*I learned to drive\*\*\*. 

June 2017 - I started cutting out toxic elements in my life. Family members, fake friends, mean people, and I started volunteering at a children's home for a few weeks. I stopped self-harming (biting myself and cutting - don't ask.). 

July 2017 - I started applying to jobs in earnest. I got a few interviews, one of which went well.

August 2017 - I landed a paid internship but my parents, especially my mother, told me it paid too little. This was my biggest failure because I listened to them instead of to my gut because I would have worked hard at it. It was for childhood education and that's something I am interested in. It was something I really wanted and I should never have listened to my parents regarding that internship. I would be so much better off now if I had learned to say ""no"".

September - I lost 35 lbs by this point, going from 195 lbs to 160 lbs. My skin improved greatly and I started shaving and dressing better. I started canvassing with the Fund for the Public Interest as a volunteer, and this turned into an unpaid internship with them.

October - I looked into joining the military, but as I would later find, my depression disqualifies me outright. I will have to wait and look into getting a waiver for that, but as I was told on the Air Force sub, it's very unlikely that this course of action will work.

November - I met my first girlfriend and got my first temp job at a customer service call center as the month started. I also became a barista for a few weeks and it was actually really fun but they fired me after I told them that I had another job and couldn't go full-time.

December 2017 - March 2018 - during these months, I stagnated completely. Weight rose to 165 lbs.

April 2018 - I lost the call center job after my shift with zero notice from my manager. Apparently my manager disliked me because I was quiet and did not communicate much, and I couldn't hear her when she was giving announcements because I would be on a call and had to ask what she said a lot of the time. I found out after the fact that this is why I was let go (via email - that stung, to be honest). My girlfriend left me at the end of this month. I started networking with people to fix my timidity and quiet nature and started attending Meetups to become better at communicating and networking and to gain useful contacts. I also re-engaged in creative writing on the night I lost my job. I used to write comic book characters and superheroes in my college notebooks during school - reading fiction, writing characters, and world-building all have long been a passion of mine. My friends in those days noted that I was creative, which I thought was cool.

May 2018 - I left for India with my mother to visit my grandmother for a week. My mother wanted me to go, but I should not have gone. I started learning to say ""no"" to my mother during that trip and started becoming more independent-minded, going out into the city without knowing the language, using landmarks and my memory to make it home in time for dinner. It was gratifying to know that I could roam freely in a foreign city with confidence without knowing the language. It was stifling, having her treat me like a child, but not unwarranted - up till then, I had been passive and timid.

June 2018-now

I am getting depressive feelings again. I am at 175 lbs but building more muscle. I have been buying and reading books and graphic novels to fuel my interests and my desire to be creative. I have been writing regularly, and I have started a blog on stories, where I will start posting book reviews and essays of my favorite works of fiction. I am networking with writers, and I have met a published author, from whom I might be able to ask advice once in a while. I am registering for more Meetups to build social confidence. My skin is without scabs, now I have only scars, and is completely soft. I am physically much fitter and work out regularly, and I shave regularly and dress more neatly and I clean my room regularly.

I believe I am capable of more (much more? I don't really know, but \*definitely more\*) than I have been doing. I want to be a fiction author, yes, and I would absolutely take the risk of failing in creative endeavors, but I want to have a job and place so that I can sustain myself while writing so that if I fail, my parents don't get saddled with the responsibility of me living with them. 

\*\*I decided I'm not going to give myself time to date while I'm trying to obtain independence. At all. No dating for me while I'm trying to figure my shit out.\*\* 

\*\* How I have changed so far:

Lost weight. Fit and physically active. Clean skin, but scarred. Shaving regularly, dressing better than before. (Still a hairy werewolf though.)

Have a little bit of job experience and internship experience out of college.

Have some contacts and new friends. 

Networking. 

Engaged in writing my book. 

Reading a LOT. Cannot stress that enough. 

Watching video essays on film and literature and philosophy, science, psych, and other academic topics. 

Cut out junk food and eating out (mostly, except when I go out with friends once in a blue moon).

More punctual, more clean and conscientious, and more inclined to tell myself harsh truths. 

Learning to say ""no"" and standing up for myself more. 

\*\* Some ideas of jobs I can/want to do do:

Teach English abroad. I have enough saved up to do a course and get a certification to go abroad and teach English. I have a B.S. which should suffice for the educational requirement. - I know this won't give me my own place but I need to get out of the home and prove to myself that I am self-sufficient. 

I was interested in the military. With that inclination, one could similarly look into becoming a police or parole/probation officer. I have a B.S. which should fulfill the education requirement.

I could work for the Fund for the Public Interest on one of their many campaigns.

Psychiatric technician. I have a B.S. in Psych, I need a certification and I'm good to go, I think, but I'll have to check.

ABA therapist. I need a course or certificate, and I need to network for it. 

Food service for the time being while searching and studying for the above jobs.

Physical labor for the time being while searching and studying for the above jobs.

Volunteer for the time being while searching and studying for the above jobs. 

\*\*These are my ideas so far.

TL/DR - for those of you who did not read, I have a little job experience and am wondering what I can do with a B.S. in Psychology and get a full time job and move out of my parents' home. The ideas of jobs I can do are listed directly above. My changes in my life are listed above the ideas for jobs I could do. 

Thoughts, advice, tough love, all are welcome! Please respond! I need it :)"
8tfuxh,3,2018-06-24,Should I stay or should I go now? (But seriously this is causing me pretty decent anxiety) Canada -&gt; USA?,pointonethree,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8tfuxh/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go_now_but_seriously/,"I was born in Chicago and lived there until I was 10, when my family moved to Canada.  (**I am a citizen and I have a SS number**, but do not currently hold my US passport, only my Canadian.)

After graduating High School, I attended university in Canada but didn't complete because I hated my program.  I dropped out, got a job that exposed me to databases, scripting, and network architecture.  Realized I had found my passion so I left my job to go back to school.  I am going to graduate later this year from a 2 year Canadian College program, with a Diploma in Computer Programming.  I was also fortunate enough to get an 8 month co-op/paid internship, where I have learned even more than I did in my program.

However, I cannot figure out what to do next.  It has been made clear to me that my co-op employer wants me to come back with them full time.  But, since I found my passion in software development, I have wanted to move back to Chicago and do it there, it's just my dream.

If I stay, I have a basically guaranteed job; I am competent and getting better.  However, my salary expectation is around $60K CAD and I don't know if I can expect much, if any, upward movement in the company.

If I move to Chicago, I have no guarantee of work.  Yes I can look for and apply to jobs remotely, but there's less security since I will be new in those positions and not as indispensable as I am in my current role by comparison.  I would also have to contend with figuring out health insurance and my US credit score.  But, I really want to do it, and, due to the larger number of jobs, I expect that I'd have much higher earning potential there than here.

I think I could be happy in Canada.  But I really, really want to move to Chicago, and I honestly think I'll be happier there.

At this point, I'm looking for opinions.  Feedback from people who have 2 year diplomas(/Associate's degrees, I think?) would be very much appreciated, with respect to how easy/hard it is to find work with our level of education.

Thank you."

I've been really wanting to attending University of Central Florida in Orlando after I finish my AA, and want to retake some classes I either failed or passed with a D in. The reason is because I've had to truck through a lot with work and an internship in web development.

I've had a few friends who graduated from there, telling me that it's an amazing school and Orlando has been a dream city for me. I only have three semesters left, so I'm trying to bring it up to a 3 as much as I Can.

I recently visited Stanford and I loved it. The people there were really chill, and the campus was beautiful. The weather was really great too, and the school spirit and especially LSJUMB seemed like a ton of fun. Stanford's CS is also a lot stronger. Overall, it seems like a fun, chill school where I can get an excellent education and a ton of cool opportunities, especially in tech.

However there's also a lot of stuff I liked more about UChicago too, namely the emphasis on a rigorous liberal arts education and interdisciplinary studies, the ""learning-to-learn"" atmosphere, and how genuine everyone was. I also loved that the education there basically prepared you for any job, and their internship programs seemed really great.

I know I would probably be happy at either one of these schools. They both have a ton of things I like, like the quarter system (more classes), smart people, pretty campuses, etc., but even though I've visited both, I'm still as confused as ever about which one I should pick to apply early, and whether I should ED.

8tgky2,1,2018-06-24,How do I avoid getting pigeonholed into a career I have no interest in?,pigeon_mike,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8tgky2/how_do_i_avoid_getting_pigeonholed_into_a_career/,"Sorry, this post turned out longer than I had anticipated...

So, to provide some background, I’m an undergraduate student entering my last semester of college and majoring in in supply chain engineering. I had wanted to study business/finance, but due to financial limitations ended up going to a state school where the business program is something of an afterthought relative to the university’s STEM programs. I switched into engineering early on because I felt that the program would do a better job of honing my problem solving and technical skills, as well as make me more competitive in the job market relative to if I had stayed in the business school.

Pretty early on I realized that I wanted to go into management consulting, and from the evidence I gathered it seemed like my new major would be the best fit for this. I managed to snag an internship with a small consultancy which lasted for two rotations (a summer and a spring semester) early on in my college career, but got virtually nothing out of it. I had very low utilization and spent most of my time idling. Additionally, the company I worked for focused almost entirely on government contracting (which meant there wasn’t really room for innovating), and in my particular case the projects I worked on pertained exclusively to a specific program within the Department of Health and Human Services (which was incredibly boring to me).

Following this experience, as I took more classes I slowly started losing faith in my program. I’ve been disappointed in the curriculum, which I feel hasn’t really taught me any useful skills like I had hoped, and I’ve come to find engineering (or at least supply chain engineering) very dull. Despite this I managed to keep a very good GPA up until recently.

Last fall, my grades dropped significantly (though they’re still in the 3.X range) because I spent an inordinate amount of my time going to career fairs and company info sessions trying to land an internship for my last summer before graduating. After being rejected by two dozen or more companies, I ended up accepting the one offer I received, from another consultancy which I had been reluctant to even apply to because their business was so similar to the first company I had worked at.

Since starting there a few weeks ago, I’ve been very disappointed. The work we do can barely be called consulting; we do number-crunching work for government agencies which outsource the tasks they don’t want to do in-house. And of course, the client for the group I’m assigned to would be none other than the Department of Health and Human Services, again. So far I’ve had very low utilization and most of the work I’ve been tasked with has been busy work. This is usually written off as being a learning experience to give me some exposure to the kind of work full time staff typically do, but their work is so niche that any experience I gain would only be useful in my specific group within the company (which isn’t even the company’s primary business area) or within DHHS. Needless to say I have no interest in pursuing either option.

I don’t want to do this line of work professionally. I went into engineering and had an unenjoyable undergraduate experience all in the name of avoiding this kind of outcome, but that hasn’t paid any dividends, and apparently now my resume is a hard pass to all but civil service-related jobs. How do I get out of this? I’m still confident I’d want to go into either (real) consulting or finance, but I don’t feel like my resume makes me appealing to those fields. How do I leverage my otherwise irrelevant job experience when applying to places this fall? How do I sell myself? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

TL;DR: I don’t want to get pigeonholed into doing busy work as a government proxy, but I’m about to finish my undergraduate and all my past internship/work experience has been as such. How do I leverage my (mostly useless) job experience to appeal to employers in consulting or finance?"

The IT team is made up of a few great people who are always busy with something and I really want to help them, I usually finish my tasks very early and then wind up with a few idle hours and when I ask them if they need help with anything they get happy and start suggesting but when they notice I have no access they just say forget it.  Also even my daily tasks require elevated permission so I have to go fetch one of the guys regularly putting even more pressure on them.  

I have refrained form asking for more permissions, but should I do that now?, I also do not even have access to most parts of the building so I cannot do much desk support tasks even.

I really like this company and the team here and would like to attain a good impression, at least good enough that they may consider me as a potential contractor if not full time staff material."

I'm a bit tensed in my job, I'm labeled help desk tech, no real tiers (my boss considers me tier 1/2) since I'm the only one for about 120 employees along with the system admin. Our directors work off a different location with one salesman and lets us handle the day to day situation, mostly me since the admin is working on projects.

I took this job a year and 3 months ago, I was happy to take my first full time role, I had prior experience but as a part time while I went to school for certs. I had prior basic skills due to having several computers for 20 years, I was afraid to do this because it didnt make sense to work with what you love (lazy and scared), I went to school when my job of 8 years outsource the work to India, I was a newspaper page layout editor and web content coordinator, sat next to IT for 8 years and found it fascinating and the guys would talk to me and tell me to study it because they felt that I knew enough to get in and work.

2016 spent the year in an IT vocational school and half the year as an intern because the market wanted a helpdesk tech with 2 years experience, A+, N+, CCNA or MCSA for 11-15 an hour.

I interviewed for this current job, got it because the IT director at the time wanted someone who can hit the ground running. I started on a tuesday, my training ended on a thursday due to the only tech leaving to his new job.

3 months in I was active in troubleshooting issues with our Hardware, Software, keeping track of inventory, Workstations, Laptops, Toners. Would go from changing a toner to creating a user in AD in one of our servers, Creating Security groups, Assigning people to groups, hiding folders for security groups in the file server,  to creating door access for new people in another server, to rebooting servers every 30 days for best practice after hours, back to unlocking users for forgetting their passwords or changing video cables. Also, to being desktop support for our office out of the country or another county in our state or users traveling around the world, to going through our email cloud service scanning for held mail, phishing attempts, to being involved in small projects for the company like an after hours sales team or finding old workstations and making them dedicated stations for multi monitor setup for the database admin. Getting calls from home at night and weekends... for 15 bucks an hour to gain the experience that was required of me.

Then my Director quit and new guy came in, I was a contractor and my old director told the management team to hire me because If I left then the new director would be all by himself in this change. So they asked me to sign some sheet to become perm...no salary offer....I brought it to their attention...they asked me what i was looking for..I felt and still feel I'm doing two people's jobs so I pulled 5 job descriptions from pay scale and showed the salary from 45-52.... counter offer was 40k..with incentive bonus of a months salary with the incentive being if I quit or get fired i'd be paying that back til March 31st.... So after taking the offer because it was a 3 dollar raise... The CFO came and asked me if I was happy... I said no, gave him the reasons. He told me 90 days we would have a performance review. He quit on the week I brought it up after 90 days, My Director took charge of it.. after 30 more days he got me to 44k (15&amp;#37; raise). My new director received all the help from me, I kept him informed while handling everything I was doing specially after we left the MSP behind because I was doing all help desk/desktop job duties... He brought a system admin with no certs but 20+years of experience.. dude got fired after 5 weeks. We have a stable admin now.

Sorry for the long long story, earlier this year around March/April we had a talk, I told him I wanted to grow here and sense that I cant in this place, he told me to get Certified in Net+ and Sec+ and he would take care of me, that he would like to make me the help desk manager and bring someone else under me. I learned as much as he has allowed me to learn, he taught me the basic admin role in our primary software, our ERP. I have taken on small projects like taking charge in implementing our ADP time clock system starting from scratch, including all new bio metrics, documenting the changes in the network, removing the software in our server. Learning to use Office 365 cloud archiving and implementing it to users with large mailbox usage. I took the responsibility of being the Phone admin, using voip phones,  running inventory, creating rules, adding new users to not just profiles but to phone groups, learning the app and teaching it to users to make international calls as if your on the desk phone. All of this plus more while doing the normal day to day troubleshooting like printer issues, scanner issues, computer issues, protocols and procedures when new/old employees come in or leave. 

Just recently, I told him I will be taking a week off in two months, he told me I deserve it and he would get a temp to cover me for the week. He told me he was bringing in someone else for a special role which is basically the ERP only. I keep taking the work because I feel it will help me here or help me somewhere else. When March 2019 hits, I'll be 2 years here with what I plan to have my net and sec certs. 

This tuesday is our review for the year, I sense he will bring up the fact I havent gotten certified in Net/Sec but honestly when I was in night class program for net+ this Jan, I was called for issues after hours and even by him forgetting I was in school. I have spent this month reading every weekend for 6 hour long sessions til it makes every bit of sense and sometimes during my hour lunch if I can be left alone. 

I'm hoping that my boss remembers every time managers at the managers meetings have finished discussions with complimenting my work, my efforts and my dedication to this place. 

TLDR: what can i use in my review to negotiate or am I over hyping myself because plenty of people work like this and get paid similar. I'm hoping he sees that I will get my certs and invests in me now. I will have them but I will make my move to leave based on this decision, I want to get to atleast 52k from 44k, I'm already on pace to make 48k based on OT. "
8tnif5,0,2018-06-24,"New graduate, possibly three job offers, not sure what to do and super stressing (long post)",MchKitty,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8tnif5/new_graduate_possibly_three_job_offers_not_sure/,"Sorry if this post gets kinda long, bear with me.

So I just graduated from a fairly in demand field a couple weeks ago. I did my internship at Company A in City A and really wanted to work there and live in the city. Unfortunately, they didn't have any positions at the moment, but they encouraged me to apply once postings came up because they really liked me.

Now, way back in March, many of my classmates were getting jobs and I was sort of panicking because I was worried I wouldn't get one. One of my professors advised me to “take whatever I could get” to ensure I would get experience and wouldn't be left behind. So I applied to a job at Company B in bumfuck nowhere Town B that's an hour outside City A. Now let's just be clear, the “city” I'm talking about is already extremely tiny, it's nothing like Toronto or New York where you can travel for an hour and still be in a city-ish area. Town B is bumfuck nowhere-ville.

So I ended up being offered a job at Company B, reluctantly accepted, and my partner and I moved to a commuter town a half hour between Town B and City A (because husband works in City A). I absolutely HATE commuting, but what can you do? I start this new job this week.

The kicker here was that after I accepted this position, Company A2 (which is also in City A), decided to interview a bunch of new graduates for positions, so I signed up for it just to see what would happen. I don't really want to work at Company A2, but it's in City A, which is where I really want to live. They haven't offered me a position, but if they did, I wouldn't start until August.

Now here's the REAL kicker. The place I interned at, Company A in City A, just posted a position! I applied, and I think I stand a pretty good chance at getting an interview and an offer, but I will probably be competing against a bunch of other people, and nothing's guaranteed.

Now here's where I'm kind of stumped. Do I stay with Company B for while and commute to town B and hope that someday I get a Company A job (and turn down Company A2)? If Company A2 offers me a position, should I take it JUST because it's in City A and that's where I want to be and maybe I can move there earlier? Maybe I'd actually like to work at Company A2, but who knows.

There's also the money issue, because I have to start paying back student loans, pay rent, and my husband needs some dental/eye work done so having benefits asap are kind of important to me right now. (All these jobs pay the same with the same benefits, so that's not really a factor).

I'm also very much a people pleaser, and I hate upsetting people/wasting their time. The thought of working at Company B for like, two weeks, then putting in two weeks notice sounds HORRIBLE to me. Then, what if I accept a position at Company A2, but then Company A (dream company) offers, and then I'm like “peace out” to this company too. So much bouncing around which looks bad. Just thinking about all this is giving me massive anxiety, and I don't know what to do.

If Company A just hired me right off the bat, I wouldn't be making this post.

tldr; New graduate, took job in small town I didn't want to live in (I want to live in city). May get job offer from “better company” (in city), but also may get job from BEST company (in city) in near future. Should I just stick with current job to get some income/experience, turn down “better company” offer, then wait for “best company” offer?"

This is outside of my role for the internship job, but I'm interested in creating a GUI application that can interface with the payroll software(as a side project) and help Mac users navigate more easily. It's sort of like going from Git to Github Desktop.

I'm not sure where to start, and I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice. I tried Googling and found tutorials on making GUIs for desktop applications.

Debating between building a desktop and buying a high-end laptop yet can't seem to find advice.,DerangedPrimate,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/8tobwy/beginning_college_in_the_fall_debating_between/,"Hello all! This is my first ever Reddit post, so forgive me if anything is improperly formatted or something.

Anyway, as the titles says, I'm beginning college this fall as a civil major, and I'm having difficulty deciding whether a mid-range desktop or high-end laptop would be best for school. I'm reading a number of different threads in which some say a laptop is the way to go while others strongly recommend a desktop/notebook combo.

My university here in Texas doesn't require engineering students to have laptops and, being heavily focused on helping low-income students who might not be able to afford one, has plenty of decent computers all around campus, though I don't know how many have the CAD software I expect I'll be using.

For a few months, I've been planning on building a gaming PC with a Ryzen 5 2600, 16 GB of RAM, and either a GTX 1050 Ti or Radeon RX 500 series video card for games like Cities Skylines and Planet Coaster and also using it for school. However, after doing some research, I've started thinking about portability. I plan in living on the campus, but being able to work on a powerful laptop in study group sessions or at the library if I need out of my dorm sounds really attractive too. Still, I plan on getting an internship or summer job next year, and a desktop would likely do the job better than any laptop.

I've used a cheap HP notebook these past two years of school, and I imagine it could be used in tandem with a desktop pretty well after some upgrades (which I don't know if it's upgradeable) and repairs.

Now that you know about my dilemma, I'd like to hear your input or about your experience in college with this. What served you best in college for CAD and other school work?

Sorry for the rambling post and thanks in advance! :-)"

My plan is to apply to all the software related positions I can find, both jobs and internships alike. I plan to solidify my computer science fundamentals, especially in data structures and algorithms in the meantime and when this internship is over (mid August).

Is this a good plan? I was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences, and would give general advice. I’m working in NYC, 40 hours a week at $15/hr.

I got my undergrad degree in public health a year and a half ago. Went through a nasty divorce so I just kept working my retail job (Costco-I make $25/hr, hard to leave that) until things settled down for me. 

I was accepted into an accelerated MPH program- can be done in less than a year. I don’t feel that I’d do well working my job and doing such an intense program so I’d have no income. So I’d be paying $25,000 plus for school and also paying  living expenses for a year in California so rent sucks.

So I’m scared about money, I’m hesitant about an accelerated program, will I really get the experience I need in such a short time? And I am worried about being able to quickly find a decent job afterwards. And I always wonder if it truly is what I want to do- I did a short internship at a health department but still haven’t worked in the field enough to truly understand what it entails- haven’t been able to find any entry level positions in my somewhat rural area to get that experience. 

I started looking into certification to be a health inspector because I can get into that now without a masters and possibly go back to school in the future. Of course if I can get hired in a trainee position, something else that’s not for sure. 

I cannot defer grad school which sucks, I can always reapply and go next year and save some more money. Or go back to where I got my undergrad for a two year MPH program next year, which would cost less for school and living expenses.

I feel like I'm forced to take a job which a graduated with but I know I would hate it so much. ( over the last 6 months I did an internship and it was honestly the worst time of my life). "

I graduated in May with a Computer Science degree from a small liberal arts college in Massachusetts. During my time there, I had an internship with my college and my senior project was creating a website in React for the Mayors office in Boston.

While those things sound pretty cool, I've applied for probably a hundred jobs in the last year and have heard little to nothing in response. My resume and my linkedin are both as polished as can be, and people in the industry have reviewed them.

Currently, I was able to find an internship with a company called Rackspace in Virginia. It's a great position, but I need something full time. They interviewed me for a Dev Ops role (the only positions they have open currently), but it wasn't a fit.

I'm scared. I don't know what else I can do to find a job at this point if no one will respond to my applications. I doubt I'll be able to keep my job at Rackspace, and I don't have enough technical knowledge or experience to get anything other than an entry level position. I've reached out to so many people in my office to mentor me, and I've learned a lot in only a month here, but it doesn't make me any less nervous. In a month and a half I'm out of a job, and I don't know what to do. I know so many people who hold jobs in companies, but no one has been able to help me.

I just want to learn. I just want a job. Getting turned down for the Dev Ops role felt like my lifeline being cut, and I'm a dead man walking come August. I'm having trouble sleeping and I'm waking up in the middle of the night. I'm a twenty-two year old man and the other night I cried into my pillow. It's pretty embarrassing, but at this point I'd really appreciate some advice from people who have been through this. I moved to this town at least two hundred miles from my college, my friends and my family, and I feel so alone.

8tui9i,2,2018-06-25,About to sign a contract for a painfully shit internship. Ama I guess haha,ndertale,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8tui9i/about_to_sign_a_contract_for_a_painfully_shit/,"I've never beaten the last interview for an internship, so I guess I'm about to leave university with zero professional work experience, which apparently cuts me off from 50% of employers, probably cancelling out my degree. Most of the time this is down to me not really being interested in the job, or just having shit interview performance for some other reason, but sometimes - especially my rejection just now - the interviewer is fucking clueless and you have no idea what they actually want from you. There's one silver lining, which is a one month fallback internship I am about to agree to, but this is definitely more of a brown lining for the following reasons.


I keep thinking about the old job triangle meme. There's a label at each corner: ""interesting"", ""well-paid"" and ""legal"". The idea is to describe your job you have to cover up one point, because you can't have a job that's all three. Here's how the triangle applies to this shitshow:

Interesting: No. It's a company based on something I'm completely uninterested in, in a department that's not remotely close to what I want to do in the future. I will be an unpaid intern, having I don't know what work delegated to me by an actually paid intern. I have never heard of a situation like that.

Well-paid: No! The contract states this is an unpaid post, 9 to 17:30 five days a week. Thrillingly, to get to the place I have to pay to travel by train... and there's no travel reimbursement so I'm losing money for this. The company project I will be helping on is worth £250m, but they were unable to spare 0.00000072% of that to do almost the right thing and reimburse my travel. This especially stings now I have sunk around £60k into my degree.

Legal: It really fucking shouldn't be legal, but it will be once I sign!

Seeing that contract confirmed all my suspicions about how I was able to secure that after my Hindenburg of an interview, where it was painfully clear I was totally unqualified. The one upside is in theory I get some work experience. Well, worst case, I get no meaningful experience and am just as unemployable at the end as at the start - but poorer. Best case, it's a single month of irrelevant, barely transferrable experience, without even any pay to compensate. Hardly makes me competitive.


If you're anything like my mum you will be thinking of worse jobs I could be doing. I will now present some traditionally crappy jobs and articulate why this is worse:

Waitress/fast food staff/toilet cleaner: paid
Charity volunteer: rewarded in mega brownie points and community adoration. Moral glow and self-worth from helping those in need, instead of helping a big rich international company increase said big riches
High-pressure unpaid banking intern: for being massive capitalist bumlickers they deserve what they get. They even perversely enjoy it
Close proximity to nuclear materials: can bet they get paid; chance of a cool mutation
Slave: the slaves earned a non-negative salary
Tramp: Travel necessarily free; I would make money picking up pennies off the street; may even gain experience liaising with other tramps for good places to find money; excellent preparation for my life after university
Monk: paid in Heaven Points; not allowed to talk so no need to communicate with idiots; no decrease in the amount of sex I'd be having


The bright side: a friend said I will be the 'coffee mule' and I'm too pessimistic to imagine anything else. I suppose I look forward to the challenge of doing the absolute bare minimum to not get fired (which I feel is my right) and I guess r/rant will have a little spike in content during August.

I hope you found this rant entertaining; if not I've failed at that too and I insincerely apologise. I will close with some Asked Questions from my brain and other people I have talked to about this:
Q: Isn't this first world af
A: Yes but I want to exercise my right to rant, god damn you. I think venting is completely reasonable given the crappiness of the situation compared to similar first world problems
Q: Can't you just leave?
A: I am in a situation which it is probably best I don't explain, where at this point I have to take the role. The rejection I mentioned at the start was my last hope at having a decent reason to dodge this cancerous job. So far I've resisted the urge to email the company that rejected me, explaining that they've doomed me to the shittiest internship I've ever heard of
Q: I am an irresponsible recruiter who likes the cut of your vitriol, and I'd like to hire you! Down for any part time work that's actually fucking paid, because we realise you're a human who's doing work?
A: Very funny (contract up front thanks)
Q: Aren't you *really* just angry at how shit a person you are?
A: Of course but I thought taking the above angle would be more engaging


Anyone know what the employment version of an incel is? I think I have what it takes to join the ranks. I look forward to any replies, just don't expect me to change my mind or respond maturely. Tips on surviving this shitty month would be very welcome. In the meantime I'll be practising spitting into full mugs of coffee.

TL;DR: Fuck you. I refuse to summarise my rant for your convenience. Go and read it"
8tumlg,7,2018-06-25,Just graduated - looking for advice..,ManatWork1993,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/8tumlg/just_graduated_looking_for_advice/,"Hello, all. I graduated in May with a bachelor's in LAS, after a couple of hectic years: full semesters were interspersed with part-time semesters, plus a semester abroad added to the mix. Most of my focus was on the things happening in my personal life; I was about as far removed from campus life as I could have possibly been. However, after managing to turn a 4-year degree into a 6-year one, I am finally done with school.

My problem is... I did not plan at all for this moment. While I was in school, I gave more thought to what was happening in the moment than to the end goal. I had no discussions with my academic advisors about future plans - no job searches while I was still a student - nothing. Currently, I am employed at a job where I am able to make ends meet, but it is not a job that I want to spend the rest of my life doing. 

And so, I am looking around to see if anybody has any advice for me. Truthfully, I am pretty uninformed about the job hunting process. I have hardly any school acquaintances whom I can ask about it, either.

Here are a couple of ideas that I had, though: 

\-UIUC Career Center: I was wondering if anybody on here has experience dealing with the Career Center. I never made use of it while I was a student and was wondering if its services are valuable to me as a recent graduate. 

\-Internship: I did not intern while I was an undergraduate, nor am I terribly familiar with how they work. Are internships still beneficial to a recent graduate such as myself, maybe as an alternative to starting an actual career? 

Is there anything else that I can/should be doing at this point in time? Any campus services that I can make use of that I'm not aware of?

Now that the dust has settled, I want to focus on the next step. Any advice you all have for me, I appreciate and will take note of. "
8tuno8,5,2018-06-25,Anyone ever been hired for a good job then completely hated it?,throoownm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8tuno8/anyone_ever_been_hired_for_a_good_job_then/,"Hello, this summer I was hired as a software development intern for a large company, though they don't deal primarily in tech. It's pays better than I could have asked for, the people there are very nice, the culture is laid back, the benefits are great, and yet I dread every second of it. 

Every day is spent exhausted, frustrated, or just plain bored. I don't find what I'm doing to be engaging in the least, I can't stand pair programming (which is huge in this office), and I don't have a mentor. All the work I do is with another intern who doesn't know any more than I do. And even though I can identify that these things are making me unhappy, I still feel guilty for hating such a big experience that many people would gladly take.

The whole experience has me feeling trapped in a situation that feels endless, and I'm scared about what my career will look like in the future. I'm terrified that I'll be doing work like this for the rest of my life and be feeling this forever. I've started considering new paths, but that's scary too because there's no guaranteeing those will be any better. This is all made more confusing by the fact that I really do like coding. While some classes are less engaging than others, I feel engaged and excited about learning in university (software engineer for context).

Sorry for the ranty post, but I want to hear from people who may have also experienced this. If you have, how did you pivot into something you enjoy, and how did you identify the most likely causes of your dislike of the job?

I should also mention, I am taking steps to find a solution. I'm looking into other career paths and am trying new things in my spare time to see if anything really makes me tick, or could help me pivot to a different place in software development.

Thank you for any advice!"

8tv7f5,2,2018-06-25,Should I give up on my aspirations of becoming a developer?,juniorIOSDev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8tv7f5/should_i_give_up_on_my_aspirations_of_becoming_a/,"I have self learnt basics of iOS app development and am able to create small iOS apps with basic functionality, and can try and figure out things that I don't know (though at times it takes quite a while to do so). I wouldn't say that I am a strong programmer yet, but I know my way around and can create apps. I have no prior programming experience and was a research scientist at a Pharma company for around 5 years, but I always had this urge to create something which resulted in me trying to learn Swift and iOS app development.  


I am based out of Stockholm and have been trying to secure a junior developer/intern role for the past 7 months with no success. The finances are already a cause stress and not being able to secure an internship has been really demotivating for me. I have started to lose interest given that I am not able to utilize any of the skills I have acquired over the past year and a half, get any real world exposure and learn from great developers. Since I do not have a degree in the related field therefore it's almost impossible for me to secure an internship. As for getting hired in a junior developer role, I don't think anyone wants to risk that given my lack of experience. Additionally I am not sure if being a female (who studied Pharmacy) trying to learn programming sounds more risky to most of the companies who are not willing to believe in me and take their chances.  


I understand that most people will suggest that I should go on and fight hard until I find something, but it's getting really hard for me given that I have no one to learn from, no real world exposure and no money earned to pay my bills. I have gradually started to lose interest as a result and haven't been learning anything new for the past few months, and just keep on applying for internships (any mobile/frontend/technology internships I come across). Has anyone been in a similar situation in the past? Should I try and get back to my old job (Pharmacy) as things will only get harder because the clock is ticking and I have no real programming experience/degree to showcase to any future prospective employers. Thank you in advance for your input! Appreciate it!"

8tvmzh,4,2018-06-25,"I'm a CS major who's graduating soon, and I feel lost... extremely lost...",cscqokpy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8tvmzh/im_a_cs_major_whos_graduating_soon_and_i_feel/,"A little bit of background about myself. I am going to be a senior next this fall at a top CS school, specifically one of the public variety in northern california. Basically started college off with a golden spoon in my mouth right? My freshman year I loved CS, basically aced my way through all the introductory weeder classes except for math which I did pretty average in. Then, my sophomore and junior year, I was hit by a combination of depression, health issues, and family issues (dad got cancer). It was hard to get out of my bed before 1PM. I skipped, pass no passed, and dropped classes. I went from taking 20 units a semester to taking the minimum of 13. I didn't participate in any extracurricular clubs or activities. I stopped contact with many of my friends that I made my freshman year. Every day, I went to bed daydreaming about impossible rewind time scenarios, to the point where I couldn't tell the difference from a realistic future and the one I was daydreaming about.   


Towards the end of my Junior year, I decided that I really needed a change after some deep LSD fueled introspection. I'm still depressed and suffer from mild anxiety, but I've started working out, going to bed earlier and waking up earlier, playing video games less, etc. I've started reconnecting with some of my old friends and while I'm still suffering from some personal health issues (mostly leads me to feel very tired throughout the day), I'm slowly improving my life and getting things together.  


Despite the positive moves I've been trying to make in my life, the one thing that has really kept me anxious and depressed is how far behind I feel to my peers. People who used to beg me for help on projects now have internships at Big N's, and are TA's or board members of CS clubs on campus. They have a plethora of personal projects, and have worked hard to maintain their GPA's. Meanwhile I barely got my internship through a connection, have close to no personal projects, and maintain a poor 3.1 gpa with quite a few pass no pass classes. Many of my classes I BS'd through, and were conceptual rather than practical questions. I haven't done any leetcode practice. My coding is so rusty, that I had to look up Java documentations for HashSet's just a few weeks ago when I just started looking towards doing coding practice again.  


Right now, I'm basically left with an extremely empty resume, very very rusty coding skills, half assed algorithmic and conceptual knowledge I'm not even sure how much of I retained, and no good practical knowledge (from looking for an internship, I realized that a lack of understanding of web technologies at a fundamental level was a huge gap/skillset I've been missing). I have no direction of what I want to do when I graduate. Do I go work? Where? Do I go to grad school? master's? MBA? Is it too late? Is my GPA too ruined to even think about that?

I know I could be in a worse place, but right now I feel buried by inadequacy which is kind of inhibiting my motivation to improve. Not only that, but I can't really grasp a solid direction I want to have. I no longer feel the same kind of passion for CS I did when I entered college due to this fear or failing even more.  


Recently I set myself a goal, something that is lofty, but achievable: By the time I'm 30, I want to be working for Google in the Japan office (I'm not a weeb, I recently took a trip to Japan and really feel in love with the food, architecture and infrastructure there, it really fits my preferred pace of life).  


This post is more a plea for help and advice, for plotting out a potential roadmap for how I might want to get there.  


Right now the plan is this:  


\- By the end of September, I want to have finished the majority/all of easy/medium leetcode questions, alternating between java, python, and c++ implementations. 

\- Picking up technologies. I want to learn how to make restful API's, general javascript infrastructure, and gain some experience with certain javascript technologies/libraries such as reactJS, angularJS, and nodeJS.  


\- Work on a personal project. A friend of mine got me into the whole bitcoin mania recently, so I've been learning how to program smart contracts in solidity on ethereum, and potentially using react js to make a web interface for my project. I don't feel passionate about this though, and the blockchain club on campus has a sort of elitist culture that heavily deters me from wanting to pursue a community on campus interested in it as well.

\- Find a full time job by the end of the year. I'm not picky but I want to shoot high. If history has told me anything, people often fall short of their goals so it's better to set them high, thus falling short won't disappoint me. Ideally, I want to work for a larger startup or unicorn since I think that when I'm young is the best time to give it a shot at one of these kind of companies.

\-Begin learning Japanese (once again, not weeb so I have minimal knowledge, but studying languages has never been tedious for me in high school so I think this should be fine.)  


Things I'm struggling with:

\- A lot of companies seem to want specific knowledge. Data science backgrounds, experience in AI/Machine learning (natural language processing, ranking, etc), mobile development, etc. The past two years, I have not fostered any direction I want my CS career to go. I just have very general knowledge of algorithms, networking, databases, architecture, etc, none of which is actually practical (rather, more conceptual). A lot of things seem like they require some sort of grad school, research experience, specific classes, or work experience, none of which I have, nor have much time to acquire.

\- Time is of the essence. I'm not sure how to progress efficiently with my plan. Sometimes I'll spend a lot of time on really mundane things while coding like figuring out the syntax for something, and with my internship right now, I don't have much extra time to work on myself, but I know I'd be much worse off without it.

\- Networking. I have no fucking clue how to reach out to people on linked in. I went from ENFP to INTP in the span of 2 years if you believe in that Myers-Briggs stuff. I find it very hard to hold a conversation online, as well as in person. It's gotten to a point where I struggle to maintain eye contact with strangers, and can't regulate my voice volume properly.

\- Getting in the mindset of properly focusing and consuming rigorous or academic texts. I swear it feels like I haven't properly sat down and read a book in forever. My mind wanders. I can't even focus on TV shows or video games anymore. There have been days where I just lie in my bed flipping through different apps on my phone and sleeping. I've found myself trying to do work, and then flipping to random youtube or facebook videos just moments later because I can't focus. If anyone has tips for getting psychological help or personal exercises to improve focus, that would be greatly appreciated.

\- My resume is likely complete garbage. I have no decent interview experience (current position just asked some very basic questions like how to implement a stack with a linked list, and how inheritance works). I have no idea what my priorities should be in improving myself.  


Any advice to help me would greatly be appreciated. If you have any personal experiences or advice you wouldn't be comfortable sharing with everyone, I would love to have some PM's. Even stern reality check type comments that are a bit mean  (in terms of goals, unrealistic plans, bad understanding of my current situation, etc) would be appreciated since I need some to ground myself, since I'm lacking both positive and negative feedback. If you read all of this, thank you for taking your time.

They all pay roughly the same.

1. Defense contracter, low level stuff, chance to work in lab hands on stuff embedded systems as well, can continue into the school year possibly get clearance down the line. Hands on stuff sounds cool, clearance could be very useful.  Really don't like the commute though and not sure how useful super low level stuff will be for Big N interview/job.  30-1hrish commute.


2. Fairly big company, would be doing web application backend stuff, feel like this might be most relevant out of offers if I go for a big 4 intern position next summer? 10-20 minute commute.


3. Small start up, data science position, kind of cool since I am interested in data science more, but not as big of a name as other companies, probably not as much support either (but maybe I learn more that way)? Afraid the lack of namepower will hurt and it might be a waste if I can't get a data science position w/o an advanced degree.  5-10 min commute.


If my goal is a Big N internship next summer what should be choosing?

Is it really impossible to get a data science job without an advanced degree, would it be a waste of time to take the data science position?

Any other thoughts you have, Thanks.

I don't know what types of things I should be doing though. An App? Web App? Super simple implementations of algorithms? I'm willing to devote a fair bit of my time towards this, I enjoy coding after all. I wouldn't say I'm a Java/C god in any form but I'm a relatively quick learner, so anything that could be picked up in a few weeks is fine.

Thanks all, and once again sorry if this is too frequently asked :s "

8ty2le,1,2018-06-26,"I am a 21 years old, rising senior college honor roll student, and part-time worker... and my mother still forces me to sleep at 12am.",icantsleepearly,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8ty2le/i_am_a_21_years_old_rising_senior_college_honor/,"I made this new account so my family doesn’t find this post. Tonight, I think I should ask for advice after my mother became abusive towards me after catching me downstairs at 1 AM eating a leftover McChicken. 

This has been going on for about a year now and I am very close to turning 22. Before I entered junior year, I’ve obeyed my mother by sleeping at midnight. When junior year came, my everyday life became packed because it was the year everything hit me. It was the year I started a part time job, became a board member of a big organization, applied for internships, struggled to keep my grades where they were, and stressed myself thinking about adult life. Of course, being a college student carrying that much weight, I started to sleep late. Some nights, I stayed up until 5am doing homework. The past year has definitely messed up my sleep schedule... but my mother still insists that I sleep at midnight. Because of junior year, I’m not sure if I have sleep anxiety or not but it now takes me 1-2 hours of trying to fall asleep when I try to sleep at midnight. 

Today, I’m on summer break and I’m basically working full time now that I don’t have to deal with classes. I only work night shifts (until 10pm) and once a week, work over night (6pm-3am). (My mother is completely okay with the overnight shift for some reason). These work hours play a pretty big role for my sleep schedule as well. When I get home at 10pm, there are lots of things I need to do that I couldn’t do in the morning, which causes me to stay up late. Showering, eating, working out, and browsing reddit are just a few examples. 

But that’s enough about me. Allow me to tell you a little bit about my mother. First of all, take into account that we are an Asian family and her main language is not English. It can be hard for me to communicate with her since MY main language is English and I have trouble speaking our native language. I speak English to her but she does not speak English to me. Her English vocabulary is limited but she will understand most of what I say. Although she’s very caring towards me, she sometimes can become VERY obnoxious, abusive, and unreasonable. Just today, while I was eating on the dining table, she comes to me and suddenly spews 1000 words a minute in a VERY harsh tone which caught me by surprise because I didn’t do anything that would really upset her except the fact that I was up late. She then threatened to destroy my laptop and video games if she ever caught me up past midnight again. What made me snap, however, was when she hit me as I was going back upstairs. This led me to write this post on my bed in the dark right now. It wasn’t a very hard hit but it was hard enough for me to know she’s pissed. 

My mother is also unreasonable and outright obnoxious at times. She will always think she is right even when it’s super clear that she isn’t. When I try to argue that she isn’t right, she will argue back in a way that reminds me of arguing against a kindergartener; repeating the same claim over and over, trying to talk over me, and sometimes she just says “No” and thinks it’s a valid argument. I never know how to argue around that and she always wins at the end. 

I’ve been quiet towards my mother about this for about a year now. Tomorrow night after work, I plan to try to sit her down and somehow talk her into calming down because I know she will be talking about what happened with the McChicken. That’s where the advice that you guys give comes in. I need everything that can help me convince her to stop telling me when to sleep like I’m a child. I’m asking for advice especially from other parents, sleep researchers, doctors, and others who have had similar issues. I’m never tired at midnight anymore. But I AM tired of getting hit and yelled at and then twisting and turning for 2 hours before actually falling asleep. 

Is it better to go to bed when I feel sleepy? Or is my mom right?

I spent an hour typing this as my mother thinks I’m sleeping 😏. I’m going to try to fall asleep now. I will check for replies in about 8 hours! Thanks!

EDIT: can’t move out because grandparents needs me as a translator and in cases of emergency. 


TLDR: I’m a grown ass man who pays bills and my mother still makes me sleep when I’m not sleepy. She will spank me and throw away my video games if she catches me up past my bedtime again. What can I do to prove to her that I am in fact a grown ass man who does not need a bedtime? "

Hi,

I just finished my first year in CS at a pretty good CS school (US) and received an internship offer to work at a startup (low pay, starts off remote but I may have the chance to move to SF with housing included). The job would be in nodejs/JavaScript, with some documentation involved.

One of my concerns is that, since it's 8hrs/day remote it might be fairly work intense..

The thing is, I am not too interested in the work and was hoping to use the rest of this summer as an opportunity to work imo interesting side projects. I would also be studying for some placement tests that can net me class credit.

For the fall, I will at least be a course assistant for a prominent class.

Will I be shooting myself in the foot wrt future recruiting if I don't take up this opportunity?

Thanks!"

I'm a recent Physics and CS grad (graduated in '17) currently teaching in China. I'm a US citizen. I've been meaning to enter the tech industry after realizing that a physics phd wasn't for me. I decided to teach in China for a year as my ""gap"" year so that I could learn Chinese, and because my teaching job is very laidback. 

I recently got a job as a software engineer (front-end) at a Chinese startup which I am incredibly thankful for. I don't have any tech internships or job experience in tech, which has made it very difficult to get tech interviews, especially because I'm in China. The job sounds like a great opportunity for me to get my foot in the tech industry, and they also use very relevant front end frameworks (react/redux/graphql/etc). I think I might also be able to get some experience there working with data science (maybe). The main problem is that software engineers in china are paid relatively little compared to in the US. 

I'm trying to decide if I should take this job offer, or try to find a job in the US. I've been having a difficult time getting interviews. If I head back to the US, I don't know how long it will take me to get another job offer. I think it would be safe to get some experience at this startup, then move back to the US. It should be easier getting past the resume screen after getting some experience. 

My questions are: are there any other cons to working in China that I haven't thought of? Would it be a better option for me to head back to the US and try to find a job there? 

Thanks!"

Everything was great, no issues with the landlord. Fast forward to a few months ago, my sister notified her landlord that she was looking to buy a condo and asked to remain in the apartment on a month-to-month basis, landlord agreed. My sister is closing on her condo next month (it got delayed/not her fault). The landlord is now saying she has to be out July 1 because his niece needs the apartment for a late summer internship. No exceptions. This isn’t ideal because my sister isn’t supposed to close until the 8th (ish) unless it gets delayed again and that’s not even a week away!

We’ve read the landlord/tenant statues for Florida and I’m not sure we understand them fully. She has paid her rent on on-time and has not had any other issues. They didn’t have a formal agreement for month-to-month, it’s all been face-to-face communication because he lives in the building. I told her to get everything in writing, but she thought everything was cordial - life lesson! Anyways, what are her rights as a tenant? What can she do to fight for that extra time, anything?"

I have transitioned into CS about 2 years ago from a completely nontechnical field, and I am about to complete my Master's in CS, which mainly consisted of core CS courses. Not surprisingly, I do not have internship or substantial coding experience, except what I did for my degree. I struggled a lot during my program and did not have the chance to take very advanced courses due to the duration of the program. I am interested in software engineering roles and I know I have a lot to learn and practice before I can land a job.

I am looking for specific advice on technical interview preparation, which entails more than ""go study CTCI,"" that I plan to dedicate the next three months. I currently practice on leetcode for a couple hours a day, but I will increase that amount of time to 4-5 hours a day or even more. Those of you who have been through a consistent and structured interview preparation phase or those who are much more experienced in the field, what would you recommend me to do and not to do during this period including when to start applying for jobs (graduating in August), and what kind of a schedule you think I should make if I can spend at least 5 hours a day for coding question practice?

So when users move from one place to another they  effectively move to a different VLAN however their Laptops do not auto-lease a new IP address from DHCP. This is all the information I have about the problem besides that flushing DNS cache has not helped or using Ipconfig /release.

Have you guys had the problem? how did you fix it? what can I  do to gather more data to be able to pinpoint the reason for this? what tools to use ?

Update 1: DHCP server is already set as authoritative.

Update 2: I was briefed today, basically they told me that they have did all they can checking the client side and DHCP and it seems that both are fine, except that the Dynamic DNS records of each client are not being updated so lookups provide a false address that is either leased to another computer or none at all."

8u27sp,4,2018-06-26,MemOK light solid red when ram is installed in slots 1 and/or 2. Is my motherboard fried?,PianoOwl,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/8u27sp/memok_light_solid_red_when_ram_is_installed_in/,"
So recently I started getting the occasional crash/BSOD and I would just restart and all would be fine. After a few days of this, I went to boot my PC in the morning and it got stuck in a reboot cycle, and my monitor would remain in sleep mode. 

I noticed at this point that my MemOK light was solid red, so I tried swapping my ram sticks around and that seemed to do the trick. This happened a couple more times and I would always just replace the ram and that seemed to fix it until yesterday. My PC crashed all of a sudden (no blue screen, but all the apps that were running at the time crashed with some kind of error message) and when I went to boot, I got the solid red light, and replacing my ram didn't do anything to fix it. At first I thought it was a faulty ram stick so I tried booting with just one stick and it worked, but after experimenting for a while I discovered that both ram sticks work fine when placed in slots 3 and 4 alone, but placing them in slots 1 or 2 (either one stick alone in slots 1 or 2 or both together, placed in 1,3 or 2,4) caused the same issue. 

At this point, I'm pretty sure that my motherboard is faulty but I want to make sure before I purchase a new one, especially because I'm still running a core i5-2400 and my mobo is an Asus p8-p67 (both ancient, I know, definitely bottle-necking my 980 ti) so if I replace my motherboard I have to replace my CPU too. I've tried reinstalling my CPU, using the memOK button, and playing around with the motherboard screws to no avail. I was planning on buying a top tier core i7 within the next few months, but I didn't expect to do it this soon, but it looks like I have no choice. I just wanted to see if there's anything I might be missing at this point, and if any of you have had this happen to you, before I spend all my money replacing it. I considered just buying one 8gb ram stick and using it in slot 3 since I can't use the 2x4gb sticks I currently have, and just waiting until I start working and possibly get an internship, but I don't know how wise it would be to continue using a (possibly?) fried motherboard."

Since these programs won't ever be used by the company and are just to demonstrate things would they sound bad/unprofessional if I put them on my resume?

I've taken two computing classes at university - not much at all, but I did well in them.

It's for a nonprofit food bank that needs assistance building a more efficient database and collecting data on how they expend and gather their resources.

I was told it would be 20 hours a week for 6 weeks, and I would be paid $1500 flat. So that works out to $12.50 an hour. Not much at all, but again, it's nonprofit. I wasn't expecting much.

At this point in my career, I'm in the very fortunate and privileged position of not having to worry about money. I do however desperately need the experience.

I've read that transitioning from nonprofit to private sector work is harder than it is vice versa. Is this accurate? I enjoy using technology to help people, but to be completely honest my own financial security and independence from my parents is a much more pressing concern to me. I'm willing to accept a low wage now as long as I can put some technical experience on my resume that will land to a higher paying job in the future.

One other option is to try and get a research position under a professor at the CS department at my university. My friends have gotten them, but I figured work experience outside of the university would be more valuable. If my goal was to prepare for grad school, I would try to get the research position. However at this point I'm more concerned with being prepared to enter the workforce as soon as I graduate with my BS.

Anyway, I'm just looking to brainstorm with other like-minded peers to see if my thought process makes sense at this point in time.

Comments appreciated.

8u44wd,346,2018-06-26,I'm starting to hate customer service...,sleepyhollow_101,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8u44wd/im_starting_to_hate_customer_service/,"In the center of one of America’s largest cities, surrounded by the blur and chatter of urban life, stands a small brick stationery store. It has clung to life through recessions, depressions, and the rise of the Internet. For over a century it has stood, home to the ever dwindling pool of people who are convinced of the importance of handwritten letters, announcements, invitations, and cards. One day, it may fall to the wayside, forgotten as email finally erases any and all need for custom stationery. But today is not that day. And until that day comes, you can find us there, standing behind the counter, waiting with a smile to see who might come through our doors.

I started working here a couple of months ago when I got out of graduate school. While most of my friends from grad school went on to take internships and positions with government organizations or consulting firms, I found myself drifting listlessly away from any line of work that was even remotely related to my field of study. I’d found myself exhausted by my degree, and any suggestion of continuing along the same path made my stomach twist up into a hard little knot. I needed to find something - anything - to cure me of my burn-out. That’s how I found the stationery store.

There’s only two other people working here. My boss, Wayne, is a gruff man who never fails to show up to the store with a paisley tie and a neatly-pressed work shirt. His deadpan humor caught me off-guard at first, but I was soon able to keep up. He is quiet and reserved, a bit disorganized, but a talented designer who can work an engraving press like nobody’s business. He’s also one of the kindest men I’ve ever met, and treats me more like a daughter than an employee, constantly making sure that I’ve made it home okay and keeping the back fridge stocked with my favorite soda (Diet Coke).

Laura is my coworker whose specialty is graphic design. She’s a perfectionist, but not an inefficient one - she gets the job done on time, and it’s always pristine when she’s finished. She has a sharp tongue and is quick to laugh. Although she claims to be older than Wayne, you’d never know it. She is forever making her way to the gym, happy hour, or the trendiest new restaurant on the east side of town. The two of us quickly became partners in crime, designing new layouts for the store and turning Wayne’s hair prematurely gray.

I fell in love with the store on my first day at work. It’s the kind of place you can spend hours in, because even though it’s not very big it is packed full of odds and ends. On its wooden shelves - which always remain dusty no matter how much I clean - you can find jewelry, pill boxes, stationery chests, cards, scarves, pens, and puzzles. There’s something here for everyone, if only you can find it. While the city bustles and buzzes around us, it feels like time slows to a standstill inside the store. It’s the only place where I truly know peace.

I settled into the work easily, like slipping on my favorite pair of jeans, and the months flew by. I didn’t make much, but it was enough to live off of and I was happy. That’s all that really mattered to me.

I met many interesting people at my job, but that wasn’t out of the norm for me - after all, I’d worked retail before, and you meet all different sorts of people in a job like that. No, the only time that I felt truly bewildered… truly uncomfortable… truly terrified... was the night that Mr. Hapshack came into the store.

I was closing on my own that night. Wayne had kept me company during the day, but he was leaving around five for his nightly bike ride. “You gonna be alright here?” he asked as he grabbed his bag.

“Sure. I promise not to burn the store down,” I answered, not looking up from the invoices I was sorting.

“I want you to take an Uber home. Don’t take the Metro, it’ll be too late to be out alone by the time you leave,” he said, his voice stern. He was always worrying about me, especially since I’d moved into a less-than-stellar neighborhood.

“Gotcha. I’ll try not to get myself killed. Have a good bike ride!”

He snorted at my answer and walked towards the back door. Then, suddenly, he turned around and addressed me once more.

“Almost forgot. There’s a customer that might be coming in tonight. His name is Bill Hapshack and his order is waiting for him behind the counter. He hasn’t paid yet, but don’t pester him about it, I’ll send him an invoice - he’s been our customer for years now. Just give him the order as soon as he comes in.” Then Wayne paused in a way that told me he wanted to add something, but wasn’t sure if he should.

“Okay… anything else?” I prompted.

He relented and said, “Mr. Hapshack’s a bit strange. Don’t pay him any mind, he’s perfectly safe. Just a bit funny, you know.” He pointed to his head so I would understand what exactly ‘funny’ meant in this context. “Call me if you have any questions or any trouble.”

“Um… alright. See you tomorrow.”

After Wayne left, I puzzled over what he’d told me. He’d never given me a warning about a customer before. Suddenly I felt ill at ease trying to decipher why he’d given me that message. Maybe Mr. Hapshack was someone super rich and important and Wayne didn’t want me to embarrass the store in front of him. Sometimes we got rich, important people coming in for our products and I never knew how to deal with them. I liked to just hide in the back until they left.

As the hours ticked by, my apprehension grew despite my best efforts to control it. I found it was now impossible to focus on the invoices and put them back in their box, deciding instead to tidy up around the store a little - the store always needs tidying up.

I turned up the background music on the store computer and started to sweep, hoping that the rhythmic motion of the broom would lull my nerves into a false sense of complacency. What was I getting worried for, anyway? I’d been at the store long enough now that I could do most anything, aside from designing the stationery myself. Everything would be fine. I just had to hand the guy a box - how bad could he be? Unless, oh my gosh, maybe he’s really mean and he’s going to berate me, or maybe he’s snobby and will laugh at my second-hand clothes, I knew I should have worn something nicer to work today…

A freezing cold hand dropped down hard on my shoulder.

I clenched the broom in my hand and screamed, whirling around and stumbling backwards, trying to put as much distance between me and the stranger as possible. My wide eyes took in an equally wide-eyed young man, backing away from me and apologizing frantically.

“I’m so sorry, ma’am, I didn’t mean to frighten you! I called out but you must not have heard me. Really, I apologize…”

I stared at him as he babbled on, my breathing and heart rate slowing down. I began to notice that he was very good-looking. He was wearing a black suit tailored expertly to his figure. He had thick black hair and a well-groomed black beard. His eyes were brown and sparkled in his tanned face. Now my heart was racing for a totally different reason.

I cleared my throat. “No, no, it’s fine, it was my fault. I didn’t hear you come in, I was lost in my own thoughts. How can I help you today?”

He flashed a dazzling smile at me. “I’m actually here to pick up an order. It should be under the name ‘Hapshack.’”

“Oh!” I exclaimed, moving behind the counter and grabbing the box. “Here it is. Are you Mr. Hapshack?”

“Indeed I am!” He said, taking the box from me. “Do you happen to have a bag I could use?”

“Sure!” I said, bending down to search the cabinet underneath the counter, muttering to myself when all I found were flimsy paper sleeves. Finally I found a nice gift bag and stood up. “Normally we charge for these, but since you’re such a loyal customer-”

I stopped dead and my heart jumped in my throat.

Mr. Hapshack was leaning across the counter, the smile wiped from his face. His eyes were wide, staring, glassy. His mouth hung open a bit as though he had seen something terrible. He stared at me, leaning so far over that he was mere inches away from my face. I froze, not sure what to do.

“Say… how long have you worked here?” he asked, his voice very serious an almost contemplative.

“I… uh… A few months,” I said, holding the bag in front of me like a shield.

“Do you wanna know a secret?” he asked, his voice dropping to a near whisper.

“N-no,” I stammered, no longer caring about the possibility of appearing impolite.

He dragged himself even further over the counter until his lips were at my ear, his cold breath tickling my skin. “I can tell everything about a person just by looking at them,” he said.

He pulled back and studied me, his expression never changing.

“Do you want to know about yourself?”

I shook my head, now too petrified to speak. I briefly considered running for the door, but I’d have to run right past him and the aisle was far too narrow to avoid him. The phone was similarly out of reach - I was trapped. My hand fumbled beneath the counter, looking for the box cutter I knew was within reach.

“You’re reaching for a box cutter right now, thinking that you can defend yourself since running isn’t an option,” Mr. Hapshack said, his eyes boring into mine.

My hand fell limp and my jaw dropped.

“You’re 24 years old and you’re allergic to peanuts. You’ve never done drugs but you drink too much. You don’t own a car because driving on the highway at night scares you too much.”

Everything he was saying was true. My skin felt cold and clammy. I prayed to God that he wouldn’t continue.

“You hate what you’ve dedicated your studies to so you’re hiding out in this dump, waiting for something better to come along. You fantasize about what it would be like to rip your own teeth out with a pliers. You smile at any man who gives you the slightest bit of attention like the pathetic little slut you are.”

Then his expression changed and he smiled at me, rather pleasantly. Tears were streaming down my face as I pressed myself back against the shelves behind me.

“Do you want to know how you’re going to die?”

I finally found my voice again. “Get out! Get the fuck out!” I shrieked.

“You’re gonna get a bullet in the stomach, two in the chest, and one in the neck. And you’re gonna bleed out on this floor right here while everyone watches. And then you’ll burn in Hell like everyone else. Won’t be long now, I expect. Won’t be long at all.”

And then, just like that, his snapped back up, standing straight and grinning. “Thank you for the stationery. I’m sure Wayne will send me an invoice later. See you soon.”

With that, he turned on his heels and walked out the door.

I locked the door and called Wayne in tears, hysterical from the encounter. He drove back to the store much more quickly than I’d expected, seeing as he was supposed to be on his bike ride. He sat next to me until I had cried myself and calmed down. Then, I gave him a much abbreviated version of what had happened.

Wayne shook his head, his face tense with anger. “I told him not to give you any trouble. Don’t you worry about him. Like I said, he’s plenty strange. Kind of a prick, too, if you ask me. But he’s not going to hurt you.”

“He… told me how I was going to die…” I said, choking on my own voice.

Wayne flapped his hand dismissively. “Don’t pay that trick any mind. He’s told me plenty of times that I’m gonna get flattened by a car. He’s just trying to upset you. He probably told you all sorts of stuff about yourself - how old you are, things you like, things you don’t like. Right?”

I nodded.

“Well, I think he goes around asking about new people he sees working and finds out what he can, then tries to scare ‘em. I’m not sure why he does it, but he pays an awful lot of money for his custom orders so we keep him around. If he really scares you, I’ll make sure you’re not here the next time he comes around. Okay?”

I nodded and thanked Wayne, even though in my heart I knew Mr. Hapshack couldn’t have asked around to find out all those horrible things about me. Those were things that nobody should know. Things I kept hidden deep inside.

Wayne drove me home that night and gave me the next few days off, which were sorely needed. After I’d had a few days to myself, I started feeling a lot better and was ready to go back to work. I really like the store and there was no way I was letting one creepy asshole ruin it for me.

I was getting dressed that morning when I got a call from Laura.

“Lily, where are you?”

Her serious tone gave me pause and a sense of dread filled my stomach. “I’m still in the apartment getting ready for my shift. Is everything okay? Am I late? I thought I didn’t start today until one…”

“Wayne’s dead.”

I was shocked into silence, listening to her sniffle over the line. Grief hit me like a wave once the shock receded. “How?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady and the tears from my eyes.

“He was hit by a car during his nightly bike ride. He died on the scene. So… you don’t have to come in today…”

Laura started crying, but I could barely hear her over the blood rushing by my ears. I mumbled something about having to hang up and ended the call. I thought back to our last conversation as I collapsed on the kitchen floor, sobbing into my hands.

He’s told me plenty of times that I’m gonna get flattened by a car.

Wayne’s funeral was held this past Sunday. Laura and I were there, of course, along with many of our regular customers. Everyone spoke about how much they’d miss Wayne, what a good friend he was, how generous and how kind. It was a beautiful ceremony.

As his brother was giving a eulogy, I turned my face away, unable to watch him on the pulpit without bursting into tears again. As my face was turned, I saw something out of the corner of my eye at the back of the chapel. I glanced back.

Mr. Hapshack stood at the doors.

Solemn and serious, he appeared just as any other mourner. Until he saw me. Our eyes connected and I saw the corner of his mouth lift just a bit. Then he winked and turned away, leaving us all to grieve.

I have no idea what I’m going to do now. But one thing is for certain.

I’m damn sure going to find a new job.

So I got a nice CS co-op job in the States outside of WW for the summer and was put on a team with 3 other interns and one newgrad who was starting at the same time as us to do a large fullstack project. We're 4 weeks into the term and I've pretty much come to the realization that the only useful programmers on the team are me and one of the other interns. The newgrad can't program herself out of a box, one of the other interns is an electrical engineer who has never programmed before (???) and the other intern is *okay* but needs a lot of hand holding.

At this point I'm doing all the backend + DB work while the other intern is handling the front end. We're doing our best to keep the others involved in the project but none of them seem capable of anything. The ECE and new grad have yet to write a single line of code, and the 3rd intern needs a lot of handholding. It's true we're all using a tech stack we aren't super experienced with but me and the other capable intern had no problem spending the first week or two studying up on the material. The rest seem unmotivated and uncaring about doing anything, and are just along for the ride.

On top of this, almost my entire team outside of the interns works out of another office nearby so communication is pretty tough, and they really only check in for progress updates and such which we give as a group - giving the illusion that we're all working on the project when it's really just the two of us. The only person regularly at my office is my Manager's Manager (who seems like a good guy).

So I still think we can get the project done between the two of us and with whatever contributions the others give us but it's become obvious to me it'll be 95% to 5% of the work. I'm also managing our version control, JIRA, and handling all the Confluence documentation. I've tried my utmost to include the others and keep them involved but it just isn't working. Half the time they aren't responsive to me when I try to teach the technologies/what I'm doing.

So my questions to my fellow students:

1. Do I keep going as I have been? I'm starting to worry that the project might not be completed by the end of the internship as it's largely just two of us working, with five capable developers it'd be a non-issue.

2. How do I make sure I'm properly credited at internships end for the work I've done? I'd honestly like to come back to this company upon graduation (although this situation is starting to sour me a bit on the outlook of this company) but I'm worried that if we do poorly it'll reflect back on me. I'd also like my Manager to know that the other intern and I are doing more than our share at this point.

3. How the heck did an ECE get through their junior year without any programming experience whatsoever? They went to a small school but it blows my mind they even got this job. How does the newgrad manage to have minimal technical ability? The interview process for this company wasn't the hardest in the world but it was definitely still technical with questions I doubt either of these two could have gotten through.

Thanks for any thoughts/opinions."

I am starting graduate school in the fall for Marriage and Family Therapy.

At my current job we just hired someone new and he has very very poor boundaries. Within ten minutes of knowing me he casually mentioned “blowing a fricken kids head off” while in Afghanistan, he stated his stepfather “beat the crap out of him”, stayed he was on probation while in elementary school, tried to talk to me about my religion, and said some choice words about his relationship with his girlfriend.

I’ve been sending pretty strong non verbal messages that I do not want to talk and that I’m uncomfortable. I avoid eye contact, I purse my lips, i deep sigh because I’m overwhelmed, and so on (not intentional I just realize now this is how I’ve reacted)

I’m no professional but it appears he has some boundary issues, and he reminds me oh so much of previous clients I worked with that were diagnosed with bipolar 1, narcissistic personality disorder, and borderline personality disorder.

I’m not the biggest fan of him, and it makes me wonder if I am going to be able to be an effective therapist.

The thing is, I was working with sex offenders with a range of disorders during my undergrad internship. During that time I experienced none of the feelings/reactions I have towards my coworker. 

What’s the deal with that?


I’ve had time to consider some things: 

1.)at my internship, a precedent had been set with the clients I was seeing. They were court ordered to the program they were in, and if they challenged it crossed boundaries it was addressed head on. They also had a lot more incentive to cooperate.

2.)this is my “personal” life, not a setting where I expect to be faced with this, nor am I expected or obligated to this coworker to be helping them.


TLDR: my coworker makes me uncomfortable, is this a sign that I won’t be able to practice as an effective therapist?

Curiously enough there is very little information on what more experienced developers go through with entering the big 4 or other large tech companies, or the unicorns, and also it gets more difficult to gauge what kind of accomplishments experienced workers have that get them shortlisted. Not just little information here but everywhere I look on the internet.

I have sent multiple applications to several large tech companies and get nothing in response. So I want to know how do I figure out what I'm up against? 

Currently my only option is to looking up random public LinkedIn profiles of people who have joined the big tech scene companies in their later years of work. And hoping to find some useful information about their past jobs and background. But it's usually like finding needles in a haystack."

I see no future in my country, I appreciate it and I dont hate it, but I don't see myself living in it for the rest of my life, I just want out. I did pretty bad my first year and barely managed to get into second year. Second year got better and I passed a lot of exams and got a free year (if you have enough ECTS points you dont have to pay for next year) and hopefully this year it will be the same. Unfortunately that means I have a pretty weak average grade. I've gone to the most popular Work &amp; Travel agency in my city and they didnt think I could make it, havent gone to the others yet, but am thinking about. The most important thing is that I want to find something from my field, I know what i specifically want to do(mostly stuff related to computer vision, generally machine learning in medicine or so) and am passionate as hell about it. Anyway I'm really oblivious to this stuff so I thought I'd ask around here. I was looking at ""The Humphrey Fellowship Program"" but it seems it requires a bachelors or 5 years experiences. Anyway I'm looking for your help, any tips, any internships or programs that might be worthwhile looking at? Even if it's something that might take a while, show it to me, what can I do now to maximize my chances later on? Does it pay off to email companies, ask for internships etc even if there's a low chance or so?
Thank you in advance."

I'm having a lot of difficulty in narrowing down where to apply to places that have a nonzero chance of giving me good financial aid. Last year I applied to a few places and got pretty much 0 aid everywhere. So far I have a 4.0 over 39 credit hours so I thought I would be more ""wanted""... but it feels like when transferring most people seem to consider only their chance of getting accepted. My family earns a bit over 150k so need aid might be mostly out of the question.

I'd like to plan to optimize my chances for this next year but I'm not really sure what to do or where to apply. I'll probably be able to keep a 4.0 this year so having had it for 2 years will help, but I'm guessing it won't be enough. I'd like to generally apply to places in California and the NE region (Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, maybe NY) and ideally I want to ""pay"" (as in take out in loans) less than $25k/year including housing and food.

Can anyone help me or maybe give some suggestions? I'm considering doing online college and moving to an apartment somewhere but I know that could hurt me as a STEM because it'd restrict my ability to get internships and other stuff like that."

(Rant warning)",PythonNerd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8u5eh3/ive_lost_almost_a_year_how_do_i_bounce_back_from/,"In July of last year I accepted a work study position at my college and was offered a position at the theater department, but I declined to focus on the university's IT internship that was being offered. Around October I was interviewed by the department sysadmin and he told me based on my interest in cybersecurity, I would be a better fit at one of the university labs that was doing research into that field. Come December, he emails me and lets me know about the open position.  I email the contact and they get back with me over Winter break, apologizing for the delay, and they scheduled me for an interview in late January.

Come interview, I pass the whiteboarding and the interviewer shows me around the lab, explains what work I will be doing, etc. All that is left is to fill our a form for human resources. I get the form but due to scheduling conflicts can't meet with him, so I turn it in to the department secretary in early February. I wait 2 weeks and send an email to the secretary, who responded that they did not get the HR form back from the lab, who was supposed to sign it.

I wait another 2 weeks and tell a friend about this, who is shadowing at the lab. One of the lab managers they shadow under asks me to come up and they would get it sorted out. So mid-march I go up and meet with them and they explain they just have to sign the form and send it down to the secretary and I can begin **volunteering**. Yes, this is a volunteer position. Anyways, late April I still hear nothing so I contact the manager again and he tells me he has no idea where my form went. I send an email to another manager in June and they forward it to the director, who says he or the interviewer will get back with me in a few days.

During the timeframe between April and June, one of my friends got hired in a paid position there, skipping the volunteering entirely. Another month flies by and I send an email again asking what happened. Tonight the director replied and told me there are no more open positions.

Almost one entire year later, a dead end. I've turned away half a dozen opportunities and patiently waited through a sluggish bureaucracy, just to still not have a position.

I have a few ideas of what I can do now. I've been doing business consulting on Upwork to some success and could take it to local companies. I could do web design work for local companies too. Another option is reach out to the PD or Sheriff's department and see if I can intern/shadow there.  I've also considered finding forensic projects on GitHub to contribute to, or making my own tools.

Any suggestions from where to go from here would be nice. Skills, projects, jobs, even websites."

I filled out all the necessary paperwork that the dealership needed.

So since I'm from NY the DMV would send anything related to my Camaro to my mother's address (I gave her permission to open things if I thought it was important). Around January 2018 she received a letter addressed to me saying that due to liability of not having insurance on the Camaro (obviously traded in) that my license was suspended.

Immediately I call the DMV and they just needed the transfer of liability documentation from the dealership then I should be good to go. I called the dealership on three separate occasions in January. The first time I was pleasant and just requested they take care of it asap since my license is on the line. They didn't fix it then I called again frustration in my voice and said send me the documentation I'll do it myself, she was short with me and said she'd take care of it. Still didn't get fixed and I got no documents in the mail so I called obviously sounding super annoyed and the same woman hung up on me.

Fast forward to May 2018, I'm changing insurance companies for my 2017 Malibu and I get an outrageously high quote. Why is this? Oh my license was suspended from January to March? What. The. F*ck. I call multiple times and leave a message with a receptionist (or intern?) And the same lady works with paperwork so I get no calls returned so I give up. 

I finally get a call about 2-3 weeks ago from an intern about her sending me documents to sign over the title. I ask her ""Why did you wait so long to do this?"" She literally said and I quote ""we didn't want to bother you"" you've gotta be f*cking kidding me, and no one decided to return my calls last month even though I was demanding answers? So I wait for paperwork which she never sent or it hasn't even come yet

Fast forward to yesterday I get two picture messages from my mom one saying I have liability on car insurance for the Camaro, and the other says the plates on the Camaro have expired so my license is expired again. I go to the dealership after work with my husband and I explain to the lowest level guy what's going on and he f*cking ignores me and has my husband answer for me. Super sexist I was not amused.

I come back this morning and speak to the manager and he grabs some lady to have me sign the transfer of title paerwork, he just walks away and shrugs it off like oopsie. Like my license is on the line and you just walk away like ""no big deal"". So I go after him and demand his General Managers number, he looked like he almost sh*t his pants when I asked. I get into work and coincedentely I work with multiple JAGs so I went straight to the one that has a forte in assistance regarding car salesmen. 

I was just wondering if there's anything I could go after these guys for because this shouldn't have happened in the first place and I don't want it to happen to any other military members in my area. Thank you. I might update later when things aren't so hectic."

First I tried to requisition a server to do work with, and when that didn't immediately work, I just started studying about the code base that they have. Then I managed to get the server, and jumped through a few more setup hoops to get things working, only to find that my server had too old an OS for me to actually do my work. Since I can only use one server at a time, I then tried to update the OS (they have a tool to do this), which caused me to wait even longer and prompted more studying. That caused the server to crash, so ultimately I deleted it and tried to requisition a new one, only the page for requisitioning servers doesn't even have that feature now! So currently I'm waiting (again) for a new server, which is really super frustrating since I want to contribute something. 

For context, I actually think the team I'm on is really nice, even though most are fairly older than I am, and looking at the code base, college seems to have prepared me pretty well to do the work they've assigned me. I really want to do good work for them, and you can tell they are starting to get a little annoyed that I haven't done any real work yet. If only working with their tools weren't so damn frustrating!

I'm a student on track to graduate from an accelerated BS/MS program in **December 2018.**  I've worked every summer since starting college, surveying several silos of the industry: from a couple of small computer vision startups, to a traditional (big) financial services company, a research stint at the university, and more recently (and currently) a couple of internships at startups that are approaching brand-name status in their respective spheres of influence.

At this point, I am conflicted.  The TLDR is that I want to apply to some of the big companies, because I'm envious of the technical problems **some** of their teams get to tackle, as well as their reputation; however, my current work environment is great and I'm reluctant to give it up.

&gt;!I love the place that I'm interning with currently.  It's in a geographic location that I want to be in for the next 5 years, has a lot of room for personal/professional/leadership growth, is using quite a few modern technologies that excite me, and the pay/perks are quite solid for a new grad.  Specifically, it's about $90k-ish post-tax, plus a fantastic benefits package, and equity options on a high-growth company currently valued just under $1bn.  The infrastructure and people are first-rate, with many engineers and senior leadership coming from years of experience at top tech companies.!&lt;

&gt;!But here's the thing.  I kind of feel like I'm lacking the rubber-stamp ""brand name"" work experience.  For context, I am graduating from a good school, but not a top-10 school.  My internships have been great, but none of them were with top-10 companies.  This is probably just a personal weakness, but I personally feel like I won't ever be ""in control"" of my career's trajectory until I have one of those names stamped on my resume, and the connections that go along with leveling up as an engineer alongside those brilliant people.  It feels silly to type out, but it's a nagging feeling.!&lt;

What do you all think? Am I foolish to be hesitant about ""settling"" for a good thing – am I that person on ""deal or no deal?"" who's wasting his time thinking about the swap?  

Regardless, when would be a good time to apply as a new grad to start in Q1 2019, when I'm likely to be receiving a time-bounded return offer at the end of August 2018?  I'm thinking that I should start sending apps out in the first couple weeks of July.

Any feedback is appreciated, and thanks in advance!"

I am working as an intern at a company and I am trying to configure an OpenWRT router and need to connect to it, however some of the settings I need to imlement and try out might lead to internet connection issues and I will be doing this while in a conference call over Skype. Does anyone know of a way to use one ethernet connection for internet access while being able to SSH into a router using a second connection? The issue is that they are techincally on the same network so the IP addresses are the same. Thanks for any advice!

First let’s say that I’m still not graduated but even if I would get the higher marks on my last exams my gpa average won’t change that much (due to my shitty attitude during the first two years of college). I am focusing on two things now:
1) getting a fucking good gmat score
2) find some good work experience (at the moment I am doing an internship in the public administration here in Italy , finance department. Still I think It will not be sufficient.

I am scared I will not be considered for any university and this is making me really depressed. 
Some of you who have been in a similar situation can somehow help me ? Advice, experiences, tips. Everything that can help is REALLY appreciated. I can pay you with some good pasta (you choose how).

One is at AT&amp;T, where I would work for three months as an intern (I would be the only one there, with a mentor assigned to me) in web development (PHP, JavaScript, SQL). I don't know much about the people there, since I actually didn't even enter the building, as the interviews were done by Skype.

The second offer is at an insignificiant medium-sized company. I would receive much higher compensation as well as benefits and I feel like the people there are really nice. I wouldn't be an intern though, I would have a lot of work to do from the get-go. I would build business applications for big corporations in Laravel (plus jQuery, Bootstrap and such for some slight front-endy stuff which isn't really the priority of the job).

I am really glad that I actually get to choose between two good options, and I am pretty sure I am up to the task at both of those positions. 

Which should I choose? AT&amp;T offers the brand and the opportunity to learn under a mentor, but the other company offers better compensaton, among other things. Also, does anybody know how strict are the background checks at AT&amp;T?"

8ucgqs,1,2018-06-27,"Need a career change, total lack of direction, is my solution viable?",Capp11688,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8ucgqs/need_a_career_change_total_lack_of_direction_is/,"Hello and thanks for stopping by. 

I am a 30 year-old man from Quebec with a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, dating a lovely woman (for 2 years this Saturday!), and working full-time at a decent job (not engineering-related; we'll get to that).  There's just one (big) problem: I hate my job (also, I suck at it) and it is starting to bleed into other areas of my life. Normally, someone as fortunate as I have been would be well equipped to simply change jobs, but many factors are complicating things.

**Lots of backstory of dubious relevance ahead (you can skip this):**

Unfortunately, for close to a decade, this has been a singular constant in my life. You see, I chose to study in mechanical engineering for no real reason in particular. My grades were good (I am among the legions of lazy students who could ace the test) and my parents were so generous as to pay my education, so why not? I didn't have any other particular passions or creative outlets (my activities were always lightly working out, reading, and playing video games), so I figured I would be pragmatic and work hard to get a diploma in a field with good job prospects. Except I didn't realize how passive or even more mediocre I would become. For the next 4 years, I basically bummed through, got very average grades overall, and didn't build any particular expertise or work ethic. I was always the one dragging his feet in every group project, made few friends (who I quickly lost touch with) and was generally unhappy the whole time, treating my misery with internet forums and video games. Aside: During this time I had two internships (with Dassault Systems and Bombardier) that went very poorly.

**Back to the more important stuff (you can still skip this):**

In spite of all my failings, I managed to graduate with a ""meh"" average (think C+), and, through a family friend, got a job in one of the companies where I had interned (Dassault Systems). My performance there was...poor, but that didn't matter as 6 months later all the new engineers were laid off.  From then on my job experience has been extremely spotty. I worked 1.5 years in a methods bureau in a factory (once again, very poor performance), then quit due to feeling depressed, spent 1 year doing absolutely nothing but living with my parents, spent another 1.5 years working in a call center (got promoted to a manager during this time), and then finally, thanks to my wonderful girlfriend, the job I am working at now.  Once again, however, I am still extremely passive and my performance is very poor.  Worse, it has now been almost 6 years that I have been out of university and my technical knowledge has waned greatly (not that I had much to begin with).  I have made some efforts to get some certifications on the side (took the EdX python programming, learned some beginner Japanese, took some project management classes), but while I am good at doing well in an academic setting, I have not taught myself the discipline to develop on my own.

In all of this, I desire nothing more than to start fresh, in a new field, and to reinvent myself, but I absolutely no idea how to begin. I have consulted several therapists and one career counselor (we have an order of counselors in Quebec), but I have never been able to get excited or interested at any of the results.  Everything feels so stagnant and stressful these days.

To that end, with all of the bellyaching above, I come, at last, to the reason I am writing this post. I am somewhat interested in studying full time at an accelerated pace to get a computer science degree from a good university in Montreal (2 years starting this fall). My thinking is that, while sub optimal as a learning experience (the resources online for anything programming-related are tremendous), this experience would allow me to refresh my skills in a new field, all the while providing me an environment where I could hone my work ethic.  Unfortunately, with all the mediocrity in my history, I fear that this is an evasion to a simplified solution (ie. get degree -&gt; get some amorphous ""job""), with no clear plan as to what comes next beyond ""become developer"" because ""I like computers, computer hardware, software, and have enjoyed basic programming on occasion"")

Am I being irrational? Should I try for a semester and find out? Have you ever been stuck in a similar place and if yes, what worked for you? Is this a work ethic problem exacerbating a career problem, or the other way around? I just dislike my situation so much that I am having a hard time thinking clearly these days.

Thank you very much for your time."

I just recently graduated and started my first software development job and I'm not liking it at all.

I have to admit I only accepted it as backup because it was the only offer I got at the time and wanted to renege later. Despite not everything working out, I ended up starting the job anyway. It pays very competitively with amazing benefits. This is the only reason to work here, yet I'll still try my best to learn given what I have until I find another opportunity.

As for why I want to quit, it's not a good fit culturally or for my experience. Everybody here is a middle aged FOB of a specific skin color. Now I'm not a racist and this isn't too big of a deal for me but I've already found it difficult to make lasting connections here, when everyone is speaking a language different from me and I feel I'll never be able to make meaningful conversations with them. I feel really left out here. Is this a concern people often have? I feel like I could be complaining too much here but like I said not my biggest concern. The culture within teams isn't ideal either. No one really talks to each other outside of meetings. I already know I'm not here to make friends but it is a complaint I have. The culture is super corporate and without interacting with anyone, I can feel it bleed through the drab lightning and cubicles.

I've had some internships here and there and they've all had pretty modern tech stacks. This company however is completely opposite. Most of the work here is porting legacy code to use a more modern tech stack, yet it's not very modern at all. Lots of windows development, manual code merging, no usage of git at all, proprietary framework, manual deployments, spaghetti code...everything I have been taught not to do is what I'm about to be doing.  It feels like everything I learned about structured development, writing clean code, etc has been washed away.This to me is the number one reason why I want to leave. I don't feel I will be growing at my full potential.

I applaud you if you read this far because I could have just trusted you to believe that I'm not liking this job at all. So now I'll ask some questions on how to handle this situation. I'd be completely cool if you offered your honest opinions on my complaints and if they're valid or I'm just being too pompous.

&gt;It's June right now and I want out ASAP. When does hiring season start up again for entry level devs?  
&gt;  
&gt;If I get an interview, do I tell them I can work ASAP? I know some new grad programs require everyone to start during January or summer.Should I include this job in my resume/mention it during the interview if I work here for a week? a month? 6 months?  
&gt;  
&gt;How can I make the most out of my short time here?"

I have a couple questions regarding job hunting and resume writing (I'm not asking for a resume critique - I need to write it first, then I will go to /r/resumes for that) 

My first major question has to do with what work experience to include on the resume. This isn't straightforward for me because of my rocky employment history. While I got my BA in linguistics, at my first full-time job after graduation I transitioned from office admin to Salesforce Administrator/Developer, and I worked there for roughly 3 years. However my mental health tanked in 2014, so I left that job, and that begins my rocky employment history - I had multiple short-term office admin jobs, all of which I failed to keep because of said mental health issues. Finally last year I decided to apply for grad school to study business analytics, and I started a master's program last fall. I maintained a part-time office admin job during this past year in school, and now I am doing a summer internship. 

Now I want to start looking for a job to start after my internship ends. My mental health has improved significantly since starting grad school, so I do not anticipate facing the problems that led to my prior job hopping. Ideally I want to find something related to what I'm studying and doing in my current position, so on my resume I want to highlight both my current internship, as well as my Salesforce experience as it's highly applicable as well. But I'm facing these years in between of unrelated job hopping. If I leave these jobs off my resume, I will have a massive gap between now and the Salesforce job, but if I try to include them, people will likely be turned off by the job hopping. They were all separate employers, so I can't use the ""combine them under a single temp agency"" trick either. How should I approach this problem when writing my resume?

My other question is about the timing and location of the job hunting. My permanent residence is in Orange County, California, but I moved to Phoenix for my internship. I will be moving back once it's over in mid August. I wanted to see if I could get something lined up for when I return, but I am not sure if I should start applying now or wait a little longer. I also don't know if currently being in Phoenix would significantly hinder me in finding a job - would it be better to just wait until I'm actually back home?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

8ufuer,1,2018-06-27,Best C# textbooks??,ForsakenWorms,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8ufuer/best_c_textbooks/,"Hi, I have a job interview in 7 days. This is a pretty big deal for me and was wondering if anyone could recommend any C# text books. Reason is I am in school for CS and took a class in C++ this internship wants me to know C#. I was wondering what the best resources were for self teaching the fundamentals in C#. 

I have a pretty good handle in the fundamentals of C++ just want to skim though the C# textbook. 

Any resource would be helpful, video, or interactive classes, but mainly books I think would be the best. 

Thank you for your time!!!

My current position:
- no actual mentorship, guidance or learning opportunities when it’s “talked” about a lot
- offered to help other projects outside my scope only to be mocked/talked down for not having skills at entry level
- no opportunities in other teams since I don’t have a full clearance (interim isn’t allowed)
- not given resources I need (for example, requested one new monitor since someone, don’t know who, took mine and I was denied since it cost money, so I’m using an old barely working small monitor and my laptop while everyone else has two large monitors and sit/stand desks)
- growing increasingly anxious/depressed/angry with growing back and neck pains, even had panic attacks for a couple months
- feel like the worlds biggest pushover because of the top-down culture
- i dread going to work and I want to leave. i only go for the money but lately it’s been going to medical fees that happened from this job
- i don’t fit in, my enthusiasm about technology has dropped heavily and my original aspirations are in the trash. i’m working with a new intern and i genuinely feel sad when he is so enthusiastic and lively about everything and I hope he doesn’t stay with this team because it was dream killer for me. i’ve been giving him “bs” marketable projects so he tell his parents/future employers that he accomplished something

I’m currently:
- working as hard as I can to learn marketable skills again
- applying to get any software engineering job anywhere at this point, keep getting rejects/no call backs. i revise my resume every two weeks
- exhausted everyday after work
- feeling trapped and I’m going to be “stuck” like this forever. maybe I’m a wishful thinker but I hope not every job is like this since this has been my only one

Maybe I’m just a depressed young adult but it was never this bad until I started this job. This is just the start of my career and I’ve regressed. And it feels almost impossible to get another “fresh” start, especially now that I’m even worse off than I was before. I feel trapped.

Has anyone been in this situation and have any advice for me?"

I am currently on my 3rd job out of college. At my internship and first job out of college I mainly used ASP.Net. This was fairly straightforward to pick up given my previous Java experience. Then at my second job out of college, I worked on Java web services, message consumers, and batch jobs. For the last two years I've worked for a consulting firm that is a Microsoft Gold partner and consequently, most of our projects are back on the Microsoft stack. Now that I'm starting to look again, companies near me are mostly split between ASP.Net and Java/Spring, with only a few using other technologies.

So what I'm wondering is, would it be in my benefit to try to prefer jobs working on one stack and get really good at it, or is it better to try to be more open to learning other languages/technologies, but having to ramp up?"

The stress is getting to me.,NSA_and_NSFW,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8ugzgt/should_i_lie_unemployed_for_a_year_the_stress_is/,"I graduated from a top school last spring with a computer engineering degree (ECE). I also am a veteran. However, I cannot even get an interview! I am 10k into debt now after using up all my savings. I have very little food and my vehicles doesn't seem to have much life left. I feel hopeless. I cannot afford to move to a new location. I cannot afford to accumulate debt. I cannot even obtain any of my old jobs again.

I have had my resume checked multiple times by many people such as school councilors, recruiters, staffing agencies, etc. Most people tell me my resume is impressive but here I am. The only feedback for improvement is to change the cosmetics such as font, size, etc; no recommendations to change the information. I have also written many cover letters and had them reviewed. I have gone to the VA and other vet services for employment but they have been useless - just a pep talk and runaround agency referrals. 

Before the military, I worked at Target for 2 years during high school. The only job I have had after the military was 2.5 years working in IT for the college I attended while I was in school. This ended when I graduated. When I was in college, I applied like crazy for internships but I was only offered one at an insurance company but I could not afford to move away for the summer on my budget. 

So far, I have applied to at least 300 companies in many broad areas from engineering, IT, lab tech, administration, retail, salesman, etc. I am not limiting myself to a single criteria except for a 100 mile radius (since I can't afford to move now). I have applied at all the local and state government jobs near me, I have gone to job fairs. I even took a job as a busboy for 3 months until the restaurant went under. About 14 job agencies have me ""on file"" and I call them about once every 2 weeks but neither of them has a job lined up.

I have only received 5 interviews (besides the obvious scams like MLMs or group interviews) but one told me that I was too qualified to work (Cashier) and the others told me they wanted someone with more experience for entry-level positions. I have thought about removing my degree but I just have a hard time with the idea because I am 26 would have a 4 year gap on my resume. I would also struggle to get by on my lack of experience - military cop, target cashier, and IT for a university. "
8uh79w,7,2018-06-28,Can an intern ask for a raise?,cnote1216,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8uh79w/can_an_intern_ask_for_a_raise/,"Three years ago I started working for an engineering company as a summer intern and I have returned every summer since. My training/skills/responsibilities have increased since my first summer, but my pay has remained the same. Is it reasonable to inquire about a pay increase without overstepping my position as an intern?

More details:

* When I began I hadn't graduated high school yet (though I did before that summer was over) and I have now completed my second year of college. 

* When I began I basically doing IT support for the office (installing software and reformatting drives). I graduated to helping with shipping and receiving the next summer and am now doing more engineering-centric work and even in charge of some subprojects that support the full-time engineers. I'm using a lot of what I study at university and would definitely consider what I do now ""skilled labor"".
* When I began, my pay was generous (~1.5x minimum wage) but I work hourly and that means no overtime, even on the occasional 12+ hour day. 
* There is currently another intern. Who is still in high school and far from graduating. (also worth noting they are  related to an employee) They are paid the same as I am now but are doing similar work to what I was three years ago.

I really like working at the company and the pay is generous enough so I don't want to cause a problem where there isn't one, but I'm in college and the extra money would go a long way. Is it reasonable to ask for a raise or should I just be content that I'm even getting paid for an internship in the first place?"

The internship will end in mid September and there are no current available vacancies at the moment, so no chance of getting a permanent job after my internship ends. 

My team basically consists of two people; a manager and an employee so unless the employee leaves there is no chance of future vacancies opening up in the next few months. This means that I'm actively looking for a job and here what the post is about.

As the title says, I was interviewed by a company two weeks ago and I had an interview with the owner of the place. (it's a small place). I had a phone interview as well with a Senior because he wasn't in the country at the moment.

They recently contacted me and what they said was this: Before letting me sign any job offer/contract they want me to do a 10 days trail as a ""part of the interview process"" to determine whether I'm fit for the job or not. I let the owner know from the interview that I'm not willing to leave my internship unless I sign a contract. She said that I can work on Weekends and work in the afternoons from 4 to 6 after I finish my original working hours. The thing is I finish at 5:30 so driving there I'd reach at 6 exactly so this is really inconvenient for me.

I don't know  how I feel about this whole thing and I don't know how I should respond to them. To be honest I didn't like the tone of the Senior guy who called me. During the call interview every time I replied to his questions with an answer he would make me feel like he wanted me talk more even though I talked quite a lot and my answers were to the point. He gave me a case study on how to evaluate a company's revenue during the phone call. I know this might be normal but I found him to be conceding in a way.

However, I really need to have a permanent job since it's been two years and 5 months since I graduated and all what I could ever get was internships. I'm really not sure how to handle this.

I'd appreciate your advices about this matter.  "
8uiova,2,2018-06-28,"Been strugging for months of emptiness. Everything that supported me is breaking down. First time ever, I genuinely think about suicide.",throwaway2896765,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8uiova/been_strugging_for_months_of_emptiness_everything/,"Hi to everyone who reads this. 

For the first time ever, I have legitimate thoughts about suicide. My life feels empty, goalless and just screwed up in general. 

It started last year when I just didn't want to come home anymore. My mother specifically was being absolutely awful to me. We had a fight every single time I would be there to the extend that the only way for me to cool things was to run away from home. I started seeing my GP and the psychologist after that, and things have bettered a little bit but home doesn't feel like home anymore. I still wasn't there most of the time. 

Somewhere around that time I started to deal with a burnout. School (Uni) absolutely killed me and all the friend I had made in the first year had disappeared because they stopped. I speak them occasionally, but they live far away. I do not enjoy school anymore. I stopped doing classes because I felt like I needed time to empty my mind. I was so stressed. 

My girlfriend was depressed and was suicidal at that time. I was there for her and had to remove a rope from her room once. It wasn't easy for me, gave me a lot to worry about. 

I somewhere about 5 months ago I saw my GP about my depressed feelings, high stress level and the feeling that a lot of things that seemed to be obvious/common sense to others, weren't to me. Last week I finally had my intake for psychological help for possible ADD and depression. 

Last Saturday my gf and I broke up. Well, she did. And as more time continues, the more I realise that everything I was still doing in my life: working on my car, going to school, searching for internships, was in the end for her. What I mean by that is that I didn't feel like I went to school for myself; I went to school for the fact that it could land me a good job, pay some money which we could use to eventually find a place for us together in a few years time. I didn't work on my car because I find it to be such a nice thing to do; I did it because she liked the car a lot and I wanted to be able to drive her around in it. We bought that car 'together'. I bought it financially, but the decision for this car specifically, was a joint decision. I went to work because I wanted to save up money for the holiday we had planned together. 

In the quotes the story about my gf and the breakup:

&gt;I wish I could have told you the things going on in my head in all honesty much earlier. I wish I wasn't procrastinating your very obvious hints. I just couldn't do it financially at the time because of the holiday we planned. And I hate the fact I never sat down with you to just tell you that. I have dodged the conversation forever because of reasons I don't even know anymore. I have promised you to do everything you ever proposed to do, but I couldn't ever do that. My money is limited. But I never told you that. I always just nodded and said yes and proceeded to not act on it. And that finally gave you the feeling that I wasn't respecting your wishes anymore.  
&gt;  
&gt;If I could go back in time and change one thing, if I could go back 10 months or so, I would've slapped myself in the face and told me to just tell her what the implications of that holiday would mean to me. 10 Months of financial stress in my head about how I am going to save up for that holiday. 10 Months of not acting on your hints and wishes, because I just failed to open up about it to you.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I still don't understand why you broke up. I get that you can't wait forever for me to finally take you to the places you've wished for for months to go. I completely get that. And I hate myself for the fact that I haven't. Because it very truthfully is the thing I would love to do the most; go out and dance with you. Hell you were the one who got me into dancing in the first place.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the other things you've said just don't make sense. You were acting just fine last week. We were even investing in ""us"", we had a perfect time when we got home. I can't remember a week you have said ""I love you"" as much as last week. I don't understand how you said this thing has been stuck in your head for the last two months. I cannot understand how, if that really is true, you could feel, or at least make it seem like you did last week.  
&gt;  
&gt;I know I've been having a rough time lately. Getting diagnosed with concentration problems, therapy taking forever to take me in, school being a major stress factor in my life, my car... Everything was killing all the energy I have. But we both knew that that would only take two more weeks. School's out for the summer now, I had my intake, and I finally am finding the time to do what I had been planning on doing since forever. If you could only see me now and see how much the fact that school's done and I'm finally being able to pick up on everything I've had to stall forever is changing me, I'm sure you would've never made that decision. I'm really a changed person in the few days time, I still can't believe it myself. I've started going to the gym, been doing some new recipes in the kitchen, I've finally started to finish up the projects that have been sitting in my room since literal years... For the first time in I think about a year time, I have peace in my head. But next to that peace is a void. A void that used to be filled with loving feelings and thoughts about you. A void that used to be filled with the idea of getting home to you. A void that used to be filled by the thought of, even when I'm having a shit day, I will lay in bed next to you tonight and then I'll be safe, warm and loved. Something I've always realised to be very valuable, but never this valuable. I miss the calls around 8PM. I realise how bad I feel I never valued that and that I never called you instead.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm still in denial. All the things you mentioned during the breakup sounded so fixable. And I know I've had the chance forever to fix them and I hate that I didn't. I wish I would've taken you out so much earlier. I hate that my mind was stuffed with stressful thoughts and I wish I had the mental space to think about fun stuff to do. All the initiatives had to come from your side, and I realise that very well.  
&gt;  
&gt;I still can't believe the way we met. That was magical. It was out of this world. I liked you back in high school, never had contact there and hadn't seen you in years, and all of a sudden there's you. At university. Starting out next year.  
&gt;  
&gt;I still got some stuff at yours that I have to pick up in two weeks. I'm scared. I'm in denial, I still can't move on. I still have the idea that you just had to cut the dirt away from your life like you do when you feel bad, that this decision was decided on very short-term and that if I show enough dedication everything will still turn out OK. But I guess it won't. You surprised me with how confident you were when you told me that I have been a great boyfriend for the last 18 months but that you cannot wait for better anymore. It feels so sour knowing that we both knew that everything was going to get much less stressful in two weeks, when school stops and everything. I can tell already how much that would've turned the tables if you had only had the patience. I wanted to go on the defensive, but something inside me told me that it was useless and I would only degrade myself if I did. So I didn't. Now I'm sitting here, thinking that maybe I should have even though you said it was definitive. I feel like I'm just living towards our meeting in two weeks with high hopes everything will turn out fine, I feel more nervous than lovesick. And that scares me to the thought that maybe the real downfall still has to come.  
&gt;  
&gt;People tell me it's stupid to think that I won't find a new love, but you hardly realise how special you were to me. You were a high-school dream come true. And maybe I can fall in love again. It will take some time. But meeting someone the way we did is never going to happen ever again.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm going to be honest; I want you back. I've had some time to think about it, I've had time to cry, I've had time to evaluate, and taking everything in consideration, our relationship definitely wasn't the easiest. I feel like I had to change a lot, maybe more than you had to. It feels sour that I was there for you when you were down, but now that I need you for a bit you disappear. But I also know deep down we have the same wishes for the future. And until the very last day, we could have endless talks in bed until you fell asleep, and I could just snuggle to you until I fell asleep too; feeling warm, loved, and at home in your vicinity. The love was still there; it's just that the frustrations for you got too much.  
&gt;  
&gt;Again, I wish I could've been more open to you. I wish I could've told you the honest, open and, actually, easy truth. I know you and I know you would understand. I know you would be there for me and find solutions together like we always have. I am so thankful for the emotional labor you have done and how much you have bettered me as a person. You gave me self-confidence back with your endless compliments on how I look. You made a man out of the boy I used to be. I miss you lief, I miss you a lot.

Finally, when everything felt to finally get a little more on the upside, she leaves me. School's running to an end now and a lot of stress is falling off my shoulders. I feel empty and useless inside; I can't do anything for myself. I don't have a home anymore, she was my home. I can't be at my parents' and I can't be on my dorm; I will feel either stressed or lonely and not at home at both. The last pillar I had solid ground on is now too collapsed. 

I have no future in my life. I don't enjoy my study anymore, regardless of the fact that I got this far already. I am scared of my internship. I have no hobbies or anything that could keep me engaged for longer than 20 minutes. It feels more like sitting out my time than it feels like living. I do not have a dead wish specifically, but I sure as hell don't want to live life like this. 

I need help. I feel like I'm falling further and further as days go by. I can't deal with this situation anymore. 

I always had the idea that I would only be able to ever kill myself with a bullet. Luckily I live in a country where that is not as easy to get your hands on something like that. Lately however, other options have gotten into my head and those are a lot easier to bring to practice. 

The summer holiday is only two days away now and all the fun things I had planned are now gone. I have nothing. My holiday is empty, and I will probably fill it with work that won't make me happy either. I want her back. I miss her so much. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this anymore. It's getting harder by the day. Every day again I get faced with how I fail to meet my own goals, how I fail to get out of bed early and get to do stuff. How I fail to get stuff done. I can't do this anymore. It has siphoned all the energy out of me and I want to end it. "

Please tell me if I'm in the wrong place - I need an objective look at this situation.

I'm going to be starting work on a college degree in the fall. I don't have a driver's license (working on it) or any work experience. I'm taking a single community college class as well, and it's of a class I took in high school, because I need the credit.

A few years ago, I found this low-key (but awesome and pretty prestigious) internship that I really, really, wanted, but I was only eligible for it this summer. I applied, and they strung me along from December until March, when they sent me a mail all of a sudden saying that it wouldn't work out. Upon further request for information, I received no acknowledgement or response.

By the language and paperwork they were sending me, I was under the strong impression that I'd get the position, and maybe because it was a dream-come-true situation, I didn't really consider any other options. After someone else's encouragement, in Feb I applied to another internship (highly prestigious and competitive, I didn't expect to get it).

I didn't get the job with the second company, but they offered to pay for a coursera class for me and 200 other people around the world, and afterwards we have access to job interview questions they use so we have a higher chance of success with them in the future.

It's early April now, and I'm freaking out about what I'm going to do over the summer. I'm applying to jobs left and right near my hometown and within a train ride's distance, to which I received zero response. I then widen my catch to jobs unrelated to my field of interest but also require no experience (restaurant and store jobs), to no avail. I likely didn't get the pink-collar jobs due to my age, lack of a car, and availability only over the summer.

My father managed to get me an internship/gig with a friend of his, where the boss deduced that I didn't have enough experience (I didn't have any) but they'd teach me a bunch of stuff over the summer. He assigned me a mentor with a big title and told me to spend &lt;= 0.75hr of his time per week and not to disturb his employees. The mentor dude proceeded to give me work to do, and we agreed that I only needed to come once a week. Going to the office is a big thing, as one of my parents has to work from home for the day to drive me. They don't mind, but they're pressed for work and honestly I feel a little guilty.

The office itself was agonizingly quiet - I almost went crazy from the silence. It wasn't even like white noise was playing and I just couldn't hear much - it was pin-drop silence. All day, except for lunch when the boss told people when they could go on their lunch breaks, and at the end of the day, when people told the boss they were leaving.

I love the work the mentor guy gave me - it's interesting, I'm learning, and it's something I'm definitely considering studying while working on my degree (this is an opportunity related to my umbrella field of interest). Problem is, going to the office is probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had.

At this point, I've found three solutions:

1. Just drop out of the gig altogether - I've got a side project I'm working on anyway, but chances are it won't amount to anything by the end of the summer.
2. Do the gig remotely.
3. Suck it up and go to the office.

8uls6e,2,2018-06-28,Doing a 'bad' gig (internship) vs not doing the gig at all?,as4rc,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8uls6e/doing_a_bad_gig_internship_vs_not_doing_the_gig/,"Please tell me if I'm in the wrong place - I need an objective look at this situation.

I'm going to be starting work on a college degree in the fall. I don't have a driver's license (working on it) or any work experience. I'm taking a single community college class as well, and it's of a class I took in high school, because I need the credit.

A few years ago, I found this low-key (but awesome and pretty prestigious) internship that I really, really, wanted, but I was only eligible for it this summer. I applied, and they strung me along from December until March, when they sent me a mail all of a sudden saying that it wouldn't work out. Upon further request for information, I received no acknowledgement or response.

By the language and paperwork they were sending me, I was under the strong impression that I'd get the position, and maybe because it was a dream-come-true situation, I didn't really consider any other options. After someone else's encouragement, in Feb I applied to another internship (highly prestigious and competitive, I didn't expect to get it).I didn't get the job with the second company, but they offered to pay for a coursera class for me and 200 other people around the world, and afterwards we have access to job interview questions they use so we have a higher chance of success with them in the future.

It's early April now, and I'm freaking out about what I'm going to do over the summer. I'm applying to jobs left and right near my hometown and within a train ride's distance, to which I received zero response. I then widen my catch to jobs unrelated to my field of interest but also require no experience (restaurant and store jobs), to no avail. I likely didn't get the pink-collar jobs due to my age, lack of a car, and availability only over the summer.

My father managed to get me an internship/gig with a friend of his, where the boss deduced that I didn't have enough experience (I didn't have any) but they'd teach me a bunch of stuff over the summer. He assigned me a mentor with a big title and told me to spend &lt;= 0.75hr of his time per week and not to disturb his employees. The mentor dude proceeded to give me work to do, and we agreed that I only needed to come once a week. Going to the office is a big thing, as one of my parents has to work from home for the day to drive me. They don't mind, but they're pressed for work and honestly I feel a little guilty.

The office itself was agonizingly quiet - I almost went crazy from the silence. It wasn't even like white noise was playing and I just couldn't hear much - it was pin-drop silence. All day, except for lunch when the boss told people when they could go on their lunch breaks, and at the end of the day, when people told the boss they were leaving.

I love the work the mentor guy gave me - it's interesting, I'm learning, and it's something I'm definitely considering studying while working on my degree (this is an opportunity related to my umbrella field of interest). Problem is, going to the office is probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had.At this point, I've found three solutions:

1. Just drop out of the gig altogether - I've got a side project I'm working on anyway, but chances are it won't amount to anything by the end of the summer.
2. Do the gig remotely.
3. Suck it up and go to the office.

I know #3 is the best because I'm taking advantage of the situation, but I feel like I didn't earn the internship - I just got it because I'm daddy's little kid and he's friends with the owner so they have to deal with me. It makes me feel like the spoiled brat that I probably am.

Two out of the four projects on my resume are web development projects, while another is a web scraper. I have had multiple recruiters tell me to take those off my resume and replace it with something companies want to see, preferably with something written in C/C++. I have done a bunch of coursework in C/C++ like rebuilding parts of the Pintos operating system and using the Huffman algorithm to compress files, but I'm not sure if I should be listing coursework as personal projects. I guess my question is what kind of projects can I do in C/C++ that could help me land an entry level job as a graduate with no internships or work experience? I also doubled majored in Economics if anyone thinks that I can use that to my advantage in the software industry."
8um1f4,2,2018-06-28,Is it worth to do a Master's in leadership skills for a Computer Science major?,genesis49m,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8um1f4/is_it_worth_to_do_a_masters_in_leadership_skills/,"I am anticipating a BS in Computer Science and graduating May 2019.  My academic advisor told me about a Master's program my university offers for engineering students.  It is a one year program, and it focuses on leadership and technical entrepreneurship within the field of Computer Science.  The university I attend is a Top 30 university, if that makes a difference.

It's kind of like a ""baby MBA"" program specifically for CS students.  I had never really considered pursuing a Master's before because my transcript isn't great.  I also know that a Master's isn't typically worth it for a student with a BS in CS that has no research experience, but this type of Master's is different since it doesn't focus on CS material but leadership skills.

I had a few bad semesters related to health &amp; family problems, but I was able to catch up through a lot of hard work these past two semesters and will graduate on time.  My current GPA is 3.18.  My advisor told me that it would help that I am an undergraduate student at the same university the Master's offers, and the average GPA for an incoming student at this program is 3.15.  Also, the school offers a 20-40&amp;#37; tuition discount for continuing students (i.e. since I am an undergraduate student at this university).  My advisor said the program has a 95&amp;#37; job placement rate.

I always thought I would pursue an industry job.  This summer, I am working as a web development intern for a medical school, and it is going alright.  I have only been doing it for a few weeks, so I haven't made up my mind one way or another about if I would want to continue as a web developer, look into software engineering, some other CS related job, or think about grad school.

If I do decide to look into this program, I would need to dedicate time to study for the GRE and to write my admissions essay.  Also, even though I would get a tuition discount, I would probably be in debt anywhere from 40k to 80k (I'm not sure about the total figures) as a result of getting my Master's.  I currently have almost no undergraduate debt to deal with because of great financial aid and scholarship money, so I am not comfortable with piling on so much debt for a program of one year, especially if it doesn't add much to my employment options or total annual salary compared to what I could be getting with a BS in Computer Science. 

I'm wondering if it's even worth applying for this program because of the necessary prep, or if I should scrap all ideas of going to grad school and focus on sharpening my programming skills and getting a full-time job after I graduate.  Would it be bad to try to do both (e.g. apply for jobs &amp; apply for this program), or would that be expanding my focus too far when I might be better off focusing on one thing?"
8um8f2,0,2018-06-28,How to persuade boss to use github?,xuhu55,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8um8f2/how_to_persuade_boss_to_use_github/,"Here's some history:

I was able to convince my President to buy me 1 year premium of DataCamp to learn R. He was then able to persuade my CEO to authorize the purchase.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8sdwiu/president\_and\_ceo\_of\_startup\_fight\_about\_giving/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8sdwiu/president_and_ceo_of_startup_fight_about_giving/)

For a while I though it didn't make sense from their perspective why I was allowed to buy a one year premium even though I'm interning and leaving after the summer. I simply assumed that I was a good persuader allowing them to buy something for me. Now it's starting to make sense why they really wanted me to learn R and even agreed to buy a $180 license. My internship objective is changing from using SPSS for generating reports to me creating an R program that generates the reports. The reason is because SPSS is cheap to buy for students like me but very expensive for non-students like my co-workers. My bosses would like to be able to have a program that does everything I have done with SPSS that they can keep. I'm actually really excited about this new assignment because I get to learn R despite never having used it before my internship.

I want them to approve of my putting my new R project on github private(free for student) so that I can show future employers my work with R since I have no other work in R to show. I also have never used github before so I can also learn how to use github which I imagine will be very important. However my company is very closeted with new technology and may not have heard of github. The software developers here have been working for over a decade in C# and have forgotten all other languages and technologies not related to the company. I feel that in order to persuade them to allow me to upload my project on github, I will need to think of a lot of good reasons. It's far easier to come up with good reasons the first time and convince them the first time than try to convince them after they say no. I'm not too aware of all the benefits github provides but if you guys could help me come up with some persuasive benefits, I'd appreciate it. I also don't think it's going to be an impossible task because I was able to get them to spend $180 for Datacamp.

1. It's a cloud for code and it allows collaborations for co-workers even if they are in different parts of the world. My company has lots of remote international workers due to them providing visa sponsorship.
2. ~~I can have my code checked by the community.(I'm actually not sure if bosses typically want code to be public)~~
3. I can have many versions and history of code stored so I can pull up backup copies
4. It can integrate with many platforms like AWS and Google cloud.

Edit: I will be writing 98-100&amp;#37; of the code."

I wouldn't realistically see me getting something at some unicorn as it stands, but I'm fine with that for the most part because I wouldn't even know what to do with some of the salaries I see thrown around here a lot.

Don't get me wrong, I would love to build up my skills going forward, but financially, since I don't have a time machine, I need to find something sooner rather than later. One thing I've seen mentioned here a bit is that non-tech companies often have boring old ""average"" programmer jobs. They aren't glamorous, and they don't pay amazingly well, but apparently they're out there somewhere and they're slightly less competitive. 

So, my questions: have any of you been in a similar situation, and if so, what was your job search like? How did you target these sorts of jobs? What was the interviewing process like? How easy/hard was it to land them? Basically, I'm asking for anything and everything on the topic.

For what it's worth, I'm graduating with a CS degree, and I've had 2 internships, but one was more of a QA/testing role, and the other was only 2 months long.

8uo15e,52,2018-06-28,What Happened at the Laundromat on State Highway AA?,midwesteries,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8uo15e/what_happened_at_the_laundromat_on_state_highway/," Hey guys! Long time reader (“lurker”? I don’t want to sound creepy, haha), first time poster. To be honest, I never really thought I’d have a reason to post on here… but I had the most crazy experience the other night, and I’m not too sure where else to turn. 

For all intents and purposes, this summer I am homeless. I realize this means different things to different people. I’m going to be a junior at the liberal arts school I go to out in Massachusetts. I came out to my mom as gay when she dropped me off for my freshman year at college… my dad had passed away earlier in the year, and since I was moving across the country, I thought I should be honest with her in an effort to make us closer. Well… I was wrong. My mom got all red in the face, told me to never come home, got in the car, and drove right on back to Houston. Happy pride month!

Anyway, I’ve been on my own ever since. I have a full-ride during the school year, so I live in the dorms. Last summer I lived with my boyfriend, but we’ve since parted ways. However, this summer, I managed to land an internship with a great law firm in Kansas City! It pays a decent stipend that covers my food and gas, but not enough for a place to live… so I shower at truckstops and the YMCA, and I sleep in campgrounds or parked in my car at the local Wal-Mart. 

So, it’s really not that bad… except that I have insomnia. It’s not uncommon for me to only get 2-3 hours of sleep a night. Usually, I drive around and try to find places that are open late. Since I’m under 21 and can’t go to bars, I end up doing a lot of driving and “urban exploring”. I’ve gotten to know my the surrounding small towns pretty well. Usually, I find a Perkins to hang out at, or I wander around a 24-hour Wal-Mart… but sometimes, I just like to turn up my music and drive around with no destination. Last night was one of those nights.

I got some burgers with the guys at work at Applebee’s, and we ended up parting ways at about midnight. I was nowhere near sleepy, so I decided to drive around. I drove all around downtown Kansas City, passed the usual sights of Blue Springs and Bates City, until I just let the music kick in and enjoyed the drive. I have a habit of letting the roads just take me away… that’s how I ended up on State Highway AA. Suddenly, the paved, sleek highway turned into an old, dingy dirt road.

It probably would’ve been a charming, rustic drive in the daylight… but at 1:30 AM definitely gave off creepy vibes. Being a 6”4’, fairly fit man, I’m not too easily intimidated… but I was getting restless driving and was eager to find a place to get out and walk around, although, it didn’t look like that opportunity would be coming any time soon. So, I sped on, hoping to at least find a gas station… and after a solid 15 minutes of literal grass, I finally found an empty building. 

It was quite an eye-sore in empty farm country. A big, white, industrial-looking building with absolutely nothing around it. There wasn’t a sign or anything, but all the lights were on and I could see washers and dryers. I rotate between three dress shirts and one pair of dress pants… so I don’t skimp on the chance to do laundry when I get it. There weren’t any cars in the parking lot, but I was already on Hick County Road… so I figured I really didn’t have anything to lose. I stripped down to my t-shirt and running shorts, and went inside. 

It looked just like any other laundromat on the inside… if the other laundromats were trying to disguise themselves, anyway. No signs up anywhere saying how much the machines cost, none of those rolling carts, not even an attendant keeping an eye on things. In fact, there weren’t any people in sight at all. I wasn’t too put off by this, though, considering most people in the Ozarks like to call it a night by 11 PM when they have work the next day. 

Shrugging to myself, I decided to just take a machine. The attendant probably didn’t need to pay too close attention at 2 AM on a Wednesday night, after all. Taking the closest machine in sight, I threw my clothes in and looked for the quarter slots. (I always keep quarters around for the tollways… I never upgraded to the E-Z Pass). But there wasn’t anywhere for the quarters to go… or even a credit card. Thinking it was a fluke, I checked around on the other machines, dryers… and, nothing.

Somewhat skeptical, I threw my clothes in… I figured maybe it was a special, state-funded laundromat for truckers passing through the night? Missouri is pretty considerate of state workers that way. With no benches around, I hopped on top of a machine, and started browsing through Facebook. Then I went through Instagram. Then responded to emails. Then read through my favorite subreddits… only to realize it was now 3:00 AM. 

I’ve had long washing cycles before… but never for more than half an hour. I hopped up to see what was up with the machine, but it was still going. Not even a timer or anything, just an endless cycle. Wanting to get a little shut-eye before work the next day, I tried to grab my clothes out to throw in the dryer… but it was like the top of the machine was dead bolted shut. This was extra odd, considering it’s the kind of machine where you lift up the top, so there isn’t a way for it to lock. 

In a brilliant, sleep-deprived decision… I thought maybe I could climb on top of the machine and pry it open. As I squatted over, the machine started shaking… figuring it couldn’t take my weight while it was running, I jumped off, only for all the other machines to start shaking, too. At first it was a slight shake, like the machines were loaded a little too high… but then, it was an unnerving rumble. All of the 80-something machines, rumbling all over the place. I thought maybe there was an earthquake or something… but everything outside looked still. 

I wanted to wait it out, because literally all my clothes were in this machine… but then the screams started. They started as shrill, ear drum-bursting shrieks, but upon further listening, I realized they were actually cries. Babies and toddlers it sounded like, all screaming at the top of their lungs, like they’d been dropped on top of their heads or something. More terrifying, the screams were coming from the insides of the machines. 

I pressed my ear against my machine, and it sounded like there was a child inside, spinning around with my clothes… same as all the other machines. It was the most terrifying sound I’d ever experienced, and the more the screams wore on, the more it sounded like they were calling out for help. Not just “help me!”, but little girls and boys, all shrieking “help mommy!” or “I want my daddy!”. There was no way I was hallucinating this. I tried climbing the machine again, but the rumbling was too intense that it threw me off… it was like trying to climb a moving mechanical bull. Literally. The machine threw me across the room. That’s when I blacked out. 

Next thing I knew, I woke up this morning on the washing machine floor, surrounded by white the white of the machines all around me. The rumbling and screams had stopped. The sun was up, and my clothes were nowhere in sight… but that was the least of my concerns. Not wanting to fuck around with that place any more, I bolted the hell out of there.

After hitting a thrift store for a second-hand suit, I went to work and tried to continue as normal. Everything was routine until I came back from my lunch break to find a file on my desk… a new case that I was assigned to audit. A case about a man who kidnapped a school bus full of day care children on a field trip, and tortured them in numerous gruesome, disturbing ways I’ll spare you all here. I will say, among his tactics, shoving children in washers and letting the cycle run. (Instantly killing them.) 

I went out with the attorneys on the case to examine the crime scene shortly after receiving the file. I dozed off on the way to the scene, exhausted from the night before. When I woke up, I found myself surrounded by grass… State Highway AA. We pulled up to an abandoned, all white building with no signs or any visible identifiers on it. Everyone in the car started murmuring about how creepy this building was out in the middle of nowhere. 

I couldn’t bear to go back inside that awful place. They said the blood was still fresh from the night before. I have no idea what happened last night… but I’ll tell you what, I won’t be going back to the laundromat on State Highway AA. And for your own good, you shouldn’t either.

Recent college grad with a BA in psych and has experience solely with criminals and addicts. 

Here’s a bit of a back story: 

I’m 22. I’m the girl who had it all, the nice car, the perfect boyfriend, nice family. Just the girl next door. Until I got a phone call from my boyfriends mom in January telling me my boyfriend is dead. He got his hands on some pills laced with fentanyl and he died on the bathroom floor. Little did I know, he was battling an uphill battle with addiction. A week beforehand, I accepted an internship in probation and parole. 80% of my case load was dealing with drug addicts.

My internship became extremely personal. I shared my story with the hard heads that said oh I’ll never OD. I began to sympathize and understand things I never thought I’d deal with or understand. Like many people,  I thought of addicts as a “junkie” until January 20th 2018. 

Tonight, I was sitting at my kitchen table and 8:50PM my phone rings and an unknown number pops up. I ignore it, thinking it’s some bs call or someone has the wrong number. I listen to the voicemail that was left and it’s from a rehab facility that I applied to a while ago. 

I immediately call him back on the cellphone number he left. He was very happy to hear from me and said you are quite impressive on paper. I want to bring you in for an interview, how does tomorrow sound? I accepted the offer for the interview.

Essay and Additional Info:  
The essay was on adjusting to the new international school and how I dealt with people who faked their friendship just for me to help them with their essays and student council campaigns.  
No criminal record  
Additional Info: I contributed a guest piece to the school newspaper on female leaders. It referenced a prior controversial statement delivered by a high school junior (at the time) on the publication, regarding how a ""lack of testosterone"" made women unfit to serve as student leaders. My piece used evidence to refute those claims. Though highly controversial, it was met with widespread public support by community members, including (but not limited to) faculty and parents, especially by females and sympathetic members of other genders. (I'm planning on including the permalink on my college applications.)  


Award Descriptions:  
Exemplary Student Award - This award, awarded by 9th-grade faculty members at the end of freshman year, recognizes students in the freshman class who are intrinsically passionate about learning. Students who receive this award are those who exemplify school-wide goals and dispositions, which include: effective communicators; knowledgeable and skilled learners; self-directed, balanced individuals; inquiring and reflective problem solvers; responsible, caring, and ethical contributors; and creative thinkers. Of the more than 212 freshmen, only five students received this award.  


Social Studies Department Award - Awarded to the student that has demonstrated a high performance in and passion for Social Studies and their Social Studies course (AP Human Geography for this particular award.) This is a departmental award with only two recipients (one for AP Human Geography, one for standard-level Geography 9) in the 9th-grade year.  


Hooks:  
My father's Northwestern status as an active alum  
Hispanic heritage on father's side  
Participated in activities like the geography competition (which was an opportunity I found myself - the school is not a member) and creation of clubs like the social studies club, which was previously not offered.

Each internship term I've worked in a different engineering plant with this company and have had the opportunity to meet a lot of different people. I have just two semesters left and will be graduating in May 2019. I will continue my internship now until mid August and will return for a few weeks over winter break.

I'm sure they know that an intern who's been with them as long as I have is interested in pursuing a full time job post graduation. The problem is I'm one of 150 engineering interns with this company and although not all will be graduating at the same time as me, I don't won't to be buried and over looked. 

How do I go about communicating with this company that I want in full time? Do I just apply like everyone else? Or do I try to talk to my current or past supervisors (all of which honestly don't know much about me. They're often way to busy to take notice to the interns and it's the regular engineers who are more familiar with the work I've done). Or do I try to go straight through to someone with HR?

First year was a struggle, but its because it took me until college to realize that I didn't actually know how to study and the last math class I took before college in was junior year (0/10 would not recommend). 

I started doing better towards the end of freshman year but I second guessed myself going into 2nd year and didn't do the extra practice I needed and didn't do as well as I wanted to. Overall, I have about a 3.0 GPA overall and about a 2.78 GPA average in STEM classes. I look back and realize I could have done better and think I have the study skills to do so now.

I realize I have to study to master the material and work problems until I can't get problems wrong, not just do the required homework.

But I am conflicted, because I really need to study harder (and do extra projects outside of class) this 3rd year so I can try to get an internship next summer. But I'm trying to figure out how to maintain relationships with my friends.

In high school, I used to be pretty busy taking AP classes and trying to (learn how to) play basketball while playing for my school, so I always came up with an excuse that I was to busy to hang out (which I realize I wasn't). I justified this to myself by getting good grades (with poor study habits), but now that I am not getting such good grades in college (havent failed a class luckily) , I can't rely on that excuse anymore.

I do have friends both in high school and college and people find me pretty chill to hang out with, but my issue is that I schedule my day pretty tightly so I don't get so distracted and stay focused on school. But I just don't know how to schedule in hanging out/texting with friends (I don't waste too much time on Facebook).

I am trying to form more study groups to study with others (after I have tried to work the hw myself), and starting to text a few people whose's #'s I have. Is there anything else I should do to socialize while compensating for the extra effort I need to put into school?

Tl;dr : Need to work harder in school, but need to socialize more to maintain friendships? Advice?"

Some companies (the big names ones) asked the sort of questions you’d expect to see in competitive programming.

I can do web Dev, have built applications in the past, but do not have much experience with algorithm based questions. So, after doing poorly on some interviews, I started wondering, is there really a need to test all candidates on those sort of questions?

I understand it gives employers a sense of our critical thinking abilities. Most of the questions they ask, people have already made implementations for, and the fact they we have to come up with our answer, which matches their answer in that short of amount doesn’t sound like a good way to test someone’s skill.

I’m just wondering what your opinion is on the interview process."

I live in Italy. When I graduate with a master's in Software Engineering, where should I go? I do not want to stay here at all, the salary is AWFUL and it won't get better soon. I was really, really hoping to go to Canada or the USA. I heard USA is extremely hard to immigrate to and Canada is a lot easier but still really hard, it would be my first ever job as a newly grad and I feel like it might be a long shot. In Europe, salaries are a lot lower, but the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Sweden have peaked my interest.

I also heard Australia is great.

The problem remains: I would have 0 work experience, maybe some internship experience (does it help to have those?) and no clue what to do, with the only positives being a) I am determined, b) I will have my degree and c) I am an EU citizen. Thanks for any advice!

The results from SPSS were so clean and usable, that my boss was hoping to replicate the results for different datasets of the same type in the future for when I'm gone. However my boss realizes that buying SPSS all the time is quite costly and asked me to create a program in R that can do all the things I did in SPSS which was mainly testing for normality.

In coding challenges it's hard for me to understand what is being asked of me and is worded very confusingly (to me). I also am not even a fan of these coding challenges because they really can't determine someones skills and their ability to write code, but rather are challenging your ability to understand complex coding language and rattle your brain under pressure. Nobody works in the real world like this; and EVERY developer googles things they don't have memorized, so why?

Anyways, since it's most realities with all companies to put someone through the gauntlet, is there places that can help you practice? Hackerrank is ""OK"" but their questions can be confusing as well. Idk maybe I need to read a programming book or something.

I know it's difficult to say which specific programs I would get into and it depends on research experience and whether it'd be a good fit and all that, but I'm just looking to find out if the places I'm considering applying to are out of my reach. 

Also, if these things are out of my reach, are there steps I could take to become more suitable for them? Things like Masters programs or research assistantships? E-mailing professors or grad students in the program to see what it's like and how I can relate my own experience to their research?

Thank you for your time."

( I wasn't done trying to figure out something and he was getting frustrated why I wouldn't ask for help, because i'm still not done and I said ""if you don't like the way im doing it you can do it)

he yelled fine i'll do everything like always (the only thing he does he communicate with our supervisor, because I have major social anxiety and if I can help it I try not to talk to people period)

TODAY he gets upset over something silly and yells

""YOU ALWAYS WANT THINGS YOUR WAY, YOU'RE LIKE A TWO YEAR OLD. I ALWAYS DO ALL THE WORK (which isn't true I do all the grunt work. especially when he was gone for 3 days out of out of our 4 week program)   YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING  YOU DONT DO ANY WORK! LOOK AT YOU YOURE A GROWN WOMAN CRYING IN THE OFFICE (At this point I was jaw dropped that hes yelling at me wasn't crying yet) GOD LOOK AT YOU"" 

I started crying when he left and turned to another intern and asked if he heard what he said and he said leave him out of it and It took me a solid 40 minutes and a whole bar of Xanax to calm down.

previously tho when he came back from his 3 days off he yrlls at me for not recording an interview (something he was supposed to do) and storms out and I kinda cried then. just like tears welled up.

I think hes stressed out and is taking it out on me

I also have the problem where I bottle up my feelings as I do not want people to know that I am sad inside. It is not I want to hide my true self, it is just that, people know me as a cheerful person (even to my family). This made me think that because of this, they won't take me seriously when I said I needed to talk.

I posted a while back about a predicament I was in. I had entered a class through a nonprofit that had partnered with companies like ServiceMaster and FedEx in order to train individuals for new IT careers. I passed the coding course(mostly C, Python) taught there in December 2017 and ended up waiting 4 months before miraculously getting a phone interview followed by an offer letter.

I now work for FedEx Services as a Developer I in their ""Pathfinders"" program. This is a category of ITD (IT Talent Development). This includes Interns (current IT students), IT Foundations (recent IT/CS/ET/etc graduates usually former interns), IT Scholars (current grad school students who are required to work for FedEx for 2 years post this program), and Pathfinders (non-traditionally educated new hires). 

Only IT Foundations and Pathfinders are considered full hire employees. The goal of Pathfinders is to find the best fit for the individual. It is completely acceptable to enter this program as a repair technician, and transition into a software developer role or vice versa or really anything in IT or IT management.

Some extra info: 

* Recently received IT Fundamentals and A+ certifications
* Studying quickly for Network+ and then Security+/Project+/Linux+ for personal improvement/opportunities
* Intending on starting an MSIS program in 2019
* Pathfinders involves 3+ month rotations for 2 years

This first month with FedEx has been spent getting adjusted to everything, scheduling orientation classes, studying off and on for IT certifications, and learning Java on my own. In general, FedEx utilizes Java. That is not the sole language used but definitely a need-to-know for myself and anyone else interested in working here. 

I'm currently using [Lynda.com](https://Lynda.com) (Free via my library) and Pluralsight for Java learning. 

I need some recommendations for further study/practice in Java (books, etc). I don't feel ready for my first rotation (which starts July 16th. Next week I will be ""desk-riding"" with developers in my department, and receiving some requirements from my first rotation to get an idea of what I'll need to research/do. 

Thanks for any recommendations!"

The nice thing about it is that we get to go deeper into the project and the rate of return offer is higher. However, compared to other universities like the University of Waterloo, I feel that we might be at a disadvantage. Students from Waterloo have to complete 5-6 internships by the time they graduate, so they will have worked at 5-6 different companies. Many other Canadian universities also require students to complete multiple 4-8 month internships.

I understand that there are many factors to take into account, such as company brand name, position, technologies used, etc. But I'm concerned about whether a 12-16 month internship experience on my resume will make me a competitive applicant when I apply to full time jobs. The 12-16 months positions are usually at companies like Intel / AMD / IBM / Qualcomm / Oracle. The big 4's and tech unicorns don't do 12-16 months."

(English is not my native language so please bear with me)

I graduated with a degree in accounting and working in an account related jobs now. But I found out that I liked IT stuff (I get into accounting because my parents said so, yeah). I get excited whenever there's computer/printer breaking down, and I am so eager to fix it. I liked computers since I was young (I broke alot of computers in the process, but totally worth it).

Thinking of getting an IT/CS part time degree but it seems that getting a full time degree in a reputable college is better because:

1. You get to network with your lecturers, and there's career service to help you get a job after graduation
2. You get to do various internships during sem break. If I opt for a part time degree, I still keep my full time job. But that means I have to forego the experience working with companies, which might help me in my resume.

If I go for full time degree, I have to get help financing from the government in my country, which I can pay later on. But if I continue to work as an auditor/accountant, I will have money saved, but I do not have the IT professional experience required to get a job after graduation. I am not sure if the risk is worth it.

I am in a serious dilemma too because I am already 25 this year. I might end up getting my IT job only after 28/29. Most of the IT jobs posting in my country require one or two years minimum experience. Has anyone done the same? All your opinions will be appreciated. Or has anyone successfully changed career into IT without a college degree? How do you do that? "

Anyways, the company is moving to the cloud very soon, and I was told that much of the industry is going here/is already there as well. Would it be worth my time and smart for me to attempt to get cloud certified sometime in the next two years before I graduate?

I feel like this along with my experience could give me a big advantage over other applicants.

Given my background I'm not expecting a research position right now, but just a software role that works with it to some meaningful extent. Some context:

* Currently interning at one of the ""top N tech companies"" (not sure which keywords the bot will filter out), but not in an ML-related position. Also have a previous internship at a lesser known company in a role that kind of involved algorithmic work.
* If I applied today I'd have basically no meaningful experience in ML to put on my resume, but I'm very willing to change that.
* Wish to start applying for new grad positions pretty early (e.g. August or September at the latest).
* Have some relevant classes registered for the Fall.
* GPA has kind of tanked so I'm going to have to wait to apply to grad school (and I'd have waited either way).
* Have a few connections that might be helpful, but not to an overwhelming extent.
* While I am really interested, I'm probably not willing to take a significant cut in pay, company quality or other areas just to get into the field right away. If I can't find a comparable offer, I'll probably go into a standard role and try to pivot later. As a result, I do not want my preparation for this to compromise my general job searching strategy.

Being realistic, do you think that there's a plausible path to my goal given the timeframe I've described? If so, what is it, and if not, what is the longer path? Appreciate the help!"

I've come close about twice before, and always seem to regret it afterwards. I always find myself thankful I didn't let anyone on to how I really feel.

I don't know when the suicidal thoughts started exactly. Definitely High school, but beyond that I can't pin it down. I always felt like I wasn't good enough back then. I got along well enough, but it seemed like there was always some higher goal than what I achieved and I always seemed to fall short. Parents were pretty supportive I suppose, but they were the ones I always hated to disappoint, especially my father. I love him, but when he's let down, he let's you know it. This is to the point that everyone has to walk on eggshells around him. He's the type who can let his anger get the best of him. He's not abusive or anything, but again...eggshells. Anyway, I wasn't exactly the perfect student sometimes, and that disappointment I felt was probably what started it. 

It got worse when I went to college. 1st year came ant went without too much trouble. Never made any friends, so I stuck to my room a lot (this would prove to be trend during my time there). I got into some 3-semester internship type deal starting that summer. Wish I could say it was on my own, but that isn't true. I had an in. Unfortunately, I botched that right up by the end of the summer and I wasn't asked back. I still remember how long it took me to actually tell my parents that. The following year was a dud as well. I'm talking serious failures here, GPA killing stuff. By the end, I was in a daunting hole. Tried to recover over the next year, but it wasn't in my favor. Too many classes taken for new ones to matter that much. Ended up using up not qualifying for scholarship money anymore, so I had to stop. I couldn't go back home, not like this. I ended up taking care of my grandmother who lives a couple hours from campus while I bide my time and prepare until the day I can go back.

I feel like i'm just a burden on my family, an emotional and financial leech. I'm trying to do better and fix things, but a lot of the time I think it would be better in the end if I wasn't around. I think about it a lot now, just sitting and holding the handgun I wonder if I will use. Sometimes I put it to my head, sometimes I don't.  I always end up just calling myself a pussy and putting it away though. I gain some comfort thinking I might eventually have a the balls to do it.

8v5uaq,72,2018-06-30,Advice for New Transfer Students from a Graduating Anteater Transfer,LetThereBeZot,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/8v5uaq/advice_for_new_transfer_students_from_a/,"Hello fellow Anteater Transfer,

Here is an outline of what helped me to do very well at UCI and accomplish all my goals.

**1) Make friends by making study groups and work together on google doc study guides, agree on deadlines.**

For one I would encourage you to collaborate with other transfer students and establish a sort of group of study friends in your major. I knew one person from community college already when I started at UCI, but I just asked a few people sitting around me in my first few classes if they might want to work on a study guide together and some of those people later became friends and a solid group. There are probably Facebook groups for transfer students from your cohort and other UCI groups there. What I did was find some like minded hardworking students who I sat near in my first few classes and said hey, why don't we work together on a study guide for the midterm on a shared google document? This turned into friendships over time that were great. Set clear due dates that everyone agrees to, if members can't meet those deadlines then do not include them in future study groups. Many people struggle to make friend at UCI for one reason or another, this is the easiest way to make friends in my experience. By the end of my 2 years at UCI my study group became my group of friends and we all plan to stay in touch. At first the relationships are more formal but they loosen up after a few quarters, we would strategize what classes to take together, and spend more informal time just talking and socializing. It all felt quite natural, just be yourself and do your part of the group contract, people will respect that and you and you will be fine. So first thing I would recommend is do not try to do everything alone, teamwork works.

**2) Establish a balanced schedule in terms of ""rigor"" with classes and professors you researched beforehand, and a description of what classes are like.**

Secondly, the transition from 16 week semesters to 11 week quarters is different for everyone. I did not find the transition as hard as I thought I would. I think if you know how to organize your time, use a schedule, and have enough discipline to do well in community college in the semester system you will do just as well at UCI. It takes a quarter to get used to the quarter system, for us they suggested starting out with 3 classes rather than 4, and I think that was a good move. Also, start out with maybe a few easier classes so you can get used to the flow, then try and set up balanced quarters in future quarters where you have some easy classes and maybe one tough one. I use eater evals on EEE to see what previous students thought of a class or professor, also when you look up a professor on ""eater evals"" it shows you all the classes they have ever taught and what quarter/year they taught them and this helps if you want to see a syllabus for that particular professor for a particular class they taught in the past that you want to take in the coming quarter. Yes long sentence, whatever, this isn't being graded. I look up old syllabuses if I can on EEE on the ""course websites"" section that lets you look back in time, so I can see how the class is structured and what to expect. I also look on the ""Rate my Professors"" website to see what people say overall about a professor. Use this information how you like, personally I always aimed for quality over being easy, but I did avoid professors who had a reputation for being unnecessarily difficult or who were bad communicators etc. Balance your quarters, do not go into them blind, do not just take classes that seem like a good time of day, the priority is that you take good classes with good quality professors.

There is only so much they can make you do in 10 weeks of instruction and 1 week of finals. Typically you will be assigned a chapter, sometimes two chapters (less common) to read per week, or a similar amount of research articles so expect to read around say 60-120 pages per week, at least that's how it was for me per class sometimes less.

Upper division tends to have more emphasis on the more enjoyable subjects of your major, at least mine did and classes tend to be a little smaller although large. Unlike community college where my classes typically had about 50 students, upper division classes at UCI are held in lecture halls that are similar to large movie theaters and they pack about 300+ people in there, sometimes less. My average upper division class had around 150 students. Lower division classes I took as electives were usually around 300+ and just awfully crowded. I employed the same tactics I did in community college and sat near the front, but not in the very front row generally. If you are sick, don't get others sick, if you cough or sneeze do it into your arm or otherwise cover it up. Be prepared for an environment that is like the movies except less fun and more crowded.

Exams vary, but often classes were set up where we had 1 midterm on week 5 or 6 and one final on week 10 or 11. There were often a few papers you would write as well to make up other points or maybe a small presentation. So a typical loadout might be that you have a midterm and final worth 75 points each, a paper worth 25 points, a presentation worth 20 points, and 5 points attendance. You spread that over a quarter and that might mean you have that first paper due on week 3, the midterm on week 5, the presentation on week 8 and the final on week 11. Honestly so long as you schedule everything I think you will have plenty of time to do this, once you get the flow of it, and you will probably get the flow within a quarter. Often exams in large classes are scantron (the red one) and multiple choice because grading 300 students short answers is hell on TAs.

**3) Have a plan so you know what classes to take to graduate on time, work with academic counselors.**

Make sure you aren't winging it with taking classes that sound nice or fun or whatever, you have a job to do anteater and that job is get the hell out of UCI with a degree, ideally on time. To do this, research exactly what is required for your major(s) and any minors you plan to take. Work on one degree at a time, that way you can bail on one you decide you no longer care about. For a while I was a double major within the same school, so I was in the school of social ecology and majoring in both criminology law and society and psychology and social behavior. I stuck with completing my PSB degree first, and near the end decided I no longer wanted to double major, and I was glad I did not waste any time trying to do both at once. Get your major requirements done first, then electives. In my case I used my electives to start working on that second major but bailed on it in the end, and I'm glad I did bail on it in the end. One advantage of a double major is that you can enroll in classes for that major at an earlier date and there is no penalty for bailing out of the double major at any time so long as it's before you graduate or petition to graduate. You can petition to double major on student access or an academic counselor can set that up for you, or undo that for you. Your catalogue year will be based on the year you started at community college and had continuous enrollment usually, so for me my catalogue year was 2014 for UCI even though I started in 2016. After carefully reviewing the university, school, and major requirements for my degree I mapped out those classes in a document at looked at how many quarters it would take, how many classes per quarter I would need, and how I might want to organize those classes to have balance. One thing this changed for me was after looking at my schedule for the next 2 years to come I realized I really didn't want to do an internship during the academic year, so I planned ahead of time to take that class in the summer, which I did.

Academic counseling is VERY important to your success at UCI. Your GPA starts at 0.00 when you transfer over from a community college, you have a clean slate, so take advantage of that. Academic counselors have the power to make special arrangements with your schedule in some cases or your classes. You can take a class as Pass/No Pass up to a specified week in the academic quarter, and by paying an $2 dollar fee that deadline may be extended, an academic counselor can help with this. Often students take some classes that are electives as P/NP if they want to preserve their GPA, because these do not change your GPA. Anyways, Academic counselors can help you plan out a strategy to achieve your goal, or review your current strategy and let you know if you are being realistic. I visited with an academic counselor, not a student peer advisor but a formal counselor usually once a quarter to make sure everything was in order. If an emergency happens, don't just think you need to drop out or anything like that, go to the counselors and work with them. Also always communicate with your TAs about stuff like that, and be sure to always be polite in your email etiquette and thank people for their help. Maybe if you read this now you will remember it ... You must PETITION ON STUDENT ACCESS TO GRADUATE and you must do this often a quarter earlier or even several quarters prior to you actually being done. Each school has its own deadline that you must send your petition, so look this information up and mark it in your calendar with a skull and cross bones next to it, do not forget this mission critical deadline lol. This is not automatic, do not F#@% yourself.

**4) Accept that you probably can't read everything, it's ok you can still thrive.**

Most people don't have time to read everything, most everyone I talked to reluctantly admitted they read about 20-50% of what was assigned, myself included. Generally you need to know key points for the exams, you don't need to know every tid bit of info in the book or readings. Very often professors will provide study guides or you can pretty easily determine what you should focus on. By working with a team of say 6 students, each student can be assigned a chapter or two to summarize into a study guide, by an agreed date. I'm not saying it's always necessary or best to do this, but it can help a ton in how you spread out your workload over a quarter. Odds are you will end up learning everything important that you really need to know and that you need to know to do well in the course by focusing on what your study group produces and following the study guide. Some classes you will want to be more careful about and spend more time focused on, and others aren't going to be as important, you don't need to work equally hard on each class to do well. You need to learn where to focus your energy to get the grade you want and to learn what you want to learn.

Where this tactic does not work at all are classes that are based on mathematics, those as you probably know, you have to do yourself and there are no shortcuts to success. Thankfully because I was IGETC certified when I transferred to UCI, my math days were over and all I had to do was take my major requirements and electives.

**5) Learn to use time management tools regularly so you don't miss deadlines and can track progress.**

So based on all that info above the most important thing of all if you don't do this already is learning to schedule time to get work done. For me I use 3 things to help me achieve this, I've used all 3 since I started community college and they have been central to my success.

One is that I have a simple notepad text document that shows all the homework assignments and their due dates with a section for me to mark my score out of say /100. When I get my syllabuses I go through and type out a list on this document that shows a list of the due date, the class, the assignment title, and the points/100. I also include in this document a section where I mark down how many absents are allowed and how many I use. If there is extra credit I record it here for each class as well. Lastly I have a section I call ""What I need for an A"" where I determine how many points I have to spare in each class so that in the end I still end up with first an A, then an A-, a B+, a B and so on.

The second document I use is a blank month calendar I created on MS paint that has spaces for 31 days. I open this up in MS paint and adjust the dates on the M - Su schedule to reflect that month. I list bigger objectives on this, major due dates and things like that and I keep a copy of this stuff in a real folder in my backpack called ""schedules."" If I need to add anything I can just write on it with a pen, it's a good way to stay on top of things.

The third thing I have is a weekly schedule, I set this up after the month one. This schedule is also a week M - Su schedule on MS Paint, but for each day there are 24 hours. I plan out my weeks with this, schedule time for reading, studying, my classes, and any special events or work. This helps me to know how much time I have to devote to other things that are also important like relaxing, unwinding, and doing non school things I care about. Taking time to relax is critical, almost as critical as getting a good nights sleep. One thing I learned as a psychology major is how important a good night sleep is, and also how helpful it can be to study a bit near when you go to bed before a test, always always try for at least 7 hours of scheduled sleep time.

**6) Find study spaces on campus that work for you and rent study rooms (free)**

The other thing that helps is renting study space in the various libraries on campus to work on a group project or study together, if that's your thing. Personally I can't focus when I'm trying to study with a group, anyways you can do that here https://www.lib.uci.edu/study-space-locator and you will see that under various building descriptions it says ""reserve a study room"" that can be helpful and you can book up to 2 hours a day. I usually put that I'm using the room with 1 other person, but actually use it myself, sorry world :) If you are curious to see what your class will look like and learn about the technology available follow this link and look up your classroom and see some specs http://www.classrooms.uci.edu/GAC/. If you use the library, please shut up and do not treat it like a hangout space, it's a quiet space for studying. It's also not a place to have a picnic, get your stank food out of there. Which reminds me, STFU in lecture that's not a hangout and it's also not a picnic site. There are a few decent computer labs that are open on campus, you will need to explore to find them, they are listed on the website.

**7) A Note on Graduate School, research it thoroughly and get ahead of the game NOW**

If you are thinking about attending grad school I could honestly do a whole post, equally detailed about that but I'll try to give a brief bit of advice here for those it might help. Here is a great little forum for grad school called Grad Cafe https://forum.thegradcafe.com/forum/65-social-work/. You need to find out if your BA degree or BS degree in your major is sufficient to make a living, it might not be, you may need a graduate degree. I applied to a masters professional degree program, mine preferred field experience over research experience. This changed what I did with my extra time at UCI, instead of being involved in research I got a part time job and did a few internships in a field that was related to my masters degree. Had I applied to a PhD program or some other kind of masters, it's likely they would have cared more about my research experience and in that case I would have needed to do everything in my power to network with research grad students and professors to get in on their research. It's not as scary as it sounds, it's not as hard as you think it is, you can do it. PhD programs also care a little more sometimes about maybe joining academic honors research groups and societies. You will want to determine if your graduate program wants you to have certain kinds of experience to be competitive and schedule that into your life right away. Grad school applications for the UC and CSU system as well as many private universities start almost 1 year prior to when you would begin classes in that grad program. My grad program and many others tend to focus on your grades from your Junior year especially, and depending on the program your Senior year or even lower division (freshman sophomore) grades. Grad schools have websites, so read the hell out of those, learn about their programs, talk to current students in them, and find out how to be a competitive applicant. You should start working on your application, or gathering information and attending ""information sessions"" the summer prior to application season if it's a year in advance like mine was. So for all the CSUs and UCs I applied to, the first summer after my first year at UCI (summer 17) I prepped for those applications, wrote out personal statements, revised them over several months, got professional and academic people to agree to write letters of reference etc and went to information sessions to meet faculty and get my name out there. It also helps to join facebook groups for those grad programs when possible to meet students, or the pages of faculty or twitter of faculty to get your name out there by liking posts that you agree with. Then when applications opened in September, I was ready to go, I could turn all my stuff in and have the advantage of turning my stuff in earlier than the deadline, plus that let me switch my attention back to UCI to start my senior year and get to work on that. So for me I needed about 6 months to prep for grad school applications, and honestly I started thinking about it and researching it 1 year prior to application season. Do not go into application season thinking it's no biggie, you need to be ahead of the game. So my advice is that if you are planning on grad school, your first year at UCI is very important, don't screw around, and research the hell out of those grad programs so you can be as competitive as possible and minimize surprises. Cover all your bases, do not wait till the last minute, get this stuff done ahead of time if at all possible.

**Closing and about me**

By doing all this stuff, and not abusing alcohol/drugs this time, I went from being a high school drop out with a GED and some community college experience in the past with a bunch of Ws Fs Ds and Cs to show for it, to graduating with 2 associate degrees from community college with straight As, I just earned my BA from UCI and graduated *summa cum laude*, and I'm heading to grad school at the highest ranked grad program for my major in Southern California, my top choice school. I had an IQ test, I have an average IQ. My success was directly related to doing the above things, and I'm confident that if you insist upon finding the discipline to do all the above you will dominate as well. Best wishes fellow anteater!

**TL DR**

1) Make friends by making study groups and work together on google doc study guides, agree on deadlines.

2) Establish a balanced schedule in terms of ""rigor"" with classes and professors you researched beforehand, and a description of what classes are like.

3) Have a plan so you know what classes to take to graduate on time, work with academic counselors.

4) Accept that you probably can't read everything, it's ok you can still thrive.

5) Learn to use time management tools regularly so you don't miss deadlines and can track progress.

6) Find study spaces on campus that work for you and rent study rooms (free)
